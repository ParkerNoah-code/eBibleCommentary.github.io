        <h2>IV. The Real Problem of Inspiration:</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          A great deal is being said of late of "the present problem of
          inspiration," with a general implication that the Christian doctrine
          of the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures has been brought into
          straits by modern investigation, and needs now to adapt itself to
          certain assured but damaging results of the scientific study of the
          Bible. Thus, because of an assumed "present distress," Canon Cheyne,
          in a paper read at the English Church Congress of 1888, commended a
          most revolutionary book of Mr. R. F. Horton's, called "Inspiration and
          the Bible,"2 which explains away inspiration properly so called
          altogether, as the best book he could think of on the subject. And Mr.
          Charles Gore defends the concessive method of treating the subject of
          inspiration adopted in "Lux Mundi," by the plea that the purpose of
          the writers of that volume "was 'to succour a distressed faith,' by
          endeavoring to bring the Christian creed into its right relation to
          the modern growth of knowledge, scientific, historical, critical."3 On
          our side of the water, Dr. Washington Gladden has published a volume
          which begins by presenting certain "new" views of the structure of the
          books of the Bible as established facts, and proceeds to the
          conclusion that: "Evidently neither the theory of verbal inspiration
          nor the theory of plenary inspiration can be made to fit the facts
          which a careful study of the writings themselves brings before us.
          These writings are not inspired in the sense which we have commonly
          given to that word." Accordingly he recommends that under the pressure
          of these new views we admit not only that the Bible is not
          "infallible," but that its laws are "inadequate" and "morally
          defective," and its untrustworthiness as a religious teacher is so
          great that it gives us in places "blurred and distorted ideas about
          God and His truth.‚Äù4 And Prof. Joseph H. Thayer has published a
          lecture which represents as necessitated by the facts as now known,
          such a change of attitude towards the Bible as will reject the whole
          Reformed doctrine of the Scriptures in favor of a more "Catholic" view
          which will look upon some of the history recorded in the Bible as only
          "fairly trustworthy," and will expect no intelligent reader to
          consider the exegesis of the New Testament writers satisfactory.5 A
          radical change in our conception of the Scriptures as the inspired
          Word of God is thus pressed upon us as now necessary by a considerable
          number of writers, representing quite a variety of schools of
          Christian thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless the situation is not one which can be fairly described as
          putting the old doctrine of inspiration in jeopardy. The exact state
          of the case is rather this: that a special school of Old Testament
          criticism, which has, for some years, been gaining somewhat widespread
          acceptance of its results, has begun to proclaim that these results
          having been accepted, a "changed view of the Bible" follows which
          implies a reconstructed doctrine of inspiration, and, indeed, also a
          whole new theology. That this changed view of the Bible involves
          losses is frankly admitted. The nature of these losses is stated by
          Dr. Sanday in a very interesting little book6 with an evident effort
          to avoid as far as possible "making sad the heart of the righteous
          whom the Lord hath not made sad," as consisting chiefly in making "the
          intellectual side of the connection between Christian belief and
          Christian practice a matter of greater difficulty than it has hitherto
          seemed to be," in rendering it "less easy to find proof texts for this
          or that," and in making the use of the Bible so much less simple and
          less definite in its details that "less educated Christians will
          perhaps pay more deference to the opinion of the more educated, and to
          the advancing consciousness of the Church at large." If this means all
          that it seems to mean, its proclamation of an indefinite Gospel eked
          out by an appeal to the Church and a scholastic hierarchy, involves a
          much greater loss than Dr. Sanday appears to think - a loss not merely
          of the Protestant doctrine of the perspicuity of the Scriptures, but
          with it of all that that doctrine is meant to express and safeguard -
          the loss of the Bible itself to the plain Christian man for all
          practical uses, and the delivery of his conscience over to the tender
          mercies of his human instructors, whether ecclesiastical or
          scholastic. Dr. Briggs is more blunt and more explicit in his
          description of the changes which he thinks have been wrought. " I will
          tell you what criticism has destroyed," he says in an article
          published a couple of years ago. "It has destroyed many false theories
          about the Bible; it has destroyed the doctrine of verbal inspiration;
          it has destroyed the theory of inerrancy; it has destroyed the false
          doctrine that makes the inspiration depend upon its attachment to a
          holy man."7 And he goes on to remark further "that Biblical criticism
          is at the bottom" of the "reconstruction that is going on throughout
          the Church" - "the demand for revision of creeds and change in methods
          of worship and Christian work." It is clear enough, then, that a
          problem has been raised with reference to inspiration by this type of
          criticism. But this is not equivalent to saying that the established
          doctrine of inspiration has been put in jeopardy. For there is
          criticism and criticism. And though it may not be unnatural for these
          scholars themselves to confound the claims of criticism with the
          validity of their own critical methods and the soundness of their own
          critical conclusions, the Christian world can scarcely be expected to
          acquiesce in the identification. It has all along been pointing out
          that they were traveling on the wrong road; and now when their
          conclusions clash with well-established facts, we simply note that the
          wrong road has not unnaturally led them to the wrong goal. In a word,
          it is not the established doctrine of inspiration that is brought into
          distress by the conflict, but the school of Old Testament criticism
          which is at present fashionable. It is now admitted that the
          inevitable issue of this type of criticism comes into collision with
          the established fact of the plenary inspiration of the Bible and the
          well-grounded Reformed doctrine of Holy Scripture based on this fact.8
          The cry is therefore, and somewhat impatiently, raised that this fact
          and this doctrine must "get out of the way," and permit criticism to
          rush on to its bitter goal. But facts are somewhat stubborn things,
          and are sometimes found to prove rather the test of theories which
          seek to make them their sport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, though the strain of the present problem should thus be
          thrown upon the shoulders to which it belongs, it is important to keep
          ourselves reminded that the doctrine of inspiration which has become
          established in the Church, is open to all legitimate criticism, and is
          to continue to be held only as, and so far as, it is ever anew
          critically tested and approved. And in view of the large bodies of
          real knowledge concerning the Bible which the labors of a generation
          of diligent critical study have accumulated, and of the difficulty
          which is always experienced in the assimilation of new knowledge and
          its correlation with previously ascertained truth, it is becoming to
          take this occasion to remind ourselves of the foundations on which
          this doctrine rests, with a view to inquiring whether it is really
          endangered by any assured results of recent Biblical study. For such
          an investigation we must start, of course, from a clear conception of
          what the Church doctrine of inspiration is, and of the basis on which
          it is held to be the truth of God. Only thus can we be in a position
          to judge how it can be affected on critical grounds, and whether
          modern Biblical criticism has reached any assured results which must
          or may "destroy" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Church, then, has held from the beginning that the Bible is the
          Word of God in such a sense that its words, though written by men and
          bearing indelibly impressed upon them the marks of their human origin,
          were written, nevertheless, under such an influence of the Holy Ghost
          as to be also the words of God, the adequate expression of His mind
          and will. It has always recognized that this conception of
          co-authorship implies that the Spirit's superintendence extends to the
          choice of the words by the human authors (verbal inspiration9), and
          preserves its product from everything inconsistent with a divine
          authorship - thus securing, among other things, that entire
          truthfulness which is everywhere presupposed in and asserted for
          Scripture by the Biblical writers (inerrancy). Whatever minor
          variations may now and again have entered into the mode of statement,
          this has always been the core of the Church doctrine of inspiration.
          And along with many other modes of commending and defending it, the
          primary ground on which it has been held by the Church as the true
          doctrine is that it is the doctrine of the Biblical writers
          themselves, and has therefore the whole mass of evidence for it which
          goes to show that the Biblical writers are trustworthy as doctrinal
          guides. It is the testimony of the Bible itself to its own origin and
          character as the Oracles of the Most High, that has led the Church to
          her acceptance of it as such, and to her dependence on it not only for
          her doctrine of Scripture, but for the whole body of her doctrinal
          teaching, which is looked upon by her as divine because drawn from
          this divinely given fountain of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if this doctrine is to be assailed on critical grounds, it is very
          clear that, first of all, criticism must be required to proceed
          against the evidence on which it is based. This evidence, it is
          obvious, is twofold. First, there is the exegetical evidence that the
          doctrine held and taught by the Church is the doctrine held and taught
          by the Biblical writers themselves. And secondly, there is the whole
          mass of evidence - internal and external, objective and subjective,
          historical and philosophical, human and divine - which goes to show
          that the Biblical writers are trustworthy as doctrinal guides. If they
          are trustworthy teachers of doctrine and if they held and taught this
          doctrine, then this doctrine is true, and is to be accepted and acted
          upon as true by us all. In that case, any objections brought against
          the doctrine from other spheres of inquiry are inoperative; it being a
          settled logical principle that so long as the proper evidence by which
          a proposition is established remains unrefuted, all so-called
          objections brought against it pass out of the category of objections
          to its truth into the category of difficulties to be adjusted to it.
          If criticism is to assail this doctrine, therefore, it must proceed
          against and fairly overcome one or the other element of its proper
          proof. It must either show that this doctrine is not the doctrine of
          the Biblical writers, or else it must show that the Biblical writers
          are not trustworthy as doctrinal guides. If a fair criticism evinces
          that this is not the doctrine of the Biblical writers, then of course
          it has "destroyed" the doctrine which is confessedly based on that
          supposition. Failing in this, however, it can "destroy" the doctrine,
          strictly speaking, only by undermining its foundation in our
          confidence in the trustworthiness of Scripture as a witness to
          doctrine. The possibility of this latter alternative must, no doubt,
          be firmly faced in our investigation of the phenomena of the Bible;
          but the weight of the evidence, be it small or great, for the general
          trustworthiness of the Bible as a source of doctrine, throws itself,
          in the form of a presumption, against the reality of any phenomena
          alleged to be discovered which make against its testimony. No doubt
          this presumption may be overcome by clear demonstration. But clear
          demonstration is requisite. For, certainly, if it is critically
          established that what is sometimes called, not without a touch of
          scorn, "the traditional doctrine," is just the Bible's own doctrine of
          inspiration, the real conflict is no longer with "the traditional
          theory of inspiration," but with the credibility of the Bible. The
          really decisive question among Christian scholars (among whom alone,
          it would seem, could a question of inspiration be profitably
          discussed), is thus seen to be, "What does an exact and scientific
          exegesis determine to be the Biblical doctrine of inspiration?"

        <h2>THE BIBLICAL DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION CLEAR</h2>
        <p>
          The reply to this question is, however, scarcely open to doubt. The
          stricter and the more scientific the examination is made, the more
          certain does it become that the authors of the New Testament held a
          doctrine of inspiration quite as high as the Church doctrine. This may
          be said, indeed, to be generally admitted by untrammeled critics,
          whether of positive or of negative tendencies. Thus, for instance - to
          confine our examples to a few of those who are not able personally to
          accept the doctrine of the New Testament writers - Archdeacon Farrar
          is able to admit that Paul " shared, doubtless, in the views of the
          later Jewish schools - the Tanaim and Amoraim - on the nature of
          inspiration. These views . . . made the words of Scripture coextensive
          and identical with the words of God."10 So also Otto Pfleiderer allows
          that Paul "fully shared the assumption of his opponents, the
          irrefragable authority of the letter as the immediately revealed Word
          of God."11 Similarly, Tholuck recognizes that the application of the
          Old Testament made by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, "rests
          on the strictest view of inspiration, since passages where God is not
          the speaker are cited as words of God or of the Holy Ghost (i. 6, 7,
          8, iv. 4, 7, vii. 21, iii. 7, x. 15)."12 This fact is worked out also
          with convincing clearness by the writer of an odd and sufficiently
          free Scotch book published a few years ago,13 who formulates his
          conclusion in the words: "There is no doubt that the author of
          Hebrews, in common with the other New Testament writers, regards the
          whole Old Testament as having been dictated by the Holy Ghost, or, as
          we should say, plenarily, and, as it were, mechanically inspired." And
          more recently still Prof. Stapfer, of Paris,14 though himself denying
          the reality not only of an infallibility for the Bible, but also of
          any inspiration for it at all, declaring that " the doctrine of an
          Inspiration distinct from Revelation and legitimating it, is an error"
          - yet cannot deny that Paul held a different doctrine - a doctrine
          which made the Old Testament to him the divine Word and the term, "It
          is written," equivalent to "God says."15
        </p>
        <p>
          A detailed statement of the evidence is scarcely needed to support a
          position allowed by such general consent. But it will not be improper
          to adjoin a brief outline of the grounds on which the general consent
          rests. In the circumstances, however, we may venture to dispense with
          an argument drawn up from our own point of view,16 and content
          ourselves with an extract from the brief statement of the grounds of
          his decision given by another of those critical scholars who do not
          believe the doctrine of plenary inspiration, but yet find themselves
          constrained to allow that it is the doctrine of the New Testament
          writers. Richard Rothe17 seeks, wrongly, to separate Christ's doctrine
          of the Old Testament from that of the apostles; our Lord obviously
          spoke of the Scriptures of His people out of the same fundamental
          conception of their nature and divinity as His apostles. But he more
          satisfactorily outlines the doctrine of the apostles as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          "We find in the New Testament authors the same theoretical view of the
          Old Testament and the same practice as to its use, as among the Jews
          of the time in general, although at the same time in the handling of
          the same conceptions and principles on both sides, the whole
          difference between the new Christian spirit and that of contemporary
          Judaism appears in sharp distinctness. Our authors look upon the words
          of the Old Testament as immediate words of God, and adduce them
          expressly as such, even those of them which are not at all related as
          direct sayings of God. They see nothing at all in the sacred volume
          which is simply the word of its human author and not at the same time
          the very Word of God Himself. In all that stands 'written' God Himself
          speaks to them, and so entirely are they habituated to think only of
          this that they receive the sacred Word written itself, as such, as
          God's Word, and hear God speaking in it immediately, without any
          thought of the human persons who appear in it as speaking and acting.
          The histarical conception of their Bible is altogether foreign to
          them. Therefore they cite the abstract h` grafh, or ai` grafai, or
          grafai. a`gi,ai (Rom. 1. 2), or again ta. i`era. gra,mmata (2 Tim.
          iii. 15), without naming any special author, as self-evidently God's
          Word, e.g., John vii. 38, x. 35, xix. 36, 37, xx. 9; Acts i. 16; James
          ii. 8; Rom. ix. 17; Gal. iii. 8, 22, iv. 30; 1 Pet. ii. 6; 2 Pet. i.
          20, etc. ; and introduce Old Testament citations with the formulas,
          now that God (Matt. i. 22, ii. 15; Acts iv. 25, xiii. 34; Rom. i. 2),
          now that the Holy Spirit (Acts i. 16, xxviii. 25; Heb. iii. 7, ix. 8,
          x. 15; cf. also Acts iv. 25; 1 Pet. i. 11; 2 Pet. i. 20) so speaks or
          has spoken. The Epistle to the Hebrews unhesitatingly adduces with a
          o` qeo.j le,gei and the like, even passages in which God is spoken of
          expressly in the third person (i. 6, 7, 8 seq., iv. 4, 7, vii. 21, x.
          30), and even (i. 10) cites a passage in which in the Old Testament
          text God Himself (according to the view of the author it is, however,
          the Son of God) is addressed, as a word spoken by God. In 2 Tim. iii.
          16 the i`era. gra,mmata (verse 15) are expressly called qeo,pneusta,
          however the sentence may be construed or expounded; and however little
          a special theory of the inspiration of the Bible can be drawn from an
          expression of such breadth of meaning, nevertheless this datum avails
          to prove that the author shared in general the view of his Jewish
          contemporaries as to the peculiar character of the Old Testament
          books, and it is of especial importance inasmuch as it attributes the
          inspiration, without the least ambiguity, directly to the writings
          themselves, and not merely to their authors, the prophets. No doubt,
          in the teaching of the apostles the conception of prophetic
          inspiration to which it causally attributes the Old Testament, has not
          yet the sharp exactness of our ecclesiastical dogmatic conception; but
          it stands, nevertheless, in a very express analogy with it. . . .
          Moreover, it must be allowed that the apostolical writers, although
          they nowhere say it expressly, refer the prophetic inspiration also to
          the actus scribendi of the Biblical authors. The whole style and
          method of their treatment of the Old Testament text manifestly
          presupposes in them this view of this matter, which was at the time
          the usual one in the Jewish schools. With Paul particularly this is
          wholly incontrovertibly the case. For only on that view could he, in
          such passages as Rom. iv. 23, 24, xv. 4; 1 Cor. ix. 10, x. 11 - in
          which he distinguishes between the occurrence of the Old Testament
          facts and the recording of them - maintain of the latter that it was
          done with express teleological reference to the needs of the New
          Testament believers, at least so far as the selection of the matter to
          be described is concerned; and only on that view could he argue on the
          details of the letter of the Old Testament Scriptures, as he does in
          Gal. iii. 15, 16. We can, moreover, trace the continuance of this view
          in the oldest postapostolical Church. . . . So far as the Old
          Testament is concerned, our ecclesiastical-dogmatic doctrine of
          inspiration can, therefore, in very fact, appeal to the authority, not
          indeed of the Redeemer Himself - for He stands in an entirely neutral
          attitude towards it - but no doubt of the apostles."
        </p>
        <p>
          A keen controversialist like Rothe does not fail, of course - as the
          reader has no doubt observed - to accompany his exposition of the
          apostolic doctrine with many turns of expression designed to lessen
          its authority in the eyes of the reader, and to prepare the way for
          his own refusal to be bound by it; but neither does he fail to make it
          clear that this doctrine, although it is unacceptable to him, is the
          apostles' doctrine. The apostles' doctrine, let it be observed that we
          say. For even so bald a statement as Rothe's will suffice to uncover
          the fallacy of the assertion, which is so often made, that the
          doctrine of verbal inspiration is based on a few isolated statements
          of Scripture to the neglect, if not to the outrage, of its phenomena -
          a form of remark into which even so sober a writer as Dr. W. G.
          Blaikie has lately permitted himself to fall.18 Nothing, obviously,
          could be more opposite to the fact. The doctrine of verbal inspiration
          is based on the broad foundation of the carefully ascertained doctrine
          of the Scripture writers on the subject. It is a product of Biblical
          Theology. And if men will really ask, not, "What do the creeds teach?
          What do the theologians say? What is the authority of the Church? but,
          What does the Bible itself teach us?" and "fencing off from the
          Scriptures all the speculations, all the dogmatic elaborations, all
          the doctrinal adaptations that have been made in the history of
          doctrine in the Church," "limit themselves strictly to the theology of
          the Bible itself " - according to the excellent programme outlined by
          Dr. Briggs19 - it is to the doctrine of verbal inspiration, as we have
          seen, that they must come. It is not Biblical criticism that has
          "destroyed" verbal inspiration, but Dr. Briggs' scholastic theories
          that have drawn him away in this matter from the pure deliverances of
          Biblical Theology.20
        </p>
        <p>
          Much more, of course, does such a statement as even Rothe's uncover
          the even deeper error of the assertion latterly becoming much too
          common, that, the doctrine of verbal inspiration, as a recent writer
          puts it,21 "is based wholly upon an a priori assumption of what
          inspiration must be, and not upon the Bible as it actually exists." It
          is based wholly upon an exegetical fact. It is based on the exegetical
          fact that our Lord and His apostles held this doctrine of Scripture,
          and everywhere deal with the Scriptures of the Old Testament in
          accordance with it, as the very Word of God, even in their narrative
          parts. This is a commonplace of exegetical science, the common
          possession of the critical schools of the left and of the right, a
          prominent and unmistakable deliverance of Biblical Theology. And on
          the establishment of it as such, the real issue is brought out plainly
          and stringently. If criticism has made such discoveries as to
          necessitate the abandonment of the doctrine of plenary inspiration, it
          is not enough to say that we are compelled to abandon only a
          "particular theory of inspiration," though that is true enough. We
          must go on to say that that "particular theory of inspiration" is the
          theory of the apostles and of the Lord, and that in abandoning it we
          are abandoning them as our doctrinal teachers and guides, as our
          "exegetes," in the deep and rich sense of that word which Dr. Vincent
          vindicates for it.22 This real issue is to be kept clearly before us,
          and faced courageously. Nothing is gained by closing our eyes to the
          seriousness of the problem which we are confronting. Stated plainly it
          is just this: Are the New Testament writers trustworthy guides in
          doctrine? Or are we at liberty to reject their authority, and frame
          contrary doctrines for ourselves? If the latter pathway be taken,
          certainly the doctrine of plenary inspiration is not the only doctrine
          that is "destroyed," and the labor of revising our creeds may as well
          be saved and the shorter process adopted of simply throwing them away:
          No wonder we are told that the same advance in knowledge which
          requires a changed view of the Bible necessitates also a whole new
          theology. If the New Testament writers are not trustworthy as teachers
          of doctrine and we have to go elsewhere for the source and norm of
          truth as to God and duty and immortality, it will not be strange if a
          very different system of doctrine from that delivered by the
          Scriptures and docilely received from them by the Church, results.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, having uncovered the precise issue which is involved in the
          real problem of inspiration, let us look at it at various angles and
          thus emphasize in turn two or three of the more important results that
          spring from it.

        <h2>
          MODIFICATIONS OF THE BIBLICAL DOCTRINE UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF THE
          SCRIPTURES
        </h2>
        <p>
          First, we emphasize the fact that, this being the real state of the
          case, we cannot modify the doctrine of plenary inspiration in any of
          its essential elements without undermining our confidence in the
          authority of the apostles as teachers of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logically, this is an immediate corollary of the proposition already
          made good. Historically, it is attested by the driftage of every
          school of thought which has sought to find a ground of faith in any
          lower than the Church's doctrine of a plenarily inspired Bible. The
          authority which cannot assure of a hard fact is soon not trusted for a
          hard doctrine. Sooner or later, in greater or less degree, the
          authority of the Bible in doctrine and life is replaced by or
          subordinated to that of reason, or of the feelings, or of the
          "Christian consciousness" - the "conscious experience by the
          individual of the Christian faith" or of that corporate Christian
          consciousness which so easily hardens into simple ecclesiastical
          domination. What we are to accept as the truth of God is a
          comparatively easy question, if we can open our Bibles with the
          confident belief that what we read there is commended to us by a fully
          credible "Thus saith the Lord." But in proportion as we allow this or
          that element in it not to be safeguarded to us by this divine
          guarantee, do we begin to doubt the trustworthiness of more and more
          of the message delivered, and to seek other grounds of confidence than
          the simple "It is written" which sufficed for the needs of our Lord
          and His apostles. We have seen Dr. Sanday pointing to "the advancing
          consciousness of the Church at large," along with the consensus of
          scholars, as the ground of acceptance of doctrines as true, which will
          be more and more turned to when men can no longer approach the Bible
          so simply as heretofore. This is the natural direction in which to
          look, for men trained to lay that great stress on institutional
          Christianity which leads Mr. Gore to describe the present situation as
          one in which "it is becoming more and more difficult to believe in the
          Bible without believing in the Church."23 Accordingly Dr. Sterrett
          also harmonizes his Hegelianism and Churchliness in finding the ground
          of Christian certitude in the "communal Christian consciousness,"
          which is defined as the Church, as "objective, authoritative reason
          for every Christian," to which he must subordinate his individual
          reason.24 Men of more individualistic training fall back rather on
          personal reason or the individual "Christian consciousness"; but all
          alike retire the Bible as a source of doctrine behind some other
          safeguard of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may not be without interest or value to subject the various
          pathways which men tread in seeking to justify a lower view of
          Scripture than that held and taught by the New Testament writers, to a
          somewhat close scrutiny, with a view to observing how necessarily they
          logically involve a gradual undermining of the trustworthiness of
          those writers as teachers of doctrine. From the purely formal point of
          view proper to our present purpose, four types of procedure may be
          recognized.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>CHRIST VERSUS THE APOSTLES</h2>
        <p>
          1. There is first, that, of which Richard Rothe is an example, which
          proceeds by attempting to establish a distinction between the teaching
          of Christ and the teaching of His apostles, and refusing the latter in
          favor of the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we have already remarked, this distinction cannot be made good.
          Rothe's attempt to establish it proceeds on the twofold ground, on the
          one hand, of an asserted absence from our Lord's dealings with the
          Scriptures of those extreme facts of usage of it as the Word of God,
          and of those extreme statements concerning its divine character, on
          the ground of which in the apostles' dealing with it we must recognize
          their high doctrine of Scripture; and on the other hand, of an
          asserted presence in Christ's remarks concerning Scripture of hints
          that He did not share the conception of Scripture belonging to
          contemporary Judaism, which conception we know to have been the same
          high doctrine that was held by the apostles. He infers, therefore,
          that the apostles, in this matter, represent only the current Jewish
          thought in which they were bred, while Christ's divine originality
          breaks away from this and commends to us a new and more liberal way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in order to make out the first member of the twofold ground on
          which he bases this conclusion, Rothe has to proceed by explaining
          away, by means of artificial exegetical expedients, a number of facts
          of usage and deliverances as to Scripture, in which our Lord's
          dealings with Scripture culminate, and which are altogether similar in
          character and force to those on the basis of which he infers the
          apostles' high doctrine. These are such passages as the quotation in
          Matt. xix. 4, 5, of Adam's words as God's Word, which Lechler appeals
          to as decisive just as Rothe appeals to similar passages in the
          epistles - but which Rothe sets aside in a footnote simply with the
          remark that it is not decisive here; the assertion in John x. 35, that
          the "Scripture cannot be broken," which he sets aside as probably not
          a statement of Christ's own opinion but an argumentum ad hominem, and
          as in any case not available here, since it does not explicitly assert
          that the authority it ascribes to Scripture is due "to its origination
          by inspiration " - but which, as Dr. Robert Watts has shown anew,25 is
          conclusive for our Saviour's view of the entire infallibility of the
          whole Old Testament; the assertion in Matt. v. 18 (and in Luke xvi.
          17) that not "one jot or one tittle (ivw/ta e]n h' mi,a kerai,a) shall
          pass away from the law till all be fulfilled," which he sets aside
          with the remark that it is not the law-codex, but the law itself, that
          is here spoken of, forgetful of the fact that it is the law itself as
          written that the Lord has in mind, in which form alone, moreover, do
          "yodhs and horns" belong to it; the assertion in Matt. xxii. 43, that
          it was "in the Spirit" that David called the Messiah, "Lord," in the
          one hundredth and tenth Psalm, which he sets aside with the remark
          that this does prove that Jesus looked upon David as a prophet, but
          not necessarily that he considered the one hundred and tenth Psalm
          inspired, as indeed he does not say gra,fei but kalei/ - forgetful
          again that it is to the written David alone that Christ makes His
          appeal and on the very language written in the Psalm that He founds
          His argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          No less, in order to make out the second member of the ground on which
          he bases his conclusion, does Rothe need to press passages which have
          as their whole intent and effect to rebuke the scribes for failure to
          understand and properly to use Scripture, into indications of
          rejection on Christ's part of the authority of the Scriptures to which
          both He and the scribes appealed. Lest it should be thought incredible
          that such a conclusion should be drawn from such premises, we
          transcribe Rothe's whole statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "On the other hand, we conclude with great probability that the
          Redeemer did not share the conception of His Israelitish
          contemporaries as to the inspiration of their Bible, as stated above,
          from the fact that He repeatedly expresses his dissatisfaction with
          the manner usual among them of looking upon and using the sacred
          books. He tells the scribes to their face that they do not understand
          the Scriptures (Matt. xxii. 29; Mark xii. 24), and that it is delusion
          for them to think to possess eternal life in them, therefore in a book
          (John v. 39), even as He also (in the same place) seems to speak
          disapprovingly of their searching of the Scriptures, because it
          proceeds from such a perverted point of view."26
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus Jesus' appeal to the Scriptures as testifying to Him, and His
          rebuke to the Jews for not following them while professing to honor
          them, are made to do duty as a proof that He did not ascribe plenary
          authority to them.27
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Rothe's whole treatment of the matter omits altogether to
          make account of the great decisive consideration of the general tone
          and manner of Christ's allusions and appeal to the Scriptures, which
          only culminate in such passages as he has attempted to explain away,
          and which not only are inconsistent with any other than the same high
          view of their authority, trustworthiness and inspiration, as that
          which Rothe infers from similar phenomena to have been the conception
          of the apostles, but also are necessarily founded on it as its natural
          expression. The distinction attempted to be drawn between Christ's
          doctrine of Holy Scripture and that of His apostles is certainly
          inconsistent with the facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we are more concerned at present to point out that the attempt to
          draw this distinction must result in undermining utterly all
          confidence in the New Testament writers as teachers of doctrine. So
          far as the apostles are concerned, indeed, it would be more correct to
          say that it is the outgrowth and manifestation of an already present
          distrust of them as teachers of doctrine. Its very principle is appeal
          from apostolic teaching to that of Christ, on the ground that the
          former is not authoritative. How far this rejection of apostolic
          authority goes is evidenced by the mode of treatment vouchsafed to it.
          Immediately on drawing out the apostles' doctrine of inspiration,
          Rothe asks, "But now what dogmatic value has this fact?
        </p>
        <p>
          And on the ground that "by their fruits ye shall know them," he
          proceeds to declare that the apostles' doctrine of Scripture led them
          into such a general use and mode of interpretation of Scripture as
          Rothe deems wholly unendurable.28 It is not, then, merely the teaching
          of the apostles as to what the Scriptures are, but their teaching as
          to what those Scriptures teach, in which Rothe finds them
          untrustworthy. It would be impossible but that the canker should eat
          still more deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is it possible to prevent it from spreading to the undermining of
          the trustworthiness of even the Lord's teaching itself, for the
          magnifying of which the distinction purports to be drawn. The
          artificial manner in which the testimony of the Lord to the authority
          of the Scriptures is explained away in the attempt to establish the
          distinction, might be pleaded indeed as an indication that trust in it
          was not very deeply rooted. And there are other indications that had
          the Lord been explained to be of the apostles' mind as to Scripture, a
          way would have been found to free us from the duty of following His
          teaching.29 For even His exegesis is declared not to be authoritative,
          seeing that "exegesis is essentially a scientific function, and
          conditioned on the existence of scientific means, which in relation to
          the Old Testament were completely at the command of Jesus as little as
          of His contemporaries"; and the principle of partial limitation at
          least to the outlook of His day which is involved in such a statement
          is fully accepted by Rothe.30 All this may, however, be thought more
          or less personal to Rothe's own mental attitude, whereas the ultimate
          undermining of our Lord's authority as teacher of doctrine, as well as
          that of His apostles, is logically essential to the position assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may be made plain at once by the very obvious remark that we have
          no Christ except the one whom the apostles have given to us. Jesus
          Himself left no treatises on doctrine. He left no written dialogues.
          We are dependent on the apostles for our whole knowledge of Him, and
          of what He taught. The portraiture of Jesus which has glorified the
          world's literature as well as blessed all ages and races with the
          revelation of a God-man come down from heaven to save the world, is
          limned by his followers' pencils alone. The record of that teaching
          which fell from His lips as living water, which if a man drink of he
          shall never thirst again, is a record by his followers' pens alone.
          They have painted for us, of course, the Jesus that they knew, and as
          they knew Him. They have recorded for us the teachings that they
          heard, and as they heard them. Whatever untrustworthiness attaches to
          them as deliverers of doctrine, must in some measure shake also our
          confidence in their report of what their Master was and taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the logic cuts even deeper. For not only have we no Christ but Him
          whom we receive at the apostles' hands, but this Christ is committed
          to the trustworthiness of the apostles as teachers. His credit is
          involved in their credit. He represents His words on earth as but the
          foundation of one great temple of doctrine, the edifice of which was
          to be built up by Him through their mouths, as they spoke moved by His
          Spirit; and thus He makes Himself an accomplice before the fact in all
          they taught. In proportion as they are discredited as doctrinal
          guides, in that proportion He is discredited with them. By the promise
          of the Spirit, He has forever bound His trustworthiness with
          indissoluble bands to the trustworthiness of His accredited agents in
          founding His Church, and especially by that great promise recorded for
          us in John xvi. 12-15: "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye
          cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come,
          he will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak of himself;
          but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show
          you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine,
          and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine:
          therefore said I, that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto
          you." Says Dr. C. W. Hodge:31
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is impossible to conceive how the authority of the Master could be
          conveyed to the teaching of the disciples more emphatically than is
          here done by Christ. He identifies His teaching and the teaching of
          the Spirit as parts of one whole; His teaching is carrying out My
          teaching, it is calling to remembrance what I have told you; it is
          completing what I have begun. And to make the unity emphatic, He
          explains why He had reserved so much of His own teaching, and
          committed the work of revelation to the Spirit. He, in His incarnation
          and life, comprised all saving truth. He was the revealer of God and
          the truth and the life. But while some things He had taught while yet
          with them, He had many things to say which must be postponed because
          they could not yet bear them. . . . If Christ has referred us to the
          apostles as teachers of the truths which He would have us know,
          certainly this primary truth of the authority of the Scriptures
          themselves can be no exception. All questions as to the extent of this
          inspiration, as to its exclusive authority, as to whether it extends
          to words as well as doctrines, as to whether it is infallible or
          inerrant, or not, are simply questions to be referred to the Word
          itself."
        </p>
        <p>
          In such circumstances the attempt to discriminate against the teaching
          of the apostles in favor of that of Christ, is to contradict the
          express teaching of Christ Himself, and thus to undermine our
          confidence in it. We cannot both believe Him and not believe Him. The
          cry, "Back to Christ!" away from all the imaginations of men's hearts
          and the cobweb theories which they have spun, must be ever the cry of
          every Christian heart. But the cry, "Back to Christ!" away from the
          teachings of His apostles, whose teachings He Himself represents as
          His own, only delivered by His Spirit through their mouths, is an
          invitation to desert Christ Himself. It is an invitation to draw back
          from the Christ of the Bible to some Christ of our own fancy, from the
          only real to some imaginary Christ. It is to undermine the credit of
          the whole historical revelation in and through the Christ of God, and
          to cast us for the ascertainment and authentication of truth on the
          native powers of our own minds.

        <h2>ACCOMMODATION OR IGNORANCE?</h2>
        <p>
          2. Another method is that of those who seek to preserve themselves
          from the necessity of accepting the doctrine of inspiration held by
          the writers of the New Testament, by representing it as merely a
          matter of accommodation to the prejudices of the Jews, naturally if
          not necessarily adopted by the first preachers of the Gospel in their
          efforts to commend to their contemporaries their new teaching as to
          the way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This position is quite baldly stated by a recent Scotch writer, to
          whose book, written with a frank boldness, a force and a logical
          acumen which are far above the common, too little heed has been paid
          as an indication of the drift of the times.32 Says Mr. James Stuart:
        </p>
        <p>
          "The apostles had not merely to reveal the Gospel scheme of salvation
          to their own and all subsequent ages, but they had to present it in
          such a form, and support it by such arguments, as should commend it to
          their more immediate hearers and readers. Notwithstanding its
          essentially universal character, the Gospel, as it appears in the New
          Testament, is couched in a particular form, suited to the special
          circumstances of a particular age and nation. Before the Gospel could
          reach the hearts of those to whom it was first addressed, prejudices
          had to be overcome, prepossessions had to be counted on and dealt
          with. The apostles, in fact, had just to take the men of their time as
          they found them, adapting their teaching accordingly. Not only so, but
          there is evidence that the apostles were themselves, to a very great
          extent, men of their own time, sharing many of the common opinions and
          even the common prejudices, so that, in arguing ex concessis, they
          were arguing upon grounds that would appear to themselves just and
          tenable. Now one of the things universally conceded in apostolic times
          was the inspiration and authority of the Old Testament; another was
          the legitimacy of certain modes of interpreting and applying the Old
          Testament. The later Jews, as is well known, cherished a superstitious
          reverence and attached an overwhelming importance to the letter of the
          Old Testament, which they regarded as the 'Word of God' in the fullest
          and most absolute sense that can possibly be put upon such an
          expression. The doctors taught and the people believed that the sacred
          writings were not only inspired, but inspired to the utmost possible
          or conceivable extent. In the composition of Scripture, the human
          author was nowhere, and the inspiring Spirit everywhere; not the
          thoughts alone, but the very words of Scripture were the Word of God,
          which He communicated by the mouth of the human author, who merely
          discharged the duty of spokesman and amanuensis, so that what the
          Scripture contains is the Word of God in as complete and full a sense
          as if it had been dictated by the lips of God to the human authors,
          and recorded with something approaching to perfect accuracy. . . .
          Such being the prevalent view of the inspiration and authority of the
          Old Testament writings, what could be more natural than that the
          apostles should make use of these writings to enforce and commend
          their own ideas? And if the Old Testament were to be used for such a
          purpose at all, evidently it must be used according to the accepted
          methods; for to have followed any other - assuming the possibility of
          such a thing - would have defeated the object aimed at, which was to
          accommodate the Gospel to established prejudices."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, here too, the first remark which needs to be made is that the
          assertion of "accommodation" on the part of the New Testament writers
          cannot be made good. To prove "accommodation," two things need to be
          shown: first, that the apostles did not share these views, and,
          secondly, that they nevertheless accommodated their teaching to them.
          "Accommodation" properly so called cannot take place when the views in
          question are the proper views of the persons themselves. But even in
          the above extract Mr. Stuart is led to allow that the apostles shared
          the current Jewish view of the Scriptures, and at a later point33 he
          demonstrates this in an argument of singular lucidity, although in its
          course he exaggerates the character of their views in his effort to
          fix a stigma of mechanicalness on them. With what propriety, then, can
          he speak of "accommodation" in the case? The fact is that the theory
          of "accommodation" is presented by Mr. Stuart only to enable him the
          more easily to refuse to be bound by the apostolic teaching in this
          matter, and as such it has served him as a stepping stone by which he
          has attained to an even more drastic principle, on which he
          practically acts: that whenever the apostles can be shown to agree
          with their contemporaries, their teaching may be neglected. In such
          cases, he conceives of the New Testament writers "being inspired and
          guided by current opinion,"34 and reasons thus:35 "Now it is
          unquestionable that the New Testament writers in so regarding the Old
          Testament were not enunciating a new theory of inspiration or
          interpretation, they were simply adopting and following out the
          current theory. . . . In matters of this kind . . . the New Testament
          writers were completely dominated by the spirit of the age, so that
          their testimony on the question of Scripture inspiration possesses no
          independent value." "If these popular notions were infallibly correct
          before they were taken up and embodied in the New Testament writings,
          they are infallibly correct still; if they were incorrect before they
          were taken up and embodied in the New Testament writings, they are
          incorrect still."36
        </p>
        <p>
          This is certainly most remarkable argumentation, and the principle
          asserted is probably one of the most singular to which thinking men
          ever committed themselves, viz., that a body of religious teachers,
          claiming authority for themselves as such, are trustworthy only when
          they teach novelties. It is the apotheosis of the old Athenian and new
          modern spirit, which has leisure and heart "for nothing else but
          either to tell or hear some new thing." Nevertheless, it is a
          principle far from uncommon among those who are seeking justification
          for themselves in refusing the leadership of the New Testament writers
          in the matter of the authority and inspiration of the Scriptures. And,
          of late, it is, of course, taking upon itself in certain quarters a
          new form, the form imposed by the new view of the origin of Christian
          thought in Hellenic sources, which has been given such vogue by Dr.
          Harnack and rendered popular in English-speaking lands by the writings
          of the late Dr. Hatch. For example, we find it expressed in this form
          in the recent valuable studies on the First Epistle of Clement of
          Rome, by Lic. Wrede.37 Clement's views of the Old Testament Scriptures
          are recognized as of the highest order; he looks upon them as a
          marvelous and infallible book whose very letters are sacred, as a
          veritable oracle, the most precious possession of the Church. These
          high views were shared by the whole Church of his day, and, indeed, of
          the previous age: "The view which Clement has of the Old Testament,
          and the use which he makes of it, show in themselves no essential
          peculiarities in comparison with the most nearly related Christian
          writings, especially the Pauline epistles, the Epistle to the Hebrews
          and the Epistle of Barnabas." And yet, according to Wrede, this view
          rests on "the Hellenistic conception of inspiration, according to
          which the individual writers were passive instruments of God."38
          Whether, however, the contemporary influence is thought to be Jewish
          or Greek, it is obvious that the appeal to it in such matters has, as
          its only intention, to free us from the duty of following the apostles
          and can have as its only effect to undermine their authority. We may
          no doubt suppose at the beginning that we seek only to separate the
          kernel from the husk; but a principle which makes husk of all that can
          be shown to have anything in common with what was believed by any body
          of contemporaries, Hebrew or Greek, is so very drastic that it will
          leave nothing which we can surely trust. On this principle the Golden
          Rule itself is not authoritative, because something like it may be
          found in Jewish tradition and among the heathen sages. It certainly
          will not serve to make novelty the test of authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the ethical point of view, however, this theory is preferable to
          that of "accommodation," and it is probable that part, at least, of
          the impulse which led Mr. Stuart to substitute it for the theory of
          "accommodation," with which he began, arose from a more or less clear
          perception of the moral implications of the theory of "accommodation."
          Under the impulse of that theory he had been led to speak of the
          procedure of the apostles in such language as this: "The sole
          principle that regulates all their appeals to the Old Testament, is
          that of obtaining, at whatever cost, support for their own favorite
          ideas."39 Is it any wonder that the reaction took place and an attempt
          was made to shift the burden from the veracity to the knowledge of the
          New Testament writers?40 In Mr. Stuart's case we see very clearly,
          then, the effect of a doctrine of "accommodation" on the credit of the
          New Testament writers. His whole book is written in order to assign
          reason why he will not yield authority to these writers in their
          doctrine of a sacrificial atonement. This was due to their Jewish type
          of thought. But when the doctrine of accommodation is tried as a
          ground for the rejection of their authority, it is found to cut too
          deeply even for Mr. Stuart. He wishes to be rid of the authority of
          the New Testament writers, not to impeach their veracity; and so he
          discards it in favor of the less plausible, indeed, but also less
          deeply cutting canon, that the apostles are not to be followed when
          they agree with contemporary thought, because in these elements they
          are obviously speaking out of their own consciousness, as the products
          of their day, and not as proclaimers of the new revelation in Christ.
          Their inspiration, in a word, "was not plenary or universal -
          extending, that is, to all matters whatever which they speak about -
          but partial or special, being limited to securing the accurate
          communication of that plan of salvation which they had so profoundly
          experienced, and which they were commissioned to proclaim."41 In all
          else "the New Testament writers are simply on a level with their
          contemporaries." It may not be uninstructive to note that under such a
          formula Mr. Stuart not only rejects the teachings of these writers as
          to the nature and extent of inspiration, but also their teaching as to
          the sacrificial nature of the very plan of salvation which they were
          specially commissioned to proclaim. But what it is our business at
          present to point out is that the doctrine of accommodation is so
          obviously a blow at not only the trustworthiness, but the very
          veracity of the New Testament authors, that Mr. Stuart, even after
          asserting it, is led to permit it to fall into neglect.

          And must it not be so? It may be easy indeed to confuse it with that
          progressive method of teaching which every wise teacher uses, and
          which our Lord also employed (John xvi. 12 seq.); it may be easy to
          represent it as nothing more than that harmless wisdom which the
          apostle proclaimed as the principle of his life, as he went about the
          world becoming all things to all men. But how different it is from
          either! It is one thing to adapt the teaching of truth to the stage of
          receptivity of the learner; it is another thing to adopt the errors of
          the time as the very matter to be taught. It is one thing to refrain
          from unnecessarily arousing the prejudices of the learner, that more
          ready entrance may be found for the truth; it is another thing to
          adopt those prejudices as our own, and to inculcate them as the very
          truths of God. It was one thing for Paul to become "all things to all
          men" that he might gain them to the truth; it was another for Peter to
          dissemble at Antioch, and so confirm men in their error. The
          accommodation attributed to the New Testament writers is a method by
          which they did and do not undeceive but deceive; not a method by which
          they teach the truth more winningly and to more; but a method by which
          they may be held to have taught along with the truth also error. The
          very object of attributing it to them is to enable us to separate
          their teaching into two parts - the true and the false; and to justify
          us in refusing a part while accepting a part at their hands. At the
          best it must so undermine the trustworthiness of the apostles as
          deliverers of doctrine as to subject their whole teaching to our
          judgment for the separation of the true from the false; at the worst,
          it must destroy their trustworthiness by destroying our confidence in
          their veracity. Mr. Stuart chose the better path; but he did so, as
          all who follow him must, by deserting the principle of accommodation,
          which leads itself along the worse road. With it as a starting point
          we must impeach the New Testament writers as lacking either knowledge
          or veracity.

        <h2>TEACHING VERSUS OPINION</h2>
        <p>
          3. A third type of procedure, in defense of refusal to be bound by the
          doctrine of the New Testament writers as to inspiration, proceeds by
          drawing a distinction between the belief and the teaching of these
          writers; and affirming that, although it is true that they did believe
          and hold a high doctrine of inspiration, yet they do not explicitly
          teach it, and that we are bound, not by their opinions, but only by
          their explicit teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          This appears to be the conception which underlies the treatment of the
          matter by Archdeacon (then Canon) Farrar, in his "Life and Work of St.
          Paul." Speaking of Paul's attitude towards Scripture, Dr. Farrar
          says:42
        </p>
        <p>
          "He shared, doubtless, in the views of the later Jewish schools - the
          Tanaim and Amoraim - on the nature of inspiration. These views, which
          we find also in Philo, made the words of Scripture coextensive and
          identical with the words of God, and in the clumsy and feeble hands of
          the more fanatical Talmudists often attached to the dead letter an
          importance which stifled or destroyed the living sense. But as this
          extreme and mechanical literalism - this claim to absolute
          infallibility even in accidental details and passing allusions - this
          superstitious adoration of the letters and vocables of Scripture, as
          though they were the articulate vocables and immediate autograph of
          God - finds no encouragement in any part of Scripture, and very
          distinct discouragement in more than one of the utterances of Christ,
          so there is not a single passage in which any approach to it is
          dogmatically stated in the writings of St. Paul."
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage lacks somewhat more in point of clearness than it does in
          point of rhetorical fire. But three things seem to be sufficiently
          plain: (1) That Dr. Farrar thinks that Paul shared the views of the
          Tanaim, the Amoraim and Philo as to the nature of inspiration. (2)
          That he admits that these views claimed for Scripture "absolute
          infallibility even in accidental details and passing allusions." (3)
          That nevertheless he does not feel bound to accept this doctrine at
          Paul's hands, because, though Paul held it, he is thought not to have
          "dogmatically stated" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the distinction which is here drawn seems, in general, a
          reasonable one. No one is likely to assert infallibility for the
          apostles in aught else than in their official teaching. And whatever
          they may be shown to have held apart from their official teaching, may
          readily be looked upon with only that respect which we certainly must
          accord to the opinions of men of such exceptional intellectual and
          spiritual insight. But it is more difficult to follow Dr. Farrar when
          it is asked whether this distinction can be established in the present
          matter. It does not seem to be true that there are no didactic
          statements as to inspiration in Paul's letters, or in the rest of the
          New Testament, such as implicate and carry into the sphere of matters
          taught, the whole doctrine that underlies their treatment of
          Scripture. The assertion in the term "theopneustic" in such a passage
          as II Tim. iii. 16, for example, cannot be voided by any construction
          of the passage; and the doctrine taught in the assertion must be
          understood to be the doctrine which that term connoted to Paul who
          uses it, not some other doctrine read into it by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is further necessary to inquire what sources we have in a case like
          that of Paul, to inform us as to what his opinions were, apart from
          and outside of his teachings. It might conceivably have happened that
          some of his contemporaries should have recorded for us some account of
          opinions held by him to which he has given no expression in his
          epistles; or some account of actions performed by him involving the
          manifestation of judgment - somewhat similar, say, to Paul's own
          account of Peter's conduct in Antioch (Gal. ii. 11 seq.). A
          presumption may be held to lie also that he shared the ordinary
          opinions of his day in certain matters lying outside the scope of his
          teachings, as, for example, with reference to the form of the earth,
          or its relation to the sun; and it is not inconceivable that the form
          of his language, when incidentally adverting to such matters, might
          occasionally play into the hands of such a presumption. But it is
          neither on the ground of such a presumption, nor on the ground of such
          external testimony, that Dr. Farrar ascribes to him views as to
          inspiration similar to those of his Jewish contemporaries. It is
          distinctly on the ground of what he finds on a study of the body of
          official teaching which Paul has left to us. Dr. Farrar discovers that
          these views as to the nature of Scripture so underlie, are so assumed
          in, are so implied by, are so interwoven with Paul's official teaching
          that he is unwillingly driven to perceive that they were Paul's
          opinions. With what color of reason then can they be separated from
          his teaching?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is raised here, moreover, a very important and far-reaching
          question, which few will be able to decide in Dr. Farrar's sense. What
          is taught in the New Testament? And what is the mode of its teaching?
          If we are to fall in with Dr. Farrar and say that nothing is taught
          except what is "dogmatically stated" in formal didactic form, the
          occasional character of the New Testament epistles would become a
          source of grave loss to us, instead of, as it otherwise is, a source
          of immense gain; the parabolic clothing of much of Christ's teaching
          would become a device to withhold from us all instruction on the
          matters of which the parables treat; and all that is most fundamental
          in religious truth, which, as a rule, is rather assumed everywhere in
          Scripture as a basis for particular applications than formally stated,
          would be removed out of the sphere of Biblical doctrine. Such a rule,
          in a word, would operate to turn the whole of Biblical teaching on its
          head, and to reduce it from a body of principles inculcated by means
          of examples into a mere congeries of instances hung in the air. The
          whole advance in the attitude of Dogmatics towards the Scriptures
          which has been made by modern scholarship is, moreover, endangered by
          this position. It was the fault of the older dogmatists to depend too
          much on isolated proof-texts for the framing and defense of doctrine.
          Dr. Farrar would have us return to this method. The alternative,
          commended justly to us by the whole body of modern scholarship, is, as
          Schleiermacher puts it, to seek "a form of Scripture proof on a larger
          scale than can be got from single texts," to build our systematic
          theology, in a word, on the basis, not of the occasional dogmatic
          statements of Scripture alone, taken separately and, as it were, in
          shreds, but on the basis of the theologies of the Scripture - to
          reproduce first the theological thought of each writer or group of
          writers and then to combine these several theologies (each according
          to its due historical place) into the one consistent system,
          consentaneous parts of which they are found to be.43 In rejecting this
          method, Dr. Farrar discredits the whole science of Biblical Theology.
          From its standpoint it is incredible that one should attribute less
          importance and authoritativeness to the fundamental conceptions that
          underlie, color and give form to all of Paul's teaching than to the
          chance didactic statements he may have been led to make by this or
          that circumstance at the call of which his letters happened to be
          written. This certainly would be tithing mint and anise and cummin and
          omitting the weightier matters of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this mode of presenting the matter must lead, no less than the
          others which have already come under review, to undermining the
          authority. of the New Testament writers as deliverers of doctrine,
          must already be obvious. It begins by discrediting them as leaders in
          doctrinal thought and substituting for this a sporadic authority in
          explicit dogmatic statements. In Dr. Farrar's own hands it proceeds by
          quite undermining our confidence in the apostles as teachers, through
          an accusation lodged against them, not only of holding wrong views in
          doctrine, but even of cherishing as fundamental conceptions
          theological fancies which are in their very essence superstitious and
          idolatrous; and in their inevitable outcome ruinous to faith and
          honor. For Dr. Farrar does not mince matters when he expresses his
          opinion of that doctrine of inspiration - in its nature and its proper
          effects - which Philo held and the Jewish Rabbis and in which Paul,
          according to his expressed conviction, shared. "To say that every word
          and sentence and letter of Scripture is divine and supernatural, is a
          mechanical and useless shibboleth, nay, more, a human idol, and
          (constructively, at least) a dreadful blasphemy." It is a
          superstitious - he tells us that he had almost said fetish-worshiping
          - dogma, and "not only unintelligible, but profoundly dangerous." It
          "has in many ages filled the world with misery and ruin," and "has
          done more than any other dogma to corrupt the whole of exegesis with
          dishonest casuistry, and to shake to its centre the religious faith of
          thousands, alike of the most ignorant and of the most cultivated, in
          many centuries, and most of all in our own."44 Yet these are the views
          which Dr. Farrar is forced to allow that Paul shared! For Philo "held
          the most rigid views of inspiration"; than him indeed "Aqiba himself
          used no stronger language on the subject"45 - Aqiba, "the greatest of
          the Tanaites";46 and it was the views of the Tanaim, Amoraim and
          Philo, which Dr. Farrar tells us the apostle shared. How after this
          Dr. Farrar continues to look upon even the "dogmatic statements" of
          Paul as authoritative, it is hard to see. By construction he was a
          fetish worshiper and placed Scripture upon an idol's pedestal. The
          doctrines which he held and which underlie his teaching were
          unintelligible, useless, idolatrous, blasphemous and profoundly
          dangerous, and actually have shaken to its centre the religious faith
          of thousands. On such a tree what other than evil fruits could grow?
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt something of this may be attributed to the exaggeration
          characteristic of Dr. Farrar's language and thought. Obviously Paul's
          view of inspiration was not altogether identical with that of
          contemporary Judaism; it differed from it somewhat in the same way
          that his use of Scripture differed from that of the Rabbis of his day.
          But it is one with Philo's and Aqiba's on the point which with Dr.
          Farrar is decisive: alike with them he looked upon Scripture as
          "absolutely infallible, even in accidental details and passing
          allusions," as the very Word of God, His "Oracles," to use his own
          high phrase, and therefore Dr. Farrar treats the two views as
          essentially one. But the situation is only modified, not relieved, by
          the recognition of this fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any event the pathway on which we enter when we begin to
          distinguish between the didactic statements and the fundamental
          conceptions of a body of incidental teaching, with a view to accepting
          the former and rejecting the latter, cannot but lead to a general
          undermining of the authority of the whole. Only if we could believe in
          a quite mechanical and magical process of inspiration (from believing
          in which Dr. Farrar is no doubt very far) by which the subject's
          "dogmatical statements" were kept entirely separate from and
          unaffected by his fundamental conceptions, could such an attitude be
          logically possible. In that case we should have to view these
          "dogmatical statements" as not Paul's at all, standing, as they do ex
          hypothesi, wholly disconnected with his own fundamental thought, but
          as spoken through him by an overmastering spiritual influence; as a
          phenomenon, in a word, similar to the oracles of heathen shrines, and
          without analogy in Scripture except perhaps in such cases as that of
          Balaam. In proportion as we draw back from so magical a conception of
          the mode of inspiration, in that proportion our refusal of authority
          to the fundamental conceptions of the New Testament writers must
          invade also their "dogmatical statements." We must logically, in a
          word, ascribe like authority to the whole body of their teaching, in
          its foundation and superstructure alike, or we must withhold it in
          equal measure from all; or, if we withhold it from one and not the
          other, the discrimination would most naturally be made against the
          superstructure rather than against the foundation.

        <h2>FACTS VERSUS DOCTRINE</h2>
        <p>
          4. Finally, an effort may be made to justify our holding a lower
          doctrine of inspiration than that held by the writers of the New
          Testament, by appealing to the so-called phenomena of the Scriptures
          and opposing these to the doctrine of the Scriptures, with the
          expectation, apparently, of justifying a modification of the doctrine
          taught by the Scriptures by the facts embedded in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The essential principle of this method of procedure is shared by very
          many who could scarcely be said to belong to the class who are here
          more specifically in mind, inasmuch as they do not begin by explicitly
          recognizing the doctrine of inspiration held by the New Testament
          writers to be that high doctrine which the Church and the best
          scientific exegesis agree in understanding them to teach.47 Every
          attempt to determine or modify the Biblical doctrine of inspiration by
          an appeal to the actual characteristics of the Bible must indeed
          proceed on an identical principle. It finds, perhaps, as plausible a
          form of assertion possible to it in the declaration of Dr. Marvin R.
          Vincent48 that "our only safe principle is that inspiration is
          consistent with the phenomena of Scripture" - to which one of
          skeptical turn might respond that whether the inspiration claimed by
          Scripture is consistent with the phenomena of Scripture after all
          requires some proof, while one of a more believing frame might respond
          that it is a safer principle that the phenomena of Scripture are
          consistent with its inspiration. Its crudest expression may be seen in
          such a book as Mr. Horton's "Inspiration and the Bible," which we have
          already had occasion to mention. Mr. Horton chooses to retain the
          term, "inspiration," as representing "the common sense of Christians
          of all ages and in all places" as to the nature of their Scriptures,49
          but asserts that this term is to be understood to mean just what the
          Bible is - that is to say, whatever any given writer chooses to think
          the Bible to be. When Paul affirms in II Tim. iii. 16 that every
          Scripture is "inspired by God," therefore, we are not to enter into a
          philological and exegetical investigation to discover what Paul meant
          to affirm by the use of this word, but simply to say that Paul must
          have meant to affirm the Bible to be what we find it to be. Surely no
          way could be invented which would more easily enable us to substitute
          our thought for the apostles' thought, and to proclaim our crudities
          under the sanction of their great names. Operating by it, Mr. Horton
          is enabled to assert that the Bible is "inspired," and yet to teach
          that God's hand has entered it only in a providential way, by His
          dealings through long ages with a people who gradually wrought out a
          history, conceived hopes, and brought all through natural means to an
          expression in a faulty and often self-contradictory record, which we
          call inspired only "because by reading it and studying it we can find
          our way to God, we can find what is His will for us and how we can
          carry out that will."50 The most naive expression of the principle in
          question may be found in such a statement as the following, from the
          pen of Dr. W. G. Blaikie: "In our mode of dealing with this question
          the main difference between us is, that you lay your stress on certain
          general considerations, and on certain specific statements of
          Scripture. We, on the other hand, while accepting the specific
          statements, lay great stress also on the structure of Scripture as we
          find it, on certain phenomena which lie on the surface, and on the
          inextricable difficulties which are involved in carrying out your view
          in detail."51 This statement justly called out the rebuke of Dr.
          Robert Watts,52 that "while the principle of your theory is a mere
          inference from apparent discrepancies not as yet explained, the
          principle of the theory you oppose is the formally expressed
          utterances of prophets and apostles, and of Christ Himself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Under whatever safeguards, indeed, it may be attempted, and with
          whatever caution it may be prosecuted, the effort to modify the
          teaching of Scripture as to its own inspiration by an appeal to the
          observed characteristics of Scripture, is an attempt not to obtain a
          clearer knowledge of what the Scriptures teach, but to correct that
          teaching. And to correct the teaching of Scripture is to proclaim
          Scripture untrustworthy as a witness to doctrine. The procedure in
          question is precisely similar to saying that the Bible's doctrine of
          creation is to be derived not alone from the teachings of the Bible as
          to creation, but from the facts obtained through a scientific study of
          creation; that the Bible's doctrine as to man is to be found not in
          the Bible's deliverances on the subject, but "while accepting these,
          we lay great stress also on the structure of man as we find him, and
          on the inextricable difficulties which are involved in carrying out
          the Bible's teaching in detail"; that the Bible's doctrine of
          justification is to be obtained by retaining the term as commended by
          the common sense of the Christian world and understanding by it just
          what we find justification to be in actual life. It is precisely
          similar to saying that Mr. Darwin's doctrine of natural selection is
          to be determined not solely by what Mr. Darwin says concerning it, but
          equally by what we, in our own independent study of nature, find to be
          true as to natural selection. A historian of thought who proceeded on
          such a principle would scarcely receive the commendation of students
          of history, however much his writings might serve certain party ends.
          Who does not see that underlying this whole method of procedure - in
          its best and in its worst estate alike - there is apparent an
          unwillingness to commit ourselves without reserve to the teaching of
          the Bible, either because that teaching is distrusted or already
          disbelieved; and that it is a grave logical error to suppose that the
          teaching of the Bible as to inspiration can be corrected in this way
          any otherwise than by showing it not to be in accordance with the
          facts? The proposed method, therefore, does not conduct us to a
          somewhat modified doctrine of inspiration, but to a disproof of
          inspiration; by correcting the doctrine delivered by the Biblical
          writers, it discredits those writers as teachers of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it not be said that in speaking thus we are refusing the inductive
          method of establishing doctrine. We follow the inductive method. When
          we approach the Scriptures to ascertain their doctrine of inspiration,
          we proceed by collecting the whole body of relevant facts. Every claim
          they make to inspiration is a relevant fact; every statement they make
          concerning inspiration is a relevant fact; every allusion they make to
          the subject is a relevant fact; every fact indicative of the attitude
          they hold towards Scripture is a relevant fact. But the
          characteristics of their own writings are not facts relevant to the
          determination of their doctrine. Nor let it be said that we are
          desirous of determining the true, as distinguished from the
          Scriptural, doctrine of inspiration otherwise than inductively. We are
          averse, however, to supposing that in such an inquiry the relevant
          "phenomena" of Scripture are not first of all and before all the
          claims of Scripture and second only to them its use of previous
          Scripture. And we are averse to excluding these primary "phenomena"
          and building our doctrine solely or mainly upon the characteristics
          and structure of Scripture, especially as determined by some special
          school of modern research by critical methods certainly not infallible
          and to the best of our own judgment not even reasonable. And we are
          certainly averse to supposing that this induction, if it reaches
          results not absolutely consentaneous with the teachings of Scripture
          itself, has done anything other than discredit those teachings, or
          that in discrediting them, it has escaped discrediting the doctrinal
          authority of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor again is it to be thought that we refuse to use the actual
          characteristics of Scripture as an aid in, and a check upon, our
          exegesis of Scripture, as we seek to discover its doctrine of
          inspiration. We do not simply admit, on the contrary, we affirm that
          in every sphere the observed fact may throw a broad and most helpful
          light upon the written text. It is so in the narrative of creation in
          the first chapter of Genesis; which is only beginning to be adequately
          understood as science is making her first steps in reading the records
          of God's creative hand in the structure of the world itself. It is
          preeminently so in the written prophecies, the dark sayings of which
          are not seldom first illuminated by the light cast back upon them by
          their fulfillment. As Scripture interprets Scripture, and fulfillment
          interprets prediction, so may fact interpret assertion. And this is as
          true as regards the Scriptural assertion of the fact of inspiration as
          elsewhere. No careful student of the Bible doctrine of inspiration
          will neglect anxiously to try his conclusions as to the teachings of
          Scripture by the observed characteristics and "structure" of
          Scripture, and in trying he may and no doubt will find occasion to
          modify his conclusions as at first apprehended. But it is one thing to
          correct our exegetical processes and so modify our exegetical
          conclusions in the new light obtained by a study of the facts, and
          quite another to modify, by the facts of the structure of Scripture,
          the Scriptural teaching itself, as exegetically ascertained; and it is
          to this latter that we should be led by making the facts of structure
          and the facts embedded in Scripture co-factors of the same rank in the
          so-called inductive ascertainment of the doctrine of inspiration.
          Direct exegesis after all has its rights: we may seek aid from every
          quarter in our efforts to perform its processes with precision and
          obtain its results with purity; but we cannot allow its results to be
          "modified" by extraneous considerations. Let us by all means be
          careful in determining the doctrine of Scripture, but let us also be
          fully honest in determining it; and if we count it a crime to permit
          our ascertainment of the facts recorded in Scripture to be unduly
          swayed by our conception of the doctrine taught in Scripture, let us
          count it equally a crime to permit our ascertainment of its doctrine
          to be unduly swayed or colored by our conception of the nature of the
          facts of its structure or of the facts embedded in its record. We
          cannot, therefore, appeal from the doctrine of Scripture as
          exegetically established to the facts of the structure of Scripture or
          the facts embedded in Scripture, in the hope of modifying the
          doctrine. If the teaching and the facts of Scripture are in harmony
          the appeal is useless. If they are in disharmony, we cannot follow
          both - we must choose one and reject the other. And the attempt to
          make the facts of Scripture co-factors of equal rank with the teaching
          of Scripture in ascertaining the true doctrine of inspiration, is
          really an attempt to modify the doctrine taught by Scripture by an
          appeal to the facts, while concealing from ourselves the fact that we
          have modified it, and in modifying corrected it, and, of course, in
          correcting it, discredited Scripture as a teacher of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably these four types of procedure will include most of the
          methods by which men are to-day seeking to free themselves from the
          necessity of following the Scriptural doctrine of inspiration, while
          yet looking to Scripture as the source of doctrine. Is it not plain
          that on every one of them the outcome must be to discredit Scripture
          as a doctrinal guide? The human mind is very subtle, but with all its
          subtlety it will hardly be able to find a way to refuse to follow
          Scripture in one of the doctrines it teaches without undermining its
          authority as a teacher of doctrine.

        <h2>IMMENSE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE FOR THE BIBLICAL DOCTRINE</h2>
        <p>
          It is only to turn another face of the proposition with which we are
          dealing towards us, to emphasize next the important fact, that, the
          state of the case being such as we have found it, the evidence for the
          truth of the doctrine of the plenary inspiration of Scripture is just
          the whole body of evidence which goes to show that the apostles are
          trustworthy teachers of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Language is sometimes made use of which would seem to imply that the
          amount or weight of the evidence offered for the truth of the doctrine
          that the Scriptures are the Word of God in such a sense that their
          words deliver the truth of God without error, is small. It is on the
          contrary just the whole body of evidence which goes to prove the
          writers of the New Testament to be trustworthy as deliverers of
          doctrine. It is just the same evidence in amount and weight which is
          adduced in favor of any other Biblical doctrine. It is the same weight
          and amount of evidence precisely which is adducible for the truth of
          the doctrines of the Incarnation, of the Trinity, of the Divinity of
          Christ, of Justification by Faith, of Regeneration by the Holy Spirit,
          of the Resurrection of the Body, of Life Everlasting. It is, of
          course, not absurdly intended that every Biblical doctrine is taught
          in the Scriptures with equal clearness, with equal explicitness, with
          equal frequency. Some doctrines are stated with an explicit precision
          that leaves little to systematic theology in its efforts to define the
          truth on all sides, except to repeat the words which the Biblical
          writers have used to teach it - as for example the doctrine of
          Justification by Faith. Others are not formulated in Scripture at all,
          but are taught only in their elements, which the systematician must
          collect and combine and so arrive finally at the doctrine - as for
          example the doctrine of the Trinity. Some are adverted to so
          frequently as to form the whole warp and woof of Scripture - as for
          example the doctrine of redemption in the blood of Christ. Others are
          barely alluded to here and there, in connections where the stress is
          really on other matters - as for example the doctrine of the fall of
          the angels. But however explicitly or incidentally, however frequently
          or rarely, however emphatically or allusively, they may be taught,
          when exegesis has once done its work and shown that they are taught by
          the Biblical writers, all these doctrines stand as supported by the
          same weight and amount of evidence - the evidence of the
          trustworthiness of the Biblical writers as teachers of doctrine. We
          cannot say that we will believe these writers when they assert a
          doctrine a hundred times and we will not believe them if they assert
          it only ten times or only once; that we will believe them in the
          doctrines they make the main subjects of discourse, but not in those
          which they advert to incidentally; that we will believe them in those
          that they teach as conclusions of formal arguments, but not in those
          which they use as premises wherewith to reach those conclusions; that
          we will believe them in those they explicitly formulate and
          dogmatically teach, but not in those which they teach only in their
          separate parts and elements. The question is not how they teach a
          doctrine, but do they teach it; and when that question is once settled
          affirmatively, the weight of evidence that commends this doctrine to
          us as true is the same in every case; and that is the whole body of
          evidence which goes to show that the Biblical writers are trustworthy
          as teachers of doctrine. The Biblical doctrine of inspiration,
          therefore, has in its favor just this whole weight and amount of
          evidence. It follows on the one hand that it cannot rationally be
          rejected save on the ground of evidence which will outweigh the whole
          body of evidence which goes to authenticate the Biblical writers as
          trustworthy witnesses to and teachers of doctrine. And it follows, on
          the other hand, that if the Biblical doctrine of inspiration is
          rejected, our freedom from its trammels is bought logically at the
          somewhat serious cost of discrediting the evidence which goes to show
          that the Biblical writers are trustworthy as teachers of doctrine. In
          this sense, the fortunes of distinctive Christianity are bound up with
          those of the Biblical doctrine of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it not be said that thus we found the whole Christian system upon
          the doctrine of plenary inspiration. We found the whole Christian
          system on the doctrine of plenary inspiration as little as we found it
          upon the doctrine of angelic existences. Were there no such thing as
          inspiration, Christianity would be true, and all its essential
          doctrines would be credibly witnessed to us in the generally
          trustworthy reports of the teaching of our Lord and of His
          authoritative agents in founding the Church, preserved in the writings
          of the apostles and their first followers, and in the historical
          witness of the living Church. Inspiration is not the most fundamental
          of Christian doctrines, nor even the first thing we prove about the
          Scriptures. It is the last and crowning fact as to the Scriptures.
          These we first prove authentic, historically credible, generally
          trustworthy, before we prove them inspired. And the proof of their
          authenticity, credibility, general trustworthiness would give us a
          firm basis for Christianity prior to any knowledge on our part of
          their inspiration, and apart indeed from the existence of inspiration.
          The present writer, in order to prevent all misunderstanding, desires
          to repeat here what he has said on every proper occasion - that he is
          far from contending that without inspiration there could be no
          Christianity. "Without any inspiration," he added, when making this
          affirmation on his induction into the work of teaching the Bible53 -
          "without any inspiration we could have had Christianity; yea, and men
          could still have heard the truth and through it been awakened, and
          justified, and sanctified, and glorified. The verities of our faith
          would remain historically proven to us - so bountiful has God been in
          His fostering care - even had we no Bible; and through those verities,
          salvation." We are in entire harmony in this matter with what we
          conceive to be the very true statement recently made by Dr. George P.
          Fisher, that "if the authors of the Bible were credible reporters of
          revelations of God, whether in the form of historical transactions of
          which they were witnesses, or of divine mysteries that were unveiled
          to their minds, their testimony would be entitled to belief, even if
          they were shut up to their unaided faculties in communicating what
          they had thus received."54 We are in entire sympathy in this matter,
          therefore, with the protest which Dr. Marcus Dods raised in his famous
          address at the meeting of the Alliance of the Reformed Churches at
          London, against representing that "the infallibility of the Bible is
          the ground of the whole Christian faith."55 We judge with him that it
          is very important indeed that such a misapprehension, if it is
          anywhere current, should be corrected. What we are at present arguing
          is something entirely different from such an overstrained view of the
          importance of inspiration to the very existence of Christian faith,
          and something which has no connection with it. We do not think that
          the doctrine of plenary inspiration is the ground of Christian faith,
          but if it was held and taught by the New Testament writers, we think
          it an element in the Christian faith; a very important and valuable
          element;56 an element that appeals to our acceptance on precisely the
          same ground as every other element of the faith, viz., on the ground
          of our recognition of the writers of the New Testament as trustworthy
          witnesses to doctrine; an element of the Christian faith, therefore,
          which cannot be rejected without logically undermining our trust in
          all the other elements of distinctive Christianity by undermining the
          evidence on which this trust rests. We must indeed prove the
          authenticity, credibility and general trustworthiness of the New
          Testament writings before we prove their inspiration; and even were
          they not inspired this proof would remain valid and we should give
          them accordant trust. But just because this proof is valid, we must
          trust these writings in their witness to their inspiration, if they
          give such witness; and if we refuse to trust them here, we have in
          principle refused them trust everywhere. In such circumstances their
          inspiration is bound up inseparably with their trustworthiness, and
          therefore with all else that we receive on trust from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, we need to remind ourselves that to say that the
          amount and weight of the evidence of the truth of the Biblical
          doctrine of inspiration is measured by the amount and weight of the
          evidence for the general credibility and trustworthiness of the New
          Testament writers as witnesses to doctrine, is an understatement
          rather than an overstatement of the matter. For if we trust them at
          all we will trust them in the account they give of the person and in
          the report they give of the teaching of Christ; whereupon, as they
          report Him as teaching the same doctrine of Scripture that they teach,
          we are brought face to face with divine testimony to this doctrine of
          inspiration. The argument, then, takes the form given it by Bishop
          Wordsworth: "The New Testament canonizes the Old; the INCARNATE WORD
          sets His seal on the WRITTEN WORD. The Incarnate Word is God;
          therefore, the inspiration of the Old Testament is authenticated by
          God Himself."57 And, again, the general trustworthiness of the writers
          of the New Testament gives us the right and imposes on us the duty of
          accepting their witness to the relation the Holy Ghost bears to their
          teaching, as, for example, when Paul tells us that the things which
          they uttered they uttered "not in words taught by human wisdom, but in
          those taught by the Spirit; joining Spirit-given things with
          Spirit-given things" (I Cor. ii. 13), and Peter asserts that the
          Gospel was preached by them "in the Holy Spirit" (I Peter i. 12); and
          this relation asserted to exist between the Holy Ghost and their
          teaching, whether oral or written (I Cor. xiv. 37; II Thess. ii. 15,
          iii. 6-14), gives the sanction of the Holy Ghost to their doctrine of
          Holy Scripture, whatever that is found to be. So that, even though we
          begin on the lowest ground, we may find ourselves compelled to say, as
          Bishop Wilberforce found himself compelled to say: "In brief, my
          belief is this: The whole Bible comes to us as 'the Word of God' under
          the sanction of God, the Holy Ghost."58 The weight of the testimony to
          the Biblical doctrine of inspiration, in a word, is no less than the
          weight to be attached to the testimony of God - God the Son and God
          the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But our present purpose is not to draw out the full value of the
          testimony, but simply to emphasize the fact that on the emergence of
          the exegetical fact that the Scriptures of the New Testament teach
          this doctrine, the amount and weight of evidence for its truth must be
          allowed to be the whole amount and weight of the evidence that the
          writers of the New Testament are trustworthy as teachers of doctrine.
          It is not on some shadowy and doubtful evidence that the doctrine is
          based - not on an a priori conception of what inspiration ought to be,
          not on a "tradition" of doctrine in the Church, though all the a
          priori considerations and the whole tradition of doctrine in the
          Church are also thrown in the scale for and not in that against this
          doctrine; but first on the confidence which we have in the writers of
          the New Testament as doctrinal guides, and ultimately on whatever
          evidence of whatever kind and force exists to justify that confidence.
          In this sense, we repeat, the cause of distinctive Christianity is
          bound up with the cause of the Biblical doctrine of inspiration. We
          accept Christianity in all its distinctive doctrines on no other
          ground than the credibility and trustworthiness of the Bible as a
          guide to truth; and on this same ground we must equally accept its
          doctrine of inspiration. "If we may not accept its account of itself,"
          asks Dr. Purves, pointedly, "why should we care to ascertain its
          account of other things?"59

          IMMENSE PRESUMPTION AGAINST ALLEGED FACTS CONTRADICTORY OF THE
          BIBLICAL DOCTRINE
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are again making no new affirmation but only looking from a
          slightly different angle upon the same proposition with which we have
          been dealing from the first, when we emphasize next the fact, that the
          state of the case being as we have found it, we approach the study of
          the so-called "phenomena" of the Scriptures with a very strong
          presumption that these Scriptures contain no errors, and that any
          "phenomena" apparently inconsistent with their inerrancy are so in
          appearance only: a presumption the measure of which is just the whole
          amount and weight of evidence that the New Testament writers are
          trustworthy as teachers of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to be often tacitly assumed that the Biblical doctrine of
          inspiration cannot be confidently ascertained until all the facts
          concerning the contents and structure and characteristics of Scripture
          are fully determined and allowed for. This is obviously fallacious.
          What Paul, for example, believed as to the nature of Scripture is
          obviously an easily separable question from what the nature of
          Scripture really is. On the other hand, the assumption that we cannot
          confidently accept the Biblical doctrine of inspiration as true until
          criticism and exegesis have said their last word upon the structure,
          the text, and the characteristics of Scripture, even to the most
          minute fact, is more plausible. But it is far from obviously true.
          Something depends upon our estimate of the force of the mass of
          evidence which goes to show the trustworthiness of the apostles as
          teachers of truth, and of the clearness with which they announce their
          teaching as to inspiration. It is conceivable, for example, that the
          force of the evidence of their trustworthiness may be so great that we
          should be fully justified in yielding implicit confidence to their
          teaching, even though many and serious difficulties should stand in
          the way of accepting it. This, indeed, is exactly what we do in our
          ordinary use of Scripture as a source of doctrine. Who doubts that the
          doctrines of the Trinity and of the Incarnation present difficulties
          to rational construction? Who doubts that the doctrines of native
          demerit and total depravity, inability and eternal punishment raise
          objections in the natural heart? We accept these doctrines and others
          which ought to be much harder to credit, such as the Biblical teaching
          that God so loved sinful man as to give His only-begotten Son to die
          for him, not because their acceptance is not attended with
          difficulties, but because our confidence in the New Testament as a
          doctrinal guide is so grounded in unassailable and compelling
          evidence, that we believe its teachings despite the difficulties which
          they raise. We do not and we cannot wait until all these difficulties
          are fully explained before we yield to the teaching of the New
          Testament the fullest confidence of our minds and hearts. How then can
          it be true that we are to wait until all difficulties are removed
          before we can accept with confidence the Biblical doctrine of
          inspiration? In relation to this doctrine alone, are we to assume the
          position that we will not yield faith in response to due and
          compelling evidence of the trustworthiness of the teacher, until all
          difficulties are explained to our satisfaction? - that we must fully
          understand and comprehend before we will believe? Or is the point this
          - that we can suppose ourselves possibly mistaken in everything else
          except our determination of the characteristics and structure of
          Scripture and the facts stated therein? Surely if we do not need to
          wait until we understand how God can be both one and three, how Christ
          can be both human and divine, how man can be both unable and
          responsible, how an act can be both free and certain, how man can be
          both a sinner and righteous in God's sight, before we accept, on the
          authority of the teaching of Scripture, the doctrines of the Trinity,
          of the Incarnation, of man's state as a sinner, of God's eternal
          predestination of the acts of free agents, and of acceptance on the
          ground of Christ's righteousness, because of the weight of the
          evidence which goes to prove that Scripture trustworthy as a teacher
          of divine truth; we may on the same compelling evidence accept, in
          full confidence, the teaching of the same Scripture as to the nature
          of its own inspiration, prior to a full understanding of how all the
          phenomena of Scripture are to be adjusted to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt it is perfectly true and is to be kept in mind that the claim
          of a writing to be infallible may be mistaken or false. Such a claim
          has been put forth in behalf of and by other writings besides the
          Bible, and has been found utterly inconsistent with the observed
          characteristics of those writings. An a priori possibility may be
          asserted to exist in the case of the Bible, that a comparison of its
          phenomena with its doctrine may bring out a glaring inconsistency. The
          test of the truth of the claims of the Bible to be inspired of God
          through comparison with its contents, characteristics and phenomena,
          the Bible cannot expect to escape; and the lovers of the Bible will be
          the last to deny the validity of it. By all means let the doctrine of
          the Bible be tested by the facts and let the test be made all the
          more, not the less, stringent and penetrating because of the great
          issues that hang upon it. If the facts are inconsistent with the
          doctrine, let us all know it, and know it so clearly that the matter
          is put beyond doubt. But let us not conceal from ourselves the
          greatness of the issues involved in the test, lest we approach the
          test in too light a spirit, and make shipwreck of faith in the
          trustworthiness of the apostles as teachers of doctrine, with the easy
          indifference of a man who corrects the incidental errors of a piece of
          gossip. Nor is this appeal to the seriousness of the issues involved
          in any sense an appeal to deal deceitfully with the facts concerning
          or stated in the Bible, through fear of disturbing our confidence in a
          comfortable doctrine of its infallibility. It is simply an appeal to
          common sense. If you are told that a malicious lie has been uttered by
          some unknown person you may easily yield the report a languid
          provisional assent; such things are not impossible, unfortunately in
          this sinful world not unexampled. But if it is told you of your loved
          and trusted friend, you will probably demand the most stringent proof
          at the point of your walking stick. So far as this, Robert Browning
          has missed neither nature nor right reason, when he makes his
          Ferishtah point out how much more evidence we require in proof of a
          fact which brings us loss than what is sufficient to command
        </p>
        <p>
          The easy acquiescence of mankind<br />
          In matters nowise worth dispute."
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is right to test most carefully the claim of every settled and
          accepted faith by every fact asserted in rebuttal of it, it must be
          equally right, nay incumbent, to scrutinize most closely the evidence
          for an asserted fact, which, if genuine, wounds in its vitals some
          important interest. If it would be a crime to refuse to consider most
          carefully and candidly any phenomena of Scripture asserted to be
          inconsistent with its inerrancy, it would be equally a crime to accept
          the asserted reality of phenomena of Scripture, which, if real, strike
          at the trustworthiness of the apostolic witness to doctrine, on any
          evidence of less than demonstrative weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we approach the consideration of these phenomena alleged to be
          inconsistent with the Biblical doctrine of inspiration not only thus
          with what may be called, though in a high sense, a sentimental
          presumption against their reality. The presumption is an eminently
          rational one, and is capable of somewhat exact estimation. We do not
          adopt the doctrine of the plenary inspiration of Scripture on
          sentimental grounds, nor even, as we have already had occasion to
          remark, on a priori or general grounds of whatever kind. We adopt it
          specifically because it is taught us as truth by Christ and His
          apostles, in the Scriptural record of their teaching, and the evidence
          for its truth is, therefore, as we have also already pointed out,
          precisely that evidence, in weight and amount, which vindicates for us
          the trustworthiness of Christ and His apostles as teachers of
          doctrine. Of course, this evidence is not in the strict logical sense
          "demonstrative;" it is "probable" evidence. It therefore leaves open
          the metaphysical possibility of its being mistaken. But it may be
          contended that it is about as great in amount and weight as "probable"
          evidence can be made, and that the strength of conviction which it is
          adapted to produce may be and should be practically equal to that
          produced by demonstration itself. But whatever weight it has, and
          whatever strength of conviction it is adapted to produce, it is with
          this weight of evidence behind us and with this strength of conviction
          as to the unreality of any alleged phenomena contradictory of the
          Biblical doctrine of inspiration, that we approach the study of the
          characteristics, the structure, and the detailed statements of the
          Bible. Their study is not to be neglected; we have not attained
          through "probable" evidence apodeictic certainty of the Bible's
          infallibility. But neither is the reality of the alleged phenomena
          inconsistent with the Bible's doctrine, to be allowed without
          sufficient evidence. Their reality cannot be logically or rationally
          recognized unless the evidence for it be greater in amount and weight
          than the whole mass of evidence for the trustworthiness of the
          Biblical writers as teachers of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not to be thought that this amounts to a recommendation of
          strained exegesis in order to rid the Bible of phenomena adverse to
          the truth of the Biblical doctrine of inspiration. It amounts to a
          recommendation of great care in the exegetical determination of these
          alleged phenomena; it amounts to a recommendation to allow that our
          exegesis determining these phenomena is not infallible. But it is far
          from recommending either strained or artificial exegesis of any kind.
          We are not bound to harmonize the alleged phenomena with the Bible
          doctrine; and if we cannot harmonize them save by strained or
          artificial exegesis they would be better left unharmonized. We are not
          bound, however, on the other hand, to believe that they are
          unharmonizable, because we cannot harmonize them save by strained
          exegesis. Our individual fertility in exegetical expedients, our
          individual insight into exegetical truth, our individual capacity of
          understanding are not the measure of truth. If we cannot harmonize
          without straining, let us leave unharmonized. It is not necessary for
          us to see the harmony that it should exist or even be recognized by us
          as existing. But it is necessary for us to believe the harmony to be
          possible and real, provided that we are not prepared to say that we
          clearly see that on any conceivable hypothesis (conceivable to us or
          conceivable to any other intelligent beings) the harmony is impossible
          - if the trustworthiness of the Biblical writers who teach us the
          doctrine of plenary inspiration is really safeguarded to us on
          evidence which we cannot disbelieve. In that case every unharmonized
          passage remains a case of difficult harmony and does not pass into the
          category of objections to plenary inspiration. It can pass into the
          category of objections only if we are prepared to affirm that we
          clearly see that it is, on any conceivable hypothesis of its meaning,
          clearly inconsistent with the Biblical doctrine of inspiration. In
          that case we would no doubt need to give up the Biblical doctrine of
          inspiration; but with it we must also give up our confidence in the
          Biblical writers as teachers of doctrine. And if we cannot reasonably
          give up this latter, neither can we reasonably allow that the
          phenomena apparently inconsistent with the former are real, or really
          inconsistent with it. And this is but to say that we approach the
          study of these phenomena with a presumption against their being such
          as will disprove the Biblical doctrine of inspiration - or, we may add
          (for this is but the same thing in different words), correct or modify
          the Biblical doctrine of inspiration - which is measured precisely by
          the amount and weight of the evidence which goes to show that the
          Bible is a trustworthy guide to doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance of emphasizing these, as it would seem, very obvious
          principles, does not arise out of need for a very great presumption in
          order to overcome the difficulties arising from the "phenomena" of
          Scripture, as over against its doctrine of inspiration. Such
          difficulties are not specially numerous or intractable. Dr. Charles
          Hodge justly characterizes those that have been adduced by
          disbelievers in the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, as "for the
          most part trivial," "only apparent," and marvelously few "of any real
          importance." They bear, he adds, about the same relation to the whole
          that a speck of sandstone detected here and there in the marble of the
          Parthenon would bear to that building.60 They do not for the most part
          require explaining away, but only to be fairly understood in order to
          void them. They constitute no real strain upon faith, but when
          approached in a candid spirit one is left continually marveling at the
          excessive fewness of those which do not, like ghosts, melt away from
          vision as soon as faced. Moreover, as every student of the history of
          exegesis and criticism knows, they are a progressively vanishing
          quantity. Those which seemed most obvious and intractable a generation
          or two ago, remain to-day as only too readily forgotten warnings
          against the ineradicable and inordinate dogmatism of the opponents of
          the inerrancy of the Bible, who over-ride continually every canon of
          historical and critical caution in their eager violence against the
          doctrine that they assail. What scorn they expressed of "apologists"
          who doubted whether Luke was certainly in error in assigning a
          "pro-consul" to Cyprus, whether he was in error in making Lysanias a
          contemporary tetrarch with the Herodian rulers, and the like. How
          easily that scorn is forgotten as the progress of discovery has one by
          one vindicated the assertions of the Biblical historians. The matter
          has come to such a pass, indeed, in the progress of discovery, that
          there is a sense in which it may be said that the doctrine of the
          inerrancy of the Bible can now be based, with considerable confidence,
          on its observed "phenomena." What marvelous accuracy is characteristic
          of its historians! Dr. Fisher, in a paper already referred to, invites
          his readers to read Archibald Forbes' article in the Nineteenth
          Century for March, 1892, on "Napoleon the Third at Sedan," that they
          may gain some idea of how the truth of history as to the salient facts
          may be preserved amid "hopeless and bewildering discrepancies in
          regard to details," in the reports of the most trustworthy
          eyewitnesses. The article is instructive in this regard. And it is
          instructive in another regard also. What a contrast exists between
          this mass of "hopeless and bewildering discrepancies in regard to
          details," among the accounts of a single important transaction,
          written by careful and watchful eye-witnesses, who were on the ground
          for the precise purpose of gathering the facts for report, and who
          were seeking to give an exact and honest account of the events which
          they witnessed, and the marvelous accuracy of the Biblical writers! If
          these "hopeless and bewildering discrepancies" are consistent with the
          honesty and truthfulness and general trustworthiness of the uninspired
          writers, may it not be argued that the so much greater accuracy
          attained by the Biblical writers when describing not one event but the
          history of ages - and a history filled with pitfalls for the unwary -
          has something more than honesty and truthfulness behind it, and
          warrants the attribution to them of something more than general
          trustworthiness? And, if in the midst of this marvel of general
          accuracy there remain here and there a few difficulties as yet not
          fully explained in harmony with it, or if in the course of the
          historical vindication of it in general a rare difficulty (as in the
          case of some of the statements of Daniel) seems to increase in
          sharpness, are we to throw ourselves with desperate persistency into
          these "last ditches" and strive by our increased msistence upon the
          impregnability of them to conceal from men that the main army has been
          beaten from the field? Is it not more reasonable to suppose that these
          difficulties, too, will receive their explanation with advancing
          knowledge? And is it not the height of the unreasonable to treat them
          like the Sibylline books as of ever-increasing importance in
          proportion to their decreasing number? The importance of keeping in
          mind that there is a presumption against the reality of these
          "inconsistent phenomena," and that the presumption is of a weight
          measurable only by the weight of evidence which vindicates the general
          trustworthiness of the Bible as a teacher of doctrine, does not arise
          from the need of so great a presumption in order to overcome the
          weight of the alleged opposing facts. Those facts are not specially
          numerous, important or intractable, and they are, in the progress of
          research, a vanishing quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance of keeping in mind the principle in question arises
          rather from the importance of preserving a correct logical method.
          There are two ways of approaching the study of the inspiration of the
          Bible. One proceeds by obtaining first the doctrine of inspiration
          taught by the Bible as applicable to itself, and then testing this
          doctrine by the facts as to the Bible as ascertained by Biblical
          criticism and exegesis. This is good logical procedure; and in the
          presence of a vast mass of evidence for the general trustworthiness of
          the Biblical writings as witnesses of doctrine, and for the
          appointment of their writers as teachers of divine truth to men, and
          for the presence of the Holy Spirit with and in them aiding them in
          their teaching (in whatever degree and with whatever effect) - it
          would seem to be the only logical and proper mode of approaching the
          question. The other method proceeds by seeking the doctrine of
          inspiration in the first instance through a comprehensive induction
          from the facts as to the structure and contents of the Bible, as
          ascertained by critical and exegetical processes, treating all these
          facts as co-factors of the same rank for the induction. If in this
          process the facts of structure and the facts embedded in the record of
          Scripture - which are called, onesidedly indeed but commonly, by the
          class of writers who adopt this procedure, "the phenomena" of
          Scripture - alone are considered, it would be difficult to arrive at a
          precise doctrine of inspiration, at the best: though, as we have
          already pointed out, a degree and kind of accuracy might be vindicated
          for the Scriptures which might lead us to suspect and to formulate as
          the best account of it, some divine assistance to the writers' memory,
          mental processes and expression. If the Biblical facts and teaching
          are taken as co-factors in the induction, the procedure (as we have
          already pointed out) is liable to the danger of modifying the teaching
          by the facts without clear recognition of what is being done; the
          result of which would be the loss from observation of one main fact of
          errancy, viz., the inaccuracy of the teaching of the Scriptures as to
          their own inspiration. This would vitiate the whole result: and this
          vitiation of the result can be avoided only by ascertaining separately
          the teaching of Scripture as to its own inspiration, and by accounting
          the results of this ascertainment one of the facts of the induction.
          Then we are in a position to judge by the comparison of this fact with
          the other facts, whether this fact of teaching is in accord or in
          disaccord with those facts of performance. If it is in disaccord, then
          of course this disaccord is the main factor in the case: the writers
          are convicted of false teaching. If it is in accord, then, if the
          teaching is not proved by the accord, it is at least left credible,
          and may be believed with whatever confidence may be justified by the
          evidence which goes to show that these writers are trustworthy as
          deliverers of doctrine. And if nice and difficult questions arise in
          the comparison of the fact of teaching with the facts of performance,
          it is inevitable that the relative weight of the evidence for the
          trustworthiness of the two sets of facts should be the deciding factor
          in determining the truth. This is as much as to say that the asserted
          facts as to performance must give way before the fact as to teaching,
          unless the evidence on which they are based as facts outweighs the
          evidence on which the teaching may be accredited as true. But this
          correction of the second method of procedure, by which alone it can be
          made logical in form or valid in result, amounts to nothing less than
          setting it aside altogether and reverting to the first method,
          according to which the teaching of Scripture is first to be
          determined, and then this teaching to be tested by the facts of
          performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance of proceeding according to the true logical method may
          be illustrated by the observation that the conclusions actually
          arrived at by students of the subject seem practically to depend on
          the logical method adopted. In fact, the difference here seems mainly
          a difference in point of view. If we start from the Scripture doctrine
          of inspiration, we approach the phenomena with the question whether
          they will negative this doctrine, and we find none able to stand
          against it, commended to us as true, as it is, by the vast mass of
          evidence available to prove the trustworthiness of the Scriptural
          writers as teachers of doctrine. But if we start simply with a
          collection of the phenomena, classifying and reasoning from them,
          whether alone or in conjunction with the Scriptural statements, it may
          easily happen with us, as it happened with certain of old, that
          meeting with some things hard to be understood, we may be ignorant and
          unstable enough to wrest them to our own intellectual destruction, and
          so approach the Biblical doctrine of inspiration set upon explaining
          it away. The value of having the Scripture doctrine as a clue in our
          hands, is thus fairly illustrated by the ineradicable inability of the
          whole negative school to distinguish between difficulties and proved
          errors. If then we ask what we are to do with the numerous phenomena
          of Scripture inconsistent with verbal inspiration, which, so it is
          alleged, "criticism" has brought to light, we must reply: Challenge
          them in the name of the New Testament doctrine, and ask for their
          credentials. They have no credentials that can stand before that
          challenge. No single error has as yet been demonstrated to occur in
          the Scriptures as given by God to His Church. And every critical
          student knows, as already pointed out, that the progress of
          investigation has been a continuous process of removing difficulties,
          until scarcely a shred of the old list of "Biblical Errors" remains to
          hide the nakedness of this moribund contention. To say that we do not
          wish to make claims "for which we have only this to urge, that they
          cannot be absolutely disproved," is not to the point; what is to the
          point is to say, that we cannot set aside the presumption arising from
          the general trustworthiness of Scripture, that its doctrine of
          inspiration is true, by any array of contradictory facts, each one of
          which is fairly disputable. We must have indisputable errors - which
          are not forthcoming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real problem brought before the Churches by the present debate
          ought now to be sufficiently plain. In its deepest essence it is
          whether we can still trust the Bible as a guide in doctrine, as a
          teacher of truth. It is not simply whether we can explain away the
          Biblical doctrine of inspiration so as to allow us to take a different
          view from what has been common of the structure and characteristics of
          the Bible. Nor, on the other hand, is it simply whether we may easily
          explain the facts, established as facts, embedded in Scripture,
          consistently with the teaching of Scripture as to the nature, extent
          and effects of inspiration. It is specifically whether the results
          proclaimed by a special school of Biblical criticism - which are of
          such a character, as is now admitted by all, as to necessitate, if
          adopted, a new view of the Bible and of its inspiration - rest on a
          basis of evidence strong enough to meet and overcome the weight of
          evidence, whatever that may be in kind and amount, which goes to show
          that the Biblical writers are trustworthy as teachers of doctrine. If
          we answer this question in the affirmative, then no doubt we shall
          have not only a new view of the Bible and of its inspiration but also
          a whole new theology, because we must seek a new basis for doctrine.
          But if we answer it in the negative, we may possess our souls in
          patience and be assured that the Scriptures are as trustworthy
          witnesses to truth when they declare a doctrine of Inspiration as when
          they declare a doctrine of Incarnation or of Redemption, even though
          in the one case as in the other difficulties may remain, the full
          explanation of which is not yet clear to us. The real question, in a
          word, is not a new question but the perennial old question, whether
          the basis of our doctrine is to be what the Bible teaches, or what men
          teach. And this is a question which is to be settled on the old
          method, viz., on our estimate of the weight and value of the evidence
          which places the Bible in our hands as a teacher of doctrine.

          imply that there are none who assert that the results of this type of
          criticism leave "inspiration" untouched. Dr. Driver does not stand
          alone when he says, in the Preface to his "Introduction to the
          Literature of the Old Testament": "Criticism in the hands of Christian
          scholars does not banish or destroy the inspiration of the Old
          Testament; it presupposes it" (p. xix). But Prof. Driver would be the
          last to maintain that the "inspiration" which criticism leaves to the
          Old Testament is what the Church has understood by the plenary
          inspiration of the Bible. Accordingly, Prof. Robertson speaks directly
          to the point when he remarks in the Preface to his "Early Religion of
          Israel" (p. xi), that "such scholars would do an invaluable service to
          the Church, at the present time, if they would explain what they mean
          by inspiration in this connection." The efforts to do this, on our
          side of the water, are not reassuring. On the relation of the new
          views to inspiration see the lucid statement by Dr. E. C. Bissell in
          The Hartford Seminary Record, n. 1.

          language employed by Him, was His estimate of the Old Testament
          Scripture? It will be observed that He does not single out the passage
          on which He bases His argument, and testify of it that it is
          unbreakable, making its infallibility depend on His authority. Stated
          formally, His argument is as follows: Major - The Scripture cannot be
          broken. Minor - 'I said ye are God's,' is written in your law, which
          is Scripture. Conclusion - 'I said ye are God's' cannot be broken....
          He argues the infallibility of the clause on which He founds His
          argument from the infallibility of the record in which it occurs.

          and his own colleague Godet, is able to teach that "by reason of the
          relation which unites the intelligence with the will," our Lord must
          needs be free not only from sin, but also from all error (Expos√© de
          Theol. Syst., iv. 288). Tholuck occupied a position similar to
          Rothe's; yet he reminds us that: "Proofs might be brought to show
          that, even in questions pertaining to learned exegesis" - which are
          such as our Lord needed to learn as a man - "such as those concerning
          the historical connection of a passage, the author and age of a book,
          an original spiritual discernment without the culture of the schools
          may often divine the truth" ("Citations of the Old Testament in the
          New," tr. in Bibliotheca Sacra, xi. p. 615).

          <a id="fn-1" href="#fnref-1">47.</a> On the contrary these writers
          usually minimize the Biblical definition of inspiration. Thus Dr.
          Marvin R. Vincent, who is immediately to be quoted (op. c. p. 15),
          tells us "Scripture does not define the nature and extent of its own
          inspiration. The oft-quoted passage of II Tim. iii. 16 really gives us
          no light on that point . . . The passage does indeed point out certain
          effects which attend the use of inspired writings . . . But after all,
          we are no nearer than ever to an answer to the question, What is
          inspiration? . . . So that we must fall back on the facts, on the
          phenomena of the Bible as we have it." But the deck is not cleared by
          such remarks; after all, Paul does assert something by calling the
          Scriptures Theopneustic, and what the thing is that he asserts in the
          use of this predicate, is not discoverable from an examination into
          what the Scriptures are, but only by an examination into what Paul
          means; but what Paul understands by theopneustic, Dr. Vincent makes no
          effort to investigate. This whole procedure is typical. Thus, for
          example, the Rev. J. Paterson Smyth, in his recent book, "How God
          Inspired the Bible" (p. 64), proceeds in an exactly similar manner.
          "Our theory of inspiration must be learned from the facts presented in
          the Bible, and in order to be correct it must be consistent with all
          these facts . . . I want to find out what I can about inspiration. God
          has nowhere revealed to me exactly what it is. He has told me it is a
          divine influence, an in-breathing of the Holy Ghost on the spirit of
          the ancient writers. But I cannot tell how much that means or what
          effects I should expect from it. I have, therefore, no way of finding
          out except by examining the phenomena presented by the Bible itself."
          This method amounts simply to discarding the guidance of the doctrine
          of Scripture in favor of our own doctrine founded on our examination
          of the nature of Scripture. Mr. Smyth cannot close his eyes to certain
          outstanding facts on the surface of Scripture, indicatory of the
          doctrine as to Scripture held by the Biblical writers (pp. 36 and
          106), though he makes no effort to collect and estimate all such
          phenomena. And when he realizes that some may be affected even by his
          meagre statement of them so far as to say that "the strong expressions
          just here quoted from some of the Bible writers, and even from our
          Lord Himself, convince me that the theory of verbal inspiration is
          most probably true," he has only such an answer as the following:
          "Well, reader, you will find a good many thoughtful people disagreeing
          with you. Why? Because, while fully receiving these arguments as a
          proof of God's inspiration of the Bible, they have looked a little
          further than the surface to judge how much God's inspiration implies,
          and they cannot believe from their examination of Scripture that it
          implies what is known as verbal inspiration" (p. 109). Mr. Smyth means
          by "verbal inspiration" the theory of mechanical dictation. But
          putting that aside as a man of straw, what it is difficult for us to
          understand is how "thoughtful people" can frame a theory of
          inspiration after only such shallow investigation of the Scriptural
          doctrine of inspiration, and how "thoughtful people" can assign their
          inability to believe a doctrine, an inability based on their own
          conception of what Scripture is, as any proof that that doctrine is
          not taught by the "strong expressions" of the Bible writers and the
          Lord Himself. Is it any more rationalistic to correct the Scriptural
          doctrine of the origin of the universe from our investigations of the
          nature of things, than it is to correct the Scriptural doctrine of
          inspiration from our investigations of the nature of Scripture?

          <a id="fn-1" href="#fnref-1">56.</a> How important and valuable this
          element of the Christian faith is, it is not the purpose of this paper
          to point out. Let it suffice here to say briefly that it is (1) the
          element which gives detailed certitude to the delivery of doctrine in
          the New Testament, and (2) the element by which the individual
          Christian is brought into immediate relation to God in the revelation
          of truth through the prophets and apostles. The importance of these
          factors in the Christian life could not be overstated. The importance
          of the recognition of plenary inspiration to the preservation of sound
          doctrine is negatively illustrated by the progress of Rationalism, as
          thus outlined briefly by Dr. Charles Hodge ("Syst. Theol.," iii. p.
          195): "Those who admitted the divine origin of the Scriptures got rid
          of its distinctive doctrines by the adoption of a low theory of
          inspiration and by the application of arbitrary principles of
          interpretation. Inspiration was in the first instance confined to the
          religious teachings of the Bible, then to the ideas or truths, but not
          to the form in which they were presented, nor to the arguments by
          which they were supported . . . In this way a wet sponge was passed
          over all the doctrines of redemption and their outlines obliterated."
          It looks as if the Church were extremely slow in reading the most
          obvious lessons of history.

          protest against the misuse of it, which, in the exigencies of the
          present controversy, has been made, as if Dr. Hodge was in this

          occurs in the reply to objections to the doctrine, not in the

          reality of error in the original Biblical text may be estimated from
          the frequency with which he asserts its freedom from error in the
