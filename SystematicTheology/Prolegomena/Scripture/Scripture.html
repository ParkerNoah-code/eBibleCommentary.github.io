        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>CANON</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Old Testament:</b> Those books, and those only, which Christ and
          his Apostles recognized as the written Word of God, are entitled to be
          regarded as canonical. This recognition was afforded in a twofold
          manner:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, many of the books of the Old Testament are quoted as the Word
          of God, as being given by the Spirit; or the Spirit is said to have
          uttered what is therein recorded. Secondly, Christ and his Apostles
          refer to the sacred writings of the Jews—the volume which they
          regarded as divine—as being what it claimed to be, the Word of God.
          When we refer to the Bible as of divine authority, we refer to it as a
          volume and recognize all the writings which it contains as given by
          the inspiration of the Spirit. In like manner when Christ or his
          Apostles quote the "Scriptures," or the "law and the prophets," and
          speak of the volume then so called, they give their sanction to the
          divine authority of all the books which that volume contained.
        </p>
        <p>
          All, therefore, that is necessary to determine for Christians the
          canon of the Old Testament, is to ascertain what books were included
          in the "Scriptures" recognized by the Jews of that period. This is a
          point about which there is no reasonable doubt. The Jewish canon of
          the Old Testament included all the books and no others, which
          Protestants now recognize as constituting the Old Testament
          Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Apocrypha:</b> These were not written in Hebrew and were not
          included in the canon of the Jews. They were, therefore, not
          recognized by Christ as the Word of God. On this ground Protestants
          reject the so-called apocryphal books. This reason is of itself
          sufficient. It is however confirmed by considerations drawn from the
          character of the books themselves. They abound in errors, and in
          statements contrary to those found in the undoubtedly canonical books.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>New Testament:</b> The principle on which the canon of the New
          Testament is determined is equally simple. Those books, and those only
          which can be proved to have been written by the Apostles, or to have
          received their sanction, are to be recognized as of divine authority.
          The reason of this rule is obvious. The Apostles were the duly
          authenticated messengers of Christ, of whom He said, "The one who
          hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me" (Lk 10:16
          ESV).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Establishment:</b> In this affair, the Church is a servant and not
          a mistress; a depositary and not a judge. She exercises the office of
          a minister, not of a magistrate, ministerium non magisterium. She
          delivers a testimony, not a judicial sentence. She discerns the canon
          of the Scriptures, she does not make it; she has recognised their
          authenticity, she has not given it. And as the men of Sichem believed
          in Jesus Christ by means of the impure but penitent woman who called
          them to him, we say to the Church: "Now we believe, not because of thy
          saying; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed
          the Christ, the Saviour of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have believed, then, through her means, not on her account. We
          found her on her knees; she showed us her Master; we recognised him,
          and we knelt down along with her. Were I to mingle in the rear of an
          imperial army, and should I ask those around me to show me their
          prince, they would do with respect to him, for me, what the Church has
          done with regard to the Scriptures. They would not call their regiment
          the ecumenical army; they would not say that the emperor has no
          authority but what is derived from its testimony. The authority of the
          Scriptures is not founded, then, on the authority of the Church: it is
          the Church that is founded on the authority of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Finality</b>: The Scripture is a full and perfect canon, containing
          in it all things necessary to salvation. ‘From a child thou hast known
          the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation’
          (2 Tim 3:15). It shows what we are to believe and what we are to
          practise. It gives us an exact model of religion, and perfectly
          instructs us in the deep things of God. By the scriptures, we receive
          'the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints' (Jude 3).
          ‘If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
          plagues that are written in this book’ (Rev 22:18).
        </p>
        <h2>ATTRIBUTES</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Inspiration:</b> Inspiration is a result of the influence of the
          Holy Spirit on the minds of certain select men, which rendered them
          the organs of God for the infallible communication of his mind and
          will. They were in such a sense the organs of God, that what they said
          God said. The infallibility and divine authority of the Scriptures are
          due to the fact that they are the word of God; and they are the word
          of God because they were given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Infallibility:</b> Scripture is "God-breathed" (2 Tim. 3:16) and
          the Word of God cannot lie (Ps. 19:8-9; Heb.6:18), it cannot perish
          and pass away (Matt. 5:18), it abides forever (I Peter 1:25), and it
          is truth itself (John 17:17). This could not be predicated of it if
          there were contradictions, and if God had allowed the sacred writers
          either to err and to forget, or to introduce deceit into it. It
          follows that whatever contradictions seem to be in Scripture are
          apparent but not real. They appear only with respect to the
          understanding of us who are not able to perceive and grasp everywhere
          their harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Preservation:</b> Although we attribute absolute integrity to
          Scripture, we do not hold that the copyists and printers have been
          inspired. The basis of the purity and integrity of the sources does
          not rest on the inerrancy of human beings but on the providence of
          God, who, although the men who copied the sacred works could have
          introduced many errors, always carefully looked after them to correct
          them, or else they can be corrected by comparison with Scripture
          itself or with better codices. Scripture far surpasses all other books
          of antiquity whatsoever in purity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Authority:</b> Whether, as a rule of faith, of duty, or of hope,
          the authority of the Bible is supreme. We may rely on the testimony of
          men, but they sometimes deceive us. We may regulate our conduct by the
          command of those who are over us, or by the dictates of our own
          conscience, but rulers may command what is wrong, and conscience is
          not infallible. We may cherish hopes founded on human promises, or the
          natural tendencies of things, but human promises are often delusive,
          and the promises of Nature are buds which, however beautiful and
          fragrant, are often blasted before they produce fruit. God never
          deceives. "The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away,
          but the word of the Lord endureth forever" (1 Pet 1:24-25). When the
          Bible speaks, all else may be silent, and its decisions leave no room
          for doubt and admit no appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authority of the Bible is immediate. Its address is directly from
          God, and directly to the mind and heart of every individual reader. We
          have no mediator but Christ, and no infallible interpreter but the
          Holy Spirit. We may derive assistance from men in understanding the
          Bible, but they have no right to understand it for us. We should
          employ our own minds in the study of God's Word, and allow no human
          interpreter to intervene between God and our own conscience. We should
          say, each one for himself, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth" (1
          Sam 3:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Clarity:</b> The Bible is a plain book. It is intelligible by the
          people. And they have the right, and are bound to read and interpret
          it for themselves; so that their faith may rest on the testimony of
          the Scriptures, and not on that of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not denied that the Scriptures contain many things hard to be
          understood; that they require diligent study; that all men need the
          guidance of the Holy Spirit in order to right knowledge and true
          faith. But it is maintained that in all things necessary to salvation
          they are sufficiently plain to be understood even by the unlearned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Necessity:</b> While the natural world provides evidence of God's
          existence and attributes, it is not sufficient to guide humanity to a
          proper understanding of God and salvation. Scripture is therefore
          necessary to show us the way of salvation and to safeguard against the
          pitfalls of speculative and false beliefs, offering a reliable and
          authoritative source of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sufficiency:</b> Paul says that all Scripture is inspired by God,
          and useful for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in
          righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every
          good work (2 Tim. 3:16-17). Here lie a number of arguments for the
          sufficiency of Scripture. First that the sacred writings can instruct
          for salvation. Who would ask for more than that we be made capable of
          salvation? Second, it is useful for all purposes, theoretical and
          practical: for teaching faith, and for guiding conduct. Third, it can
          make the man of God complete for every good work.
        </p>
        <h2>SOLA SCRIPTURA</h2>
        <p>Scripture is the sole infallible rule for faith and practice.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Negative:</b> Sola scriptura does not pertain to knowledge outside
          of the faith and practice of the church. It is not denied that God
          reveals himself, even his eternal power and Godhead, by his works, and
          has done so from the beginning of the world. But all the truths thus
          revealed are clearly made known in his written Word. Nor is it denied
          that there may have been, and probably were, books written by inspired
          men, which are no longer in existence. Much less is it denied that
          Christ and his Apostles delivered many discourses which were not
          recorded, and which, could they now be known and authenticated, would
          be of equal authority with the books now regarded as canonical.
          Neither is it denied that there can be other rules or sources of
          knowledge such as tradition, confessions and councils; only it is
          recognized that they don't have equal authority with Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Positive:</b> All that Protestants insist upon is that the Bible
          contains all the extant revelations of God which He designed to be the
          rule of faith and practice for his Church; so that nothing can
          rightfully be imposed on the consciences of men as truth or duty which
          is not taught directly or by necessary implication in the Holy
          Scriptures. This excludes all unwritten traditions and decrees of the
          visible Church; all resolutions of conventions, or other public
          bodies, declaring this or that to be right or wrong, true or false.
