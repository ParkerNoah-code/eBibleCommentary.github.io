          V. Principles of Historical Evidence applicable to the Proof of a
          Divine Revelation
        </h2>
        <p>
          V. Principles of Historical Evidence applicable to the Proof of a
          Divine Revelation (mainly derived from Greenleaf, Testimony of the
          Evangelists, and from Starkie on Evidence).
        </p>
        <p>1. As to documentary evidence.</p>
        <p>
          (a) Documents apparently ancient, not bearing upon their face the
          marks of forgery, and found in proper custody, are presumed to be
          genuine until sufficient evidence is brought to the contrary. The New
          Testament documents, since they are found in the custody of the
          church, their natural and legitimate depository, must by this rule be
          presumed to be genuine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian documents were not found, like the Book of Mormon, in a
          cave, or in the custody of angels. Martineau, Seat of Authority,
          322—“The Mormon prophet, who cannot tell God from devil close at hand,
          is well up with the history of both worlds, and commissioned to get
          ready the second promised land.” Washington Gladden, Who wrote the
          Bible?—“An angel appeared to Smith and told him where he would find
          this book; he went to the spot designated and found in a stone box a
          volume six inches thick, composed of thin gold plates, eight inches by
          seven, held together by three gold rings; these plates were covered
          with writing, in the ‘Reformed Egyptian tongue’; with this book were
          the ‘Urim and Thummim’, a pair of supernatural spectacles, by means of
          which he was able to read and translate this ‘Reformed Egyptian’
          language.” Sagebeer, The Bible in Court, 113—“If the ledger of a
          business firm has always been received and regarded as a ledger, its
          value is not at all impeached if it is impossible to tell which
          particular clerk kept this ledger.…The epistle to the Hebrews would be
          no less valuable as evidence, if shown not to have been written by
          Paul.” See Starkie on Evidence, 480 sq.; Chalmers, Christian
          Revelation, in Works, 3:147–171.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Copies of ancient documents, made by those most interested in
          their faithfulness, are presumed to correspond with the originals,
          even although those originals no longer exist. Since it was the
          church’s interest to have faithful copies, the burden of proof rests
          upon the objector to the Christian documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the evidence of a copy of its own records, the originals having
          been lost, the House of Lords decided a claim to the peerage; see
          Starkie on Evidence, 51. There is no manuscript of Sophocles earlier
          than the tenth century, while at least two manuscripts of the N. T. go
          back to the fourth century. Frederick George Kenyon, Handbook to
          Textual Criticism of N. T.: “We owe our knowledge of most of the great
          works of Greek and Latin literature—Æschylus, Sophocles, Thucydides,
          Horace, Lucretius, Tacitus, and many more—to manuscripts written from
          900 to 1500 years after their authors’ deaths; while of the N. T. we
          have two excellent and approximately complete copies at an interval of
          only 250 years. Again, of the classical writers we have as a rule only
          a few score of copies (often less), of which one or two stand out as
          decisively superior to all the rest; but of the N. T. we have more
          than 3000 copies (besides a very large number of versions), and many
          of these have distinct and independent value.” The mother of
          Tischendorf named him Lobgott, because her fear that her babe would be
          born blind had not come true. No man ever had keener sight than he. He
          spent his life in deciphering old manuscripts which other eyes could
          not read. The Sinaitic manuscript which he discovered takes us back
          within three centuries of the time of the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) In determining matters of fact, after the lapse of considerable
          time, documentary evidence is to be allowed greater weight than oral
          testimony. Neither memory nor tradition can long be trusted to give
          absolutely correct accounts of particular facts. The New Testament
          documents, therefore, are of greater weight in evidence than tradition
          would be, even if only thirty years had elapsed since the death of the
          actors in the scenes they relate.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Starkie on Evidence, 51, 730. The Roman Catholic Church, in its
          legends of the saints, shows how quickly mere tradition can become
          corrupt. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, yet sermons
          preached to-day on the anniversary of his birth make him out to be
          Unitarian, Universalist, or Orthodox, according as the preacher
          himself believes.
        </p>
        <p>2. As to testimony in general.</p>
        <p>
          (a) In questions as to matters of fact, the proper inquiry is not
          whether it is possible that the testimony may be false, but whether
          there is sufficient probability that it is true. It is unfair,
          therefore, to allow our examination of the Scripture witnesses to be
          prejudiced by suspicion, merely because their story is a sacred one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There must be no prejudice against, there must be open-mindedness to,
          truth; there must be a normal aspiration after the signs of
          communication from God. Telepathy, forty days fasting,
          parthenogenesis, all these might once have seemed antecedently
          incredible. Now we see that it would have been more rational to admit
          their existence on presentation of appropriate evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) A proposition of fact is proved when its truth is established by
          competent and satisfactory evidence. By competent evidence is meant
          such evidence as the nature of the thing to be proved admits. By
          satisfactory evidence is meant that amount of proof which ordinarily
          satisfies an unprejudiced mind beyond a reasonable doubt. Scripture
          facts are therefore proved when they are established by that kind and
          degree of evidence which would in the affairs of ordinary life satisfy
          the mind and conscience of a common man. When we have this kind and
          degree of evidence it is unreasonable to require more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In matters of morals and religion competent evidence need not be
          mathematical or even logical. The majority of cases in criminal courts
          are decided upon evidence that is circumstantial. We do not determine
          our choice of friends or of partners in life by strict processes of
          reasoning. The heart as well as the head must be permitted a voice,
          and competent evidence includes considerations arising from the moral
          needs of the soul. The evidence, moreover, does not require to be
          demonstrative. Even a slight balance of probability, when nothing more
          certain is attainable, may suffice to constitute rational proof and to
          bind our moral action.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) In the absence of circumstances which generate suspicion, every
          witness is to be presumed credible, until the contrary is shown; the
          burden of impeaching his testimony lying upon the objector. The
          principle which leads men to give true witness to facts is stronger
          than that which leads them to give false witness. It is therefore
          unjust to compel the Christian to establish the credibility of his
          witnesses before proceeding to adduce their testimony, and it is
          equally unjust to allow the uncorroborated testimony of a profane
          writer to outweigh that of a Christian writer. Christian witnesses
          should not be considered interested, and therefore untrustworthy; for
          they became Christians against their worldly intrests, and because
          they could not resist the force of testimony. Varying accounts among
          them should be estimated as we estimate the varying accounts of
          profane writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          John’s account of Jesus differs from that of the synoptic gospels; but
          in a very similar manner, and probably for a very similar reason,
          Plato’s account of Socrates differs from that of Xenophon. Each saw
          and described that side of his subject which he was by nature best
          fitted to comprehend,—compare the Venice of Canaletto with the Venice
          of Turner, the former the picture of an expert draughtsman, the latter
          the vision of a poet who sees the palaces of the Doges glorified by
          air and mist and distance. In Christ there was a “hiding of his power”
          (Hab_3:4); “how small a whisper do we hear of him!” (Job_26:14); he,
          rather than Shakespeare, is “the myriad-minded”; no one evangelist can
          be expected to know or describe him except “in part” (1Co_13:12).
          Frances Power Cobbe, Life, 2:402—“All of us human beings resemble
          diamonds, in having several distinct facets to our characters; and, as
          we always turn one of these to one person and another to another,
          there is generally some fresh side to be seen in a particularly
          brilliant gem.” E. P. Tenney, Coronation, 45—“The secret and powerful
          life he [the hero of the story] was leading was like certain solitary
          streams, deep, wide, and swift, which run unseen through vast and
          unfrequented forests. So wide and varied was this man’s nature, that
          whole courses of life might thrive in its secret places,—and his
          neighbors might touch him and know him only on that side on which he
          was like them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) A slight amount of positive testimony, so long as it is
          uncontradicted, outweighs a very great amount of testimony that is
          merely negative. The silence of a second witness, or his testimony
          that he did not see a certain alleged occurrence, cannot
          counterbalance the positive testimony of a first witness that he did
          see it. We should therefore estimate the silence of profane writers
          with regard to facts narrated in Scripture precisely as we should
          estimate it if the facts about which they are silent were narrated by
          other profane writers, instead of being narrated by the writers of
          Scripture.

          Egyptian monuments make no mention of the destruction of Pharaoh and
          his army; but then, Napoleon’s dispatches also make no mention of his
          defeat at Trafalgar. At the tomb of Napoleon in the Invalides of
          Paris, the walls are inscribed with names of a multitude of places
          where his battles were fought, but Waterloo, the scene of his great
          defeat, is not recorded there. So Sennacherib, in all his monuments,
          does not refer to the destruction of his army in the time of Hezekiah.
          Napoleon gathered 450,000 men at Dresden to invade Russia. At Moscow
          the soft-falling snow conquered him. In one night 20,000 horses
          perished with cold. Not without reason at Moscow, on the anniversary
          of the retreat of the French, the exultation of the prophet over the
          fall of Sennacherib is read in the churches. James Robertson, Early
          History of Israel, 395, note—“Whately, in his Historic Doubts, draws
          attention to the fact that the principal Parisian journal in 1814, on
          the very day on which the allied armies entered Paris as conquerors,
          makes no mention of any such event. The battle of Poictiers in 782,
          which effectually checked the spread of Mohammedanism across Europe,
          is not once referred to in the monastic annals of the period. Sir
          Thomas Browne lived through the Civil Wars and the Commonwealth, yet
          there is no syllable in his writings with regard to them. Sale says
          that circumcision is regarded by Mohammedans as an ancient divine
          institution, the rite having been in use many years before Mohammed,
          yet it is not so much as once mentioned in the Koran.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though we should grant that Josephus does not mention Jesus, we
          should have a parallel in Thucydides, who never once mentions
          Socrates, the most important character of the twenty years embraced in
          his history. Wieseler, however, in Jahrbuch f. d. Theologie, 23:98,
          maintains the essential genuineness of the commonly rejected passage
          with regard to Jesus in Josephus, Antiq., 18:3:3, omitting, however,
          as interpolations, the phrases: “if it be right to call him man”;
          “this was the Christ”; “he appeared alive the third day according to
          prophecy”; for these, if genuine, would prove Josephus a Christian,
          which he, by all ancient accounts, was not. Josephus lived from a.d.
          34 to possibly 114. He does elsewhere speak of Christ; for he records
          (20:9:1) that Albinus “assembled the Sanhedrim of judges, and brought
          before them the brother of Jesus who was called Christ, whose name was
          James, and some others … and denlivered them to be stoned.” See
          Niese’s new edition of Josephus; also a monograph on the subject by
          Gustav Adolph Müller, published at Innsbruck, 1890. Rush Rhees, Life
          of Jesus of Nazareth, 22—“To mention Jesus more fully would have
          required some approval of his life and teaching. This would have been
          a condemnation of his own people whom he desired to commend to Gentile
          regard, and he seems to have taken the cowardly course of silence
          concerning a matter more noteworthy, for that generation, than much
          else of which he writes very fully.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) “The credit due to the testimony of witnesses depends upon: first,
          their ability; secondly, their honesty; thirdly, their number and the
          consistency of their testimony; fourthly, the conformity of their
          testimony with experience; and fifthly, the coincidence of their
          testimony with collateral circumstances.” We confidently submit the
          New Testament witnesses to each and all of these tests.
