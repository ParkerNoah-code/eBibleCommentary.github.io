        <h2>III. Miracles, as attesting a Divine Revelation</h2>
        <p>1. Definition of Miracle.</p>
        <p>
          A. Preliminary Definition.—A miracle is an event palpable to the
          senses, produced for a religious purpose by the immediate agency of
          God; an event therefore which, though not contravening any law of
          nature, the laws of nature, if fully known, would not without this
          agency of God be competent to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This definition corrects several erroneous conceptions of the
          miracle:—(a) A miracle is not a suspension or violation of natural
          law; since natural law is in operation at the time of the miracle just
          as much as before. (b) A miracle is not a sudden product of natural
          agencies—a product merely foreseen, by him who appears to work it; it
          is the effect of a will outside of nature. (c) A miracle is not an
          event without a cause; since it has for its cause a direct volition of
          God. (d) A miracle is not an irrational or capricious act of God; but
          an act of wisdom, performed in accordance with the immutable laws of
          his being, so that in the same circumstances the same course would be
          again pursued. (e) A miracle is not contrary to experience; since it
          is not contrary to experience for a new cause to be followed by a new
          effect. (f) A miracle is not a matter of internal experience, like
          regeneration or illumination; but is an event palpable to the senses,
          which may serve as an objective proof to all that the worker of it is
          divinely commissioned as a religious teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          For various definitions of miracles, see Alexander, Christ and
          Christianity, 302. On the whole subject, see Mozley, Miracles;
          Christlieb, Mod. Doubt and Christ. Belief, 285–339; Fisher, in
          Princeton Rev., Nov. 1880, and Jan. 1881; A. H. Strong, Philosophy and
          Religion, 129–147, and in Baptist Review, April, 1879. The definition
          given above is intended simply as a definition of the miracles of the
          Bible, or, in other words, of the events which profess to attest a
          divine revelation in the Scriptures. The New Testament designates
          these events in a two-fold way, viewing them either subjectively, as
          producing effects upon men, or objectively, as revealing the power and
          wisdom of God. In the former aspect they are called τέρατα, ‘wonders,’
          and σημεῖα ‘signs,’ (Joh_4:48; Act_2:22). In the latter aspect they
          are called δυνάμεις, ‘powers,’ and ἔργα ‘works,’ (Mat_7:22;
          Joh_14:11). See H. B. Smith, Lect. on Apologetics, 90–116, esp.
          94—“σημεῖον, sign, marking the purpose or object, the moral end,
          placing the event in connection with revelation.” The Bible Union
          Version uniformly and properly renders τέρας by ‘wonder,’ δυνάμις by
          ‘miracle,’ ἔργον by ‘work,’ and σημεῖον by ‘sign.’ Goethe, Faust:
          “Alles Vergängliche ist nur ein Gleichniss: Das Unzulängliche wird
          hier Ereigniss”—“Everything transitory is but a parable; The
          unattainable appears as solid fact.” So the miracles of the New
          Testament are acted parables,—Christ opens the eyes of the blind to
          show that he is the Light of the world, multiplies the loaves to show
          that he is the Bread of Life, and raises the dead to show that he
          lifts men up from the death of trespasses and sins. See Broadus on
          Matthew, 175.
        </p>
        <p>
          A modification of this definition of the miracle, however, is demanded
          by a large class of Christian physicists, in the supposed interest of
          natural law. Such a modification is proposed by Babbage, in the Ninth
          Bridgewater Treatise, chap. viii. Babbage illustrates the miracle by
          the action of his calculating machine, which would present to the
          observer in regular succession the series of units from one to ten
          million, but which would then make a leap and show, not ten million
          and one, but a hundred million; Ephraim Peabody illustrates the
          miracle from the cathedral clock which strikes only once in a hundred
          years; yet both these results are due simply to the original
          construction of the respective machines. Bonnet held this view; see
          Dorner, Glaubenslehre, 1:591, 592; Eng. translation, 2:155, 156; so
          Matthew Arnold, quoted in Bruce, Miraculous Element in Gospels, 52;
          see also A. H. Strong, Philosophy and Religion, 129–147. Babbage and
          Peabody would deny that the miracle is due to the direct and immediate
          agency of God, and would regard it as belonging to a higher order of
          nature. God is the author of the miracle only in the sense that he
          instituted the laws of nature at the beginning and provided that at
          the appropriate time miracle should be their outcome. In favor of this
          view it has been claimed that it does not dispense with the divine
          working, but only puts it further back at the origination of the
          system, while it still holds God’s work to be essential, not only to
          the upholding of the system, but also to the inspiring of the
          religious teacher or leader with the knowledge needed to predict the
          unusual working of the system. The wonder is confined to the prophecy,
          which may equally attest a divine revelation. See Matheson, in
          Christianity and Evolution, 1–26.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is plain that a miracle of this sort lacks to a large degree
          the element of ‘signality’ which is needed, if it is to accomplish its
          purpose. It surrenders the great advantage which miracle, as first
          defined, possessed over special providence, as an attestation of
          revelation—the advantage, namely, that while special providence
          affords some warrant that this revelation comes from God, miracle
          gives full warrant that it comes from God. Since man may by natural
          means possess himself of the knowledge of physical laws, the true
          miracle which God works, and the pretended miracle which only man
          works, are upon this theory far less easy to distinguish from each
          other: Cortez, for example, could deceive Montezuma by predicting an
          eclipse of the sun. Certain typical miracles, like the resurrection of
          Lazarus, refuse to be classed as events within the realm of nature, in
          the sense in which the term nature is ordinarily used. Our Lord,
          moreover, seems clearly to exclude such a theory as this, when he
          says: “If I by the finger of God cast out demons” (Luk_11:20);
          Mar_1:41—“I will; be thou made clean.” The view of Babbage is
          inadequate, not only because it fails to recognize any immediate
          exercise of will in the miracle, but because it regards nature as a
          mere machine which can operate apart from God—a purely deistic method
          of conception. On this view, many of the products of mere natural law
          might be called miracles. The miracle would be only the occasional
          manifestation of a higher order of nature, like the comet occasionally
          invading the solar system. William Elder, Ideas from Nature: “The
          century-plant which we have seen growing from our childhood may not
          unfold its blossoms until our old age comes upon us, but the sudden
          wonder is natural notwithstanding.” If, however, we interpret nature
          dynamically, rather than mechanically, and regard it as the regular
          working of the divine will instead of the automatic operation of a
          machine, there is much in this view which we may adopt. Miracle may be
          both natural and supernatural. We may hold, with Babbage, that it has
          natural antecedents, while at the same time we hold that it is
          produced by the immediate agency of God. We proceed therefore to an
          alternative and preferable definition, which in our judgment combines
          the merits of both that have been mentioned. On miracles as already
          defined, see Mozley, Miracles, preface, ix–xxvi, 7, 143–166; Bushnell,
          Nature and Supernatural, 333–336; Smith’s and Hastings’ Dict. of
          Bible, art.: Miracles; Abp. Temple, Bampton Lectures for 1884:193–221;
          Shedd, Dogm. Theology, 1:541, 542.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Alternative and Preferable Definition.—A miracle is an event in
          nature, so extraordinary in itself and so coinciding with the prophecy
          or command of a religious teacher or leader, as fully to warrant the
          conviction, on the part of those who witness it, that God has wrought
          it with the design of certifying that this teacher or leader has been
          commissioned by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This definition has certain marked advantages as compared with the
          preliminary definition given above:—(a) It recognizes the immanence of
          God and his immediate agency in nature, instead of assuming an
          antithesis between the laws of nature and the will of God. (b) It
          regards the miracle as simply an extraordinary act of that same God
          who is already present in all natural operations and who in them is
          revealing his general plan. (c) It holds that natural law, as the
          method of God’s regular activity, in no way precludes unique exertions
          of his power when these will best secure his purpose in creation. (d)
          It leaves it possible that all miracles may have their natural
          explanations and may hereafter be traced to natural causes, while both
          miracles and their natural causes may be only names for the one and
          self-same will of God. (e) It reconciles the claims of both science
          and religion: of science, by permitting any possible or probable
          physical antecedents of the miracle; of religion, by maintaining that
          these very antecedents together with the miracle itself are to be
          interpreted as signs of God’s special commission to him under whose
          teaching or leadership the miracle is wrought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Augustine, who declares that “Dei voluntas rerum natura est,” defines
          the miracle in De Civitate Dei, 21:8—“Portentum ergo fit non contra
          naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura.” He says also that a birth
          is more miraculous than a resurrection, because it is more wonderful
          that something that never was should begin to be, than that something
          that was and ceased to be should begin again. E. G. Robinson, Christ.
          Theology, 104—“The natural is God’s work. He originated it. There is
          no separation between the natural and the supernatural. The natural is
          supernatural. God works in everything. Every end, even though attained
          by mechanical means, is God’s end as truly as if he wrought by
          miracle.” Shaler, Interpretation of Nature, 141, regards miracle as
          something exceptional, yet under the control of natural law; the
          latent in nature suddenly manifesting itself; the revolution resulting
          from the slow accumulation of natural forces. In the Windsor Hotel
          fire, the heated and charred woodwork suddenly burst into flame. Flame
          is very different from mere heat, but it may be the result of a
          regularly rising temperature. Nature may be God’s regular action,
          miracle its unique result. God’s regular action may be entirely free,
          and yet its extraordinary result may be entirely natural. With these
          qualifications and explanations, we may adopt the statement of
          Biedermann, Dogmatik, 581–591—“Everything is miracle,—therefore faith
          sees God everywhere; Nothing is miracle,—therefore science sees God
          nowhere.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles are never considered by the Scripture writers as infractions
          of law. Bp. Southampton, Place of Miracles, 18—“The Hebrew historian
          or prophet regarded miracles as only the emergence into sensible
          experience of that divine force which was all along, though invisibly,
          controlling the course of nature.” Hastings, Bible Dictionary,
          4:117—“The force of a miracle to us, arising from our notion of law,
          would not be felt by a Hebrew, because he had no notion of natural
          law.” Psa_77:19-20—“Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great
          waters, And thy footsteps were not known”—They knew not, and we know
          not, by what precise means the deliverance was wrought, or by what
          precise track the passage through the Red Sea was effected; all we
          know is that “Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of
          Moses and Aaron.” J. M. Whiton, Miracles and Supernatural Religion:
          “The supernatural is in nature itself, at its very heart, at its very
          life; … not an outside power interfering with the course of nature,
          but an inside power vitalizing nature and operating through it.”
          Griffith-Jones, Ascent through Christ, 35—“Miracle, instead of
          spelling ‘monster’, as Emerson said, simply bears witness to some
          otherwise unknown or unrecognized aspect of the divine character.”
          Shedd, Dogm. Theol., l:533—“To cause the sun to rise and to cause
          Lazarus to rise, both demand omnipotence; but the manner in which
          omnipotence works in one instance is unlike the manner in the other.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracle is an immediate operation of God; but, since all natural
          processes are also immediate operations of God, we do not need to deny
          the use of these natural processes, so far as they will go, in
          miracle. Such wonders of the Old Testament as the overthrow of Sodom
          and Gomorrah, the partings of the Red Sea and of the Jordan, the
          calling down of fire from heaven by Elijah and the destruction of the
          army of Sennacherib, are none the less works of God when regarded as
          wrought by the use of natural means. In the New Testament Christ took
          water to make wine, and took the five loaves to make bread, just as in
          ten thousand vineyards to-day he is turning the moisture of the earth
          into the juice of the grape, and in ten thousand fields is turning
          carbon into corn. The virgin-birth of Christ may be an extreme
          instance of parthenogenesis, which Professor Loeb of Chicago has just
          demonstrated to take place in other than the lowest forms of life and
          which he believes to be possible in all. Christ’s resurrection may be
          an illustration of the power of the normal and perfect human spirit to
          take to itself a proper body, and so may be the type and prophecy of
          that great change when we too shall lay down our life and take it
          again. The scientist may yet find that his disbelief is not only
          disbelief in Christ, but also disbelief in science. All miracle may
          have its natural side, though we now are not able to discern it; and,
          if this were true, the Christian argument would not one whit be
          weakened, for still miracle would evidence the extraordinary working
          of the immanent God, and the impartation of his knowledge to the
          prophet or apostle who was his instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          This view of the miracle renders entirely unnecessary and irrational
          the treatment accorded to the Scripture narratives by some modern
          theologians. There is a credulity of scepticism, which minimizes the
          miraculous element in the Bible and treats it as mythical or
          legendary, in spite of clear evidence that it belongs to the realm of
          actual history. Pfleiderer, Philos. Relig., 1:295—“Miraculous legends
          arise in two ways, partly out of the idealizing of the real, and
          partly out of the realizing of the ideal.…Every occurrence may obtain
          for the religious judgment the significance of a sign or proof of the
          world-governing power, wisdom, justice or goodness of God.…Miraculous
          histories are a poetic realizing of religious ideas.” Pfleiderer
          quotes Goethe’s apothegm: “Miracle is faith’s dearest child.” Foster,
          Finality of the Christian Religion, 128–138—“We most honor biblical
          miraculous narratives when we seek to understand them as poesies.”
          Ritschl defines miracles as “those striking natural occurrences with
          which the experience of God’s special help is connected.” He leaves
          doubtful the bodily resurrection of Christ, and many of his school
          deny it; see Meade, Ritschl’s Place in the History of Doctrine, 11. We
          do not need to interpret Christ’s resurrection as a mere appearance of
          his spirit to the disciples. Gladden, Seven Puzzling Books, 202—“In
          the hands of perfect and spiritual man, the forces of nature are
          pliant and tractable as they are not in ours. The resurrection of
          Christ is only a sign of the superiority of the life of the perfect
          spirit over external conditions. It may be perfectly in accordance
          with nature.” Myers, Human Personality, 2:288—“I predict that, in
          consequence of the new evidence, all reasonable men, a century hence,
          will believe the resurrection of Christ.” We may add that Jesus
          himself intimates that the working of miracles is hereafter to be a
          common and natural manifestation of the new life which he imparts:
          Joh_14:12—“He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do
          also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto the
          Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We append a number of opinions, ancient and modern, with regard to
          miracles, all tending to show the need of so defining them as not to
          conflict with the just claims of science. Aristotle: “Nature is not
          full of episodes, like a bad tragedy.” Shakespeare, All’s Well that
          Ends Well, 2:3:1—“They say miracles are past; and we have our
          philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural
          and causeless. Hence it is that we make trifles of terrors, ensconsing
          ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to
          an unknown fear.” Keats, Lamia: “There was an awful rainbow once in
          heaven; We know her woof, her texture: she is given in the dull
          catalogue of common things.” Hill, Genetic Philosophy, 334—“Biological
          and psychological science unite in affirming that every event, organic
          or psychic, is to be explained in the terms of its immediate
          antecedents, and that it can be so explained. There is therefore no
          necessity, there is even no room, for interference. If the existence
          of a Deity depends upon the evidence of intervention and supernatural
          agency, faith in the divine seems to be destroyed in the scientific
          mind.” Theodore Parker: “No whim in God,—therefore no miracle in
          nature.” Armour, Atonement and Law, 15–33—“The miracle of redemption,
          like all miracles, is by intervention of adequate power, not by
          suspension of law. Redemption is not ‘the great exception.’ It is the
          fullest revelation and vindication of law.” Gore, in Lux Mundi,
          320—“Redemption is not natural but supernatural—supernatural, that is,
          in view of the false nature which man made for himself by excluding
          God. Otherwise, the work of redemption is only the reconstitution of
          the nature which God had designed.” Abp. Trench: “The world of nature
          is throughout a witness for the world of spirit, proceeding from the
          same hand, growing out of the same root, and being constituted for
          this very end. The characters of nature which everywhere meet the eye
          are not a common but a sacred writing,—they are the hieroglyphics of
          God.” Pascal: “Nature is the image of grace.” President Mark Hopkins:
          “Christianity and perfect Reason are identical.” See Mead,
          Supernatural Revelation, 97–123; art.: Miracle, by Bernard, in
          Hastings’ Dictionary of the Bible. The modern and unproved view of the
          miracle is perhaps best presented by T. H. Wright, The Finger of God;
          and by W. N. Rice, Christian Faith in an Age of Science, 336.
        </p>
        <p>2. Possibility of Miracle.</p>
        <p>
          An event in nature may be caused by an agent in nature yet above
          nature. This is evident from the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Lower forces and laws in nature are frequently counteracted and
          transcended by the higher (as mechanical forces and laws by chemical,
          and chemical by vital), while yet the lower forces and laws are not
          suspended or annihilated, but are merged in the higher, and made to
          assist in accomplishing purposes to which they are altogether unequal
          when left to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          By nature we mean nature in the proper sense—not ‘everything that is
          not God,’ but ‘everything that is not God or made in the image of
          God’s; see Hopkins, Outline Study of Man, 258, 259. Man’s will does
          not belong to nature, but is above nature. On the transcending of
          lower forces by higher, see Murphy, Habit and Intelligence, 1:88.
          James Robertson, Early Religion of Israel, 23—“Is it impossible that
          there should be unique things in the world? Is it scientific to assert
          that there are not?” Ladd, Philosophy of Knowledge, 406—“Why does not
          the projecting part of the coping-stone fall, in obedience to the law
          of gravitation, from the top of yonder building? Because, as physics
          declares, the forces of cohesion, acting under quite different laws,
          thwart and oppose for the time being the law of gravitation.…But now,
          after a frosty night, the coping-stone actually breaks off and tumbles
          to the ground; for that unique law which makes water forcibly expand
          at 32° Fahrenheit has contradicted the laws of cohesion and has
          restored to the law of gravitation its temporarily suspended rights
          over this mass of matter.” Gore, Incarnation, 48—“Evolution views
          nature as a progressive order in which there are new departures, fresh
          levels won, phenomena unknown before. When organic life appeared, the
          future did not resemble the past. So when man came. Christ is a new
          nature—the creative Word made flesh. It is to be expected that, as new
          nature, he will exhibit new phenomena. New vital energy will radiate
          from him, controlling the material forces. Miracles are the proper
          accompaniments of his person.” We may add that, as Christ is the
          immanent God, he is present in nature while at the same time he is
          above nature, and he whose steady will is the essence of all natural
          law can transcend all past exertions of that will. The infinite One is
          not a being of endless monotony. William Elder, Ideas from Nature,
          156—“God is not bound hopelessly to his process, like Ixion to his
          wheel.”

          (b) The human will acts upon its physical organism, and so upon
          nature, and produces results which nature left to herself never could
          accomplish, while yet no law of nature is suspended or violated.
          Gravitation still operates upon the axe, even while man holds it at
          the surface of the water—for the axe still has weight (cf. 2Ki_6:5-7).

        <p>
          Versus Hume, Philos. Works, 4:130—“A miracle is a violation of the
          laws of nature.” Christian apologists have too often needlessly
          embarrassed their argument by accepting Hume’s definition. The stigma
          is entirely undeserved. If man can support the axe at the surface of
          the water while gravitation still acts upon it, God can certainly, at
          the prophet’s word, make the iron to swim, while gravitation still
          acts upon it. But this last is miracle. See Mansel, Essay on Miracles,
          in Aids to Faith, 26, 27: After the greatest wave of the season has
          landed its pebble high up on the beach, I can move the pebble a foot
          further without altering the force of wind or wave or climate in a
          distant continent. Fisher, Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 471;
          Hamilton, Autology, 685–690; Bowen, Metaph. and Ethics, 445; Row,
          Bampton Lectures on Christian Evidences, 54–74; A. A. Hodge: Pulling
          out a new stop of the organ does not suspend the working or destroy
          the harmony of the other stops. The pump does not suspend the law of
          gravitation, nor does our throwing a ball into the air. If gravitation
          did not act, the upward velocity of the ball would not diminish and
          the ball would never return. “Gravitation draws iron down. But the
          magnet overcomes that attraction and draws the iron up. Yet here is no
          suspension or violation of law, but rather a harmonious working of two
          laws, each in its sphere. Death and not life is the order of nature.
          But men live notwithstanding. Life is supernatural. Only as a force
          additional to mere nature works against nature does life exist. So
          spiritual life uses and transcends the laws of nature” (Sunday School
          Times). Gladden, What Is Left? 60—“Wherever you find thought, choice,
          love, you find something that is not under the dominion of fixed law.
          These are the attributes of a free personality.” William James: “We
          need to substitute the personal view of life for the impersonal and
          mechanical view. Mechanical rationalism is narrowness and partial
          induction of facts,—it is not science.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) In all free causation, there is an acting without means. Man acts
          upon external nature through his physical organism, but, in moving his
          physical organism, he acts directly upon matter. In other words, the
          human will can use means, only because it has the power of acting
          initially without means.

          1882:188. A. J. Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 311—“Not Divinity
          alone intervenes in the world of things. Each living soul, in its
          measure and degree, does the same.” Each soul that acts in any way on
          its surroundings does so on the principle of the miracle. Phillips
          Brooks, Life, 2:350—“The making of all events miraculous is no more an
          abolition of miracle than the flooding of the world with sunshine is
          an extinction of the sun.” George Adam Smith, on Isa_33:14—“derouriug
          fire…everlasting barnings”: “If we look at a conflagration through
          smoked glass, we see buildings collapsing, but we see no fire. So
          science sees results, but not the power which produces them; sees
          cause and effect, but does not see God.” P. S. Henson: “The current in
          an electric wee is invisible so long as it circulates uniformly. But
          cut the wire and insert a piece of carbon between the two broken ends,
          and at once you have an arc-light that drives away the darkness. So
          miracle is only the momentary interruption in the operation of uniform
          laws, which thus gives light to the ages,”—or, let us say rather, the
          momentary change in the method of their operation whereby the will of
          God takes a new form of manifestation. Pfleiderer, Grundriss,
          100—“Spinoza leugnete ihre metaphysische Möglichkeit, Hume ihre
          geschichtliche Erkennbarkeit, Kant ihre practische Brauchbarkeit,
          Schleiermacher ihre religiöse Bedeutsamkeit, Hegel ihre geistige
          Beweiskraft, Fichte ihre wahre Christlichkeit, und die kritische
          Theologie ihre wahre Geschichtlichkeit.”

          (d) What the human will, considered as a supernatural force, and what
          the chemical and vital forces of nature itself, are demonstrably able
          to accomplish, cannot be regarded as beyond the power of God, so long
          as God dwells in and controls the universe. If man’s will can act
          directly upon matter in his own physical organism, God’s will can work
          immediately upon the system which he has created and which he
          sustains. In other words, if there be a God, and if he be a personal
          being, miracles are possible. The impossibility of miracles can be
          maintained only upon principles of atheism or pantheism.

          New Englander, July, 1889:1–32—Three postulates: (1) Every particle
          attracts every other in the universe: (2) Man’s will is free; (2)
          Every volition is accompanied by corresponding brain-action. Hence
          every volition of ours causes changes throughout the whole universe;
          also, in Century Magazine, Dec. 1894:229—Conditions are never twice
          the same in nature; all things are the results of will, since we know
          that the least thought of ours shakes the universe; miracle is simply
          the action of will in unique conditions; the beginning of life, the
          origin of consciousness, these are miracles, yet they are strictly
          natural; prayer and the mind that frames it are conditions which the
          Mind in nature cannot ignore. Cf. Psa_115:3—“our God is in the heaven:
          He hath done whatsoever he pleased” = his almighty power and freedom
          do away with all a priori objections to miracles. If God is not a mere
          force, but a person, then miracles are possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) This possibility of miracles becomes doubly sure to those who see
          in Christ none other than the immanent God manifested to creatures.
          The Logos or divine Reason who is the principle of all growth and
          evolution can make God known only by means of successive new
          impartations of his energy. Since all progress implies increment, and
          Christ is the only source of life, the whole history of creation is a
          witness to the possibility of miracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          See A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 163–166—“This conception of
          evolution is that of Lotze. That great philosopher, whose influence is
          more potent than any other in present thought, does not regard the
          universe as a plenum to which nothing can be added in the way of
          force. He looks upon the universe rather as a plastic organism to
          which new impulses can be imparted from him of whose thought and will
          it is an expression. These impulses, once imparted, abide in the
          organism and are thereafter subject to its law. Though these impulses
          come from within, they come not from the finite mechanism but from the
          immanent God. Robert Browning’s phrase, ‘All’s love, but all’s law,’
          must be interpreted as meaning that the very movements of the planets
          and all the operations of nature are revelations of a personal and
          present God, but it must not be interpreted as meaning that God runs
          in a rut, that he is confined to mechanism, that he is incapable of
          unique and startling manifestations of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The idea that gives to evolution its hold upon thinking minds is the
          idea of continuity. But absolute continuity is inconsistent with
          progress. If the future is not simply a reproduction of the past,
          there must be some new cause of change. In order to progress there
          must be either a new force, or a new combination of forces, and the
          new combination of forces can be explained only by some new force that
          causes the combination. This new force, moreover, must be intelligent
          force, if the evolution is to be toward the better instead of toward
          the worse. The continuity must be continuity not of forces but of
          plan. The forces may increase, nay, they must increase, unless the new
          is to be a mere repetition of the old. There must be additional energy
          imparted, the new combination brought about, and all this implies
          purpose and will. But through all there runs one continuous plan, and
          upon this plan the rationality of evolution depends.

        <p>
          “A man builds a house. In laying the foundation he uses stone and
          mortar, but he makes the walls of wood and the roof of tin. In the
          superstructure he brings into play different laws from those which
          apply to the foundation. There is continuity, not of material, but of
          plan. Progress from cellar to garret requires breaks here and there,
          and the bringing in of new forces; in fact, without the bringing in of
          these new forces the evolution of the house would be impossible. Now
          substitute for the foundation and superstructure living things like
          the chrysalis and the butterfly; imagine the power to work from within
          and not from without; and you see that true continuity does not
          exclude but involves new beginnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Evolution, then, depends on increments of force plus continuity of
          plan. New creations are possible because the immanent God has not
          exhausted himself. Miracle is possible because God is not far away,
          but is at hand to do whatever the needs of his moral universe may
          require. Regeneration and answers to prayer are possible for the very
          reason that these are the objects for which the universe was built. If
          we were deists, believing in a distant God and a mechanical universe,
          evolution and Christianity would be irreconcilable. But since we
          believe in a dynamical universe, of which the personal and living God
          is the inner source of energy, evolution is but the basis, foundation
          and background of Christianity, the silent and regular working of him
          who, in the fulness of time, utters his voice in Christ and the
          Cross.”

          Lotze’s own statement of his position may be found in his Microcosmos,
          2:479 sq. Professor James Ten Broeke has interpreted him as follows:
          “He makes the possibility of the miracle depend upon the close and
          intimate action and reaction between the world and the personal
          Absolute, in consequence of which the movements of the natural world
          are carried on only through the Absolute, with the possibility of a
          variation in the general course of things, according to existing facts
          and the purpose of the divine Governor.”
        </p>
        <p>3. Probability of Miracles.</p>
        <p>
          A. We acknowledge that, so long as we confine our attention to nature,
          there is a presumption against miracles. Experience testifies to the
          uniformity of natural law. A general uniformity is needful, in order
          to make possible a rational calculation of the future, and a proper
          ordering of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Butler, Analogy, part ii, chap. ii; F. W. Farrar, Witness of
          History to Christ, 3–45; Modern Scepticism, 1:179–227; Chalmers,
          Christian Revelation, 1:47. G. D. B. Pepper: “Where there is no law,
          no settled order, there can be no miracle. The miracle presupposes the
          law, and the importance assigned to miracles is the recognition of the
          reign of law. But the making and launching of a ship may be governed
          by law, no less than the sailing of the ship after it is launched. So
          the introduction of a higher spiritual order into a merely natural
          order constitutes a new and unique event.” Some Christian apologists
          have erred in affirming that the miracle was antecedently as probable
          as any other event, whereas only its antecedent improbability gives it
          value as a proof of revelation. Horace: “Nec deus intersit, nisi
          dignus vindice nodus Inciderit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          B. But we deny that this uniformity of nature is absolute and
          universal. (a) It is not a truth of reason that can have no
          exceptions, like the axiom that a whole is greater than its parts. (b)
          Experience could not warrant a belief in absolute and universal
          uniformity, unless experience were identical with absolute and
          universal knowledge. (c) We know, on the contrary, from geology, that
          there have been breaks in this uniformity, such as the introduction of
          vegetable, animal and human life, which cannot be accounted for,
          except by the manifestation in nature of a supernatural power.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Compare the probability that the sun will rise to-morrow morning
          with the certainty that two and two make four. Huxley, Lay Sermons,
          158, indignantly denies that there is any ‘must’ about the uniformity
          of nature: “No one is entitled to say a priori that any given
          so-called miraculous event is impossible.” Ward, Naturalism and
          Agnosticism, 1:84—“There is no evidence for the statement that the
          mass of the universe is a definite and unchangeable quantity”; 108,
          109—“Why so confidently assume that a rigid and monotonous uniformity
          is the only, or the highest, indication of order, the order of an ever
          living Spirit, above all? How is it that we depreciate machine-made
          articles, and prefer those in which the artistic impulse, or the
          fitness of the individual case, is free to shape and to make what is
          literally manufactured, hand-made? … Dangerous as teleological
          arguments in general may be, we may at least safely say the world was
          not designed to make science easy.…To call the verses of a poet, the
          politics of a statesman, or the award of a judge mechanical, implies,
          as Lotze has pointed out, marked disparagement, although it implies,
          too, precisely those characteristics—exactness and invariability—in
          which Maxwell would have us see a token of the divine.” Surely then we
          must not insist that divine wisdom must always run in a rut, must ever
          repeat itself, must never exhibit itself in unique acts like
          incarnation and resurrection. See Edward Hitchcock, in Bib. Sac.,
          20:489–561, on “The Law of Nature’s Constancy Subordinate to the
          Higher Law of Change”; Jevons, Principles of Science, 2:430–438;
          Mozley, Miracles, 26.

          (b) S. T. Coleridge, Table Talk, 18 December, 1831—“The light which
          experience gives us is a lantern on the stern of the ship, which
          shines only on the waves behind us.” Hobbes: “Experience concludeth
          nothing universally.” Brooks, Foundations of Zoölogy, 131—“Evidence
          can tell us only what has happened, and it can never assure us that
          the future must be like the past; 132—Proof that all nature is
          mechanical would not be inconsistent with the belief that everything
          in nature is immediately sustained by Providence, and that my volition
          counts for something in determining the course of events.” Royce,
          World and Individual, 2:204—“Uniformity is not absolute. Nature is a
          vaster realm of life and meaning, of which we men form a part, and of
          which the final unity is in God’s life. The rhythm of the heart-beat
          has its normal regularity, yet its limited persistence. Nature may be
          merely the habits of free will. Every region of this universally
          conscious world may be a centre whence issues new conscious life for
          communication to all the worlds.” Principal Fairbairn: “Nature is
          Spirit.” We prefer to say: “Nature is the manifestation of spirit, the
          regularities of freedom.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Other breaks in the uniformity of nature are the coming of Christ
          and the regeneration of a human soul. Harnack, what is Christianity,
          18, holds that though there are no interruptions to the working of
          natural law, natural law is not yet fully known. While there are no
          miracles, there is plenty of the miraculous. The power of mind over
          matter is beyond our present conceptions. Bowne, Philosophy of Theism,
          210—The effects are no more consequences of the laws than the laws are
          consequences of the effects = both laws and effects are exercises of
          divine will. King, Reconstruction in Theology, 56—We must hold, not to
          the uniformity of law, but to the universality of law; for evolution
          has successive stages with new laws coming in and becoming dominant
          that had not before appeared. The new and higher stage is practically
          a miracle from the point of view of the lower. See British Quarterly
          Review, Oct. 1881:154; Martineau, Study, 2:200, 203, 209.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. Since the inworking of the moral law into the constitution and
          course of nature shows that nature exists, not for itself, but for the
          contemplation and use of moral beings, it is probable that the God of
          nature will produce effects aside from those of natural law, whenever
          there are sufficiently important moral ends to be served thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath the expectation of uniformity is the intuition of final cause;
          the former may therefore give way to the latter. See Porter, Human
          Intellect, 592–615—Efficient causes and final causes may conflict, and
          then the efficient give place to the final. This is miracle. See
          Hutton, in Nineteenth Century, Aug. 1885, and Channing, Evidences of
          Revealed Religion, quoted in Shedd, Dogm. Theol., 1:534, 535—“The
          order of the universe is a means, not an end, and like all other means
          must give way when the end can be beat promoted without it. It is the
          mark of a weak mind to make an idol of order and method; to cling to
          established forms of business when they clog instead of advancing it.”
          Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 357—“The stability of the heavens is
          in the sight of God of less importance than the moral growth of the
          human spirit.” This is proved by the Incarnation. The Christian sees
          in this little earth the scene of God’s greatest revelation. The
          superiority of the spiritual to the physical helps us to see our true
          dignity in the creation, to rule our bodies, to overcome our sins.
          Christ’s suffering shows us that God is no indifferent spectator of
          human pain. He subjects himself to our conditions, or rather in this
          subjection reveals to us God’s own eternal suffering for sin. The
          atonement enables us to solve the problem of sin.

          D. The existence of moral disorder consequent upon the free acts of
          man’s will, therefore, changes the presumption against miracles into a
          presumption in their favor. The non-appearance of miracles, in this
          case, would be the greatest of wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stearns, Evidence of Christian Experience, 331–335—So a man’s personal
          consciousness of sin, and above all his personal experience of
          regenerating grace, will constitute the best preparation for the study
          of miracles. “Christianity cannot be proved except to a bad
          conscience.” The dying Vinet said well: “The greatest miracle that I
          know of is that of my conversion. I was dead, and I live; I was blind,
          and I see; I was a slave, and I am free; I was an enemy of God, and I
          love him; prayer, the Bible, the society of Christians, these were to
          me a source of profound ennui; whilst now it is the pleasures of the
          world that are wearisome to me, and piety is the source of all my joy.
          Behold the miracle! And if God has been able to work that one, there
          are none of which he is not capable.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the physical and the moral are not “sundered as with an axe.”
          Nature is but the lower stage or imperfect form of the revelation of
          God’s truth and holiness and love. It prepares the way for the miracle
          by suggesting, though more dimly, the same essential characteristics
          of the divine nature. Ignorance and sin necessitate a larger
          disclosure. G. S. Lee, The Shadow Christ, 84—“The pillar of cloud was
          the dim nightlamp that Jehovah kept burning over his infant children,
          to show them that he was there. They did not know that the night
          itself was God.” Why do we have Christmas presents in Christian homes?
          Because the parents do not love their children at other times? No; but
          because the mind becomes sluggish in the presence of merely regular
          kindness, and special gifts are needed to wake it to gratitude. So our
          sluggish and unloving minds need special testimonies of the divine
          mercy. Shall God alone be shut up to dull uniformities of action?
          Shall the heavenly Father alone be unable to make special
          communications of love? Why then are not miracles and revivals of
          religion constant and uniform? Because uniform blessings would be
          regarded simply as workings of a machine. See Mozley, Miracles,
          preface, xxiv; Turner, Wish and will, 291–315; N. W. Taylor, Moral
          Government, 2:388–423.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. As belief in the possibility of miracles rests upon our belief in
          the existence of a personal God, so belief in the probability of
          miracles rests upon our belief that God is a moral and benevolent
          being. He who has no God but a God of physical order will regard
          miracles as an impertinent intrusion upon that order. But he who
          yields to the testimony of conscience and regards God as a God of
          holiness, will see that man’s unholiness renders God’s miraculous
          interposition most necessary to man and most becoming to God. Our view
          of miracles will therefore be determined by our belief in a moral, or
          in a non-moral, God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philo, in his Life of Moses, 1:88, speaking of the miracles of the
          quails and of the water from the rock, says that “all these unexpected
          and extraordinary things are amusements or playthings of God.” He
          believes that there is room for arbitrariness in the divine procedure.
          Scripture however represents miracle as an extraordinary, rather than
          as an arbitrary act. It is “his work, his stranges work … his act, his
          strange act” (Isa_28:21). God’s ordinary method is that of regular
          growth and development. Chadwick, Unitarianism, 72—“Nature is
          economical. If she wants an apple, she develops a leaf; if she wants a
          brain, she develops a vertebra. We always thought well of backbone;
          and, if Goethe’s was a sound suggestion, we think better of it now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is commonly, but very erroneously, taken for granted that miracle
          requires a greater exercise of power than does God’s upholding of the
          ordinary processes of nature. But to an omnipotent Being our measures
          of power have no application. The question is not a question of power,
          but of rationality and love. Miracle implies selfrestraint, as well as
          self-unfolding, on the part of him who works it. It is therefore not
          God’s common method of action; it is adopted only when regular methods
          will not suffice; it often seems accompanied by a sacrifice of feeling
          on the part of Christ (Mat_17:17—“O faithless and perverse generation,
          how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring
          him hither to me”; Mar_7:34—“looking up to heaven, he sighed, and
          saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened”; cf. Mat_12:39—“An evil
          and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no
          sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.”
        </p>
        <p>
          F. From the point of view of ethical monism the probability of miracle
          becomes even greater. Since God is not merely the intellectual but the
          moral Reason of the world, the disturbances of the world-order which
          are due to sin are the matters which most deeply affect him. Christ,
          the life of the whole system and of humanity as well, must suffer;
          and, since we have evidence that he is merciful as well as just, it is
          probable that he will rectify the evil by extraordinary means, when
          merely ordinary means do not avail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like creation and providence, like inspiration and regeneration,
          miracle is a work in which God limits himself, by a new and peculiar
          exercise of his power,—limits himself as part of a process of
          condescending love and as a means of teaching sense-environed and
          sin-burdened humanity what it would not learn in any other way.
          Self-limitation, however, is the very perfection and glory of God, for
          without it no self-sacrificing love would be possible (see page 9,
          F.). The probability of miracles is therefore argued not only from
          God’s holiness but also from his love. His desire to save men from
          their sins must be as infinite as his nature. The incarnation, the
          atonement, the resurrection, when once made known to us, commend
          themselves, not only as satisfying our human needs, but as worthy of a
          God of moral perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          An argument for the probability of the miracle might be drawn from the
          concessions of one of its chief modern opponents, Thomas H. Huxley. He
          tells us in different places that the object of science is “the
          discovery of the rational order that pervades the universe,” which in
          spite of his professed agnosticism is an unconscious testimony to
          Reason and will at the basis of all things. He tells us again that
          there is no necessity in the uniformities of nature: “When we change
          ‘will’ into ‘must,’ we introduce an idea of necessity which has no
          warrant in the observed facts, and has no warranty that I can discover
          elsewhere.” He speaks of “the infinite wickedness that has attended
          the course of human history.” Yet he has no hope in man’s power to
          save himself: “I would as soon adore a wilderness of apes,” as the
          Pantheist’s rationalized conception of humanity. He grants that Jesus
          Christ is “the noblest ideal of humanity which mankind has yet
          worshiped.” Why should be not go further and concede that Jesus Christ
          most truly represents the infinite Reason at the heart of things, and
          that his purity and love, demonstrated by suffering and death, make it
          probable that God will use extraordinary means for man’s deliverance?
          It is doubtful whether Huxley recognized his own personal sinfulness
          as fully as he recognized the sinfulness of humanity in general. If he
          had done so, he would have been willing to accept miracle upon even a
          slight preponderance of historical proof. As a matter of fact, he
          rejected miracle upon the grounds assigned by Hume, which we now
          proceed to mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The amount of testimony necessary to prove a miracle is no greater
          than that which is requisite to prove the occurrence of any other
          unusual but confessedly possible event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hume, indeed, argued that a miracle is so contradictory of all human
          experience that it is more reasonable to believe any amount of
          testimony false than to believe a miracle to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original form of the argument can be found in Hume’s Philosophical
          Works, 4:124–150. See also Bib. Sac., Oct. 1867:615. For the most
          recent and plausible statement of it, see Supernatural Religion,
          1:55–94. The argument maintains for substance that things are
          impossible because improbable. It ridicules the credulity of those who
          “thrust their fists against the posts, And still insist they see the
          ghosts,” and holds with the German philosopher who declared that he
          would not believe in a miracle, even if he saw one with his own eyes.
          Christianity is so miraculous that it takes a miracle to make one
          believe it.
        </p>
        <p>The argument is fallacious, because</p>
        <p>
          (a) It is chargeable with a petitio principii, in making our own
          personal experience the measure of all human experience. The same
          principle would make the proof of any absolutely new fact impossible.
          Even though God should work a miracle, he could never prove it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It involves a self-contradiction, since it seeks to overthrow our
          faith in human testimony by adducing to the contrary the general
          experience of men, of which we know only from testimony. This general
          experience, moreover, is merely negative, and cannot neutralize that
          which is positive, except upon principles which would invalidate all
          testimony whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It requires belief in a greater wonder than those which it would
          escape. That multitudes of intelligent and honest men should against
          all their interests unite in deliberate and persistent falsehood,
          under the circumstances narrated in the New Testament record, involves
          a change in the sequences of nature far more incredible than the
          miracles of Christ and his apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) John Stuart Mill, Essays on Theism, 216–241, grants that, even if
          a miracle were wrought, it would be impossible to prove it. In this he
          only echoes Hume, Miracles, 112—“The ultimate standard by which we
          determine all disputes that may arise is always derived from
          experience and observation.” But here our own personal experience is
          made the standard by which to judge all human experience. Whately,
          Historic Doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte, shows that the same
          rule would require us to deny the existence of the great Frenchman,
          since Napoleon’s conquests were contrary to all experience, and
          civilized nations had never before been so subdued. The London Times
          for June 18, 1888, for the first time in at least a hundred years or
          in 31, 200 issues, was misdated, and certain pages read June 17,
          although June 17 was Sunday. Yet the paper would have been admitted in
          a court of justice as evidence of a marriage. The real wonder is, not
          the break in experience, but the continuity without the break.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Lyman Abbott: “If the Old Testament told the story of a naval
          engagement between the Jewish people and a pagan people, in which all
          the ships of the pagan people were absolutely destroyed and not a
          single man was killed among the Jews, all the sceptics would have
          scorned the narrative. Every one now believes it, except those who
          live in Spain.” There are people who in a similar way refuse to
          investigate the phenomena of hypnotism, second sight, clairvoyance,
          and telepathy, declaring a priori that all these things are
          impossible. Prophecy, in the sense of prediction, is discredited. Upon
          the same principle wireless telegraphy might be denounced as an
          imposture. The son of Erin charged with murder defended himself by
          Saying: “Your honor, I can bring fifty people who did not see me do
          it.” Our faith in testimony cannot be due to experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) On this point, see Chalmers, Christian Revelation, 3:70; Starkie
          on Evidence, 739; De Quincey, Theological Essays, 1:162–188; Thornton,
          Old-fashioned Ethics, 143–153; Campbell on Miracles. South’s sermon on
          The Certainty of our Savior’s Resurrection had stated and answered
          this objection long before Hume propounded it.
        </p>
        <p>5. Evidential force of Miracles.</p>
        <p>
          (a) Miracles are the natural accompaniments and attestations of new
          communications from God. The great epochs of miracles—represented by
          Moses, the prophets, the first and second comings of Christ—are
          coincident with the great epochs of revelation. Miracles serve to draw
          attention to new truth, and cease when this truth has gained currency
          and foothold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles are not scattered evenly over the whole course of history.
          Few miracles are recorded during the 2500 years from Adam to Moses.
          When the N. T. Canon is completed and the internal evidence of
          Scripture has attained its greatest strength, the external
          attestations by miracle are either wholly withdrawn or begin to
          disappear. The spiritual wonders of regeneration remain, and for these
          the way has been prepared by the long progress from the miracles of
          power wrought by Moses to the miracles of grace wrought by Christ.
          Miracles disappeared because newer and higher proofs rendered them
          unnecessary. Better things than these are now in evidence. Thomas
          Fuller: “Miracles are the swaddling-clothes of the infant church.”
          John Foster: “Miracles are the great bell of the universe, which draws
          men to God’s sermon.” Henry Ward Beecher: “Miracles are the midwives
          of great moral truths; candles lit before the dawn but put out after
          the sun has risen.” Illingworth, in Lux Mundi, 210—“When we are told
          that miracles contradict experience, we point to the daily occurrence
          of the spiritual miracle of regeneration and ask: ‘Which is easier to
          say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk?’ (Mat_9:5).”
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles and inspiration go together; if the former remain in the
          church, the latter should remain also; see Marsh, in Bap. Quar. Rev.,
          1887:225–242. On the cessation of miracles in the early church, see
          Henderson, Inspiration, 443–490; Bückmann, in Zeitsch. f. luth. Theol.
          u. Kirche, 1878:216. On miracles in the second century, see Barnard,
          Literature of the Second Century, 139–180. A. J. Gordon, Ministry of
          the Spirit, 167—“The apostles were commissioned to speak for Christ
          till the N. T. Scriptures, his authoritative voice, were completed. In
          the apostolate we have a provisional inspiration; in the N. T. a
          stereotyped inspiration; the first being endowed with authority ad
          interim to forgive sins, and the second having this authority in
          perpetuo.” Dr. Gordon draws an analogy between coal, which is fossil
          sunlight, and the New Testament, which is fossil inspiration.
          Sabatter, Philos. Religion, 74—“The Bible is very free from the
          senseless prodigies of oriental mythology. The great prophets, Isaiah,
          Amos, Micah, Jeremiah, John the Baptist, work no miracles. Jesus’
          temptation in the wilderness is a victory of the moral consciousness
          over the religion of mere physical prodigy.” Trench says that miracles
          cluster about the foundation of the theocratic kingdom under Moses and
          Joshua, and about the restoration of that kingdom under Elijah and
          Elisha. In the O. T., miracles confute the gods of Egypt under Moses,
          the Phœnician Baal under Elijah and Elisha, and the gods of Babylon
          under Daniel. See Diman, Theistic Argument, 376, and art.: Miracle, by
          Bernard, in Hastings’ Bible Dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Miracles generally certify to the truth of doctrine, not directly,
          but indirectly; otherwise a new miracle must needs accompany each new
          doctrine taught. Miracles primarily and directly certify to the divine
          commission and authority of a religious teacher, and therefore warrant
          acceptance of his doctrines and obedience to his commands as the
          doctrines and commands of God, whether these be communicated at
          intervals or all together, orally or in written documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exceptions to the above statement are very few, and are found only
          in cases where the whole commission and authority of Christ, and not
          some fragmentary doctrine, are involved. Jesus appeals to his miracles
          as proof of the truth of his teaching in Mat_9:5-6—“Which is easier to
          say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk? But that ye may
          know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then
          saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go
          unto thy house”; 12:28—“if I by the spirit of God cast out demons,
          then is the kingdom of God come upon you.” So Paul in Rom_1:4, says
          that Jesus “was declared to be the Son of God with power,.…by the
          resurrection from the dead.” Mair, Christian Evidences, 223, quotes
          from Natural Religion, 181—“It is said that the theo-philanthropist
          Larévellière-Lépeaux once confided to Talleyrand his disappointment at
          the ill success of his attempt to bring into vogue a sort of improved
          Christianity, a sort of benevolent rationalism which he had invented
          to meet the wants of a benevolent age. ‘His propaganda made no way,’
          he said. ‘what was he to do?’ he asked. The ex-bishop Talleyrand
          politely condoled with him, feared it was a difficult task to found a
          new religion, more difficult than he had imagined, so difficult that
          he hardly knew what to advise. ‘Still,’—so he went on after a moment’s
          reflection,—‘there is one plan which you might at least try: I should
          recommend you to be crucified, and to rise again the third day.” See
          also Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith, 147–167; Farrar, Life of
          Christ, 1:168–172.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Miracles, therefore, do not stand alone as evidences. Power alone
          cannot prove a divine commission. Purity of life and doctrine must go
          with the miracles to assure us that a religious teacher has come from
          God. The miracles and the doctrine in this manner mutually support
          each other, and form parts of one whole. The internal evidence for the
          Christian system may have greater power over certain minds and over
          certain ages than the external evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pascal’s aphorism that “doctrines must be judged by miracles, miracles
          by doctrine,” needs to be supplemented by Mozley’s statment that “a
          supernatural fact is the proper proof of a supernatural doctrine,
          while a supernatural doctrine is not the proper proof of a
          supernatural fact.” E. G. Robinson, Christian Theology, 107, would
          “defend miracles, but would not buttress up Christianity by them.…No
          amount of miracles could convince a good man of the divine commission
          of a known bad man; nor, on the other hand, could any degree of
          miraculous power suffice to silence the doubts of an evil-minded
          man.…The miracle is a certification only to him who can perceive its
          significance.…The Christian church has the resurrection written all
          over it. Its very existence is proof of the resurrection. Twelve men
          could never have founded the church, if Christ had remained in the
          tomb. The living church is the burning bush that is not consumed.”
          Gore, Incarnation, 57—“Jesus did not appear after his resurrection to
          unbelievers, but to believers only,—which means that this crowning
          miracle was meant to confirm an existing faith, not to create one
          where it did not exist.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian Union, July 11, 1891—“If the anticipated resurrection of
          Joseph Smith were to take place, it would add nothing whatever to the
          authority of the Mormon religion.” Schurman, Agnosticism and Religion,
          57—“Miracles are merely the bells to call primitive peoples to church.
          Sweet as the music they once made, modern ears find them jangling and
          out of tune, and their dissonant notes scare away pious souls who
          would fain enter the temple of worship.” A new definition of miracle
          which recognizes their possible classification as extraordinary
          occurrences in nature, yet sees in all nature the working of the
          living God, may do much to remove this prejudice. Bishop of
          Southampton, Place of Miracle, 53—“Miracles alone could not produce
          conviction. The Pharisees ascribed them to Beelzebub. Though Jesus had
          done so many signs, yet they believed not.…Though miracles were
          frequently wrought, they were rarely appealed to as evidence of the
          truth of the gospel. They are simply signs of God’s presencé in his
          world. By itself a miracle had no evidential force. The only test for
          distinguishing divine from Satanic miracles is that of the moral
          character and purpose of the worker; and therefore miracles depend for
          all their force upon a previous appreciation of the character and
          personality of Christ (79). The earliest apologists make no use of
          miracles. They are of no value except in connection with prophecy.
          Miracles are the revelation of God, not the proof of revelation.”

          (d) Yet the Christian miracles do not lose their value as evidence in
          the process of ages. The loftier the structure of Christian life and
          doctrine the greater need that its foundation be secure. The authority
          of Christ as a teacher of supernatural truth rests upon his miracles,
          and especially upon the miracle of his resurrection. That one miracle
          to which the church looks back as the source of her life carries with
          it irresistibly all the other miracles of the Scripture record; upon
          it alone we may safely rest the proof that the Scriptures are an
          authoritative revelation from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The miracles of Christ are simple correlates of the Incarnation—proper
          insignia of his royalty and divinity. By mere external evidence
          however we can more easily prove the resurrection than the
          incarnation. In our arguments with sceptics, we should not begin with
          the ass that spoke to Balaam, or the fish that swallowed Jonah, but
          with the resurrection of Christ; that conceded, all other Biblical
          miracles win seem only natural preparations, accompaniments, or
          consequences. G. F. Wright, in Bib. Sac, 1889:707—“The difficulties
          created by the miraculous character of Christianity may be compared to
          those assumed by a builder when great permanence is desired in the
          structure erected. It is easier to lay the foundation of a temporary
          structure than of one which is to endure for the ages.” Pressensé:
          “The empty tomb of Christ has been the cradle of the church, and if in
          this foundation of her faith the church has been mistaken, she must
          needs lay herself down by the side of the mortal remains, I say, not
          of a man, but of a religion.”
        </p>
        <p>
          President Schurman believes the resurrection of Christ to be “an
          obsolete picture of an eternal truth—the fact of a continued life with
          God.” Harnack, Wesen des Christenthums, 102, thinks no consistent
          union of the gospel accounts of Christ’s resurrection can be attained;
          apparently doubts a literal and bodily rising; yet traces Christianity
          back to an invincible faith in Christ’s conquering of death and his
          continued life. But why believe the gospels when they speak of the
          sympathy of Christ, yet disbelieve them when they speak of his
          miraculous power? We have no right to trust the narrative when it
          gives us Christ’s words “Weep not” to the widow of Nain, (Luk_7:13),
          and then to distrust it when it tells us of his raising the widow’s
          son. The words “Jesus wept” belong inseparably to a story of which
          “Lasarus, come forth!” forms a part (Joh_11:35; Joh_11:43). It is
          improbable that the disciples should have believed so stupendous a
          miracle as Christ’s resurrection, if they had not previously seen
          other manifestations of miraculous power on the part of Christ. Christ
          himself is the great miracle. The conception of him as the risen and
          glorified Savior can be explained only by the fact that he did so
          rise. E. G. Robinson, Christ. Theology, 109—“The Church attests the
          fact of the resurrection quite as much as the resurrection attests the
          divine origin of the church. Resurrection, as an evidence, depends on
          the existence of the church which proclaims it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) The resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ—by which we mean his
          coming forth from the sepulchre in body as well as in spirit—is
          demonstrated by evidence as varied and as conclusive as that which
          proves to us any single fact of ancient history. Without it
          Christianity itself is inexplicable, as is shown by the failure of all
          modern rationalistic theories to account for its rise and progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          In discussing the evidence of Jesus’ resurrection, we are confronted
          with three main rationalistic theories:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The Swoon-theory of Strauss. This holds that Jesus did not really
          die. The cold and the spices of the sepulchre revived him. We reply
          that the blood and water, and the testimony of the centurion
          (Mar_15:45), proved actual death (see Bib. Sac, April, 1889:228;
          Forrest, Christ of History and Experience, 137–170). The rolling away
          of the stone, and Jesus’ power immediately after, are inconsistent
          with immediately preceding swoon and suspended animation. How was his
          life preserved? where did he go? when did he die? His not dying
          implies deceit on his own part or on that of his disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Spirit-theory of Keim. Jesus really died, but only his spirit
          appeared. The spirit of Jesus grave the disciples a sign of his
          continued life, a telegram from heaven. But we reply that the telegram
          was untrue, for it asserted that his body had risen from the tomb. The
          tomb was empty and the linen cloths showed an orderly departure. Jesus
          himself denied that he was a bodiless spirit: “a spirit hath not flesh
          and bones, as ye see me having” (Luk_24:39). Did “his flesh see
          corruption” (Act_2:31)? Was the penitent thief raised from the dead as
          much as he? Godet, Lectures in Defence of the Christian Faith, lect.
          i: A dilemma for those who deny the fact of Christ’s resurrection:
          Either his body remained in the hands of his disciples, or it was
          given up to the Jews. If the disciples retained it, they were
          impostors: but this is not maintained by modern rationalists. If the
          Jews retained it, why did they not produce it as conclusive evidence
          against the disciples?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The Vision-theory of Renan. Jesus died, and there was no
          objective appearance even of his spirit. Mary Magdalene was the victim
          of subjective hallucination, and her hallucination became contagious.
          This was natural because the Jews expected that the Messiah would work
          miracles and would rise from the dead. We reply that the disciples did
          not expect Jesus’ resurrection. The women went to the sepulchre, not
          to see a risen Redeemer, but to embalm a dead body. Thomas and those
          at Emmaus had given up all hope. Four hundred years had passed since
          the days of miracles; John the Baptist “did no miracle” (Joh_10:41);
          the Sadducees said “there is no resurrection” (Mat_22:23). There were
          thirteen different appearances, to: 1. the Magdalen; 2. other women;
          3. Peter; 4. Emmaus; 5. the Twelve; 6. the Twelve after eight days; 7.
          Galilee seashore; 8. Galilee mountain; 9. Galilee five hundred; 10.
          James; 11. ascension at Bethany; 12. Stephen; 13. Paul on way to
          Damascus. Paul describes Christ’s appearance to him as something
          objective, and he implies that Christ’s previous appearances to others
          were objective also: “last of all [ these bodily appearances],.… he
          appeared to me also” (1Co_15:8). Bruce, Apologetics, 396—“Paul’s
          interest and intention in classing the two together was to level his
          own vision [ of Christ ] up to the objectivity of the early
          Christophanies. He believed that the eleven, that Peter in particular,
          had seen the risen Christ with the eye of the body, and he meant to
          claim for himself a vision of the same kind.” Paul’s was a sane,
          strong nature. Subjective visions do not transform human lives; the
          resurrection moulded the apostles; they did not create the
          resurrection (see Gore, Incarnation, 76). These appearances soon
          ceased, unlike the law of hallucinations, which increase in frequency
          and intensity. It is impossible to explain the ordinances, the Lord’s
          day, or Christianity itself, if Jesus did not rise from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resurrection of our Lord teaches three important lessons: (1) It
          showed that his work of atonement was completed and was stamped with
          the divine approval; (2) It showed him to be Lord of all and gave the
          one sufficient external proof of Christianity; (3) It furnished the
          ground and pledge of our own resurrection, and thus “brought life and
          immortality to light” (2Ti_1:10). It must be remembered that the
          resurrection was the one sign upon which Jesus himself staked his
          claims—“the sign of Jonah” (Luk_11:29); and that the resurrection is
          proof, not simply of God’s power, but of Christ’s own power:
          Joh_10:18—“I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
          again”; Joh_2:19—“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
          it up”.…21—“he spake of the temple of his body.” See Alexander, Christ
          and Christianity, 9, 158–224, 302; Mill, Theism, 216; Auberlen, Div.
          Revelation, 56; Boston Lectures, 203–239; Christlieb, Modern Doubt and

        <p>6. Counterfeit Miracles.</p>
        <p>
          Since only an act directly wrought by God can properly be called a
          miracle, it follows that surprising events brought about by evil
          spirits or by men, through the use of natural agencies beyond our
          knowledge, are not entitled to this appellation. The Scriptures
          recognize the existence of such, but denominate them “lying wonders”
          (2Th_2:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          These counterfeit miracles in various ages argue that the belief in
          miracles is natural to the race, and that somewhere there must exist
          the true. They serve to show that not all supernatural occurrences are
          divine, and to impress upon us the necessity of careful examination
          before we accept them as divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          False miracles may commonly be distinguished from the true by (a)
          their accompaniments of immoral conduct or of doctrine contradictory
          to truth already revealed—as in modern spiritualism; (b) their
          internal characteristics of inanity and extravagance—as in the
          liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, or the miracles of the
          Apocryphal New Testament; (c) the insufficiency of the object which
          they are designed to further—as in the case of Apollonius of Tyana, or
          of the miracles said to accompany the publication of the doctrines of
          the immaculate conception and of the papal infallibility; (d) their
          lack of substantiating evidence—as in mediaeval miracles, so seldom
          attested by contemporary and disinterested witnesses; (e) their denial
          or undervaluing of God’s previous revelation of himself in nature—as
          shown by the neglect of ordinary means, in the cases of Faithcure and
          of so-called Christian Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only what is valuable is counterfeited. False miracles presuppose the
          true. Fisher, Nature and Method of Revelation, 283—“The miracles of
          Jesus originated faith in him, while mediæval miracles follow
          established faith. The testimony of the apostles was given in the face
          of incredulous Sadducees. They were ridiculed and maltreated on
          account of it. It was no time for devout dreams and the invention of
          romances.” The blood of St. Januarius at Naples is said to be
          contained in a vial, one side of which is of thick glass, while the
          other side is of thin. A similar miracle was wrought at Hales in
          Gloucestershire. St. Alban, the first martyr of Britain, after his
          head is cut off, carries it about in his hand. In Ireland the place is
          shown where St. Patrick in the fifth century drove all the toads and
          snakes over a precipice into the nether regions. The legend however
          did not become current until some hundreds of years after the saint’s
          bones had crumbled to dust at Saul, near Downpatrick (see Hemphill,
          Literature of the Second Century, 180–182). Compare the story of the
          book of Tobit (6–8), which relates the expulsion of a demon by smoke
          from the burning heart and liver of a fish caught in the Tigris, and
          the story of the Apocryphal New Testament (I, Infancy), which tells of
          the expulsion of Satan in the form of a mad dog from Judas by the
          child Jesus. On counterfeit miracles in general, see Mozley, Miracles,
          15, 161; F. W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 72; A. S. Farrar,
          Science and Theology, 208; Tholuck, Vermischte Schriften, 1:27; Hodge,
          Syst. Theol., 1:630; Presb. Rev., 1881:687–719.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some modern writers have maintained that the gift of miracles still
          remains in the church. Bengel: “The reason why many miracles are not
          now wrought is not so much because faith is established, as because
          unbelief reigns.” Christlieb: “It is the want of faith in our age
          which is the greatest hindrance to the stronger and more marked
          appearance of that miraculous power which is working here and there in
          quiet concealment. Unbelief is the final and most important reason for
          the retrogression of miracles.” Edward Irving, Works, 5:464—“Sickness
          is sin apparent in the body, the presentiment of death, the forerunner
          of corruption. Now, as Christ came to destroy death, and will yet
          redeem the body from the bondage of corruption, if the church is to
          have a first fruits or earnest of this power, it must be by receiving
          power over diseases that are the first fruits and earnest of death.”
          Dr. A. J. Gordon, in his Ministry of Healing, held to this view. See
          also Boys, Proofs of the Miraculous in the Experience of the Church;
          Bushnell, Nature and the Supernatural, 446–492; Review of Gordon, by
          Vincent, in Presb. Rev., 1883:473–502; Review of Vincent, in Presb.
          Rev., 1884:49–79.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reply to the advocates of faith-cure in general, we would grant
          that nature is plastic in God’s hand; that he can work miracle when
          and where it pleases him; and that he has given promises which, with
          certain Scriptural and rational limitations, encourage believing
          prayer for healing in cases of sickness. But we incline to the belief
          that in these later ages God answers such prayer, not by miracle, but
          by special providence, and by gifts of courage, faith and will, thus
          acting by his Spirit directly upon the soul and only indirectly upon
          the body. The laws of nature are generic volitions of God, and to
          ignore them and disuse means is presumption and disrespect to God
          himself. The Scripture promise to faith is always expressly or
          impliedly conditioned upon our use of means: we are to work out our
          own salvation, for the very reason that it is God who works in us; it
          is vain for the drowning man to pray, so long as he refuses to lay
          hold of the rope that is thrown to him. Medicines and physicians are
          the rope thrown to us by God; we cannot expect miraculous help, while
          we neglect the help God has already given us; to refuse this help is
          practically to deny Christ’s revelation in nature. Why not live
          without eating, as well as recover from sickness without medicine?
          Faith-feeding is quite as rational as faith-healing. To except cases
          of disease from this general rule as to the use of means has no
          warrant either in reason or in Scripture. The atonement has purchased
          complete salvation, and some day salvation shall be ours. But death
          and depravity still remain, not as penalty, but as chastisement. So
          disease remains also. Hospitals for Incurables, and the deaths even of
          advocates of faith-cure, show that they too are compelled to recognize
          some limit to the application of the New Testament promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of the preceding discussion we must regard the so-called
          Christian Science as neither Christian nor scientific. Mrs. Mary Baker
          G. Eddy denies the authority of all that part of revelation which God
          has made to man in nature, and holds that the laws of nature may be
          disregarded with impunity by those who have proper faith; see G. F.
          Wright, in Bib. Sac., April, 1899:375. Bishop Lawrence of
          Massachusetts: “One of the errors of Christian Science is its neglect
          of accumulated knowledge, of the fund of information stored up for
          these Christian centuries. That knowledge is just as much God’s gift
          as is the knowledge obtained from direct revelation. In rejecting
          accumulated knowledge and professional skill, Christian Science
          rejects the gift of God.” Most of the professed cures of Christian
          Science are explicable by the influence of the mind upon the body,
          through hypnosis or suggestion; (see A. A. Bennett, in Watchman, Feb.
          13, 1903). Mental disturbance may make the mother’s milk a poison to
          the child; mental excitement is a common cause of indigestion; mental
          depression induces bowel disorders; depressed mental and moral
          conditions render a person more susceptible to grippe, pneumonia,
          typhoid fever. Reading the account of an accident in which the body is
          torn or maimed, we ourselves feel pain in the same spot; when the
          child’s hand is crushed, the mother’s hand, though at a distance,
          becomes swollen; the mediæval stigmata probably resulted from
          continuous brooding upon the sufferings of Christ (see Carpenter,
          Mental Physiology, 676–690).
        </p>
        <p>
          But mental states may help as well as harm the body. Mental expectancy
          facilitates cure in cases of sickness. The physician helps the patient
          by inspiring hope and courage. Imagination works wonders, especially
          in the case of nervous disorders. The diseases said to be cured by
          Christian Science are commonly of this sort. In every age fakirs,
          mesmerists, and quacks have availed themselves of these underlying
          mental forces. By inducing expectancy, imparting courage, rousing the
          paralyzed will, they have indirectly caused bodily changes which have
          been mistaken for miracle. Tacitus tell us of the healing of a blind
          man by the Emperor Vespasian. Undoubted cures have been wrought by the
          royal touch in England. Since such wonders have been performed by
          Indian medicine-men, we canaot regard them as having any specific
          Christian character, and when, as in the present case, we find them
          used to aid in the spread of false doctrine with regard to sin,
          Christ, atonement, and the church, we must class them with the “lying
          wonders” of which we are warned in 2Th_2:9. See Harris, Philosophical
          Basis of Theism, 381–386; Buckley, Faith-Healing, and in Century
          Magazine, June, 1886:221–236; Bruce, Miraculous Element in Gospels,
          lecture 8; Andover Review, 1887:249–264.
