        <h2>II. On the Adversaries and Defenders of the Doctrine</h2>
        <h2>
          XLIV. Who are the divines that have impugned the doctrine of the
          divine inspiration?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We have one general remark to make before enumerating them here,
          namely, that with the single exception of Theodore of Mopsuestia, that
          philosophical divine whose numerous writings, so strongly tainted with
          Pelagianism, were condemned for their Nestorianism in the fifth
          œcumenical council (Constantinople, 553), and whose principles on the
          divine inspiration were very loose,—with the exception, we say, of
          Theodore of Mopsuestia, it has been found impossible to produce, in
          the long course of the EIGHT FIRST CENTURIES OF CHRISTIANITY, a single
          doctor who has disowned the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures,
          unless it be in the bosom of the most violent heresies that have
          tormented the Christian Church; that is to say, among the Gnostics,
          the Manicheans, the Anomeans, and the Mahometans. St Jerome himself,
          who sometimes permitted himself, while speaking of the style of
          certain parts of the sacred books, to use a language whose temerity
          will be censured by all pious persons, nevertheless maintains, even
          for such passages, the entire inspiration of all the parts of the
          sacred Scripture;2 and in that he further sees, under what he calls
          the grossness of the language and the seeming absurdity of the
          reasonings, intentions on the part of the Holy Spirit full of profound
          art and wisdom. And if, transporting ourselves from the days of St
          Jerome to four hundred years farther down, we come to the celebrated
          Agobard, who is alleged by Dr Du Pin to have been the first of the
          fathers of the Church that abandoned the doctrine of a verbal
          inspiration, it is most unjustly, says Dr Rudelbach, that such a
          charge has been brought against that bishop. It is true, that in
          disputing with the Abbot Fredigise,4 touching the latitude to be
          allowed to Latin translators of the sacred text, he maintains that the
          dignity of the Word of God consists in the force of meaning, not in
          the pomp of words; but he took care to add, that the authority of the
          apostles and the prophets remains intact, and that no one is permitted
          to believe that they could have placed a letter otherwise than they
          have done; for their authority is stronger than heaven and earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, then, we would class, in the order of time, the men who
          controverted the entire divine inspiration of our sacred books, we
          must place:—
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2d century, the Gnostics (Valentine, Cerdo, Marcio, his
          disciple, &c.) They believed in two equal principles, independent,
          contrary, and co-eternal; the one good and the other bad; the one the
          father of Jesus Christ, and the other the author of the law; and,
          entertaining this idea, they rejected the Pentateuch, at the same time
          admitting no more of the New Testament than the gospel of Luke, and
          part of Paul's epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 3d century Manes or Manicheus, who, calling himself the
          paraclete promised by Jesus Christ, corrected the books of the
          Christians, and added his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 4th century, the Anomeans or Ultra-Arians (for Arius himself
          held a more reserved language), who maintained, with their leader
          Ætius, that the Son, a created intelligence, unlike to the Father,
          took to himself a human body without a human soul. They spoke of the
          Scriptures with an irreverence tantamount to the denial of their
          entire inspiration. "When pressed with Scriptural reasons," says St
          Epiphanius, "they escape by saying: That it was as a man that the
          apostle said those things;" or, "Why do you bring the Old Testament
          against me?" And what does the holy bishop add? "It was to be expected
          that those who denied the glory of Christ, should deny still more that
          of the apostles."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 5th century, Theodore of Mopsuestia, chief of the Antioch
          school, an able philosopher, and learned but rash divine. All that
          remains to us of his numerous works, is some fragments only, preserved
          to us by other authors. His books, as we have said, were condemned
          (two hundred years after his death) at the Council of Constantinople.
          There were quoted there, for example, his writings against
          Appollinarius, in which he had said that the book of Job is merely a
          poem derived from a pagan source; that Solomon had no doubt received
          λόγον γνώσεως, but not λόγον σοφίας; that the Song of Songs is but a
          long and insignificant epithalamium, without any character
          prophetical, historical, or scientific, and in the manner of the
          Symposion of Plato, etc, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 7th century, Mahomet (whose false religion is nothing more than
          a heresy of Christianity, and who speaks of Christ at least as
          honourably as most part of the Socinians have done,)—Mahomet
          acknowledged, and often quoted as inspired, the books of the Old and
          New Testament; but he said they had been corrupted, and, like Manes,
          he added his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 12th and 13th centuries, as it would appear, there sprang up
          and took a regular shape, first among the Talmudist Jews, the system
          of those modern doctors who have thought fit to class the various
          passages of holy Scripture under various orders of inspiration, and to
          reduce the divine inspiration to more or less natural proportions. It
          was under the double influence of the Aristotelian philosophy, and of
          the theology of the Talmud, that the Jews of the middle ages,
          differing much in this from the ancient Jews,2 imagined this theory.
          That was the time of the Solomon Jarchis, the David Kimchis, the
          Averroeses, the Aben-Ezras, the Joseph Albos; and above all of Moses
          Maimonides, that Spanish Jew who has been called the eagle of the
          doctors. Maimonides, borrowing the vague terms of the peripatetic
          philosophy, taught that prophecy is not an exclusive product of the
          action of the Holy Ghost. Just, says he, as, if the intellectus agens
          (the intellectual influence that is in man) associate itself more
          intimately with reason, there results from it the secta sapientum
          speculatorum; and as, if that agent operates more on the imagination,
          there results from it the secta politicorum, legislatorum,
          divinatorum, et præstigiatorum; so also, when this superior principle
          exercises its action in a more perfect manner on those two faculties
          of the soul at once, the result is the secta prophetarum. Almost all
          the modern Jewish doctors have adopted the ideas of Maimonides; and
          there, also, seems to have originated Schleiermacher's modern system
          of inspiration. It is in starting from these principles that the
          doctors have admitted several degrees of inspiration in the prophets.
          Of these, Maimonides reckoned sometimes eight, sometimes eleven.
          Joseph Albo reduced them to four, and Abarbanel to three. They applied
          these distinctions of different degrees of inspiration to the division
          of the Old Testament into Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa (וכתובים
          נביאים תודה). The kethubim, according to him, had not received the
          prophetic spirit (נבואה רוח), but only the Holy Spirit (רוח הקדש),
          which, according to him, was no more than a human faculty, by means of
          which a man pronounced words of wisdom and holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern German school of the adversaries of inspiration, seems
          accordingly to be a mere reproduction of the theory of the rabbins of
          the 13th century, or a borrowing from the Talmudist doctors of our own
          days.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 16th century, Socinus and Castellio3 maintained that the sacred
          writers sometimes show a failure of memory, and might err on subjects
          of slight importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 17th century, three orders of adversaries, according to the
          celebrated Turretine, combated inspiration. These were, besides the
          infidels properly so-called (atheos et gentiles): 1. the fanatics
          (enthusiastœ), who charged Scripture with imperfection in order to
          exalt their own particular revelations; 2. those of the Pope's sect
          (pontificii), who scrupled not, says he, to betray the cause of
          Christianity by alleging the corruption of the original text
          (fontium), in order to exalt their Vulgate translation; 3. The
          rationalists of different classes (libertini), who, without going out
          of the Church, unceasingly attempted to shake the authority of the
          Scriptures, by pointing to difficult passages and apparent
          contradictions (ἄπορα καὶ ἐναντιοφανῆ).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the latter half of the 18th century, this last class of adversaries
          became very numerous in Germany. Semler gave the first impulsion to
          what he called the liberal interpretation of the Scriptures; he
          rejected all inspiration, denied all prophecy, and treated all miracle
          as allegory and exaggeration. Ammon, more lately, laid down positive
          rules for this impious manner of explaining the miraculous facts.2 The
          writings of a legion of doctors no less daring, Paulus, Gabler,
          Schuster, Restig, and many others, abound in practical applications of
          these principles. Eichhorn, more recently still, has reduced into
          system the rationalist doctrine of prophecy. De Wette, in his
          Preliminary Manual, appears not to see any true prediction in the
          prophets, and not to find any difference between those of Israel and
          those of the Pagan nations, beyond the spirit of morality and
          sincerity which characterises monotheism, and which, says he, purified
          Hebrew prophecy, while it was wanting to the seers among the pagans.
          Hug, in his Introduction to the New Testament Scriptures,5 nowhere
          speaks of inspiration. Michaelis admits it for a part of the
          Scriptures, and rejects it for the other. So did John Leclerc in the
          last century. Rosenmüller is still more wavering in his sentiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of late years, however, there have been German divines more
          reverentially inclined, who have admitted different degrees of
          inspiration in the different parts of the Scriptures; by
          distinguishing the passages which do not relate, say they, to
          salvation; and making bold to see in them, as Socinus and Castellio
          did of old, slips of memory, and errors, on subjects which, in their
          eyes, seemed of little importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the English, too, there have been seen, of late years, persons
          otherwise respectable, who have allowed themselves to range the
          sentences of God's Word under different classes of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XLV. Can many illustrious doctors of the Church be mentioned as
            maintaining the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the uniform doctrine of THE WHOLE CHURCH down to the days of the
          Reformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hardly," says Rudelbach, "is there a single point with regard to
          which there reigned, in the eight first ages of the Church, a greater
          or more cordial unanimity."
        </p>
        <p>
          To the reader who wishes to consult these testimonies of history, we
          recommend the dissertation lately published on this subject by the
          learned doctor of Glogau, already mentioned. The author, commencing
          with a review of the first eight hundred years of the Christian era,
          establishes the following principles there, by very numerous
          quotations from the Greek and Latin fathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The ancient Church, with one unanimous voice, teaches that all the
          canonical writings of the Old and New Testaments ARE GIVEN BY THE HOLY
          SPIRIT of God; and it is on this sole foundation (and independently of
          the fragmentary information that human imperfection may acquire from
          them) that the Church founded her faith on the perfection of the
          Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The ancient Church, following out this first principle, no less
          firmly maintains the INFALLIBILITY of the Scriptures as their
          sufficiency (αὐτάρκειαν) and their plenitude. She attributes to their
          sacred authors not only axiopistia, to wit, a fully deserved
          credibility, but also autopistia, to wit, a right to be believed,
          independently of their circumstances or of their personal qualities,
          and on account of the infallible and celestial authority which caused
          them to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The ancient Church, viewing the whole Scripture as an utterance, on
          the part of God, addressed to man, and dictated by the Holy Ghost, has
          ever maintained that there is NOTHING ERRONEOUS, nothing useless,
          nothing superfluous there; and that in this divine work, as in that of
          creation, one may always recognise, amid the richest plenty, the
          greatest and the wisest economy. Every word there will be found to
          have its object, its point of view, its sphere of efficacy. "Nihil
          otiosum, nec sine signo, neque sine argumento apud eum."—(Irenæus);
          πᾶν ῥῆμα … ἐργαζόμενον τὸ ἑαυτοῦ ἔργον.— (Origen.) It is in vigorously
          establishing and defending both these characters of the Scriptures,
          that the ancient Church has shown the elevated and profound idea she
          entertained of their divine inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The ancient Church has always maintained that the doctrine of holy
          Scripture is the SAME THROUGHOUT, and that the Spirit of the Lord
          gives utterance in every part of it to one and the same testimony. She
          vigorously opposed that science, falsely so called (1 Tim. 6:20),
          which even in the first ages of her history, had taken a regular shape
          in the doctrines of the Gnostics, and which, daring to impute
          imperfection to the Old Testament, made it appear that there were
          contradictions between one apostle and another apostle, where there
          were really none.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The ancient Church thought that inspiration ought chiefly to be
          viewed, it is true, as a passive state, but as a state in which the
          human faculties, FAR FROM BEING EXTINGUISHED or set aside by the
          action of the Holy Ghost, were exalted by his virtue, and filled with
          his light. She has often compared the soul of the prophets and of the
          apostles to "a stringed instrument, which the Holy Ghost put in
          motion, in order to draw out of it the divine harmonies of life."—
          (Athenagoras.) "What they had to do, was simply to submit themselves
          to the powerful action of the Holy Ghost, so that, touched by his
          celestial influence, the harp, though human, might reveal to us the
          knowledge of the mysteries of heaven."—(Justin Martyr.) But, in their
          view, this harp, entirely passive as it was as respects the action of
          God, was the heart of a man, the soul of a man, the understanding of a
          man, renewed by the Holy Ghost, and filled with divine life.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The ancient Church, while it maintained that there was this
          continued action on the part of the Holy Ghost in the composition of
          the Scriptures, strenuously repelled the false notions which certain
          doctors, particularly among the Montanists, sought to propagate
          respecting the activity of the Spirit of God, and the passiveness of
          the spirit of man in divine inspiration; as if the prophet, ceasing to
          have the mastery of his senses, had been in the state which the pagans
          attributed to their sibyls (μανίᾳ or ἐκστάσει). While the
          Cataphrygians held that an inspired man, under the powerful influence
          of the divine virtue, loses his senses (excidit sensu, adumbratus,
          silicet, virtute divina), the ancient Church maintained, on the
          contrary, that the prophet DOES NOT SPEAK IN A STATE OF ECSTASY (non
          loquitur in ἐκστάσει,) and that one may distinguish by this trait
          false prophets from the true. This was the doctrine held by Origen
          against Celsus (lib. vii. c. 4); as also of Miltiades, of Tertullian,
          of Epiphanius, of Chrysostom, of Basil, and of Jerome, against the
          Montanists.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The ancient Church in her endeavours, by means of OTHER
          DEFINITIONS, which we shall not indicate here, to give greater
          clearness to the idea of divine inspiration, and to disentangle it
          from the difficulties with which it was sometimes obscured, still
          further showed how much she cherished this doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The ancient Church thought that if the name of action on the part
          of God is to be applied to inspiration, it must be understood to
          extend TO WORDS as well as to things.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. The ancient Church, by her constant MODE OF QUOTING the Scriptures,
          in order to the establishment and defence of her doctrines; by her
          manner, too, of EXPOUNDING and COMMENTING on them; and, in fine, by
          the USE which she recommends all Christians, without exception, to
          make of them as a privilege and a duty; the ancient Church, by these
          three habitual practices, shows, still more strongly, if it be
          possible, than she could have done by direct declarations, how
          profoundly attached she was to the doctrine of a verbal inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is not only by her exposition of the Word that the ancient
          Church shows us to what point she held the entire inspiration of the
          Scriptures, as an incontrovertible axiom; she will show you this still
          more strongly, if you will follow her while she is engaged IN
          RECONCILING THE apparent CONTRADICTIONS sometimes presented by the
          Gospel narratives. After having made an essay of some explanation, she
          does not insist upon it; but hastens to conclude, that whatever be its
          validity, there necessarily exists some method of reconciling those
          passages, and that the difficulty is only apparent, because the cause
          of that difficulty lies in our ignorance, and not in Scripture.
          "Whether it be so, or otherwise (she says with Julius Africanus), it
          matters not, the Gospel remains entirely true (τὸ μέντοι ἐυαγγέλιον
          πάντως ἀληθεύει)! This is her invariable conclusion as to the perfect
          solubility of all the difficulties that one can present to her in the
          Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. The ancient Church was so strongly attached to the doctrine of the
          personality of the Holy Spirit, and of his sovereign action in the
          composition of the whole Scriptures, that she made no difficulty in
          admitting at one and the same time the greatest variety and the
          GREATEST LIBERTY in the phenomena, in the occasions, in the persons,
          in the characters, and in all the external circumstances, under the
          concurrence of which that work of God was accomplished. At the same
          time that she owned with St Paul, that in all the operations of this
          Spirit, it is one and the self-same Spirit that divideth to every man
          severally as he will (1 Cor. 12:11), she equally admitted that in the
          work of divine inspiration, the divine causation was exercised amid a
          large amount of liberty, as respects human manifestations. And be it
          carefully remarked, that you will nowhere find, in the ancient Church,
          a certain class of doctors adopting one of these points of view (that
          of the divine causation and sovereignty), and another class of doctors
          attaching themselves exclusively to another (that of human
          personality, and of the diversity of the writer's occasions,
          affections, intelligence, style, and other circumstances). "If this
          were so," says Rudelbach, "one might justly accuse us of having
          ourselves forced the solution of the problem, instead of faithfully
          exhibiting the views of the ancient Church." But no; on the contrary,
          you will often see one and the same author exhibit, at once and
          without scruple, both of these points of view: the action of God and
          the personality of man. This is what we see, for example, abundantly
          in Jerome, who, even when speaking of the specialties of the sacred
          writers, never abandons the idea of a word introduced by God into
          their minds. This we farther remark in Irenæus, who, while he insists
          more than any one else on the action of God in the inspiration of the
          Scriptures, is the first of the fathers of the Church that relates in
          detail the personal circumstances of the Evangelists. This is what you
          will find again in St Augustine; this is what you will see even in the
          father of Ecclesiastical History, Eusebius of Cæsarea, who gives so
          many details on the four authors of the Gospels, and who,
          nevertheless, professes the most rigorous principles on the plenary
          inspiration of the Canonical Scriptures.

          11. The ancient Church shows us more completely still, by two other
          traits, the idea she had formed of divine inspiration, by the care she
          took, on the one hand, TO FIX THE RELATIONS which the doctrine of
          divine inspiration bore to the doctrine of the gifts of grace; and, on
          the other, TO EXHIBIT THE PROOFS of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fine, although the ancient Church presents this spontaneous
          (ungesuchte) and universal agreement in the doctrine of inspiration,
          we must not imagine that this great phenomenon is attached, as some
          have been fain to say, to some particular system of theology, or may
          be explained by that system. No more must we regard this wonderful
          agreement as the germ of a theory that was to establish it, at a later
          period in the Church. No. The very assertions of an opposite opinion
          which, from time to time, made themselves heard on the part of the
          heretics of the first centuries, and the NATURE OF THE REPLIES that
          were put forth by the ancient Church, clearly demonstrate, on the
          contrary, that this doctrine was deeply rooted in the Church's
          conscience. Every time that the fathers, in defending any truth by
          passages from Scripture, succeeded so far as to drive their
          adversaries into the impossibility of defending themselves, otherwise
          than by denying the full inspiration of the divine testimonies, the
          Church thought the question was decided. The adversary was tried; he
          had no more to say for himself; he denied the Scripture to be the Word
          of God! What more remained to be done, but to compel him to look his
          own ill-favoured argument in the face, and to say to him, See what you
          have come to! as one would bid a man who has disfigured himself, look
          at himself in a glass? And this the fathers did.
        </p>
        <p>Such are facts of the case; such is the voice of the Church.</p>

          We had at first brought together, with the design of giving them here,
          a long series of passages, taken first from Irenæus, Tertullian,2
          Cyprian, Origen,4 Chrysostom, Justin Martyr,6 Epiphanius, Augustine,8
          Athanasius, Hilary,10 Basil the Great, and Gregory the Great,12
          Gregory of Nyssa, Theodoret,14 Cyril of Alexandria; then, the most
          revered fathers of after centuries; and, finally, the most holy
          doctors of the Reformation.16 But we soon perceived that all these
          names, were we to give them by themselves, would seem nothing better
          than an idle appeal to the authority of men; and were we to give them
          along with the passages referred to, in full, we should run into an
          excessive multiplication of words.

          We shall proceed, therefore, with a careful examination of the
          difficulties and the systems that are opposed to the doctrine of a
          plenary inspiration. Those difficulties constitute what are
          objections, and those systems what are rather evasions. The two next
          chapters we shall devote to the study of both.
