        <h2>II. All the Prophetic Utterances are given by God</h2>
        <p>
          St Peter in his second epistle, at the close of the first chapter,
          thus expresses himself: "Knowing this first, that no Scripture is of
          any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by
          the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the
          Holy Ghost."—Note on this passage:
        </p>
        <p>1. That it relates to written revelations (προφητεία γραφῆς);</p>
        <p>
          2. That never (οὐ ποτὲ) did any of these come through the impulsion or
          the government of a will of man;
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That it was as urged or moved by the Holy Ghost that those holy men
          wrote and spoke;
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Finally, that their writings are called by the name of prophecy. It
          will be proper then, before we proceed farther, to have the scriptural
          meaning of these words prophecy, prophesy, prophet (כיאִנָ), precisely
          determined; because it is indispensable for the investigation with
          which we are occupied, that this be known, and because the knowledge
          of it will throw much light on the whole question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Various and often very inaccurate meanings have been given to the
          biblical term prophet; but an attentive examination of the passages in
          which it is employed, will soon convince us that it constantly
          designates, in the Scriptures, "a man whose mouth utters the words of
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the Greeks, this name was at first given only to the interpreter
          and the organ of the vaticinations pronounced in the temples (ἐξηγητὴς
          ἔνθεων μαντείων). This sense of the word is fully explained by a
          passage in the Timæus of Plato. The most celebrated prophets of pagan
          antiquity were those of Delphos. They conducted the Pythoness to the
          tripod, and were charged with the interpretation of the oracles of the
          god, or the putting of them into writing. And it was only afterwards,
          by an extension of this its first meaning, that the name of prophet
          was given among the Greeks to poets, who, commencing their songs with
          an invocation of Apollo and the Muses, were deemed to give utterance
          to the language of the gods, and to speak under their inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          A prophet, in the Bible, is a man, then, in whose mouth God puts the
          words which he wishes to be heard upon earth; and it was farther by
          allusion to the fulness of this meaning that God said to Moses, that
          Aaron should be his prophet unto Pharaoh, according as he had told him
          (at chap. iv. ver. 16): "He shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and
          thou shalt be to him instead of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, in Scripture, how the prophets testify of the Spirit that makes
          them speak, and of the wholly divine authority of their words: you
          will ever find in their language one uniform definition of their
          office, and of their inspiration. They speak; it is, no doubt, their
          voice that makes itself heard; it is their person that is agitated; it
          is, no doubt, their soul also that often is moved;—but their words are
          not only theirs; they are, at the same time, the words of Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The mouth of the Lord hath spoken;"—"the Lord hath spoken," they say
          unceasingly.—"I will open my mouth in the midst of them," saith the
          Lord to his servant Ezekiel.—"The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and
          his word was in my tongue," said the royal psalmist.2—"Hear the word
          of the Lord!" It is thus that the prophets announce what they are
          about to say.—"Then was the word of the Lord upon me," is what they
          often say.—"The word of God came unto Shemaiah;"—"the word of God came
          to Nathan;"—"the word of God came unto John in the wilderness;"4—"the
          word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord;"—"the burden of the word of
          the Lord by Malachi;"6—"the word of the Lord that came unto
          Hosea;"—"In the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord by
          Haggai, the prophet."8
        </p>
        <p>
          This word came down upon the men of God when it pleased, and often in
          the most unlooked-for manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus that God, when he sent Moses, said to him, "I will be with
          thy mouth;" and that, when he made Balaam speak, "he put a word in
          Balaam's mouth."10 The apostles, too, quoting a passage from David in
          their prayer, express themselves in these words: "Thou, Lord, hast
          said by the mouth of thy servant David." And St Peter, addressing the
          multitude of the disciples: "Men and brethren, this scripture must
          needs have been fulfilled, which the HOLY GHOST, BY THE MOUTH OF
          DAVID, spake before concerning Judas." The same apostle also, in the
          holy place, under Solomon's porch, cried to the people of Jerusalem,
          "But those things which God before HAD SHOWED BY THE MOUTH OF ALL HIS
          PROPHETS, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the view of the apostles, then, David in his psalms, and all the
          prophets in their writings, whatever might be the pious emotions of
          their souls, were only the mouth of the Holy Ghost. It was David WHO
          SPOKE; it was the prophets WHO SHOWED; but it was also God THAT SPAKE
          BY THE MOUTH of David, his servant; it was God WHO SHOWED BY THE MOUTH
          of all his prophets.—(Acts 1:16, 3:18, 21, 4:25.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And, yet again, let the reader be so good as carefully to examine, as
          it stands in the Greek, that expression which recurs so often in the
          Gospel, and which is so conclusive, "That it might be fulfilled which
          was spoken BY THE PROPHET,—(and even) which was spoken OF THE LORD BY
          THE PROPHET, (ΔΙΑ τοῦ προφήτου,—and even, ΥΠΟ τοῦ Κυριου ΔΙΑ το ̀ ῦ
          προφήτου), saying." …
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in a quite analogous sense that holy scripture gives the name of
          prophets and of false prophets to impostors, who lied among the
          Gentiles, in the temples of the false gods, whether they were only
          common cheats, falsely pretending to visions from God, or whether they
          were really the mouth or an occult power, of a malevolent angel, of a
          spirit of Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is, farther, in the same sense that St Paul, in quoting a verse
          of Epimenides, a poet, priest, and soothsayer among the Cretans,
          called him "one of their prophets;" because all the Greeks consulted
          him as an oracle; because Nicias was sent into Crete by the Athenians
          to fetch him to purify their city; and because Aristotle, Strabo,
          Suidas,2 and Diogenes Laertius, tell us that he undertook to foretell
          the future, and to discover things unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          From all these quotations, accordingly, it remains established, that
          in the language of the Scriptures the prophecies are "the words of God
          put into the mouth of man."
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, it is by a manifest abuse also, that in common language
          people seem to understand no more by that word than a miraculous
          prediction. The prophecies could reveal the past as well as the
          future; they denounced God's judgments; they interpreted his Word;
          they sang his praises; they consoled his people; they exhorted souls
          to holiness; they testified of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as "no prophecy came by the will of man," a prophet, as we have
          already intimated, was such only at intervals, "and as the Spirit gave
          him utterance."—(Acts 2:4)
        </p>
        <p>
          A man prophesied sometimes without foreseeing it, sometimes too
          without knowing it, and sometimes even without desiring it. I have
          said, without foreseeing it; and often at the very moment when he
          could least expect it. Such was the old prophet of Bethel.—(1 Kings
          13:20.) I have said, without knowing it; such was Caiaphas.— (John
          11:51.) Finally, I have said, without desiring it; such was Balaam,
          when, wishing three times to curse Israel, he could not, three
          successive times, make his mouth utter any words but those of
          benediction.—(Numb. 23, 24.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall give other examples to complete the demonstration of what a
          prophecy generally is, and thus to arrive at a fuller comprehension of
          the extent of the action of God in what St Peter calls written
          prophecy (προφητείαν γραφῆς).
        </p>
        <p>
          We read in the 11th of Numbers (25th to the 29th verses), that, as
          soon as the Lord made the Spirit to rest upon the seventy elders,
          "they prophesied;" but (it is added) "they did not cease." The Spirit,
          then, came upon them at an unexpected moment; and after he had thus
          "spoken by them," and his word "had been upon their tongue," (2 Sam.
          23:2), they preserved nothing more of this miraculous gift, and were
          prophets only for a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read in the First Book of Samuel (10:11), with what unforeseen
          power the Spirit of the Lord seized young king Saul at the moment
          when, as he sought for his father's she-asses, he met a company of
          prophets who came down from the holy place. "What is this that is come
          to the son of Kish," said they one to another; "Is Saul also among the
          prophets?"
        </p>
        <p>
          We read at the 19th chapter, something still more striking. Saul sends
          to Ramah men who were to take David; but no sooner did they meet
          Samuel and the company of prophets over whom he was set, than the
          Spirit of the Lord came upon these men of war, and "they also
          prophesied." Saul sends others, and "they also prophesy." Saul at last
          goes thither himself, and "he also prophesied all that day and all
          that night before Samuel." "The Spirit of God," we are told, "WAS UPON
          HIM."
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is particularly by an attentive study of the 12th and 14th
          chapters of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, that one obtains an
          exact knowledge of what the action of God, and the part assigned to
          man severally, were in prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle there gives the Church of Corinth the rules that were to
          be followed in the use of this miraculous gift. His counsels will be
          found to throw a deal of light on this important subject. One will
          then recognise at once the following facts and principles:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Holy Ghost at that time conferred upon the faithful, for the
          common advantage, a great variety of gifts (12:8–10);—to one that of
          miracles; to another that of healing; to another, discerning of
          spirits; to another, divers kinds of tongues, which the man himself
          did not understand when he spoke them; to another, the interpretation
          of tongues; to another, in fine, prophecy—that is, uttering with his
          own tongue words dictated by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. One and the selfsame Spirit divided severally as he would these
          different miraculous powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. These gifts were a just subject of Christian desire and ambition.
          (ζηλοῦτε, 14:1, 39.) But the one that was to be regarded as the most
          desirable of all, was that of prophesying; for one could speak an
          unknown tongue without edifying any body, and that miracle was "useful
          rather to the unbelievers than to believers;" whereas "he that
          prophesied spoke unto men to edification, and exhortation, and
          comfort."—(1 Cor. 14:1–3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That prophecy—that is to say, those words that fell miraculously on
          the lips that the Holy Ghost had chosen for such an office—that
          prophecy assumed very different forms. Sometimes the Spirit gave a
          psalm, sometimes a doctrine, sometimes a revelation; sometimes, too,
          it was a miraculous interpretation of that which others had
          miraculously expressed in strange tongues.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In those prophecies there was evidently a work of God and a work of
          man. They were the words of the Holy Ghost; but they were also the
          words of the prophet. It was God that spoke, but in men, by men, for
          men; and there you would have found, as on other occasions, the sound
          of their voice—perhaps also the habitual peculiarities of their
          style—perhaps, moreover, allusions to their own experience, to their
          position at the time, to their individuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. These miraculous facts continued in the primitive Church throughout
          the long career of the apostles. St Paul, who wrote his letter to the
          Corinthians twenty years after the death of Jesus Christ, speaks of
          them as a common and habitual order of things, for some time existing
          among them, and which ought still to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The prophets, although they were the mouth of God to make his words
          heard, were not, however, absolutely passive while engaged in
          prophesying.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The spirits of the prophets," says St Paul, "are subject to the
          prophets" (1 Cor. 14:32); that is to say, that the men of God, while
          his prophetic word was on their lips, could nevertheless check its
          escape by the repressive action of their own wills; nearly as a man
          suspends, when he wishes to do so, the almost involuntary course of
          his respiration. Thus, for example, if any revelation came upon one of
          those that were sitting, the first that spoke had then "to hold his
          peace, sit down, and let him speak."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now apply these principles and these facts to the prophecy of
          Scripture (τῇ προφητείᾳ γραφῆς), and to the passage of St Peter, for
          the explanation of which we have adduced them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No prophecy of the Scripture," says he "is of any private
          interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by a will of
          man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
          Ghost."—(2 Pet. 1:21.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, we have the plenary and entire inspiration of the
          Scriptures clearly established by the apostle; here we have the
          SCRIPTURE assimilated to those prophecies which we have just defined.
          It "came not by a will of man;" it is entirely dictated by the Holy
          Ghost; it gives us the very words of God; it is entirely (ἕνθεος and
          θεόπνευστος) given by the breath of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would dare then, after such declarations, to maintain, that in the
          Scriptures the expressions are not inspired? They are WRITTEN
          PROPHECIES (πᾶσα προφητεία γραφῆς). One sole difficulty, accordingly,
          is all that can any longer be opposed to our conclusion. The testimony
          and the reasoning on which it rests, are so clearly valid, that one
          can elude them only by this objection. We agree, it will be said, that
          written prophecy (προφητεία γραφῆς) has, without contradiction, been
          composed by that power of the Holy Ghost which was put forth in the
          prophets; but the rest of the book, the Epistles, the Gospels, and the
          Acts, the Proverbs, the Books of Kings, and so many other purely
          historical writings, are not entitled to be put in the same rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, let us pause; and, before replying, see clearly the extent
          of our argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          It ought already to be fully acknowledged, that all that part of the
          Scriptures at least called PROPHECY, whatever it be, has been
          completely dictated by God; so that the words as well as the thoughts
          have been given by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But who now will permit us to establish a distinction between any one
          of the books of the Bible, and all the other books? Is not all given
          by prophecy? Certainly all has equally God's warrant; this is what we
          proceed to prove.
