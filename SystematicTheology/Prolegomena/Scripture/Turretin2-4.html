        <h2>The Authority of Scripture</h2>
        <p>FOURTH QUESTION</p>
        <p><em>Are the Holy Scriptures genuine and divine? Affirmative.</em></p>
        <p>
          I. The question of the authority (authoritas) of Scripture depends
          upon its origin, which has just been discussed. Since it is from God,
          it cannot be other than genuine (authenticus) and divine. Hence arises
          the question or its authority, which can have two aspects: (1) with
          atheists and pagans (ethnici), who grant to Scripture no more
          authority than to any other writing; (2) with Christians who, while
          acknowledging [its authority], understand it as depending, at least in
          our understanding (quoad nos), on the testimony of the church. With
          the first, it must be asked whether Holy Scriptures are credible in
          themselves and divine; with the second, how this is made known to us,
          or on what testimony, above all, the authority of Scripture depends.
          Here we are discussing the first question, not the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Granted that in truth the first question seems hardly necessary
          among Christians, where it should be assumed without controversy that
          Scripture is God-breathed and the primary foundation of the faith, yet
          because there are even today among Christians too many atheists and
          libertines who seek in every way to erode this most sacred truth, it
          is of first importance for salvation that we protect our faith fully
          against the demonic scoffing of such irreligious folk.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The authority of Scripture, concerning which we are now writing,
          is nothing else than the right and dignity of the sacred books, by
          which those articles which are set forth in them to be believed are
          most worthy of faith, and those which are set forth as to be left
          undone or to be done demand obedience. The basis is the divine and
          infallible truth of the books, which have God as author, because he
          has the supreme privilege of binding mankind to faith and obedience.
          This can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. The first is the worthiness
          of faith of the Word in itself, which is always the same and which
          rests upon itself, whether human testimony supports it or not. The
          second is the opinion or judgment of people concerning Scripture,
          which differs by reason of the difference between subjects [persons].
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Further, authority (authentia) is either that of history and
          narration, or that of truth and the norm. According to the former
          whatever is told in Scripture is true as it is told, whether good or
          evil, true or false. The latter refers to matters true in themselves,
          that are communicated as the norm of faith and morals. Not everything
          in Scripture has the authority of a norm, inasmuch as words of
          blasphemous people and of the devil are recorded, but everything has
          the authority of historical truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. It is not a question of whether the sacred writers simply as human
          beings and in private matters would err. We readily concede this. Nor
          is it a question whether they could err as holy men led by the Holy
          Spirit, and in the substance, the total message. This I suppose no one
          of our adversaries, except a defender of pure atheism, will uphold.
          The question is whether in writing they were so led and inspired by
          the Holy Spirit that, with regard to both the substance and the words,
          their writings were authoritative (authenticus) and divine. The
          adversaries deny this; we affirm it.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Scripture shows itself to be divine, in an authoritative manner
          and by means of an artless argument or testimony, when it calls itself
          "God-breathed." This testimony can be used with profit in disputes
          among Christians, who themselves profess to accept [Scripture], but
          not against others who reject it. But Scripture [also shows itself to
          be divine] rationally (ratiocinative) by means of arguments
          constructed by reason, based on marks (notae) which God has impressed
          on Scripture, which carry before them the unquestionable proofs
          (argumenta) of divinity. For just as the works of God proclaim the
          incomparable excellence of their creator, seen in certain qualities
          perceived by the eyes, and as the sun becomes known by its own light,
          even so [God] wills that various rays of divinity, by which he may be
          recognized, should flow out from Scripture, which is the effluence of
          the Father of lights and the sun of righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. These marks are both extrinsic and intrinsic. The former,
          although they are insufficient for a full proof of the matter,
          nevertheless are of great weight for confirming it, and convincing
          those who deny it. [But] it is in the latter that the chief strength
          of the argument lies.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The external marks are: (1) the origin [of Scripture]: its
          primal antiquity surpassing all pagan monuments; as Tertullian said,
          "Whatever is first is most true"; (2) its survival (duratio): the
          wonders of the divine Word through the provision for its protection
          against the most powerful and hostile enemies who sought to destroy it
          by sword and fire, right down to the present day, while a multitude of
          other books, against which nothing of the kind was attempted, have
          been altogether lost; (3) its agents and writers, who showed the
          greatest candor and sincerity in writing, and did not conceal their
          failures, but openly avowed them; (4) its adjuncts: the number,
          constancy, and condition of the martyrs, who sealed it with their
          blood. For since nothing is dearer to people than life, so many
          myriads of both sexes, and of all ages and walks of life, could not
          have so willingly gone forth to death, even in its most cruel forms,
          in defense of Scripture, unless they were convinced of its divinity.
          Nor would God have cared to exercise his omnipotence in the performing
          of so many and great miracles as were performed, both under the law
          and under the gospel for producing faith in the divinity of Scripture,
          if it were merely a product of human intellect. In addition there is
          the testimony of adversaries themselves, as that of the pagans to
          Moses, of Josephus and the authors of the Talmud to Christ, and of
          Mohammed to both Testaments, which can be found in the writings of
          Vives, Plessaeus, Grotius, and others. Finally there is the consensus
          of [Christian] people, who, although they differ concerning religious
          teaching, worship, language, and behavior, yet receive this Word as a
          most precious treasury of divine truth, and hold it as the foundation
          of religion and the worship of God; nor is it credible that God would
          have permitted such a multitude of people, who sought him earnestly,
          to be deceived for so long by lying books.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. The internal marks, which are more significant, are also of many
          kinds. (1) The content (materia): the awe-inspiring sublimity of the
          mysteries such as the Trinity, the incarnation, the satisfaction of
          Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and others, which could not be
          found out by the wisdom of any mind; the holiness and purity of the
          commandments, which bring (cogo) into order the very meditations and
          inward desires of the heart and are fit to make people perfect in
          every form of virtue, and worthy of God; the certainty of the
          prophecies (oracula) concerning the most hidden and distant matters.
          Knowledge and prediction of the future, depending on the will of God
          alone, is unique to God (Numen) (Isa.41:23). (2) The style: the divine
          majesty, appearing no less in the simplicity than in the gravity, and
          that absolute uncompromising manner of laying obligation upon all
          without distinction--on both the exalted and the humble. (3) The form:
          the divine consensus and total harmony, not only between the
          Testaments, with the fulfillment of prediction and typology, but also
          between individual books of both Testaments, so much the more amazing
          in that these books were the work of many authors, who wrote at
          different times and places, so that they were unable to confer with
          one another about the matters on which they wrote. (4) The purpose:
          the aim of everything toward the glory of the one God and the holiness
          and salvation of humanity. (5) The effect: the light and efficacy of
          the divine teaching, which, with more penetrating power than a
          two-edged sword, pierces into the very soul, engenders faith and piety
          in the minds of hearers, and unfailing constancy for confessors, and
          always come forth triumphant from the reign of Satan and false
          religions. These criteria are truly such that they: cannot apply to
          any human writings, all of which bear the evidence of human weakness,
          but they truly show that Scripture is divine, especially when they are
          taken, not one at a time, but altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. It is not to be thought that these marks appear in equal force in
          all the books of Scripture. Just as one star differs from another in
          brilliance, so in this heaven of Scripture some books send forth more
          glorious and plentiful rays, others fewer and more meager ones,
          depending on whether they are more or less necessary for the church,
          and contain teachings of greater or less importance. This brilliance
          shines forth much more in the Gospels and the Epistles of Paul than in
          the Books of Ruth and Esther, but it is nonetheless certain that those
          evidences of truth and majesty, which prove them divine and
          authoritative in themselves, are in all of them, or at least that
          nothing is found in them that makes their authority doubtful.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. It is not necessary that there should be these marks in every
          pericope or verse of the canonical books, or in particular parts of
          Scripture, separated from the whole, those marks by which they can be
          distinguished from the Apocrypha. It is enough that they are present
          in the divine writings considered together and as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Granted that false religions are accustomed to use these criteria
          to vindicate their teaching, yet nonetheless the true one may ascribe
          them to itself, for the false opinion of human beings does not destroy
          the truth. Nor will a believer be unable truly to proclaim the divine
          quality of the Holy Scripture, in which he sees everywhere the most
          brilliant rays of divine truth, [merely] because a Turk falsely
          attributes this divine quality (divinitas) to his Qur'an, or a Jew
          attributes it to his Cabala, because the fictions and lies of which
          both books are altogether composed are obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Although faith rests on the authority of testimony, and not on
          scientific demonstration, it does not follow that it cannot be
          supported by intellectual arguments at times, especially when faith is
          first formed, because faith, before it believes, should (debere) have
          the clearly perceived divine quality of the witness whom it should
          believe, [known] from sure marks found in [the witness]; otherwise it
          cannot believe him. For where such grounds for believing anyone are
          lacking, the testimony of such a witness is not worthy of belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. The witness of the prophets and apostles is superior to all
          objection, and cannot be questioned by reason. For, if it were
          uncertain and fallible, this would be either because they were
          deceived or because they wished to deceive others, but neither can be
          said. (1) They were not deceived, nor could they have been. For if
          they were deceived, they were deceived either by another or by
          themselves. The former cannot be said, for [they were not deceived]
          either by God, who, just as he can be deceived by no one likewise
          cannot deceive anyone, nor by unfallen angels, nor by demons, since
          this teaching leads to the total destruction of the kingdom of the
          devil. [That they deceived themselves] is no more possible, for if
          anyone is deceived about any event, it is mainly either because he did
          not see it himself but heard from others whom he trusted, or because
          he saw it incidentally and in passing, or because it is obscure and
          too difficult for human understanding, or because the person is of
          impaired mind and limited by some pathological condition because of
          which he interprets poorly. But in this case nothing of this sort took
          place. For (1) they reported what they knew not by doubtful report or
          from others who knew imperfectly, but what they themselves knew by the
          most certain and experiential knowledge, since they were witnesses by
          eye and ear, in matters in the comprehension of which they were
          engaged with earnest concern and zeal. (2) Nor did they speak of
          remote and distant affairs, but of events which happened in their own
          time and in the place in which they wrote, as is written, "What we
          have seen with our eyes, what we have heard concerning the word of
          life, that we proclaim" (I John 1:1- 2). (3) It is not a question of
          matters that were obscure or that rested on mere speculation,
          concerning which simple and uneducated people, not comprehending their
          sublimity, might easily have been deceived, but of events that took
          place in their presence and before their eyes: for example, the
          resurrection of Christ, of whom, before his death, they were regular
          companions, and who had shown himself openly to them after his
          resurrection, not in passing, but for a significant amount of time,
          not once, but often, not before one or another individual, but before
          many of both sexes, and all walks of life. (4) Finally, it cannot be
          said that their faculties were impaired; for not only is there no
          distorted imagination or disturbed mind, but rather they give evidence
          of wisdom and sound mind in both word and life; and furthermore not
          one or another individual but many people experience and report the
          same thing. From this it follows that there is no reason why they can
          be said to have been deceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. [2] But, just as they were not deceived, neither did they wish to
          deceive. For those who deceive and lie have in mind some gain from
          lying and deception, either to receive honor (gloria), or the
          gratitude of the human race, or to gain wealth and ease. But what
          reward, either in life or in death, was sought by the men of God when
          they proclaimed this testimony? While alive, they often experienced on
          its account the very fate by which people are driven to
          deception--poverty, exile, crucifixion, and extreme torture--and,
          after death, infamy and everlasting loss. Nevertheless, disregarding
          such considerations, they, knowing the risk, did not hesitate to meet
          ultimate decisions for the sake of confirming their witness, and,
          forever dying, to undergo the most bitter humiliation and suffering.
          Who could believe that they would have been willing to bear all this
          for the sake of something they knew to be doubtful or false, when it
          was known for a certainty that anyone who took their course would meet
          loss of reputation and property, if not death? No one, surely, can
          argue that they were so enamored of a desire for lying that they did
          it in a manner at once most stupid and evil; most stupid, that they
          should want to lie not for their advantage but most certainly for
          their disadvantage, when they wrote against their very religion
          itself, which so strictly forbids lying; most evil, because in lying
          they would have sought to deceive the whole world, and, with no
          advantage for themselves, to involve everyone in evil with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Further, they could not have deceived, even if they wanted to.
          For they did not write of events that were remote and separated from
          their experience, or which took place before their time, or secretly
          and in some comer in the absence of witnesses, as those who impose on
          the masses commonly do, nor could they easily have conspired in
          falsehood. But they described events which took place in their own
          time, in public and in the light of day (coram sole), in the very
          place where they wrote, and indeed which often concerned those who had
          seen and heard what they wrote about, who would readily have detected
          fraud and deceit, if they were present. If, therefore, they were not
          deceived and did not deceive, there is no doubt but that their witness
          is sacred (divinus), and that all teaching that depends on it is
          authoritative (authenticus).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. That the prophets and apostles were such, and that they wrote
          the books attributed to them, cannot be called in question without
          destroying all belief in historical records (antiquitatis fides), and
          giving rise to total scepticism (Pyrrhonismus). It is just as possible
          to raise the question with regard to all other books that have
          survived, but since it is certain that these books were written by
          some authors, what sane person would not more readily believe that
          they were written by those whose names they bear, as the Christian
          church everywhere has always held, and over which no controversy has
          been begun either by Jews or by pagans, and which in the earliest
          times, when it was possible to know the facts, was already accepted,
          than [to believe that they were written] by somebody else?
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Anything that can be brought up to destroy faith in the Mosaic
          history can easily be refuted if examined in detail. For (1) if anyone
          should deny that Moses ever existed, or was the author of the books
          ascribed to him, he could be shown wrong without difficulty, both
          because not only Jews and Christians but also many profane writers
          acknowledge him, and also because [his authorship] has always been
          accepted by a multitude of people, nor can it be questioned on any
          ground unless we wish to overthrow historical belief altogether, and
          to deny that Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and others ever lived and wrote
          the books that bear their names, which no one except a demented person
          would maintain. Much less can this be maintained with regard to Moses
          than with regard to these others, because there is no book which the
          Jews would have had more reason to throw away, since by so doing they
          would have freed themselves from the yoke of a most burdensome law.
          But on the contrary, none has been received and preserved by them with
          greater care and enthusiasm, nor accorded, contrary to expectation,
          such authority, as it has been regarded as divine law and the norm of
          religion; certainly (sane) for no other reason than conviction
          concerning the truth contained in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. (2) Secondly, if anyone, convinced by another, gives up this
          point and admits that Moses lived and wrote the books attributed to
          him, but maintains that he was an outstanding impostor and falsifier,
          who deceived the Israelite people by empty lies and false miracles
          (prodigii), and subjected them to himself by means of the law which he
          proclaimed, such a person can be refuted no less easily. For, not to
          mention that the pagans themselves, and irreconcilable opponents like
          Porphyry (Adversus Christianos, book 4), give praise to Moses as a
          truthful writer, it cannot easily be understood how that outstanding
          wisdom and admirable character, in which the entire life of Moses
          shines, can be harmonized with such a wicked imposture, or in what way
          he would have been able to think through that marvelous law, from
          which whatever good others possess has been borrowed, which provides
          for the glory of the one God and the holiness of the people, to
          further his fraud and imposture. Further, if he were an impostor, it
          is surprising that he followed a path plainly contrary to his design,
          in which he could easily be convicted of falsification.
        </p>
        <p>
          For if the account which he gives of the origin of the world is false,
          nothing would have been easier than to demonstrate its falsity,
          because of the small number of generations which he records between
          Adam and the flood, and between the flood and the people's departure
          from Egypt, since in the time of Moses some who had seen Joseph could
          still be living, whose parents would have seen Shem, who, up to the
          hundredth year of his life could have associated with Methuselah, who
          survived to that time, and who himself had seen Adam; thus the truth
          or falsity of the matter could have been discovered without
          difficulty. (3) If Moses was an impostor, and wished to deceive the
          Israelites, he certainly hoped that the Israelites would believe his
          lies and deceptions, but how would he have been able to convince them
          of so many and such great signs as are said to have been given both in
          Egypt and in the desert, if nothing of the sort had happened?
          Especially in view of the fact that he wrote for people who would have
          been witnesses, by ear and eye, of the events, and he wrote concerning
          actions which were not performed many centuries earlier, but in that
          very time, not secretly and in some comer, and before a few witnesses
          who could easily have been corrupted, but openly and in public before
          the eyes of six hundred thousand men [Exod. 12:37], and their
          irreconcilable enemies, who would be able to describe him as a
          falsifier? Would he have been able to hope that there would be among
          the people no one who doubted these claims, or who would not inquire
          into the truth of what happened in Egypt? Is it believable that, out
          of so many people, whom he repeatedly described most bitterly as
          rebellious and ungovernable, and whom he often afflicted with the most
          painful punishments, striking with sudden death not simply hundreds,
          but thousands, and [performing] similar actions by which he could have
          most justly aroused their anger against him, there was not one who
          exposed his deceit and imposture, when all of them are seen
          complaining and rebelling so unfairly against him? Finally, if he
          engaged in imposture, he certainly took some gain from it, either
          honor or wealth, as he might have gained authority (imperium) for
          himself and his posterity, or sought praise for wisdom and heroic
          character (virtus); but both the facts themselves and the sincerity
          with which he so frankly confessed his own sin, and above all his
          failure to believe, sufficiently show how far Moses was from desire
          for riches or honor.

          XX. But perhaps the Israelites, recognizing the falsity of the
          accounts which were given by Moses, joined in deceit and imposture, in
          order to secure the greater glory of the nation. But (1) who dares
          believe that they were so senseless as to agree that they would not
          resist in such a tremendous fraud by which they were subjected to the
          unbearable (abastaktw?|/) yoke of a most burdensome law, if they were
          convinced that this law was simply the invention of Moses? Is it
          possible to assert, in any true fashion, that, of six hundred thousand
          men, all would agree in such deceit, so that not one was found who
          would set himself against such a plan? (2) So far from truth is it
          that they secured honor and praise among others by this action that,
          on the contrary, the hatred and scorn of all came upon them, rightly;
          for who would maintain that it advanced the honor of a nation to have
          its worst sins and grumblings exposed to the eyes of the world, so
          that they were shown as the most stiff-necked and ungrateful of
          mortals, and the very heavy penalties by which God punished their
          obstinacy and rebellion were recorded more than once? Who does not see
          that these facts show forever the honesty of the [Israelite] nation?
          In short, there is no reason why a people of such stiff neck and so
          fond of pleasure would so readily have sought subjection to a most
          burdensome law, one the least transgression of which was so severely
          avenged, unless they were convinced of the divine quality (divinitas)
          of the call of Moses, and of the truth of his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. The conversion of the world and the success of the gospel is a
          most striking argument for its divine quality, for unless the apostles
          were men of God and imparted heavenly truth, it is beyond
          comprehension who could have accomplished this, since their teaching
          lacked all those supports by which every human teaching is made
          popular and spread abroad, and was attacked stubbornly by those forces
          by which any teaching can be resisted: the authority of elders, the
          consensus of popular opinion, the favor of princes, the eloquence of
          orators, the subtlety of philosophers, agreement with human customs
          and inclination. [This teaching] was spread by a few ignorant and weak
          men, who were altogether foreign not only to deceit in teaching, but
          also to the appearance of it. They were not helped by the support of
          eloquence, [were] educated in no skill of pleading, [were] scorned and
          despised. By persuasion alone, without any support from authority and
          public approval, without the aid of weapons, through a thousand deaths
          and hardships and in the shortest time, [this teaching] was so spread
          to almost every place that it had overcome all obstacles, and emerged
          victor over other religions that were well furnished with all these
          supports, so that entire nations and kings themselves had embraced it,
          without hope of reward, and indeed with the certain prospect of evils
          which were absurd to reason and unwelcome to the flesh, and which
          would seem to drive people away from it rather than attract them to
          it.

          XXII. Certainty is of three kinds: (1) mathematical, (2) moral, and
          (3) theological. (1) Mathematical or metaphysical certainty consists
          of first principles known through nature and in themselves, and of
          conclusions demonstrated from such principles, such as "the whole is
          greater than any part," and "the same object cannot both exist (esse)
          and not exist at the same time." (2) Moral certainty is found in
          matters which cannot be demonstrated but which nevertheless are
          commended to belief by such most probable evidences and arguments that
          no prudent person can doubt them. [In this class are the conclusions]
          that the Aeneid was written by Virgil, and Livy's history by Livy.
          Although, to be sure, the matter is not known through itself, yet it
          is so witnessed to by unchanging report that nobody who has any
          conception of history and literature can doubt it. (3) Theological
          certainty is found in matters which, although .they cannot be
          demonstrated, nor known through themselves or by nature, and do not
          depend on most probable evidence and moral arguments, yet [depend on]
          arguments truly theological and divine, namely, divine revelation,
          which therefore produce not merely a moral and conjectural certainty,
          but a faith truly divine. Scripture does not hold (habeo) metaphysical
          certainty. If it did, the assent which we would give it would take the
          form of knowledge (scientiam), not faith. It does not hold a certainty
          simply moral and probable. If it did, our faith would be no more
          certain than the historical assent which is given to human writings.
          But it does hold a theological and infallible certainty, which cannot
          deceive the person who is faithful and illuminated by the Spirit of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. The prophets made no mistakes when they wrote inspired by God
          and as prophets, not even in matters of little significance, because
          if they did, faith in the whole of Scripture would be turned into
          doubt. But in other ways, as men, they were capable of error. In this
          way, David erred in the letter concerning the killing of Uriah [II
          Sam. 11:14-15], which has historical but not normative authority, and
          Nathan erred in the advice which, without seeking God's will, he gave
          David about building the temple (II Sam. 7:3), because the influence
          of the Holy Spirit was neither universal nor continuous, nor is it to
          be understood as a normal motion or effect of nature (II Kings 2:17).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. The apostles were infallible in faith, not in morals, and the
          Spirit was their guide in all truth so that they never erred, but not
          in all godly living (pietas) so that they never sinned, because they
          were like us in all things. The pretense and hypocrisy of Peter,
          recorded in Galatians 2:12, was a sin in life, not an error in faith,
          a moral lapse and failure in conduct resulting from weakness and fear
          of incurring the hatred of the Jews. It was not, however, an
          intellectual error (error mentis) resulting from ignorance of
          Christian freedom, his understanding of which is sufficiently shown by
          his fellowship with Gentiles previous to the arrival of the Jews.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. When Paul says, "I say, not the Lord" (I Cor. 7:10[12]), he does
          not deny the inspiration of the Lord, by whose words he vindicates his
          own (v. 40). Rather this precept, or law expressly given by the Lord,
          was hidden before him, so that the meaning is that this controversy
          over sinful desertion had not yet arisen in Christ's time, nor had he
          had any opportunity of settling it, which Paul, illumined by the
          Spirit, now did.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. Anything in the Law which seems absurd and useless will be found
          by the pious and wise to be of the greatest significance for the
          motivating of obedience, the overthrowing of idolatry, the cultivation
          of morals, and the proclamation of the Messiah, if taken rightly and
          properly. The genealogies, and other records that seem unnecessary,
          are witnesses to the origin, spread, and preservation of the church
          and to the fulfillment of the promises of a Messiah descended from the
          seed of Abraham and David. XXVII. The prophecy of Hosea (Hos.1:2) does
          not command that he marry the adulteress, for the sons of a marriage
          cannot be called illegitimate, which is the meaning of this verse. But
          this must be understood as allegory, since Israel, impure because of
          her idolatry, is represented by this symbol.
