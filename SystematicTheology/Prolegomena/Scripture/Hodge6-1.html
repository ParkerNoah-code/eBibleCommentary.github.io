        <p><b>§ 1. Statement of the Doctrine</b></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          All Protestants agree in teaching that "the word of God, as contained
          in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only
          infallible rule of faith and practice."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Smalcald Articles, the Lutheran Church says: "Ex patrum— verbis
          et factis non sunt exstruendi articuli fidei—Regulam autem aliam
          habemus, ut videlicet verbum Dei condat articulos fidei et præterea
          nemo, ne angelus quidem." In the "Form of Concord,"2 it is said:
          "Credimus, confitemur et docemus, unicam regulam et normam secundum
          quam omnia dogmata omnesque doctores æstimari et judicari oporteat,
          nullam omnino aliam esse, quam prophetica et apostolica scripta cum V.
          tum N. Testamenti."
        </p>
        <p>
          The symbols of the Reformed churches teach the same doctrine.
          Confessio Helvetica, II. says: "In scriptura sancta habet universalis
          Christi Ecclesia plenissime exposita, quæcunque pertinent cum ad
          salvificam fidem, tum ad vitam Deo placentem.4 Non alium in causa
          fidei judicem, quam ipsum Deum per Scripturas sacras pronuntiantem,
          quid verum sit, quid falsum, quid sequendum sit quidne fugiendum.
          Confessio Gallicana: Quum hæc (SS.) sit omnis veritatis summa,
          complectens quidquid ad cultum Dei et salutem nostram requiritur,
          neque hominibus neque ipsis etiam angelis fas esse dicimus quicquam ei
          verbo adjicere vel detrahere vel quicquam prorsus in eo immutare." In
          the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England,6 it is said: "Holy
          Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
          whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to
          be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of
          faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation." The
          Westminster Confession teaches: "Under the name of Holy Scripture, or
          the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old
          and New Testament, which are these: etc.… All which are given by
          inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life. The whole
          counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory,
          man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in
          Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from
          Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added whether by
          new revelations of the Spirit or traditions of men.2 All things in
          Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all;
          yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and
          observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some
          place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the
          unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
          sufficient understanding of them."
        </p>
        <p>
          From these statements it appears that Protestants hold, (1.) That the
          Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the Word of God, written
          under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and are therefore
          infallible, and of divine authority in all things pertaining to faith
          and practice, and consequently free from all error whether of
          doctrine, fact, or precept. (2.) That they contain all the extant
          supernatural revelations of God designed to be a rule of faith and
          practice to his Church. (3.) That they are sufficiently perspicuous to
          be understood by the people, in the use of ordinary means and by the
          aid of the Holy Spirit, in all things necessary to faith or practice,
          without the need of any infallible interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>The Canon</p>
        <p>
          Before entering on the consideration of these points, it is necessary
          to answer the question, What books are entitled to a place in the
          canon, or rule of faith and practice? Romanists answer this question
          by saying, that all those which the Church has decided to be divine in
          their origin, and none others, are to be thus received. Protestants
          answer it by saying, so far as the Old Testament is concerned, that
          those books, and those only, which Christ and his Apostles recognized
          as the written Word of God, are entitled to be regarded as canonical.
          This recognition was afforded in a twofold manner: First, many of the
          books of the Old Testament are quoted as the Word of God, as being
          given by the Spirit; or the Spirit is said to have uttered what is
          therein recorded. Secondly, Christ and his Apostles refer to the
          sacred writings of the Jews—the volume which they regarded as
          divine—as being what it claimed to be, the Word of God. When we refer
          to the Bible as of divine authority, we refer to it as a volume and
          recognize all the writings which it contains as given by the
          inspiration of the Spirit. In like manner when Christ or his Apostles
          quote the "Scriptures," or the "law and the prophets," and speak of
          the volume then so called, they give their sanction to the divine
          authority of all the books which that volume contained. All,
          therefore, that is necessary to determine for Christians the canon of
          the Old Testament, is to ascertain what books were included in the
          "Scriptures" recognized by the Jews of that period. This is a point
          about which there is no reasonable doubt. The Jewish canon of the Old
          Testament included all the books and no others, which Protestants now
          recognize as constituting the Old Testament Scriptures. On this ground
          Protestants reject the so-called apocryphal books. They were not
          written in Hebrew and were not included in the canon of the Jews. They
          were, therefore, not recognized by Christ as the Word of God. This
          reason is of itself sufficient. It is however confirmed by
          considerations drawn from the character of the books themselves. They
          abound in errors, and in statements contrary to those found in the
          undoubtedly canonical books.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle on which the canon of the New Testament is determined is
          equally simple. Those books, and those only which can be proved to
          have been written by the Apostles, or to have received their sanction,
          are to be recognized as of divine authority. The reason of this rule
          is obvious. The Apostles were the duly authenticated messengers of
          Christ, of whom He said, "He that heareth you, heareth me."
