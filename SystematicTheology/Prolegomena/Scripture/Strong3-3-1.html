        <h2>I. Definition of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Inspiration is that influence of the Spirit of God upon the minds of
          the Scripture writers which made their writings the record of a
          progressive divine revelation, sufficient, when taken together and
          interpreted by the same Spirit who inspired them, to lead every honest
          inquirer to Christ and to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the significance of each part of this definition: 1.
          Inspiration is an influence of the Spirit of God. It is not a merely
          naturalistic phenomenon or psychological vagary, but is rather the
          effect of the inworking of the personal divine Spirit. 2. Yet
          inspiration is an influence upon the mind, and not upon the body. God
          secures his end by awakening man’s rational powers, and not by an
          external or mechanical communication. 3. The writings of inspired men
          are the record of a revelation. They are not themselves the
          Rev_4:1-11. The revelation and the record are both progressive.
          Neither one is complete at the beginning. 5. The Scripture writings
          must be taken together. Each part must be viewed in connection with
          what precedes and with what follows. 6. The same Holy Spirit who made
          the original revelations must interpret to us the record of them, if
          we are to come to the knowledge of the truth. 7. So used and so
          interpreted, these writings are sufficient, both in quantity and in
          quality, for their religious purpose. 8. That purpose is, not to
          furnish us with a model history or with the facts of science, but to
          lead us to Christ and to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Inspiration is therefore to be defined, not by its method, but by
          its result. It is a general term including all those kinds and degrees
          of the Holy Spirit’s influence which were brought to bear upon the
          minds of the Scripture writers, in order to secure the putting into
          permanent and written form of the truth best adapted to man’s moral
          and religious needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Inspiration may often include revelation, or the direct
          communication from God of truth to which man could not attain by his
          unaided powers. It may include illumination, or the quickening of
          man’s cognitive powers to understand truth already revealed.
          Inspiration, however, does not necessarily and always include either
          revelation or illumination. It is simply the divine influence which
          secures a transmission of needed truth to the future, and, according
          to the nature of the truth to be transmitted, it may be only an
          inspiration of superintendence, or it may be also and at the same time
          an inspiration of illumination or revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It is not denied, but affirmed, that inspiration may qualify for
          oral utterance of truth, or for wise leadership and daring deeds. Men
          may be inspired to render external service to God’s kingdom, as in the
          cases of Bezalel and Samson; even though this service is rendered
          unwillingly or unconsciously, as in the cases of Balaam and Cyrus. All
          human intelligence, indeed, is due to the inbreathing of that same
          Spirit who created man at the beginning. We are now concerned with
          inspiration, however, only as it pertains to the authorship of
          Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gen_2:7—“And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
          breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
          soul”; Exo_31:2-3—“I have called by name Besalel … and I have filled
          him with the Spirit of God … in all manner of workmanship”;
          Jdg_13:24-25—“called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah
          blessed him. And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him”;
          Num_23:5—“And Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return
          unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak”; 2Ch_36:22—“Jehovah stirred up
          the spirit of Cyrus”; Isa_44:28—“that saith of Cyrus, He is my
          shepherd”; Isa_45:5—“I will gird thee, though thou hast not known me”;
          Job_32:8—“there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty
          giveth them understanding.” These passages show the true meaning of
          2Ti_3:16—“Every scripture inspired of God.” The word θεόπνευστος is to
          be understood as alluding, not to the flute-player’s breathing into
          his instrument, but to God’s original inbreathing of life. The flute
          is passive, but man’s soul is active. The flute gives out only what it
          receives, but the inspired man under the divine influence is a
          conscious and free originator of thought and expression. Although the
          inspiration of which we are to treat is simply the inspiration of the
          Scripture writings, we can best understand this narrower use of the
          term by remembering that all real knowledge has in it a divine
          element, and that we are possessed of complete consciousness only as
          we live, move, and have our being in God. Since Christ, the divine
          Logos or Reason, is “the light which lighteth every man” (Joh_1:9), a
          special influence of “the spirit of Christ which was in them”
          (1Pe_1:11) rationally accounts for the fact that “men spake from God,
          being moved by the Holy Spirit” (2Pe_1:21).
        </p>
        <p>
          It may help our understanding of terms above employed if we adduce
          instances of
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Inspiration without revelation, as in Luke or Acts, Luk_1:1-3;
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Inspiration including revelation, as in the Apocalypse, Rev_1:1,
          Rev_1:11;
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Inspiration without illumination, as in the prophets, 1Pe_1:11;
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Inspiration including illumination, as in the case of Paul,
          1Co_2:12;
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Revelation without inspiration, as in God’s words from Sinai,
          Exo_20:1; Exo_20:22;
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Illumination without inspiration, as in modern preachers,
          Eph_2:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other definitions are those of Park: “Inspiration is such an influence
          over the writers of the Bible that all their teachings which have a
          religious character are trust-worthy”; of Wilkinson: “Inspiration is
          help from God to keep the report of divine revelation free from error.
          Help to whom? No matter to whom, so the result is secured. The final
          result, viz.: the record or report of revelation, this must be free
          from error. Inspiration may affect one or all of the agents employed”;
          of Hovey: “Inspiration was an influence of the Spirit of God on those
          powers of men which are concerned in the reception, retention and
          expression of religious truth—an influence so pervading and powerful
          that the teaching of inspired men was according to the mind of God.
          Their teaching did not in any instance embrace all truth in respect to
          God, or man, or the way of life; but it comprised just so much of the
          truth on any particular subject as could be received in faith by the
          inspired teacher and made useful to those whom he addressed. In this
          sense the teaching of the original documents composing our Bible may
          be pronounced free from error”; of G. B. Foster: “Revelation is the
          action of God in the soul of his child, resulting in divine
          self-expression there: Inspiration is the action of God in the soul of
          his child, resulting in apprehension and appropriation of the divine
          expression. Revelation has logical but not chronological priority”; of
          Horton, Inspiration and the Bible, 10–13—“We mean by Inspiration
          exactly those qualities or characteristics which are the marks or
          notes of the Bible.…We call our Bible inspired; by which we mean that
          by reading and studying it we find our way to God, we find his will
          for us, and we find how we can conform ourselves to his will.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fairbairn, Christ in Modern Theology, 496, while nobly setting forth
          the naturalness of revelation, has misconceived the relation of
          inspiration to revelation by giving priority to the former: “The idea
          of a written revelation may be said to be logically involved in the
          notion of a living God. Speech is natural to spirit; and if God is by
          nature spirit, it will be to him a matter of nature to reveal himself.
          But if he speaks to man, it will be through men; and those who hear
          best will be most possessed of God. This possession is termed
          ‘inspiration.’ God inspires, man reveals: revelation is the mode or
          form—word, character, or institution—in which man embodies what he has
          received. The terms, though not equivalent, are co-extensive, the one
          denoting the process on its inner side, the other on its outer.” This
          statement, although approved by Sanday, Inspiration, 124, 125, seems
          to us almost precisely to reverse the right meaning of the words. We
          prefer the view of Evans, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 54—“God
          has first revealed himself, and then has inspired men to interpret,
          record and apply this revelation. In redemption, inspiration is the
          formal factor, as revelation is the material factor. The men are
          inspired, as Prof. Stowe said. The thoughts are inspired, as Prof.
          Briggs said. The words are inspired, as Prof. Hodge said. The warp and
          woof of the Bible is πνεῦμα: “the words that I have spoken unto you
          are spirit” (Joh_6:63). Its fringes run off, as was inevitable, into
          the secular, the material, the psychic.” Phillips Brooks, Life,
          2:351—“If the true revelation of God is in Christ, the Bible is not
          properly a revelation, but the history of a revelation. This is not
          only a fact but a necessity, for a person cannot be revealed in a
          book, but must find revelation, if at all, in a person. The centre and
          core of the Bible must therefore be the gospels, as the story of
          Jesus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, like Priestley, have held that the gospels are authentic but not
          inspired. We therefore add to the proof of the genuineness and
          credibility of Scripture, the proof of its inspiration. Chadwick, Old
          and New Unitarianism, 11—“Priestley’s belief in supernatural
          revelation was intense. He had an absolute distrust of reason as
          qualified to furnish an adequate knowledge of religious things, and at
          the same time a perfect confidence in reason as qualified to prove
          that negative and to determine the contents of the revelation.” We
          might claim the historical truth of the gospels, even if we did not
          call them inspired. Gore, in Lux Mundi, 341—“Christianity brings with
          it a doctrine of the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures, but is not
          based upon it.” Warfield and Hodge, Inspiration, 8—“While the
          inspiration of the Scriptures is true, and being true is fundamental
          to the adequate interpretation of Scripture, it nevertheless is not,
          in the first instance, a principle fundamental to the truth of the
          Christian religion.”
