        <h2>I. Sacred Criticism is a Scientific Inquirer, and not a Judge</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, critical science does not keep its place when, instead
          of being a scientific inquirer, it would be a judge; when, not content
          with collecting together the oracles of God, it sets about composing
          them, decomposing them, canonizing them, decanonizing them; and, when
          it gives forth oracles itself! Then it tends to nothing less than to
          subvert the faith from its foundation. This we proceed to demonstrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employ your reason, your time, all the resources of your genius, to
          assure yourself whether the book which has been put into your hands,
          under the name of the Bible, contains, in fact, the same oracles, the
          first deposit of which was confided, under the divine Providence, to
          the Jewish people, and of which the second deposit, under the same
          guarantee, was committed to the church universal of the apostolic
          times. Assure yourself, then, if this book be authentic, and if the
          copyists have not altered it. All this labour is legitimate, rational,
          honourable; it has been undertaken before you abundantly; and if the
          investigations of another have not satisfied you, resume them, follow
          them out, get all the information in your power; all the churches of
          God will thank you. But when this work is over, when you have
          ascertained that the Bible is an authentic book, and that the
          unexceptionable seals of God Almighty are attached to it, then listen
          to what science and reason alike call to you; then listen to God; then
          sursùm oculi, flexi poplites, sursùm corda! then down upon your knees!
          lift up your hearts on high, in reverence, with profound humility!
          Then science and reason have no longer to judge, but to receive; no
          longer to pronounce, but to comprehend. There is still a task, and it
          is a science, if you will; but it is no longer the same; it is that of
          understanding and submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if your wisdom, on the contrary, after having received the Bible
          as an authentic book, makes bold to constitute itself the judge of
          what is found contained there; if, from this Scripture, which calls
          itself inspired, and which declares that it is, at the last day, to
          judge you yourself, that wisdom of yours dares to take away any thing;
          if, seating itself like the angels of the last judgment, it drag the
          book of God to the seashore of science, in order to collect in its
          vessels what it sees in it to be good, and to throw out what it finds
          in it to be bad, if it pretend to separate there the thought of God
          from the thought of man; if, for example (to adduce but one trait
          among a thousand) it venture to deny, like Michaelis, that the first
          two chapters of Matthew are from God, because it does not approve the
          Scriptural quotations found in them; next, to deny the inspiration of
          Mark and that of Luke, because it has found them, it says, in
          contradiction with Matthew;2 in a word, if it think it has the power
          of subjecting the book, acknowledged to be authentic, to the
          outrageous control of its ignorance, and of its carnal sense; then, it
          is necessary that it should be reproved; it is guilty of revolt, it
          judges God. Here there is no longer science, there is fascination;
          there is no longer progress, there is obscurantism.
        </p>
        <p>
          One may judge of this, if he compare with this blundering of
          theologians on the word of God, the more rational procedure of
          physicians and naturalists in studying his works. Here, at least,
          people hold beforehand as an axiom, that all objects in creation
          answer to ends that are full of wisdom and harmony. Here science sets
          itself, not to contest these ends, but to discover them. Here, what
          people call progress, is not the daring rashness of controlling the
          works of their God; it is the good fortune to have sounded them, to
          have obtained a better recognition of their marvels, and to have been
          able to present them under some new aspects to the admiration of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, then, will Christians not do with the works of God in the works
          of redemption, what naturalists do with the works of God in creation?
          Why, if, even among the pagans, a physician—the great Galen—could say
          "that in describing the different parts of the human body, he was
          composing a hymn in honour of Him who has made us," will not the
          Christian comprehend that to describe with truth the various parts of
          the Word of God, would be always "composing a hymn in honour of Him
          who has made it?" Thus thought the apostolic fathers; thus the pious
          Irenæus, the disciple of Polycarp, the pupil of John. "The Scriptures
          are perfect," said he. "In the Scriptures let God always teach, and
          let man always learn! Thus it is that from the confused polyphony of
          their instructions, one sole and admirable symphony will make itself
          heard in us, praising by its hymns the God who has made all things."
        </p>
        <p>
          Were we to be told, there was a very studious nation in existence,
          among whom the science of Nature, taking a new direction, had begun
          immense works with the purpose of establishing that there are mistakes
          in creation; plants badly constructed, animals ill conceived, organs
          ill adapted—what would you think of such a people and their grand
          attempt? Would you say that they effected any advance in science?
          Would you not rather conceive that they darkened and degraded it, and
          that people there were putting themselves to a deal of learned labour
          in finding out the art of being ignorant? While anatomists have been
          unable to explain the use of the liver in the human body, or of
          antennae in that of insects, they have not on that account found
          nature in fault; they have put it all to the account of their own
          ignorance. Why, then, when you happen not yet to have discovered the
          use of something that is said in the Scriptures, do you lay the blame
          on any but yourselves, and why will you not wait?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is no new idea. It is now sixteen hundred years since a godly man
          expressed it better than we have done, and preached it with unction to
          his contemporaries. "If ever, in reading Scriptures," says Origen, in
          the thirty-ninth of his homilies, "you happen to stumble on some
          thought which becomes for thee a stone of stumbling and a rock of
          offence, blame none but thyself (αἰτιῶ σαυτόν); doubt not that this
          stone of stumbling and rock of offence has some great meaning (ἔχειν
          νοήματα), and is to fulfil that promise, 'He that believeth shall not
          be confounded.'—(Rom. 9:33.) Begin, then, with believing; and soon you
          will find, under this imaginary stumblingblock, a plentiful and holy
          utility. If we have received the commandment not to speak idle words,
          for we shall give account thereof at the last judgment, how much more
          ought we to think, with regard to God's prophets, that every word
          proceeding from their mouth had its object to effect and its utility!3
          I believe, then, that for those who know how to make use of the virtue
          of the Scriptures, each of the letters written in the oracles of God,
          has its object and its use (ἐργάζεται), even to an iota and single
          jot.… And in like manner as among plants, there is not one which has
          not its virtue; and, nevertheless, it belongs only to those who have
          acquired a knowledge of botany to be able to tell us how each ought to
          be applied and prepared in order to its becoming useful; so likewise
          whoever is a holy and spiritual botanist of the Word of God (τις ̀
          Βοτανικός ἐστιν ὁ ἅγιος καὶ πνευματικός), he, collecting each iota and
          each element, will find the virtue of that Word, and will perceive
          that nothing in that which is written is superfluous (ὁτι οὐδὲν
          παρέλκει). Would you have another comparison? Every member of our body
          has its office for which it has been placed there by the great
          Architect. Nevertheless, it belongs not to all to be acquainted with
          its use and virtue, but only to those physicians who have occupied
          themselves with anatomy.… Well, then, I consider the Scriptures as the
          collection of the plants of the Word, or as the perfect body of the
          Word. But if thou art neither botanist of the Scriptures nor anatomist
          of the prophetical words, go not to imagine that there is any thing
          superfluous there; and when you have been unable to find the reason
          for that which is written, blame not the holy letters; lay the blame
          on thyself alone." Thus spake Origen; but we might have found thoughts
          quite to the same effect in other fathers, and particularly in
          Irenæus,2 who lived still nearer the apostolic times.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we must further bid the reader remark, that this pretending
          to judge the Word of God overthrows all the foundations of the faith.
          It would even render it impossible in the hearts of all who are but a
          little consistent. This it is but too easy to demonstrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order that a soul receive life, it must receive faith; in order
          that it may have faith, it must believe God; in order that it believe
          God, it must begin with renouncing the prejudices of its own wisdom on
          sin, on the future, on the judgment, on grace, on itself, on the
          world, on God, on all things.… Is it not written that the natural man
          receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, that he even cannot
          receive them, and that they are foolishness unto him? The gospel,
          accordingly, will shock his reason or his conscience, or both. And yet
          he must submit upon the sole testimony of God; and it is not until
          after having thus settled his relation to it, that he will recognize
          it as being "the wisdom of God and the power of God unto salvation to
          everyone that believeth." He must believe, then, without having seen;
          that is to say, the gospel, before he has comprehended it, ought to
          confound his own wisdom, revolt his natural heart, buffet his pride,
          and condemn his own righteousness! How then would you ever get it to
          be accepted by men who would, like you, wait to have every thing
          approved, before receiving every thing? Imbued with your principles,
          they will impute to man in the Scriptures every thing that shocks
          their natural feelings. They will think that they ought to retrench
          from it the prejudices of the apostles on the consequences of Adam's
          sin, on the Trinity, on the expiation, on eternal punishments, on the
          gehenna, on the resurrection of the body, on the doctrine of devils,
          on election, on the gratuitous justification of the sinner by faith,
          perhaps also on miracles. How shall a man, if he be unhappy enough to
          imitate you, ever find life, peace, and joy, by means of faith? How
          shall he hope against hope? How shall he believe that he is ever
          saved, wretched man that he is? He will have to pass his days lost in
          vague, misty, uncertain doctrines! and his life, his peace, his love,
          his obedience must remain, until death, such as his doctrines are! We
          conclude, then, with this first advice: Make critical science a
          learned inquirer; don't make it a judge.
