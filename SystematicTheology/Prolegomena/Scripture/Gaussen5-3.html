        <h2>III. Apparent insignificance of certain Details in the Bible</h2>
        <p>
          "Was it suited to the dignity of inspiration to accompany the thoughts
          of the apostle Paul, even into those vulgar details to which we see
          him descend in many of his letters? Could the Holy Ghost have gone so
          far as to dictate to him those ordinary salutations with which they
          close? or those medicinal counsels which he gives to Timothy with
          respect to his stomach and his frequent infirmities? or those
          commissions with which he charges him with respect to his parchments
          and a certain cloak which he had left with Carpus at Troas, when he
          quitted Asia?"
        </p>
        <p>
          We beg the reader will allow us to beseech him to ponder well, when,
          on taking the Bible into his hands, he does not perceive, from his
          very first readings, the tokens of God in such or such a passage of
          the Word. Let not those reckless hands proceed to cast a single verse
          out of the temple of the Scriptures. They clasp an eternal book, all
          the authors of which have said, like Paul, "And I think that I also
          have the mind of the Lord." If then he does not as yet see any thing
          divine in such or such a verse, the fault is in himself, not in the
          passage. Let him say rather, like Jacob, "Surely the Lord is in this
          place, and I knew it not."
        </p>
        <p>Let us examine more closely the passages alleged.</p>
        <p>
          Paul, from the recess of his prison, asks for the return of his cloak;
          he had left it with Carpus at Troas; he begs Timothy to hasten before
          winter, and not to forget to bring it with him. This domestic detail,
          so many thousand times adduced as an objection to the inspiration of
          the Scriptures, from the days of the Anomeans, spoken of by Jerome,
          this detail seems to you too trivial for an apostolical book, or, at
          least, too insignificant, and too remote from edification, for the
          dignity of inspiration. Unhappy is the man, nevertheless, who does not
          perceive its pathetic grandeur!
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ also, on the day of his death, spoke of his garment and
          his vesture. Would you have that passage dismissed from the number of
          inspired sayings? It was after a night of fatigue and anguish. He had
          been led through the streets of Jerusalem for seven hours in
          succession, by torch-light, from street to street, from tribunal to
          tribunal, beaten and buffetted, blindfolded in mockery, and struck
          with sticks on the head. The morrow's sun had not risen when they
          bound his hands to lead him further from the sacerdotal palace to
          Pilate's pretorium. There, his flesh torn with stripes, bathed with
          blood, then delivered over in order to his final execution into the
          hands of ferocious soldiers, he saw all his clothes taken from him
          that he might be arrayed in a purple robe, while people knelt before
          him, and put a reed in his hand, and spit in his face. Then, before
          placing the cross on his torn limbs, his garments were thrown over his
          wounds, in order to his being taken to Calvary; but, when they were
          about to proceed to his execution, they were taken from him for the
          third time; and it was then that, spoiled of every thing, first of his
          upper garment, then of his very inner vesture, he was to die on the
          felon's gibbet, in view of an immense concourse of people. Was there
          ever found under heaven a man who has not found these details deeply
          moving, sublime, inimitable? and was there ever found one who, from
          the recital of this death-scene, would think of retrenching, as
          useless or too commonplace, the account given of those garments which
          were parted, and of that vesture on which a lot was cast? Has not
          infidelity itself said, in speaking of it, that the majesty of the
          Scriptures astonished it, that their simplicity addressed itself to
          the heart, that the death of Socrates was that of a sage, but that the
          death of Jesus Christ was that of a God? And if divine inspiration was
          reserved for a portion only of the holy books, would it not be for
          these very details? Would it not be for the history of that love
          which, after having lived upon the earth more poor than the birds of
          the air and the foxes of the field, desired to die poorer still,
          despoiled of every thing, of his upper and under garments, fixed to a
          felon's gibbet, with his arms extended and nailed to the tree? Ah! let
          your mind be at ease with respect to the Holy Ghost! He has not
          derogated from his dignity; and very far from having thought that he
          descended too far in reporting these facts to the earth, he hastened
          to relate them; and it was a thousand years beforehand, it was in the
          age of the war of Troy, that he sang them to the harp of David: "They
          pierced my hands and my feet (he said); they look and stare upon me;
          they part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture!"2
        </p>
        <p>
          Well then, this is the same Spirit who has desired to show to us Paul
          writing to Timothy and asking for his cloak. Mark what he says He,
          too, was spoiled of every thing. Even while as yet but a youth, he was
          great among men, a favourite of princes, admired by all: he forsook
          all for Jesus Christ. For thirty years and more he has been poor; in
          labours more abundant than others, in stripes above measure, in
          prisons more frequent; of the Jews five times received he forty
          stripes save one; thrice was he beaten with rods; once was he stoned;
          thrice he suffered shipwreck; in journeyings often, in perils of
          waters, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness in perils
          on the sea; in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in cold and
          nakedness (we quote his own words.) Mark now what he says: behold him
          advanced in years; he is in his last prison; he is in Rome; he is
          waiting for his sentence of death; he has fought the good fight; he
          has finished his course; he has kept the faith; but he is shivering
          with cold; … winter has commenced; and he is in want of clothes!
          Buried in one of the dungeons of the Mamertine prisons, he lies under
          such a load of opprobrium that even all the Christians of Rome are
          ashamed of him, and when first called to appear before his judges, no
          man stood by him. The time was, ten years before, when already a
          prisoner in Rome, and loaded with chains, he had at least received
          some money from the Philippians, who, knowing his wretched state, had
          subscribed among themselves in their indigence something to be sent as
          alms to him there; but now behold him forsaken; nobody was with him
          but Luke; all had abandoned him; winter was at hand. He needed a
          cloak; he had left his two hundred leagues off, with Carpus at Troas;
          in the chilly dungeons of Rome there was nobody to lend him one: had
          he not joyfully parted with all for Jesus? had he not counted all the
          world's glories as dung that he might win Christ? and does he not
          willingly endure all things for the elect's sake?2 We were ourselves
          last year in Rome, in a hotel at the beginning of November, on a rainy
          day. With what a lively feeling, under the chill impressions of the
          evening, did we represent to ourselves the holy apostle Paul in the
          subterranean prisons of the Capitol, dictating the last of his
          letters, expressing his regret at the want of his cloak, and begging
          Timothy to send it to him before winter!
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is there now that would wish to retrench from the inspired
          epistles a trait so affecting and so pathetic? Does not the Holy Ghost
          take you as it were into Paul's prison, there to have instant occular
          evidence of his affectionate self-renunciation and sublime poverty; so
          as to make us see also, as with our own eyes, what was the depth of
          his love, sometime before, when it made him write in his letter to the
          Philippians: "I tell you, even weeping, that there are many among you
          who mind only earthly things, and whose end is destruction!" Do you
          not seem to behold him in his prison, loaded with his chain, engaged
          in writing, and the tears dropping on his parchment? And do you not
          seem also to behold that poor body of his, one day illclothed,
          suffering, and benumbed; the next, beheaded and dragged into the
          Tiber, in expectation of "that day when the earth will give up her
          dead, and the sea the dead that are in it, and when Christ shall
          change our vile body to be fashioned like unto his glorious body?" And
          if these details are beautiful, do you think they are not useful too?
          And if useful for the man who reads them as a simple historical truth,
          what do they not become for him who believes in their inspiration, and
          who says to himself: "O my soul, these words are written by Paul; but
          it is thy God that addresses them to thee!" Who could tell the
          strength and the comfort which, by their very familiarness and their
          actuality, they may have carried into prisons and cottages? Who could
          reckon up the poor men and the martyrs to whom such traits have
          imparted encouragement, example, and joy? We recollect, in
          Switzerland, in our day, the pastor Juvet, who was refused a coverlet,
          twenty years ago, in the prisons of the Canton de Vaud. One may call
          to mind in the Universal Church that Jerome of Prague, who was shut up
          for three hundred and forty days in the prisons of Constance, in the
          bottom of a dark fœtid tower, and never allowed to leave it except to
          appear before his murderers. No more has there been forgotten, among
          the English, holy Bishop Hooper, dragged from his damp, disgusting
          cellar, covered with wretchedly poor clothes and a borrowed cloak, as
          he proceeded to the stake, tottering on his staff, and bent double
          with rheumatism. Venerable fathers, blessed martyrs, you would no
          doubt call to mind your brother Paul, shut up in the prisons of Rome,
          suffering from cold and nakedness, and asking for his cloak! Ah!
          unhappy he who feels not the sublime humanity, the tender grandeur,
          the provident and divine sympathy, the depth and the charm of such a
          mode of instruction! but more to be pitied still, perhaps, is he who
          declares it to be human, because he does not comprehend it! Here we
          would quote the noble words of the venerable Haldane on this verse of
          Paul: —"Here, in his solemn farewell address, of which the verse
          before us forms a part—the last of his writings, and which contains a
          passage of unrivalled grandeur—the apostle of the Gentiles is
          exhibited in a situation deeply calculated to affect us. We behold him
          standing upon the confines of the two worlds—in this world about to be
          beheaded, as guilty, by the Emperor of Rome—in the other world to be
          crowned, as righteous, by the King of kings—here deserted by men,
          there to be welcomed by angels—here in want of a cloak to cover him,
          there to be clothed upon with his house from heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! rather than bring forward these passages in order to rob the
          Scriptures of their infallibility, one should have owned in them that
          wisdom of God, which so often, by a single stroke, has contrived to
          give us instructions for which, without that, long pages would have
          been necessary. One should have adored that tender condescension
          which, stooping to our feebleness, has been pleased not only to reveal
          to us the loftiest conceptions of heaven in the simplest words of
          earth, but also to present them to us in forms so lively, so dramatic,
          so penetrating, by often concentrating them, so as to enable us the
          better to seize them, in the narrow compass of a single verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus, then, that St Paul, by these words thrown out at random,
          among the very last commissions of a familiar letter, darts for us a
          sudden light on his ministry, and discovers to us with a word the
          whole of the apostle's life, as a single flash of lightning, during
          night, illuminates in an instant all the summits of our Alps, and as
          some people reveal to you their whole soul by a look.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many striking instances of this might we cite! They crowd upon us;
          but we are obliged to restrain ourselves; and it will behove us rather
          to keep to the precise passages which have been adduced as objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before proceeding farther, we must, however, frankly avow, that we are
          almost ashamed to defend under this form the Word of the Lord; and for
          any such apology we experience, as it were, a disgust of conscience.
          Is it altogether becoming? and can we engage in it without some
          irreverence? We ought to look well at all times to the manner in which
          we defend the things of God, and see to it that we do not imitate the
          recklessness of Uzzah in putting forth his hand to the ark of God, and
          wishing to hold it, for the oxen stumbled. The anger of the Lord, we
          are told, was kindled against him for his error.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be fully acknowledged, on both sides, that any word is contained
          in the oracles of God, then why defend it … as worthy of him, by man's
          reasonings? You may do so, no doubt, before unbelievers, but with men
          who own the divinity of the Scriptures, is it not to commit an insult
          on that word—is it not to take up a false position, and to lay your
          hand on the ark, as Uzzah did? Did this Word present itself to your
          eyes as a root out of a dry ground; had it no form nor comeliness, and
          no beauty to make you desire it, still you ought to venerate it, and
          look for every thing for it from him who has given it. Does it not
          imply, then, our being wanting in respect for him when he speaks, when
          we would prove the respect that is due to him? Should I not have been
          ashamed when shown my Saviour and my God rising from supper, taking a
          bason, laying aside his garments, girding himself with a towel, and
          proceeding to wash his disciples' feet—should I not have been ashamed
          to set myself to prove that, in spite of all this, still he was
          Christ! Ah, I should rather have wished to worship him more fervently
          than ever! Well, then, the majesty of the Scriptures desires to stoop
          to us! There do you not behold one who rises from the table, lays
          aside his garments, girds himself like a servant, and kneels before
          sinners, in order to wash their feet? "If I wash thee not, thou hast
          no part with me!" Is there not in that very humiliation, which reveals
          itself to us with such a charm, as it were the voice of the Word in
          his humiliation?
        </p>
        <p>
          As for us, it strikes us that there is no arrogance to be compared
          with that of a man who, owning the Bible to be a book from God, then
          makes bold to sift with his hand the pure in it from what is impure,
          the inspired from what is uninspired, God from man. This is to
          overturn all the foundations of the faith; it amounts to placing it,
          no more in believing God, but in believing ourselves. It ought to be
          enough for us that a chapter or a word form part of the Scriptures, in
          order to our knowing it to be divinely good; for God has pronounced
          upon it as he has upon the creation, "I beheld all that I had made,
          and behold all was good." We will never say then, I find this saying
          admirable, therefore it is from God; and still less, I see no use in
          it, therefore it is from man. God preserve us from so doing! But we
          say, it is in the Scriptures, therefore it is from God. It is from
          God, therefore it is useful, therefore it is wise, therefore it is
          admirable; and if I do not yet see it to be so, the fault lies only
          with myself. We hold there is an error in this protection which man's
          wisdom would accord to that of God; we hold there is an outrage
          involved in that clumsy stamp with which it sets itself to legalize
          the holy Scriptures, and in that absurd signature with which it dares
          to mark its pages. If, then, we still go on here with the work of
          showing how the divine wisdom shines out in some passages which people
          dare to consider human, it is not for the purpose of establishing
          their divine origin on the judgments of our better informed wisdom, or
          to procure a tardy respect for them from the mere fact of the beauty
          they disclose. Our respect goes before; it was founded on the passage
          being written in the "Oracles of God." Henceforth, before having seen,
          we have believed. We have no thought, therefore, but that of refuting
          the objection by some examples of its temerity. Let us listen,
          further, to two or three passages to which people have made bold to
          refuse the honours of inspiration, because they have started with the
          idea that they are without any spiritual bearing. We will quote but a
          very small number here. It takes no time to pronounce of a sentence
          that it is useless or vulgar—to demonstrate that there is a mistake in
          the objection, requires pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the passages which we have most frequently heard adduced, when
          people have wished to justify the distinction between what is inspired
          in the Word of God, and what is not, is Paul's recommendation to
          Timothy with regard to the stomach complaints and ailings with which
          that young disciple was afflicted. "Drink no longer water, but use a
          little wine, for thy stomach's sake and frequent infirmities."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless examine this passage more closely; what an admirable and
          living revelation do we find in it of the grandeur of the apostolic
          calling, and of the amiability of the Christian character! Mark,
          first, that it was as it were in the temple of God that it was
          pronounced; for immediately before you hear those solemn words:—"I
          charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect
          angels, that thou observe these things, without preferring one before
          another, doing nothing by partiality. Lay hands suddenly on no man,
          keep thyself pure, drink no longer water." One sees that it is in the
          presence of their common Master, and of his holy angels, that Paul
          desired to speak to his disciple; let us enter then into the same
          temple, in order to comprehend him—let us place ourselves on the same
          heights, "before the Lord and his holy angels," then shall we speedily
          perceive how many beauties are revealed by these words, both in the
          ministry of the apostles, and in the ways of the Lord. This the
          celebrated Chrysostom well understood, when, preaching on those very
          words, he observed how little the Lord's most useful servants should
          be surprised, should it so happen that their Lord should deem it fit
          to prove them, as he did Timothy, with complaints in their chest, or
          head, or stomach—should he put some thorn in their flesh; and should
          he thus buffet them by some angel of Satan, in order to fashion them,
          on the one hand, for sympathy, for cordial affections, for tender
          compassions; and, on the other, for patience, self-denial, and, above
          all, for prayer. Read over seriously, and as if in the light of the
          last day, this beautiful passage of the apostle's; ere long, within
          the small compass of this single verse, you will wonder how many
          precious lessons the Holy Ghost would give us, besides that pointed
          out by the pious bishop of Constantinople. How many words, and almost
          chapters, would have been required, in order that as much might be
          said to us under another form! Here you will learn, for example,
          Timothy's sobriety; he had wished, like Paul, to bring his body
          under—he abstained entirely from wine. You will see here, in the third
          place, with what a tender and fatherly delicacy the apostle reproved
          him, either for his imprudence, or for austerity carried too far. You
          will remark here with what wisdom the Lord authorizes, and even bids,
          by these words, the men of God to pay the necessary attention to their
          health, at a time, nevertheless, in which he has thought fit to
          compromise it by sicknesses. In the fifth place, you will here admire
          the prophetic forecast with which these words, put in the mouth of an
          apostle, condemn beforehand those human traditions which were
          afterwards to interdict the use of wine to believers as an impurity.
          Here you will see, in the sixth place, with what tender solicitude,
          and with what fatherly watchfulness, the apostle, in the midst of his
          high functions, and notwithstanding the cares with which all the
          churches overwhelmed him (from Jerusalem to Illyricum, and from
          Illyricum to Spain), directed his regards to the personal
          circumstances, to his health, to the weakness of his stomach, to his
          often infirmities, and to the imprudent habits of his daily regimen.
          You will further learn here an historical fact, which will throw an
          useful light for you on the nature of the miraculous gifts.
          Notwithstanding all the interest felt by Paul in his disciple, he is
          incapable of re-establishing Timothy's health, even he who, however,
          had so often healed the sick, and even raised the dead to life again;
          for the apostles (and we learn it again by this verse, as well as by
          the illness of Epaphroditus), did not receive the gift of miracles for
          a continuance, any more than that of inspiration; it was a power that
          was renewed to them for every particular occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if these numerous lessons from the apostle are important, and if
          we thus receive them all in a single verse, and in a way the best
          fitted to affect us, oh! how penetrating do they not become to the
          Christian soul, from the moment he has the certain conviction that
          here we have not the words of a good man only; that they are not even
          those of an apostle only; but that it is the voice of his God who
          desires to teach him, under so affecting a form, sobriety, brotherly
          love, an affectionate interest for each other's health, the usefulness
          of infirmities and afflictions even for God's most zealous servants,
          and who, in order to convey so many precious lessons to him,
          condescends to address him by the mouth of a simple creature!
        </p>
        <p>
          People, further, often object to us those greetings which close the
          epistles of Paul, and which, after all, we are told, are of no more
          importance than those ordinary compliments with which we all usually
          conclude our letters. Here there is nothing unworthy of an apostle, no
          doubt; but no more is there any thing inspired. Here the Holy Ghost
          has allowed Paul's pen to run on, as we ourselves would allow a clerk
          to conclude by himself, in the usual form, a letter, the first pages
          of which we had dictated to him. Look, for example, at the last
          chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Is it not evident there, that
          the apostle surrenders himself, in the course of sixteen verses, to
          the purely personal reminiscences of his friendships? Was there any
          need of inspiration for the dry nomenclature of all those persons? The
          apostle mentions eighteen by their names, without reckoning all to
          whom he sent remembrances collectively in the house of Aquila, in that
          of Narcissus, or in that of Aristobulus. These verses require no
          inspiration; and, what would have sufficed at most, in order to their
          being written, would have been such a superintendence on the part of
          the Holy Ghost, as that which he still exercised when he left them to
          their personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not afraid to avow that we delight to recall here these sixteen
          verses that have been so often objected to; for, far from furnishing
          any ground for objection, they belong to the number of passages in
          which the divine wisdom recommends itself by itself; and, if you will
          examine more closely, you will, ere long, join us in admiring the
          fecundity, the condescension, and the elevation of this method of
          instruction; you will find in it, under the most practical and the
          most artless form, a living picture of a primitive church; and you
          will recognize in it to what an elevation, even the least known, and
          the most feeble among them, may rise in its bosom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen first, with what an affectionate interest the apostle
          recommends to the kind regard of the church of Rome that humble woman,
          who, it would appear, undertook the voyage from Corinth to Rome for
          the sake of his temporal affairs. She was a sister well beloved, who
          had put herself at the service of the saints, and who had not been
          afraid to open her house to a great many of the believers, and to Paul
          himself, notwithstanding the perils of that hospitality. She was
          servant to the church of Cenchrea. It behoved the brethren who were
          settled at Rome, therefore, to receive her in the Lord, and to aid her
          in all her needs. Behold, then, what an example the apostle sets us,
          in some words, of that Christian urbanity which ought to characterize
          all the mutual relations of God's children. Admire, as he passes so
          rapidly under review the brethren and the sisters of the church of
          Rome, the manner in which he contrives to pour even over this list of
          names which is called dry, the sweet unction of his charity. He has
          some words of encouragement and affectionate esteem for each of them;
          he recalls in it the generous hospitality of Phebe, the risk of death
          which Aquila and his companion braved for him, the honour which
          Epenetus had of having been the first of the Achaians that were
          converted to Jesus Christ, the great labours of Andronicus and of
          Junia, who were even in the faith before him; his Christian love for
          Amplias, the evangelical labours of Urbane, the proved fidelity of
          Apelles, the manifold labours of Tryphena and Tryphosa in the Lord,
          and those of the beloved Persis. What an appeal, too, to the
          conscience of every serious reader is there in this rapid catalogue!
          See, then, he ought to say to himself, who the faithful were to whom
          salutations were sent in the church of Rome! And were the same apostle
          to write a letter to the church in which I myself occupy a place for
          some days, what would he say of me? would my name be found in it?
          could he add that, like Phebe, I receive the saints into my house;
          that, like Aquila and Priscilla, I hold Christian meetings under my
          happy roof; that, like Mary, I have bestowed much labour on the Lord's
          ministers; that, like Andronicus and Junia, I had suffered for Jesus
          Christ; that, like Rufus, I am chosen in the Lord; that, like Urbane,
          I am his helper; that, like Tryphena, and Tryphosa, I labour in the
          Lord; and that I even labour much, like the beloved Persis?
        </p>
        <p>
          But behold, above all, what a lesson there is for Christian women in
          these admirable verses! In the unaffected familiarity which terminates
          this letter, what a lofty idea is given us of their vocation! What an
          important part, then, is assigned them in the church, and what a place
          in heaven! Without having yet seen the city of Rome, Paul mentions
          there by their own names, no fewer than nine or ten women among his
          fellow-labourers. First we have, besides Phebe, that admirable
          Priscilla, who had even exposed herself to death for the apostle, and
          towards whom all the churches of the Gentiles felt so much gratitude.
          Then we have a lady, called Mary, who had, he says, bestowed much
          labour on the apostles; there was Tryphena; there was Tryphosa, who
          laboured also in the Lord; there was Persis, who was particularly dear
          to him, and who had laboured much in the Lord; there was Julia; there
          was the sister of Nereus; there was Olympia, perhaps; there was, in
          fine, the venerable mother of Rufus. And observe, in passing, with
          what respect he has named this lady, and with what delicacy he
          proceeds to salute her with the tender name of mother. Have we not
          here the very Christian politeness which he recommends to these same
          Romans in the 12th chapter of this epistle: "Salute Rufus, chosen in
          the Lord," he writes, "and his mother, WHO IS ALSO MINE!" What an
          affecting pattern do not these verses propose to husbands and wives,
          in the persons of Aquila and of Priscilla! You see them here in Rome;
          you may have seen them, five years before, banished from Italy by the
          Emperor Claudius, arriving at Corinth, and receiving in their house
          the apostle Paul; then, eighteen months afterwards, setting off with
          him to Asia, and staying at Ephesus, where they already had a church
          in their house, and where they received with so much success the young
          and brilliant Apollos, who, notwithstanding his talents, thought
          himself fortunate in having it in his power to put himself to the
          school of their Christian conversation and their charity. Now that
          Claudius had died, so as to make way for Nero, you see them, when
          hardly returned to Rome, immediately consecrate their new residence to
          the church of God. It is in their house that it meets; and you learn
          here, further, as it were in passing, that these spouses had not
          hesitated to lay down their lives for the life of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, besides all these lessons, which, in these sixteen short verses,
          are offered to our consciences, you may there learn further two facts
          of deep importance for the history of the church. And, first, you see
          there, with the most unsought and the fullest evidence, that at that
          time there was no question in Rome about Peter, or his episcopate, or
          about his popedom, or his primacy, or even his presence. Do you not
          perceive a prophetical foresight in the care taken by the Holy Ghost
          to do, for this epistle to the Romans, what he has not done for any
          other of the fourteen of Paul's epistles, and to close it thus with a
          long catalogue of the women and of men that were the most esteemed at
          the time in the whole Roman church? Behold, then, the apostle of the
          Gentiles, who, twenty years after his conversion, writes to them with
          greetings addressed to as many as twenty-eight persons living in the
          midst of them, by their proper names, and many others besides by
          collective designations, and who has not a word to send them for the
          prince of the apostles, as he is called, for the vicar of Jesus
          Christ, for his superior, for the bishop of the universal church, for
          the founder of the Roman church!! Peter was the apostle of the
          Circumcision, and not of the Gentiles; his place was at Jerusalem;
          there we have to look for him, and there Paul had always found him. In
          his first journey, three years after his conversation, Paul visited
          him and abode fifteen days in his house. In his second journey, to go
          to the first council, he again meets him there. In his third journey,
          in the year 44, at the time of the death of Herod Agrippa, again it is
          there that Peter has his residence. In his fourth journey, seventeen
          years after his conversion,3 Paul finds him still there, in the charge
          of an apostle, not of the Gentiles (mark this well) but of the
          Circumcision. And when at last he was on the way accomplishing his
          fifth and last journey, he writes to the Romans and the Galatians; and
          then in order that the whole Church might know well that Peter is not
          at Rome, and never was there, we find Paul taking care to salute by
          their names all the most eminent among the believers at Rome, even
          among the women. What bishop in our days, of the Latin sect, would
          dare to write a letter of sixteen chapters to the church of Rome,
          without saying to it a single word either about its pope, or about
          Peter, or about a vicar of Jesus Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another historical fact, still more interesting, to the
          knowledge of which these very sixteen verses, said to be useless,
          conduct us by the most striking traits. See, in the very details of
          these short salutations, by what humble instruments, and yet how
          extensively, the gospel had established itself in so short a time, in
          the mighty city of Rome. No apostle had set his foot there, yet behold
          with wonder what porgress had already been made by the Word of God,
          solely through the labours of artizans, merchants, women, slaves, and
          freedmen, who happened to be in Rome! Jesus Christ had his disciples
          there, even in the palaces of the Jewish princes who resided at the
          imperial court, and even among the pagans who served nearer the person
          of Nero. Paul asks that salutations should be sent from him, first
          (among other Christians) to those of Aristobulus' household; and,
          secondly, to those of the household of Narcissus "who are in the
          Lord." Now, the former of these two great personages was the brother
          of Agrippa the Great and of Herodias; the second was the all-powerful
          favourite of the emperor Claudius. Agrippina caused him to be put to
          death only at the close of the year 54.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! let all who call themselves Christians renounce then, and for
          ever, those rash systems in which people rise against the words of the
          Scriptures, to impugn their propriety; in which people take away from
          God's Bible such and such a passage, and such and such a word, in
          order to make (at least as respects that passage and that word) a
          Bible of man's; and in which people thus charge themselves with the
          responsibility of the temerities that shall be ventured upon besides,
          by doctors of greater hardihood, imitating upon a book what they shall
          have seen you do upon a verse! What idea can a man have of the sacred
          writers, when he would impute to them the mad audacity of mingling
          their own oracles with those of the Most High? We recollect the case
          of a man who had lost his reason, who was supported by our hospitals,
          whose handwriting, however, as a copyist, was so beautiful that one of
          the Geneva ministers engaged him to transcribe his sermons. Great was
          the confusion of the latter, when on looking at his papers again, he
          ascertained that the unhappy man had thought it his duty to enrich all
          the pages with his own thoughts. The distance is less, however,
          between a lunatic and a minister, even were he holy as Daniel and
          sublime as Isaiah, than between Daniel and Isaiah and the Eternal
          Wisdom!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, having advanced thus far, we would wish, before proceeding
          farther, to recommend to our readers, in the practice of sacred
          criticism, three precautions, the importance and necessity of which
          ought to be impressed upon them by the theopneustic doctrine.
