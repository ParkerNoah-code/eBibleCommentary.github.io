        <h2>Scripture: The Only Rule of Faith and Life</h2>
        <h2>Works, vol. 1, ch. 3.1.</h2>

        <h2>
          Doctrine II. “<em
            >The scriptures are the rule to direct us how we may glorify and
            enjoy God.</em
          >“
        </h2>
        <p>Here I shall only give the properties of this rule.</p>
        <h2>1. Scripture is Clear.</h2>
        <p>
          1. It is a perspicuous or clear rule. For though all things in
          scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all;
          yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and
          observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some
          place of scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the
          unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
          sufficient understanding of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) With respect to all things necessary to salvation, whether for
          faith or practice, it cannot be denied, but there are portions of the
          scripture very obscure, which possibly are not rightly interpreted
          even to this day; but in such things as are necessary to salvation,
          they are clear. And in this respect it hath been said, that the
          scriptures are a depth wherein a lamb may wade, and an elephant may
          swim.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Though some things, the faith of which is necessary to salvation,
          be high and incomprehensible mysteries, such as the doctrine of the
          Trinity, of the incarnation of the Son of God, etc. yet the way of
          propounding them is clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) It may be that what is truly necessary unto salvation may be very
          obscurely laid down in some place of scripture; yet in some other
          place we shall find the same thing clearly propounded:
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) And that so as not only the learned, but even the unlearned, may
          attain to a sufficient understanding of them; which you must carefully
          remember is meant here of believing persons, who have the inward
          illumination of the Spirit, removing their own natural darkness: for
          if ye shall understand it of unbelievers, it contradicts what we have
          laid down above, relating to the necessity of spiritual illumination.
          And so the sense is, that not only may the learned, but even the
          unlearned Christian, attain to a sufficient understanding of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Providing they make use of the ordinary means appointed of God for
          the understanding of them; reading attentively and devoutly with
          prayer and meditation on them, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>The Clarity of Scripture Proved.</h2>
        <p>
          This perspicuity of the scriptures I shall prove by the following
          arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The scripture plainly teaches its own perspicuity and clearness in
          this sense. It is called a lamp and a light, Psalms 119:105. The very
          “<em
            >entrance of it (it is said) gives light and understanding to the
            simple</em
          >,” Psalms 119:130. See Proverbs 6:23. The apostle, 2 Peter 1:19,
          calls the holy scriptures a light, and particularly the word of
          prophecy, or the prophetic word, which of all the rest seems most
          dark, yet this he calls a light and a shining light, shining in a dark
          place; shewing thereby, that where it comes and shines, though the
          place be of itself dark, yet it dispels the darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Such is the way God hath delivered his word, that its commands are
          not remote from the understanding; the meanest believer hath no reason
          to complain of the difficulty of it in the things necessary to
          salvation, Deuteronomy 30:11, etc. “<em
            >For this command which I command thee this day, it is not hidden
            from thee, neither is it far off: It is not in heaven, that thou
            shouldst say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto
            us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea,
            that thou shouldst say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring
            it in unto us, that we may hear it, and do it! But the word is very
            nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do
            it.</em
          >“
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If all things necessary to salvation be understood by all sincere
          Christians, and this by virtue of the Spirit dwelling in every
          believer, then the scriptures are clear in all things necessary to
          salvation to the meanest believer. But the former is true: 1
          Corinthians 2:15, “<em>He that is spiritual judgeth all things</em>;”
          1 John 2:20, 27, “<em
            >Ye have an unction from the holy One, and ye know all things. The
            anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need
            not that any man teach you; but the same anointing teacheth you of
            all things.” Consider to whom John is there speaking, not only to
            learned men and great divines, but to all believers, even to little
            children; to all that have the Spirit, which is common to all; “for
            if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</em
          >“
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The things that are necessary to salvation are hid only to
          unbelievers, in whom the God of this world hath blinded their eyes; as
          for others, God himself hath taught them, 2 Corinthians 4:4, 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) God hath promised to write his law in his people’s hearts, and
          that he himself will teach them to know himself, Jeremiah 31:33-34;
          therefore the scripture must needs be perspicuous and clear in things
          necessary to salvation: for that which is written in our hearts cannot
          be but clear unto us; and that which God himself teacheth us cannot be
          obscure, for who teacheth like God?
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) If the scriptures be not clear in themselves to all believers, but
          that all its perspicuity depends on the interpretation of the church,
          then our faith is to be ultimately resolved into the testimony of man;
          but that cannot be, for human testimony is not infallible and
          authentic, and therefore cannot found divine faith and an infallible
          persuasion. The reason of the consequence is clear. Hearers are
          obliged if they will not pin their faith on men’s sleeves, to compare
          the interpretations given by men, with the scriptures themselves;
          which is utterly unpracticable, unless the scriptures be clear in
          themselves in such things as are necessary to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) The perspicuity of the scripture appears, if ye consider their
          author, who is God himself, the Father of lights; and the end for
          which he gave the scriptures unto the church, viz. that they might be
          a rule of faith and life. Of his power to speak plainly, who can
          doubt? and the end for which they are given may sufficiently satisfy
          as to his will to speak so; for how can they be a rule to us, if wrapt
          up so as we cannot understand them without the church’s
          interpretation, in those things that are necessary to salvation?
        </p>
        <h2>2. Scripture is a Perfect Rule.</h2>
        <p>
          2. It is a perfect rule. There is nothing necessary to be believed or
          done but what is to be found there. It is a perfect rule for us to
          walk by in the way to heaven and glory. What can be more desired than
          that in the text,
          <em
            >It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
            instruction in righteousness</em
          >? “<em>The law of the Lord is perfect</em>,” Psalms 19:7. The
          scriptures were written that men might have life, John 20:31, and
          comfort and hope in all conditions, Romans 15:4. But I insisted on
          this more fully in the preceding doctrine.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Scripture is the Only Rule for Faith and Life.</h2>
        <p>
          3. It is the only rule. Every doctrine taught any manner of way in
          religion must be brought to this rule, and if it agree not with it,
          must be rejected, Isaiah 8:20. Hereby traditions must be tried,
          Matthew 15:3; and spirits or revelations, 1 John 4:1; and nothing must
          be added to it, Proverbs 30:6; Revelation 22:18. I shall shut up with
          a few inferences.
        </p>
        <h2>Inferences.</h2>
        <p>
          Inference 1. The opinions of fathers, decrees of councils, acts of
          assemblies, covenants, and minister’s sermons, are not the rule of
          faith to us; nor can any of them bind us but in so far as they are
          agreeable to the word of God, by which all of them must be judged and
          examined, Isaiah 8:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 2. Translations of the scriptures into the vulgar languages
          are most necessary and profitable. How otherwise should the unlearned
          read them, if they were not translated? It was by means of these
          translations that Romish Babel was brought down at the Reformation, as
          by the division of tongues the building of old Babel was hindered. And
          that makes the Papists such enemies to translations of the scriptures.
          We have reason to bless God for human learning, by which these
          translations are made, seeing the prophets and apostles wrote in
          languages which but few understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 3. This may give us a just abhorrence of Popery, which
          almost in every point on this head casts dust on the scriptures. The
          Papists deny the necessity of translations; will not allow the people
          the free reading of the Bible; cry out on it for its obscurity; accuse
          it of imperfection; and add their traditions to it, that it may not be
          the only rule. And thus they blaspheme both God and his word, and
          expose themselves to that direful threatening, Revelation 22:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 4. This may also give us a just detestation of Quakerism,
          which sets up the light within men, which in very deed is nothing but
          a natural conscience, and the spirit without the scriptures, to be a
          rule to men. But their light is but darkness, and their spirit a
          spirit of darkness and delusion, if it agree not with the scriptures,
          Isaiah 8:20, and must be tried and examined by the scriptures, 1 John
          4:1. The Quakers are a dangerous set of people that overturn the
          foundation of true religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 5. This may likewise give us a just abhorrence of the
          superstition and ceremonies of the church of England, wherewith they
          have corrupted the worship of God, rejecting the simplicity of gospel
          worship, and regulating their worship in many things not by the
          scripture, but the dregs of Antichrist: Deuteronomy 4:2, “<em
            >Ye shall not add unto the word that I command you.</em
          >” What word? Statutes, Deuteronomy 4:1, ceremonies and rites of
          worship. To baptize with water is Christ’s command; but who has added
          the sign of the cross? Christ instituted the sacrament of the supper:
          but who has added kneeling, to overturn the table-gesture, which we
          have from Christ’s own example? The Lord’s day is of divine
          institution: but whose are the numerous holidays observed in the
          church of England? Matthew 15:9. What is all this but an accusing the
          scripture of imperfection, as if God had not laid down a sufficient
          rule to teach us how we may glorify him: as if they were ashamed of
          simple scripture-worship, but they must deck it up in the whorish
          garments made by their own brains? God has a special zeal for his
          worship; and it becomes us to quicken our zeal for it, in a time when
          enemies are bringing in innovations in worship into this church, and
          setting up their Dagon beside the ark. But though God should, for our
          contempt of our pure worship, plague the land with this superstitious
          worship once more, yet as sure as Babylon shall fall, it shall fall
          and flee before the glory of the latter days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 6. Lastly, Be exhorted to study the holy scriptures. Read
          them in your families, and read them in secret, and cry for the Holy
          Spirit, who dictated them, to make you understand them. Lock them not
          up in your chests, and let them not lie dusty in your windows, as too
          many do to their shame and disgrace, lest the dust of them witness
          against you. Prefer the Bible to all other books, as the book whereof
          God himself is the author. Prize and esteem it, as shewing you the way
          to salvation, as a lamp to your feet, and a light to your paths.
