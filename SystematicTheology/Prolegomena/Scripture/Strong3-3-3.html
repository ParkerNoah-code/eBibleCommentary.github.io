        <h2>III. Theories of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>1. The Intuition-theory.</p>
        <p>
          This holds that inspiration is but a higher development of that
          natural insight into truth which all men possess to some degree; a
          mode of intelligence in matters of morals and religion which gives
          rise to sacred books, as a corresponding mode of intelligence in
          matters of secular truth gives rise to great works of philosophy or
          art. This mode of intelligence is regarded as the product of man’s own
          powers, either without special divine influence or with only the
          inworking of an impersonal God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory naturally connects itself with Pelagian and rationalistic
          views of man’s independence of God, or with pantheistic conceptions of
          man as being himself the highest manifestation of an all-pervading but
          unconscious intelligence. Morell and F. W. Newman in England, and
          Theodore Parker in America, are representatives of this theory. See
          Morell, Philos. of Religion, 127–179—“Inspiration is only a higher
          potency of what every man possesses in some degree.” See also Francis
          W. Newman (brother of John Henry Newman), Phases of Faith (= phases of
          unbelief); Theodore Parker, Discourses of Religion, and Experiences as
          a Minister: “God is infinite; therefore he is immanent in nature, yet
          transcending it; immanent in spirit, yet transcending that. He must
          fill each point of spirit, as of space; matter must unconsciously
          obey; man, conscious and free, has power to a certain extent to
          disobey, but obeying, the immanent God acts in man as much as in
          nature”—quoted in Chadwick, Theodore Parker, 271. Hence Parker’s view
          of Inspiration: If the conditions are fulfilled, inspiration comes in
          proportion to man’s gifts and to his use of those gifts. Chadwick
          himself, in his Old and New Unitarianism, 68, says that “the
          Scriptures are inspired just so far as they are inspiring, and no
          more.”
        </p>
        <p>
          W. C. Gannett, Life of Ezra Stiles Gannett, 196—“Parker’s spiritualism
          affirmed, as the grand truth of religion, the immanence of an
          infinitely perfect God in matter and mind, and his activity in both
          spheres.” Martineau, Study of Religion, 2:178–180—“Theodore Parker
          treats the regular results of the human faculties as an immediate
          working of God, and regards the Principia of Newton as inspired..…What
          then becomes of the human personality? He calls God not only
          omnipresent, but omniactive. Is then Shakespeare only by courtesy
          author of Macbeth?.…If this were more than rhetorical, it would be
          unconditional pantheism.” Both nature and man are other names for God.
          Martineau is willing to grant that our intuitions and ideals are
          expressions of the Deity in us, but our personal reasoning and
          striving, he thinks, cannot be attributed to God. The word νοῦς has no
          plural: intellect, in whatever subject manifested, being all one, just
          as a truth is one and the same, in however many persons’ consciousness
          it may present itself; see Martineau, Seat of Authority, 403. Palmer,
          Studies in Theological Definition, 27—“We can draw no sharp
          distinction between the human mind discovering truth, and the divine
          mind imparting revelation.” Kuenen belongs to this school.
        </p>
        <p>With regard to this theory we remark:</p>
        <p>
          (a) Man has, indeed, a certain natural insight into truth, and we
          grant that inspiration uses this, so far as it will go, and makes it
          an instrument in discovering and recording facts of nature or history.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the investigation, for example, of purely historical matters, such
          as Luke records, merely natural insight may at times have been
          sufficient. When this was the case, Luke may have been left to the
          exercise of his own faculties, inspiration only inciting and
          supervising the work. George Harris, Moral Evolution, 413—“God could
          not reveal himself to man, unless he first revealed himself in man. If
          it should be written in letters on the sky: ‘God is good,’—the words
          would have no meaning, unless goodness had been made known already in
          human volitions. Revelation is not by an occasional stroke, but by a
          continuous process. It is not superimposed, but inherent..…Genius is
          inspired; for the mind which perceives truth must be responsive to the
          Mind that made things the vehicles of thought.” Sanday, Bampton
          Lectures on Inspiration: “In claiming for the Bible inspiration, we do
          not exclude the possibility of other lower or more partial degrees of
          inspiration in other literatures. The Spirit of God has doubtless
          touched other hearts and other minds.…in such a way as to give insight
          into truth, besides those which could claim descent from Abraham.”
          Philo thought the LXX translators, the Greek philosophers, and at
          times even himself, to be inspired. Plato he regards as “most sacred”
          (ἱερώτατος), but all good men are in various degrees inspired. Yet
          Philo never quotes as authoritative any but the Canonical Books. He
          attributes to them an authority unique in its kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) In all matters of morals and religion, however, man’s insight into
          truth is vitiated by wrong affections, and, unless a supernatural
          wisdom can guide him, he is certain to err himself, and to lead others
          into error.
        </p>
        <p>
          1Co_2:14—“Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
          of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them,
          because they are spiritually judged”; 10—“But unto us God revealed
          them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the
          deep things of God.” See quotation from Coleridge, in Shairp, Culture
          and Religion, 114—“Water cannot rise higher than its source; neither
          can human reasoning”; Emerson, Prose Works, 1:474; 2:468—“ ’Tis
          curious we only believe as deep as we live”; Ullmann, Sinlessness of
          Jesus, 183, 184. For this reason we hold to a communication of
          religious truth, at least at times, more direct and objective than is
          granted by George Adam Smith, Com. on Isaiah 1:372—“To Isaiah
          inspiration was nothing more nor less than the possession of certain
          strong moral and religious convictions, which he felt he owed to the
          communication of the Spirit of God, and according to which he
          interpreted, and even dared to foretell, the history of his people and
          of the world. Our study completely dispels, on the evidence of the
          Bible itself, that view of inspiration and prediction so long held in
          the church.” If this is meant as a denial of any communication of
          truth other than the internal and subjective, we set over against it
          Num_12:6-8—“if there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make
          myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.
          My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house: with him
          will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark
          speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall he behold.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The theory in question, holding as it does that natural insight is
          the only source of religious truth, involves a self-contradiction;—if
          the theory be true, then one man is inspired to utter what a second is
          inspired to pronounce false. The Vedas, the Koran and the Bible cannot
          be inspired to contradict each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vedas permit thieving, and the Koran teaches salvation by works;
          these cannot be inspired and the Bible also. Paul cannot be inspired
          to write his epistles, and Swedenborg also inspired to reject them.
          The Bible does not admit that pagan teachings have the same divine
          endorsement with its own. Among the Spartans to steal was
          praiseworthy; only to be caught stealing was criminal. On the
          religious consciousness with regard to the personality of God, the
          divine goodness, the future life, the utility of prayer, in all of
          which Miss Cobbe, Mr. Greg and Mr. Parker disagree with each other,
          see Bruce, Apologetics, 143, 144. With Matheson we may grant that the
          leading idea of inspiration is “the growth of the divine through the
          capacities of the human,” while yet we deny that inspiration confines
          itself to this subjective enlightenment of the human faculties, and
          also we exclude from the divine working all those perverse and
          erroneous utterances which are the results of human sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) It makes moral and religious truth to be a purely subjective
          thing—a matter of private opinion—having no objective reality
          independently of men’s opinions regarding it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this system truth is what men ‘trow’; things are what men
          ‘think’—words representing only the subjective. “Better the Greek
          ἀλήθεια = ‘the unconcealed’ (objective truth)”—Harris, Philos. Basis
          of Theism, 182. If there be no absolute truth, Lessing’s ‘search for
          truth’ is the only thing left to us. But who will search, if there is
          no truth to be found? Even a wise cat will not eternally chase its own
          tail The exercise within certain limits is doubtless useful, but the
          cat gives it up so soon as it becomes convinced that the tail cannot
          be caught. Sir Richard Burton became a Roman Catholic, a Brahmin, and
          a Mohammedan, successively, apparently holding with Hamlet that "there
          is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” This same
          scepticism as to the existence of objective truth appears in the
          sayings: “Your religion is good for you, and mine for me”; “One man is
          born an Auguetinian, and another a Pelagian.” See Dix, Pantheism,
          Introd., 12. Richter: “It is not the goal, but the course, that makes
          us happy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) It logically involves the denial of a personal God who is truth
          and reveals truth, and so makes man to be the highest intelligence in
          the universe. This is to explain inspiration by denying its existence;
          since, if there be no personal God, inspiration is but a figure of
          speech for a purely natural fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animus of this theory is denial of the supernatural. Like the
          denial of miracles, it can be maintained only upon grounds of atheism
          or pantheism. The view in question, as Hutton in his Essays remarks,
          would permit us to say that the word of the Lord came to Gibbon, amid
          the ruins of the Coliseum, saying: “Go, write the history of the
          Decline and Fall!” But, replies Hutton: Such a view is pantheistic.
          Inspiration is the voice of a living friend, in distinction from the
          voice of a dead friend, i. e., the influence of his memory. The inward
          impulse of genius, Shakespeare’s for example, is not properly
          denominated inspiration. See Row, Bampton Lectures for 1877:428–474;
          Rogers, Eclipse of Faith, 73 sq. and 283 sq.; Henderson, Inspiration
          (2nd ed.), 443–469, 481–490. The view of Martineau, Seat of Authority,
          302, is substantially this. See criticism of Martineau, by Rainy, in
          Critical Rev_1:5-20.
        </p>
        <p>2. The Illumination Theory.</p>
        <p>
          This regards inspiration as merely an intensifying and elevating of
          the religious perceptions of the Christian, the same in kind, though
          greater in degree, with the illumination of every believer by the Holy
          Spirit. It holds, not that the Bible is, but that it contains, the
          word of God, and that not the writings, but only the writers, were
          inspired. The illumination given by the Holy Spirit, however, puts the
          inspired writer only in full possession of his normal powers, but does
          not communicate objective truth beyond his ability to discover or
          understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory naturally connects itself with Arminian views of mere
          coöperation with God. It differs from the Intuition-theory by
          containing several distinctively Christian elements: (1) the influence
          of a personal God; (2) an extraordinary work of the Holy Spirit; (3)
          the Christological character of the Scriptures, putting into form a
          revelation of which Christ is the centre (Rev_19:10). But while it
          grants that the Scripture writers were “moved by the Holy Spirit”
          (φερόμενοι—2Pe_1:21), it ignores the complementary fact that the
          Scripture itself is “inspired of God” (θεόπνευστος—2Ti_3:16). Luther’s
          view resembles this; see Dorner, Gesch. prot. Theol., 236, 237.
          Schleiermacher, with the more orthodox Neander, Tholuck and Cremer,
          holds it; see Essays by Tholuck, in Herzog, Encyclopädie, and in
          Noyes, Theological Essays; Cremer, Lexicon N. T., θεόπνευστος, and in
          Herzog and Hauck, Realencyc, 9:183–203. In France, Sabatier, Philos.
          Religion, 90, remarks: “Prophetic inspiration is piety raised to the
          second power”—it differs from the piety of common men only in
          intensity and energy. See also Godet, in Revue Chrétienne, Jan. 1878.
        </p>
        <p>
          In England Coleridge propounded this view in his Confessions of an
          Inquiring Spirit (Works, 5:669)—“Whatever finds me bears witness that
          it has proceeded from a Holy Spirit; in the Bible there is more that
          finds me than I have experienced in all other books put together.”
          [Shall we then call Baxter’s “Saints’ Rest” inspired, while the Books
          of Chronicles are not?] See also F. W. Robertson, Sermon I; Life and
          Letters, letter 53, vol. 1:270; 2:143–150—“The other way, some twenty
          or thirty men in the world’s history have had special communication,
          miraculous and from God; in this way, all may have it, and by devout
          and earnest cultivation of the mind and heart may have it inimitably
          increased.” Frederick W. H. Myers, Catholic Thoughts on the Bible and
          Theology, 10–20, emphasizes the idea that the Scriptures are, in their
          earlier parts, not merely inadequate, but partially untrue, and
          subsequently superseded by fuller revelations. The leading thought is
          that of accommodation; the record of revelation is not necessarily
          infallible. Allen, Religious Progress, 44, quotes Bishop Thirlwall:
          “If that Spirit by which every man spoke of old is a living and
          present Spirit, its later lessons may well transcend its
          earlier”;—Pascal’s ‘colossal man’ is the race; the first men
          represented only infancy; we are ‘the ancients’, and we are wiser than
          our fathers. See also Farrar, Critical History of Free Trought, 473,
          note 50; Martineau, Studies in Christianity: “One Gospel in Many
          Dialects.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Of American writers who favor this view, see J. F. Clarke, Orthodoxy,
          its Truths and Errors, 74; Curtis, Human Element in Inspiration;
          Whiton, in N. Eng., Jan. 1882:63–72; Ladd, in Andover Review, July,
          1885, in What is the Bible? and in Doctrine of Sacred Scripture,
          1:759—“a large proportion of its writings inspired”; 2:178, 275,
          497—“that fundamental misconception which identifies the Bible and the
          word of God”; 2:488—“Inspiration, as the subjective condition of
          Biblical revelation and the predicate of the word of God, is
          specifically the same illumining, quickening, elevating and purifying
          work of the Holy Spirit as that which goes on in the persons of the
          entire believing community.” Professor Ladd therefore pares down all
          predictive prophecy, and regards Isa_53:1-12, not as directly and
          solely, but only as typically, Messianic. Clarke, Christian Theology,
          35–44—“Inspiration is exaltation, quickening of ability, stimulation
          of spiritual power; it is uplifting and enlargement of capacity for
          perception, comprehension and utterance; and all under the influence
          of a thought, a truth, or an ideal that has taken possession of the
          soul.…Inspiration to write was not different in kind from the common
          influence of God upon his people.…Inequality in the Scriptures is
          plain.…Even if we were convinced that some book would better have been
          omitted from the Canon, our confidence in the Scriptures would not
          thereby be shaken. The Canon did not make Scripture, but Scripture
          made the Canon. The inspiration of the Bible does not prove its
          excellence, but its excellence proves its inspiration. The Spirit
          brought the Scriptures to help Christ’s work, but not to take his
          place. Scripture says with Paul: ‘Not that we have lordship over your
          faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast’
          (2Co_1:24).”
        </p>
        <p>
          E. G. Robinson: “The office of the Spirit in inspiration is not
          different from that which he performed for Christians at the time the
          gospels were written.…When the prophets say: ‘Thus saith the Lord,’
          they mean simply that they have divine authority for what they utter.”
          Calvin E. Stowe, History of Books of Bible, 19—“It is not the words of
          the Bible that were inspired. It is not the thoughts of the Bible that
          were Inspired. It was the men who wrote the Bible who were inspired.”
          Thayer, Changed Attitude toward the Bible, 63—“It was not before the
          polemic spirit became rife in the controversies which followed the
          Reformation that the fundamental distinction between the word of God
          and the record of that word became obliterated, and the pestilent
          tenet gained currency that the Bible is absolutely free from every
          error of every sort.” Principal Cave, in Homiletical Review, Feb.
          1892, admitting errors but none serious in the Bible, proposes a
          mediating statement for the present controversy, namely, that
          Revelation implies inerrancy, but that Inspiration does not. Whatever
          God reveals must be true, but many have become inspired without being
          rendered infallible. See also Mead, Supernatural Revelation, 291 sq.
        </p>
        <p>With regard to this theory we remark:</p>
        <p>
          (a) There is unquestionably an illumination of the mind of every
          believer by the Holy Spirit, and we grant that there may have been
          instances in which the influence of the Spirit, in inspiration,
          amounted only to illumination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain applications and interpretations of Old Testament Scripture,
          as for example, John the Baptist’s application to Jesus of Isaiah’s
          prophecy (Joh_1:29—“Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away [marg.
          ‘beareth’] the sin of the world”), and Peter’s interpretation of
          David’s words (Act_2:27—“thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades,
          Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption”), may have
          required only the illuminating influence of the Holy Spirit. There is
          a sense in which we may say that the Scriptures are inspired only to
          those who are themselves inspired. The Holy Spirit must show us Christ
          before we recognize the work of the Spirit in Scripture. The doctrines
          of atonement and of justification perhaps did not need to be newly
          revealed to the N. T. writers; illumination as to earlier revelations
          may have sufficed. But that Christ existed before his incarnation, and
          that there are personal distinctions in the Godhead, probably required
          revelation. Edison says that “inspiration is simply perspiration.”
          Genius has been defined as “unlimited power to take pains.” But it is
          more—the power to do spontaneously and without effort what the
          ordinary man does by the hardest. Every great genius recognizes that
          this power is due to the inflowing into him of a Spirit greater than
          his own—the Spirit of divine wisdom and energy. The Scripture writers
          attribute their understanding of divine things to the Holy Spirit; see
          next paragraph. On genius, as due to “subliminal uprush,” see F. W. H.
          Myers, Human Personality, 1:70–120.

          (b) But we deny that this was the constant method of inspiration, or
          that such an influence can account for the revelation of new truth to
          the prophets and apostles. The illumination of the Holy Spirit gives
          no new truth, but only a vivid apprehension of the truth already
          revealed. Any original communication of truth must have required a
          work of the Spirit different, not in degree, but in kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures clearly distinguish between revelation, or the
          communication of new truth, and illumination, or the quickening of
          man’s cognitive powers to perceive truth already revealed. No increase
          in the power of the eye or the telescope will do more than to bring
          into clear view what is already within its range. Illumination will
          not lift the veil that hides what is beyond. Revelation, on the other
          hand, is an ‘unveiling’—the raising of a curtain, or the bringing
          within our range of what was hidden before. Such a special operation
          of God is described in 2Sa_23:2-3—“The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me,
          And his word was upon my tongue. The God of Israel said, The Rock of
          Israel spake to me”; Mat_10:20—“For it is not ye that speak, but the
          Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you”; 1Co_2:9-13—“Things which
          eye saw not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart
          of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him. But
          unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth
          all things, yea, the deep things of God. For who among men knoweth the
          things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so
          the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. But we
          received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from
          God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of
          God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Clairvoyance and second sight, of which along with many cases of
          imposition and exaggeration there seems to be a small residuum of
          proved fact, show that there may be extraordinary operations of our
          natural powers. But, as in the case of miracle, the inspiration of
          Scripture necessitated an exaltation of these natural powers such as
          only the special influence of the Holy Spirit can explain. That the
          product is inexplicable as due to mere illumination seems plain when
          we remember that revelation sometimes excluded illumination as to the
          meaning of that which was communicated, for the prophets are
          represented in 1Pe_1:11 as “searching what time or what manner of time
          the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it
          testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that
          should follow them.” Since no degree of illumination can account for
          the prediction of “things that are to come” (Joh_16:13), this theory
          tends to the denial of any immediate revelation in prophecy so-called,
          and the denial easily extends to any immediate revelation of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Mere illumination could not secure the Scripture writers from
          frequent and grievous error. The spiritual perception of the Christian
          is always rendered to some extent imperfect and deceptive by remaining
          depravity. The subjective element so predominates in this theory, that
          no certainty remains even with regard to the trustworthiness of the
          Scriptures as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we admit imperfections of detail in matters not essential to the
          moral and religious teaching of Scripture, we claim that the Bible
          furnishes a sufficient guide to Christ and to salvation. The theory we
          are considering, however, by making the measure of holiness to be the
          measure of inspiration, renders even the collective testimony of the
          Scripture writers an uncertain guide to truth. We point out therefore
          that inspiration is not absolutely limited by the moral condition of
          those who are inspired. Knowledge, in the Christian, may go beyond
          conduct. Balaam and Caiaphas were not holy men, yet they were inspired
          (Num_23:5; Joh_11:49-52). The promise of Christ assured at least the
          essential trustworthiness of his witnesses (Mat_10:7; Mat_10:19-20;
          Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26-27; Joh_16:13; Joh_17:8). This theory that
          inspiration is a wholly subjective communication of truth leads to the
          practical rejection of important parts of Scripture, in fact to the
          rejection of all Scripture that professes to convey truth beyond the
          power of man to discover or to understand. Notice the progress from
          Thomas Arnold (Sermons, 2:185) to Matthew Arnold (Literature and
          Dogma, 134, 137). Notice also Swedenborg’s rejection of nearly one
          half the Bible (Ruth, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job,
          Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and the whole of the N. T.
          except the Gospels and the Apocalypse), connected with the claim of
          divine authority for his new revelation. “His interlocutors all
          Swedenborgize” (R. W. Emerson). On Swedenborg, see Hours with the
          Mystics, 2:230; Moehler, Symbolism, 436–466; New Englander, Jan.
          1874:195; Baptist Review, 1883:143–157; Pond, Swedenborgianism;
          Ireland, The Blot on the Brain, 1–129.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The theory is logically indefensible, as intimating that
          illumination with regard to truth can be imparted without imparting
          truth itself, whereas God must first furnish objective truth to be
          perceived before he can illuminate the mind to perceive the meaning of
          that truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory is analogous to the views that preservation is a continued
          creation; knowledge is recognition; regeneration is increase of light.
          In order to preservation, something must first be created which can be
          preserved; in order to recognition, something must be known which can
          be recognized or known again; in order to make increase of light of
          any use, there must first be the power to see. In like manner,
          inspiration cannot be mere illumination, because the external
          necessarily precedes the internal, the objective precedes the
          subjective, the truth revealed precedes the apprehension of that
          truth. In the case of all truth that surpasses the normal powers of
          man to perceive or evolve, there must be special communication from
          God; revelation must go before inspiration; inspiration alone is not
          revelation. It matters not whether this communication of truth be from
          without or from within. As in creation, God can work from within, yet
          the new result is not explicable as mere reproduction of the past. The
          eye can see only as it receives and uses the external light furnished
          by the sun, even though it be equally true that without the eye the
          light of the sun would be nothing worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Grundriss, 17–19, says that to Schleiermacher revelation
          is the original appearance of a proper religious life, which life is
          derived neither from external communication nor from invention and
          reflection, but from a divine impartation, which impartation can be
          regarded, not merely as an instructive influence upon man as an
          intellectual being, but as an endowment determining his whole personal
          existence—an endowment analogous to the higher conditions of poetic
          and heroic exaltation. Pfleiderer himself would give the name
          “revelation” to “every original experience in which man becomes aware
          of, and is seized by, supersensible truth, truth which does not come
          from external impartation nor from purposed reflection, but from the
          unconscious and undivided transcendental ground of the soul, and so is
          received as an impartation from God through the medium of the soul’s
          human activity.” Kaftan, Dogmatik, 51 sq.—“We must put the conception
          of revelation in place of inspiration. Scripture is the record of
          divine revelation. We do not propose a new doctrine of inspiration, in
          place of the old. We need only revelation, and, here and there,
          providence. The testimony of the Holy Spirit is given, not to
          inspiration, but to revelation—the truths that touch the human spirit
          and have been historically revealed.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Allen, Jonathan Edwards, 182—Edwards held that spiritual life in the
          soul is given by God only to his favorites and dear children, while
          inspiration may be thrown out, as it were, to dogs and swine—a Balaam,
          Saul, and Judas. The greatest privilege of apostles and prophets was,
          not their inspiration, but their holiness. Better to have grace in the
          heart, than to be the mother of Christ (Luk_11:27-28). Maltbie D.
          Babcock, in S. S. Times, 1901:590—“The man who mourns because
          infallibility cannot be had in a church, or a guide, or a set of
          standards, does not know when he is well off. How could God develop
          our minds, our power of moral judgment, if there were no ‘spirit to be
          tried’ (1Jn_4:1), no necessity for discrimination, no discipline of
          search and challenge and choice? To give the right answer to a problem
          is to put him on the side of infallibility so far as that answer is
          concerned, but it is to do him an ineffable wrong touching his real
          education. The blessing of life’s schooling is not in knowing the
          right answer in advance, but in developing power through struggle.”

          Why did John Henry Newman surrender to the Church of Rome? Because he
          assumed that an external authority is absolutely essential to
          religion, and, when such an assumption is followed, Rome is the only
          logical terminus. “Dogma was,” he says, “the fundamental principle of
          my religion.” Modern ritualism is a return to this mediæval notion.
          “Dogmatic Christianity,” says Harnack, “is Catholic. It needs an
          inerrant Bible, and an infallible church to interpret that Bible. The
          dogmatic Protestant is of the same camp with the sacramental and
          infallible Catholic.” Lyman Abbott: “The new Reformation denies the
          infallibility of the Bible, as the Protestant Reformation denied the
          infallibility of the Church. There is no infallible authority.
          Infallible authority is undesirable.…God has given us something far
          better,—life.…The Bible is the record of the gradual manifestation of
          God to man in human experience, in moral laws and their applications,
          and in the life of Him who was God manifest in the flesh.”

          Leighton Williams: “There is no inspiration apart from experience.
          Baptists are not sacramental, nor creedal, but experimental
          Christians”—not Romanists, nor Protestants, but believers in an inner
          light. “Life, as it develops, awakens into self-consciousness. That
          self-consciousness becomes the most reliable witness as to the nature
          of the life of which it is the development. Within the limits of its
          own sphere, its authority is supreme. Prophecy is the utterance of the
          soul in moments of deep religious experience. The inspiration of
          Scripture writers is not a peculiar thing,—it was given that the same
          inspiration might be perfected in those who read their writings.”
          Christ is the only ultimate authority, and he reveals himself in three
          ways, through Scripture, the Reason, and the Church. Only Life saves,
          and the Way leads through the Truth to the Life. Baptists stand nearer
          to the Episcopal system of life than to the Presbyterian system of
          creed. Whiton, Gloria Patri, 136—“The mistake is in looking to the
          Father above the world, rather than to the Son and the Spirit within
          the world, as the immediate source of revelation.…Revelation is the
          unfolding of the life and thought of God within the world. One should
          not be troubled by finding errors in the Scriptures, any more than by
          finding imperfections in any physical work of God, as in the human
          eye.”
        </p>
        <p>3. The Dictation-theory.</p>
        <p>
          This theory holds that inspiration consisted in such a possession of
          the minds and bodies of the Scripture writers by the Holy Spirit, that
          they became passive instruments or amanuenses—pens, not penmen, of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory naturally connects itself with that view of miracles which
          regards them as suspensions or violations of natural law. Dorner,
          Glaubenslehre, 1:624 (transl. 2:186–189), calls it a “docetic view of
          inspiration. It holds to the abolition of second causes, and to the
          perfect passivity of the human instrument; denies any inspiration of
          persons, and maintains inspiration of writings only. This exaggeration
          of the divine element led to the hypothesis of a multiform divine
          sense in Scripture, and, in assigning the spiritual meaning, a
          rationalizing spirit led the way.” Representatives of this view are
          Quenstedt, Theol. Didact., 1:76—“The Holy Ghost inspired his
          amanuenses with those expressions which they would have employed, had
          they been left to themselves”; Hooker, Works, 2:383—“They neither
          spake nor wrote any word of their own, but uttered syllable by
          syllable as the Spirit put it into their mouths”; Gauaaen,
          Theopneusty, 61—“The Bible is not a book which God charged men already
          enlightened to make under his protection; it is a book which God
          dictated to them”; Cunningham, Theoi. Lectures, 349—“The verbal
          inspiration of the Scriptures [which he advocates] implies in general
          that the words of Scripture were suggested or dictated by the Holy
          Spirit, as well as the substance of the matter, and this, not only in
          some portion of the Scriptures, but through the whole.” This reminds
          us of the old theory that God created fossils in the rocks, as they
          would be had ancient seas existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanday, Bamp. Lect. on Inspiration, 74, quotes Philo as saying: “A
          prophet gives forth nothing at all of his own, but acts as interpreter
          at the prompting of another in all his utterances, and as long as he
          is under inspiration he is in ignorance, his reason departing from its
          place and yielding up the citadel of the soul, when the divine Spirit
          enters into it and dwells in it and strikes at the mechanism of the
          voice, sounding through it to the clear declaration of that which he
          prophesieth”; in Gen_15:12—“About the setting of the sun a trance came
          upon Abram”—the sun is the light of human reason which sets and gives
          place to the Spirit of God. Sanday, 78, says also: “Josephus holds
          that even historical narratives, such as those at the beginning of the
          Pentateuch which were not written down by contemporary prophets, were
          obtained by direct inspiration from God. The Jews from their birth
          regard their Scripture as ‘the decrees of God,’ which they strictly
          observe, and for which if need be they are ready to die.” The Rabbis
          said that “Moses did not write one word out of his own knowledge.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Reformers held to a much freer view than this. Luther said: “What
          does not carry Christ with it, is not apostolic, even though St. Peter
          or St. Paul taught it. If our adversaries fall back on the Scripture
          against Christ, we fall back on Christ against the Scripture.” Luther
          refused canonical authority to books not actually written by apostles
          or composed, like Mark and Luke, under their direction. So he rejected
          from the rank of canonical authority Hebrews, James, Jude, 2 Peter and
          Revelation. Even Calvin doubted the Petrine authorship of 2 Peter,
          excluded the book of Revelation from the Scripture on which he wrote
          Commentaries, and also thus ignored the second and third epistles of
          John; see Prof. R. E. Thompson, in S. S. Times, Dec. 3, 1898:803, 804.
          The dictation-theory is post-Reformation. H. P. Smith, Bib.
          Scholarship and Inspiration, 85—“After the Council of Trent, the Roman
          Catholic polemic became sharper. It became the endeavor of that party
          to show the necessity of tradition and the untrustworthiness of
          Scripture alone. This led the Protestants to defend the Bible more
          tenaciously than before.” The Swiss Formula of Consensus in 1675 not
          only called the Scriptures “the very word of God,” but declared the
          Hebrew vowel-points to be inspired, and some theologians traced them
          back to Adam. John Owen held to the inspiration of the vowel-points;
          see Horton, Inspiration and Bible, 8. Of the age which produced the
          Protestant dogmatic theology, Charles Beard, in the Hibbert Lectures
          for 1883, says: “I know no epoch of Christianity to which I could more
          confidently point in illustration of the fact that where there is most
          theology, there is often least religion.”
        </p>
        <p>Of this view we may remark:</p>
        <p>
          (a) We grant that there are instances when God’s communications were
          uttered in an audible voice and took a definite form of words, and
          that this was sometimes accompanied with the command to commit the
          words to writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          For examples, see Exo_3:4—“God called unto him out of the midst of the
          bush, and said, Moses, Moses”; Exo_20:22—“Ye yourselves have seen that
          I have talked with you from heaven”; cf. Heb_12:19—“the voice of
          words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should
          be spoken unto them”; Num_7:89—“And when Moses went into the tent of
          meeting to speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him
          from above the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the testimony, from
          between the two cherubim: and he spake unto him”; 8:1—“And Jehovah
          spake unto Moses, saying,” etc.; Dan_4:31—“While the word was in the
          king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king
          Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from
          thee”; Act_9:5—“And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am
          Jesus whom thou persecutest”; Rev_19:9—“And he saith unto me, Write,
          Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb”;
          Rev_21:5—“And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all
          things new”; cf. Rev_1:10-11—“and I heard behind me a great voice, as
          of a trumpet saying, What thou seest, write in a book and send it to
          the seven churches.” So the voice from heaven at the baptism, and at
          the transfiguration, of Jesus (Mat_3:17; Mat_17:5; see Broadus, Amer.
          Com., on these passages).
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The theory in question, however, rests upon a partial induction of
          Scripture facts,—unwarrantably assuming that such occasional instances
          of direct dictation reveal the invariable method of God’s
          communications of truth to the writers of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture nowhere declares that this immediate communication of the
          words was universal. On 1Co_2:13—οὐκ ἐν διδακτοῖς ἀνθρωπίνης σοφίας
          λόγοις, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν διδακτοῖς πνεύματος, the text usually cited as proof
          of invariable dictation—Meyer says: “There is no dictation here;
          διδακτοῖς excludes everything mechanical.” Henderson, Inspiration (2nd
          ed.), 333, 349—“As human wisdom did not dictate word for word, so the
          Spirit did not.” Paul claims for Scripture simply a general style of
          plainness which is due to the influence of the Spirit. Manly:
          “Dictation to an amanuensis is not teaching.” Our Revised Version
          properly translates the remainder of the verse, 1Co_2:13—“combining
          spiritual things with spiritual words.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It cannot account for the manifestly human element in the
          Scriptures. There are peculiarities of style which distinguish the
          productions of each writer from those of every other, and there are
          variations in accounts of the same transaction which are inconsistent
          with the theory of a solely divine authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice Paul’s anacoloutha and his bursts of grief and indignation
          (Rom_5:12 sq., 2Co_11:1 sq.), and his ignorance of the precise number
          whom he had baptized (1Co_1:16). One beggar or two (Mat_20:30; cf.
          Luk_18:35); “about five and twenty or thirty furlongs” (Joh_6:19);
          “shed for many” (Mat_26:28 has περί, Mar_14:24 and Luk_22:20 have
          ὑπέρ). Dictation of words which were immediately to be lost by
          imperfect transcription? Clarke, Christian Theology, 33–37—“We are
          under no obligation to maintain the complete inerrancy of the
          Scriptures. In them we have the freedom of life, rather than
          extraordinary precision of statement or accuracy of detail. We have
          become Christians in spite of differences between the evangelists. The
          Scriptures are various, progressive, free. There is no authority in
          Scripture for applying the word ‘inspired’ to our present Bible as a
          whole, and theology is not bound to employ this word in defining the
          Scriptures. Christianity is founded in history, and will stand whether
          the Scriptures are inspired or not. If special inspiration were wholly
          disproved, Christ would still be the Savior of the world. But the
          divine element in the Scriptures will never be disproved.”

          (d) It is inconsistent with a wise economy of means, to suppose that
          the Scripture writers should have had dictated to them what they knew
          already, or what they could inform themselves of by the use of their
          natural powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why employ eye-witnesses at all? Why not dictate the gospels to
          Gentiles living a thousand years before? God respects the instruments
          he has called into being, and he uses them according to their
          constitutional gifts. George Eliot represents Stradivarius as
          saying:—“If my hand slacked, I should rob God—since he is fullest
          good—Leaving a blank instead of violins. God cannot make Antonio
          Stradivari s violins, Without Antonio.” Mar_11:3—“The Lord hath need
          of him,” may apply to man as well as beast.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) It contradicts what we know of the law of God’s working in the
          soul. The higher and nobler God’s communications, the more fully is
          man in possession and use of his own facilities. We cannot suppose
          that this highest work of man under the influence of the Spirit was
          purely mechanical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph receives communication by vision (Mat_1:20); Mary, by words of
          an angel spoken in her waking moments (Luk_1:28). The more advanced
          the recipient, the more conscious the communication. These four
          theories might almost be called the Pelagian, the Arminian, the
          Docetic, and the Dynamical. Sabatier, Philos. Religion, 41, 42, 87—“In
          the Gospel of the Hebrews, the Father says at the baptism to Jesus:
          ‘My Son, in all the prophets I was waiting for thee, that thou
          mightest come, and that I might rest in thee. For thou art my Rest.’
          Inspiration becomes more and more internal, until in Christ it is
          continuous and complete. Upon the opposite Docetic view, the most
          perfect inspiration should have been that of Balaam’s ass.” Semler
          represents the Pelagian or Ebionitic view, as Quenstedt represents
          this Docetic view. Semler localizes and temporalizes the contents of
          Scripture. Yet, though he carried this to the extreme of excluding any
          divine authorship, he did good service in leading the way to the
          historical study of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>4. The Dynamical Theory.</p>
        <p>
          The true view holds, in opposition to the first of these theories,
          that inspiration is not simply a natural but also a supernatural fact,
          and that it is the immediate work of a personal God in the soul of
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          It holds, in opposition to the second, that inspiration belongs, not
          only to the men who wrote the Scriptures, but to the Scriptures which
          they wrote, so that these Scriptures, when taken together, constitute
          a trustworthy and sufficient record of divine revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It holds, in opposition to the third theory, that the Scriptures
          contain a human as well as a divine element, so that while they
          present a body of divinely revealed truth, this truth is shaped in
          human moulds and adapted to ordinary human intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, inspiration is characteristically neither natural, partial,
          nor mechanical, but supernatural, plenary, and dynamical. Further
          explanations will be grouped under the head of The Union of the Divine
          and Human Elements in Inspiration, in the section which immediately
          follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the small circle be taken as symbol of the human element in
          inspiration, and the large circle as symbol of the divine, then the
          Intuition-theory would be represented by the small circle alone; the
          Dictation-theory by the large circle alone; the Illumination-theory by
          the small circle external to the large, and touching it at only a
          single point; the Dynamical-theory by two concentric circles, the
          small included in the large. Even when inspiration is but the
          exaltation and intensification of man’s natural powers, it must be
          considered the work of God as well as of man. God can work from within
          as well as from without. As creation and regeneration are works of the
          immanent rather than of the transcendent God, so inspiration is in
          general a work within man’s soul, rather than a communication to him
          from without. Prophecy may be natural to perfect humanity. Revelation
          is an unveiling, and the Röntgen rays enable us to see through a veil.
          But the insight of the Scripture writers into truth so far beyond
          their mental and moral powers is inexplicable except by a supernatural
          influence upon their minds; in other words, except as they were lifted
          up into the divine Reason and endowed with the wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we propose this Dynamical-theory as one which best explains
          the Scripture facts, we do not regard this or any other theory as of
          essential importance. No theory of inspiration is necessary to
          Christian faith. Revelation precedes inspiration. There was religion
          before the Old Testament, and an oral gospel before the New Testament.
          God might reveal without recording; might permit record without
          inspiration; might inspire without vouching for anything more than
          religious teaching and for the history, only so far as was necessary
          to that religious teaching. Whatever theory of inspiration we frame,
          should be the result of a strict induction of the Scripture facts, and
          not an a priori scheme to which Scripture must be conformed. The fault
          of many past discussions of the subject is the assumption that God
          must adopt some particular method of inspiration, or secure an
          absolute perfection of detail in matters not essential to the
          religious teaching of Scripture. Perhaps the best theory of
          inspiration is to have no theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warfield and Hodge, Inspiration, 8—“Very many religious and historical
          truths must be established before we come to the question of
          inspiration, as for instance the being and moral government of God,
          the fallen condition of man, the fact of a redemptive scheme, the
          general historical truth of the Scriptures, and the validity and
          authority of the revelation of God’s will which they contain, i. e.,
          the general truth of Christianity and of its doctrines. Hence it
          follows that while the inspiration of the Scriptures is true, and
          being true is a principle fundamental to the adequate interpretation
          of Scripture, it nevertheless is not, in the first instance, a
          principle fundamental to the truth of the Christian religion.”
          Warfleld, in Presb. and Ref. Rev., April, 1893:208—“We do not found
          the whole Christian system on the doctrine of inspiration..…Were there
          no such thing as inspiration, Christianity would be true, and all its
          essential doctrines would be credibly witnessed to us”—in the gospels
          and in the living church. F. L. Patton, Inspiration, 22—“I must take
          exception to the disposition of some to stake the fortunes of
          Christianity on the doctrine of inspiration. Not that I yield to any
          one in profound conviction of the truth and importance of the
          doctrine. But it is proper for us to bear in mind the immense
          argumentative advantage which Christianity has, aside altogether from
          the inspiration of the documents on which it rests.” So argue also
          Sanday, Oracles of God, and Dale, The Living Christ.
