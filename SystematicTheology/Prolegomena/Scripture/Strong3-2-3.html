        <h2>I. Genuineness of the Christian Documents</h2>
        <p>1. Scripture teaching in general.</p>
        <p>A. The Bible is the work of one mind.</p>
        <p>
          (a) In spite of its variety of authorship and the vast separation of
          its writers from one another in point of time, there is a unity of
          subject, spirit, and aim throughout the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          We here begin a new department of Christian evidences. We have thus
          far only adduced external evidence. We now turn our attention to
          internal evidence. The relation of external to internal evidence seems
          to be suggested in Christ’s two questions in Mar_8:27; Mar_8:29—“Who
          do men say that I am? … who say ye that I am?” The unity in variety
          displayed in Scripture is one of the chief internal evidences. This
          unity is indicated in our word “Bible,” in the singular number. Yet
          the original word was “Biblia,” a plural number. The world has come to
          see a unity in what were once scattered fragments: the many “Biblia”
          have become one “Bible.” In one sense R. W. Emerson’s contention is
          true: “The Bible is not a book,—it is a literature.” But we may also
          say, and with equal truth: “The Bible is not simply a collection of
          books,—it is a book.” The Bible is made up of sixty-six books, by
          forty writers, of all ranks,—shepherds, fishermen, priests, warriors,
          statesmen, kings,—composing their works at intervals through a period
          of seventeen centuries. Evidently no collusion between them is
          possible. Scepticism tends ever to ascribe to the Scriptures greater
          variety of authorship and date, but all this only increases the wonder
          of the Bible’s unity. If unity in a half dozen writers is remarkable,
          in forty it is astounding. “The many diverse instruments of this
          orchestra play one perfect tune: hence we feel that they are led by
          one master and composer.” Yet it takes the same Spirit who inspired
          the Bible to teach its unity. The union is not an external or
          superficial one, but one that is internal and spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Not one moral or religious utterance of all these writers has been
          contradicted or superseded by the utterances of those who have come
          later, but all together constitute a consistent system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we must distinguish between the external form and the moral and
          religious substance. Jesus declares in Mat_5:21-22; Mat_5:27-28;
          Mat_5:33-34; Mat_5:38-39; Mat_5:43-44, “Ye have heard that it was said
          to them of old time … but I say onto you,” and then he seems at first
          sight to abrogate certain original commands. But he also declares in
          this connection, Mat_5:17-18—“Think not I am come to destroy the law
          or the prophets: I came not to destroy but to fulfil. For verily I say
          unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall
          in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.”
          Christ’s new commandments only bring out the inner meaning of the old.
          He fulfils them not in their literal form but in their essential
          spirit. So the New Testament completes the revelation of the Old
          Testament and makes the Bible a perfect unity. In this unity the Bible
          stands alone. Hindu, Persian, and Chinese religious books contain no
          consistent system of faith. There is progress in revelation from the
          earlier to the later books of the Bible, but this is not progress
          through successive steps of falsehood; it is rather progress from a
          less to a more clear and full unfolding of the truth. The whole truth
          lay germinally in the protevangelium uttered to our first parents
          (Gen_3:15—the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head).
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Each of these writings, whether early or late, has represented
          moral and religious ideas greatly in advance of the age in which it
          has appeared, and these ideas still lead the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          All our ideas of progress, with all the forward-looking spirit of
          modern Christendom, are due to Scripture. The classic nations had no
          such ideas and no such spirit, except as they caught them from the
          Hebrews. Virgil’s prophecy, in his fourth Eclogue, of a coming virgin
          and of the reign of Saturn and of the return of the golden age, was
          only the echo of the Sibylline books and of the hope of a Redeemer
          with which the Jews had leavened the whole Roman world; see A. H.
          Strong, The Great Poets and their Theology, 94–96.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) It is impossible to account for this unity without supposing such
          a supernatural suggestion and control that the Bible, while in its
          various parts written by human agents, is yet equally the work of a
          superhuman intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may contrast with the harmony between the different Scripture
          writers the contradictions and refutations which follow merely human
          philosophies—e. g., the Hegelian idealism and the Spencerian
          materialism. Hegel is “a name to swear at, as well as to swear by.”
          Dr. Stirling, in his Secret of Hegel, “kept all the secret to himself,
          if he ever knew it.” A certain Frenchman once asked Hegel if he could
          not gather up and express his philosophy in one sentence for him.
          “No,” Hegel replied, “at least not in French.” If Talleyrand’s maxim
          be true that whatever is not intelligible is not French, Hegel’s
          answer was a correct one. Hegel said of his disciples: “There is only
          one man living who understands me, and he does not.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Goeschel, Gabler, Daub, Marheinecke, Erdmann, are Hegel’s right wing,
          or orthodox representatives and followers in theology; see Sterrett,
          Hegel’s Philosophy of Religion. Hegel is followed by Alexander and
          Bradley in England, but is opposed by Seth and Schiller. Upton,
          Hibbert Lectures, 279–300, gives a valuable estimate of his position
          and influence: Hegel is all thought and no will. Prayer has no effect
          on God,—it is a purely psychological phenomenon. There is no
          free-will, and man’s sin as much as man’s holiness is a manifestation
          of the Eternal. Evolution is a fact, but it is only fatalistic
          evolution. Hegel notwithstanding did great service by substituting
          knowledge of reality for the oppressive Kantian relativity, and by
          banishing the old notion of matter as a mysterious substance wholly
          unlike and incompatible with the properties of mind. He did great
          service also by showing that the interactions of matter and mind are
          explicable only by the presence of the Absolute Whole in every part,
          though he erred greatly by carrying that idea of the unity of God and
          man beyond its proper limits, and by denying that God has given to the
          will of man any power to put itself into antagonism to His Will. Hegel
          did great service by showing that we cannot know even the part without
          knowing the whole, but he erred in teaching, as T. H. Green did, that
          the relations constitute the reality of the thing. He deprives both
          physical and psychical existences of that degree of selfhood or
          independent reality which is essential to both science and religion.
          We want real force, and not the mere idea of force; real will, and not
          mere thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. This one mind that made the Bible is the same mind that made the
          soul, for the Bible is divinely adapted to the soul.
        </p>
        <p>(a) It shows complete acquaintance with the soul.</p>
        <p>
          The Bible addresses all parts of man’s nature. There are Law and
          Epistles for man’s reason; Psalms and Gospels for his affections;
          Prophets and Revelations for his imagination. Hence the popularity of
          the Scriptures, Their variety holds men. The Bible has become
          interwoven into modern life. Law, literature, art, all show its
          moulding influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It judges the soul—contradicting its passions, revealing its
          guilt, and humbling its pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          No product of mere human nature could thus look down upon human nature
          and condemn it. The Bible speaks to us from a higher level. The
          Samaritan woman’s words apply to the whole compass of divine
          revelation; it tells us all things that ever we did (Joh_4:29). The
          Brahmin declared that Rom_1:1-32, with its description of heathen
          vices, must have been forged after the missionaries came to India.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It meets the deepest needs of the soul—by solutions of its
          problems, disclosures of God’s character, presentations of the way of
          pardon, consolations and promises for life and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither Socrates nor Seneca Bets forth the nature, origin and
          consequences of sin as committed against the holiness of God, nor do
          they point out the way of pardon and renewal. The Bible teaches us
          what nature cannot, viz.: God’s creatorship, the origin of evil, the
          method of restoration, the certainty of a future state, and the
          principle of rewards and punishments there.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Yet it is silent upon many questions for which writings of merely
          human origin seek first to provide solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare the account of Christ’s infancy in the gospels with the fables
          of the Apocryphal New Testament; compare the scant utterances of
          Scripture with regard to the future state with Mohammed’s and
          Swedenborg’s revelations of Paradise. See Alexander McLaren’s sermon
          on The Silence of Scripture, in his book entitled: Christ in the
          Heart, 131–141.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) There are infinite depths and inexhaustible reaches of meaning in
          Scripture, which difference it from all other books, and which compel
          us to believe that its author must be divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir Walter Scott, on his death bed: “Bring me the Book!” “What book?”
          said Lockhart, his son-in-law. “There is but one book!” said the dying
          man. Réville concludes an Essay in the Revue des deux Mondes (1864):
          “One day the question was started, in an assembly, what book a man
          condemned to lifelong imprisonment, and to whom but one book would be
          permitted, had better take into his cell with him. The company
          consisted of Catholics, Protestants, philosophers and even
          materialists, but all agreed that their choice would fall only on the
          Bible.”
        </p>

        <p>2. Moral System of the New Testament.</p>
        <p>
          The perfection of this system is generally conceded. All will admit
          that it greatly surpasses any other system known among men. Among its
          distinguishing characteristics may be mentioned:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Its comprehensiveness,—including all human duties in its code,
          even the most generally misunderstood and neglected, while it permits
          no vice whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buddhism regards family life as sinful. Suicide was commended by many
          ancient philosophers. Among the Spartans to steal was
          praiseworthy,—only to be caught stealing was criminal. Classic times
          despised humility. Thomas Paine said that Christianity cultivated “the
          spirit of a spaniel,” and John Stuart Mill asserted that Christ
          ignored duty to the state. Yet Peter urges Christians to add to their
          faith manliness, courage, heroism (2Pe_1:5—“in your faith supply
          virtue”), and Paul declares the state to be God’s ordinance
          (Rom_13:1—“Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for
          there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of
          God”). Patriotic defence of a nation’s unity and freedom has always
          found its chief incitement and ground in these injunctions of
          Scripture. E. G. Robinson: “Christian ethics do not contain a particle
          of chaff,—all is pure wheat.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Its spirituality,—accepting no merely external conformity to right
          precepts, but judging all action by the thoughts and motives from
          which it springs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The superficiality of heathen morals is well illustrated by the
          treatment of the corpse of a priest in Siam: the body is covered with
          gold leaf, and then is left to rot and shine. Heathenism divorces
          religion from ethics. External and ceremonial observances take the
          place of purity of heart. The Sermon on the Mount on the other hand
          pronounces blessing only upon inward states of the soul.
          Psa_51:6—“Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts, and in the
          hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom”; Mic_6:8—“what doth
          Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and
          to walk humbly with thy God?”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Its simplicity,—inculcating principles rather than imposing rules;
          reducing these principles to an organic system; and connecting this
          system with religion by summing up all human duty in the one command
          of love to God and man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christianity presents no extensive code of rules, like that of the
          Pharisees or of the Jesuits. Such codes break down of their own
          weight. The laws of the State of New York alone constitute a library
          of themselves, which only the trained lawyer can master. It is said
          that Mohammedanism has recorded sixty-five thousand special instances
          in which the reader is directed to do right. It is the merit of Jesus’
          system that all its requisitions are reduced to unity.
          Mar_12:29-31—“Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one: and
          thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
          soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. The second is
          this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other
          commandment greater than these.” Wendt, Teaching of Jesus, 2:384–814,
          calls attention to the inner unity of Jesus’ teaching. The doctrine
          that God is a loving Father is applied with unswerving consistency.
          Jesus confirmed whatever was true in the O. T., and he set aside the
          unworthy. He taught not so much about God, as about the kingdom of
          God, and about the ideal fellowship between God and men. Morality was
          the necessary and natural expression of religion. In Christ teaching
          and life were perfectly blended. He was the representative of the
          religion which he taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Its practicality,—exemplifying its precepts in the life of Jesus
          Christ; and, while it declares man’s depravity and inability in his
          own strength to keep the law, furnishing motives to obedience, and the
          divine aid of the Holy Spirit to make this obedience possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revelation has two sides; Moral law, and provision for fulfilling the
          moral law that has been broken. Heathen systems can incite to
          temporary reformations, and they can terrify with fears of
          retribution. But only God’s regenerating grace can make the tree good,
          in such a way that its fruit will be good also (Mat_12:33). There is a
          difference between touching the pendulum of the clock and winding it
          up,—the former may set it temporarily swinging, but only the latter
          secures its regular and permanent motion. The moral system of the N.
          T. is not simply law,—it is also grace: Joh_1:17—“the law was given
          through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.” Dr. William
          Ashmore’s tract represents a Chinaman in a pit. Confucius looks into
          the pit and says: “If you had done as I told you, you would never have
          gotten in.” Buddha looks into the pit and says: “If you were up here I
          would show you what to do.” So both Confucius and Buddha pass on. But
          Jesus leaps down into the pit and helps the poor Chinaman out.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the Parliament of Religions in Chicago there were many ideals of
          life propounded, but no religion except Christianity attempted to show
          that there was any power given to realize these ideals. When Joseph
          Cook challenged the priests of the ancient religions to answer Lady
          Macbeth’s question: “How cleanse this red right hand?” the priests
          were dumb. But Christianity declares that “the blood of Jesus his Son
          cleanseth us from all sin” (1Jn_1:7). E. G. Robinson: Christianity
          differs from all other religions in being (1) a historical religion;
          (2) in turning abstract law into a person to be loved; (3) in
          furnishing a demonstration of God’s love in Christ; (4) in providing
          atonement for sin and forgiveness for the sinner; (5) in giving a
          power to fulfil the law and sanctify the life. Bowne, Philos. of
          Theism, 249—“Christianity, by making the moral law the expression of a
          holy Will, brought that law out of its impersonal abstraction, and
          assured its ultimate triumph. Moral principles may be what they were
          before, but moral practice is forever different. Even the earth itself
          has another look, now that it has heaven above it.” Frances Power
          Cobbe, Life, 92—“The achievement of Christianity was not the
          inculcation of a new, still less of a systematic, morality; but the
          introduction of a new spirit into morality; as Christ himself said, a
          leaven into the lump.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We may justly argue that a moral system so pure and perfect, since it
          surpasses all human powers of invention and runs counter to men’s
          natural tastes and passions, must have had a supernatural, and if a
          supernatural, then a divine, origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heathen systems of morality are in general defective, in that they
          furnish for man’s moral action no sufficient example, rule, motive, or
          end. They cannot do this, for the reason that they practically
          identify God with nature, and know of no clear revelation of his holy
          will. Man is left to the law of his own being, and since he is not
          conceived of as wholly responsible and free, the lower impulses are
          allowed sway as well as the higher, and selfishness is not regarded as
          sin. As heathendom does not recognize man’s depravity, so it does not
          recognize his dependence upon divine grace, and its virtue is
          self-righteousness. Heathenism is man’s vain effort to lift himself to
          God; Christianity is God’s coming down to man to save him; see
          Gunsaulus, Transfig. of Christ, 11, 12. Martineau, 1:15, 16, calls
          attention to the difference between the physiological ethics of
          heathendom and the psychological ethics of Christianity. Physiological
          ethics begins with nature; and, finding in nature the uniform rule of
          necessity and the operation of cause and effect, it comes at last to
          man and applies the same rule to him, thus extinguishing all faith in
          personality, freedom, responsibility, sin and guilt. Psychological
          ethics, on the contrary, wisely begins with what we know best, with
          man; and finding in him free-will and a moral purpose, it proceeds
          outward to nature and interprets nature as the manifestation of the
          mind and will of God.

        <p>
          “Psychological ethics are altogether peculiar to Christendom.…Other
          systems begin outside and regard the soul as a homogeneous part of the
          universe, applying to the soul the principle of necessity that
          prevails outside of it.…In the Christian religion, on the other hand,
          the interest, the mystery of the world are concentrated in human
          nature.…The sense of sin—a sentiment that left no trace in
          Athens—involves a consciousness of personal alienation from the
          Supreme Goodness; the aspiration after holiness directs itself to a
          union of affection and will with the source of all Perfection; the
          agency for transforming men from their old estrangement to new
          reconciliation is a Person, in whom the divine and human historically
          blend; and the sanctifying Spirit by which they are sustained at the
          height of their purer life is a living link of communion between their
          minds and the Soul of souls.…So Nature, to the Christian
          consciousness, sank into the accidental and the neutral.” Measuring
          ourselves by human standards, we nourish pride; measuring ourselves by
          divine standards, we nourish humility. Heathen nations, identifying
          God with nature or with man, are unprogressive. The flat architecture
          of the Parthenon, with its lines parallel to the earth, is the type of
          heathen religion; the aspiring arches of the Gothic cathedral
          symbolize Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sterrett, Studies in Hegel, 33, says that Hegel characterized the
          Chinese religion as that of Measure, or temperate conduct; Brahmanism
          as that of Phantasy, or inebriate dream-life; Buddhism as that of
          Self-involvement; that of Egypt as the imbruted religion of Enigma,
          symbolized by the Sphynx; that of Greece, as the religion of Beauty;
          the Jewish as that of Sublimity; and Christianity as the Absolute
          religion, the fully revealed religion of truth and freedom. In all
          this Hegel entirely fails to grasp the elements of Will, Holiness,
          Love, Life, which characterize Judaism and Christianity, and
          distinguish them from all other religions. R. H. Hutton: “Judaism
          taught us that Nature must be interpreted by our knowledge of God, not
          God by our knowledge of Nature.” Lyman Abbott: “Christianity is not a
          new life, but a new power; not a summons to a new life, but an offer
          of new life; not a reënactment of the old law, but a power of God unto
          salvation; not love to God and man, but Christ’s message that God
          loves us, and will help us to the life of love.”

          Beyschlag, N. T. Theology, 5, 6—“Christianity postulates an opening of
          the heart of the eternal God to the heart of man coming to meet him.
          Heathendom shows us the heart of man blunderingly grasping the hem of
          God’s garment, and mistaking Nature, his majestic raiment, for
          himself. Only in the Bible does man press beyond God’s external
          manifestations to God himself.” See Wuttke, Christian Ethics, 1:37–73;

          In contrast with the Christian system of morality the defects of
          heathen systems are so marked and fundamental, that they constitute a
          strong corroborative evidence of the divine origin of the Scripture
          revelation. We therefore append certain facts and references with
          regard to particular heathen systems.

          1. Confucianism. Confucius (Kung-fu-tse), b.c. 551–478, contemporary
          with Pythagoras and Buddha. Socrates was born ten years after
          Confucius died. Mencius (371–278) was a disciple of Confucius.
          Matheson, in Faiths of the World (St. Giles Lectures), 73–108, claims
          that Confucianism was “an attempt to substitute a morality for
          theology,” Legge, however, in Present Day Tracts, 3: no. 18, shows
          that this is a mistake. Confucius simply left religion where he found
          it. God, or Heaven, is worshiped in China, but only by the Emperor.
          Chinese religion is apparently a survival of the worship of the
          patriarchal family. The father of the family was its only head and
          priest. In China, though the family widened into the tribe, and the
          tribe into the nation, the father still retained his sole authority,
          and, as the father of his people, the Emperor alone officially offered
          sacrifice to God. Between God and the people the gulf has so widened
          that the people may be said to have no practical knowledge of God or
          communication with him. Dr, W. A. P. Martin: “Confucianism has
          degenerated into a pantheistic medley, and renders worship to an
          impersonal ‘anima mundi,’ under the leading forms of visible nature.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. William Ashmore, private letter: “The common people of China have:
          (1) Ancestor-worship, and the worship of deified heroes: (2) Geomancy,
          or belief in the controlling power of the elements of nature; but back
          of these, and antedating them, is (3) the worship of Heaven and Earth,
          or Father and Mother, a very ancient dualism; this belongs to the
          common people also, though once a year the Emperor, as a sort of
          high-priest of his people, offers sacrifice on the altar of Heaven; in
          this he acts alone. ‘Joss’ is not a Chinese word at all. It is the
          corrupted form of the Portuguese word ‘Deos.’ The word ‘pidgin’ is
          similarly an attempt to say ‘business’ (big-i-ness or bidgin).
          ‘Joss-pidgin’ therefore means simply ‘divine service,’ or service
          offered to Heaven and Earth, or to spirits of any kind, good or bad.
          There are many gods, a Queen of Heaven, King of Hades, God of War, god
          of literature, gods of the hills, valleys, streams, a goddess of
          small-pox, of child-bearing, and all the various trades have their
          gods. The most lofty expression the Chinese have is ‘Heaven,’ or
          ‘Supreme Heaven,’ or ‘Azure Heaven.’ This is the surviving indication
          that in the most remote times they had knowledge of one supreme,
          intelligent and personal Power who ruled overall.” Mr. Yugoro Chiba
          has shown that the Chinese classics permit sacrifice by all the
          people. But it still remains true that sacrifice to “Supreme Heaven”
          is practically confined to the Emperor, who like the Jewish
          high-priest offers for his people once a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confucius did nothing to put morality upon a religious basis. In
          practice, the relations between man and man are the only relations
          considered. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, sincerity,
          are enjoined, but not a word is said with regard to man’s relations to
          God. Love to God is not only not commanded—it is not thought of as
          possible. Though man’s being is theoretically an ordinance of God, man
          is practically a law to himself. The first commandment of Confucius is
          that of filial pity. But this includes worship of dead ancestors, and
          is so exaggerated as to bury from sight the related duties of husband
          to wife and of parent to child. Confucius made it the duty of a son to
          slay his father’s murderer, just as Moses insisted on a strictly
          retaliatory penalty for bloodshed; see J. A. Farrer, Primitive Manners
          and Customs, 80. He treated invisible and superior beings with
          respect, but held them at a distance. He recognized the “Heaven” of
          tradition; but, instead of adding to our knowledge of it, he stifled
          inquiry. Dr. Legge: “I have been reading Chinese books for more than
          forty years, and any general requirement to love God, or the mention
          of any one as actually loving him, has yet to come for the first time
          under my eye.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ezra Abbot asserts that Confucius gave the golden rule in positive as
          well as negative form; see Harris, Philos. Basis of Theism, 222. This
          however seems to be denied by Dr. Legge, Religions of China, 1–58. Wu
          Ting Fang, former Chinese minister to Washington, assents to the
          statement that Confucius gave the golden rule only in its negative
          form, and he says this difference is the difference between a passive
          and an aggressive civilization, which last is therefore dominant. The
          golden rule, as Confucius gives it, is: “Do not unto others that which
          you would not they should do unto you.” Compare with this, Isocrates:
          “Be to your parents what you would have your children be to you.…Do
          not to others the things which make you angry when others do them to
          you”; Herodotus: “What I punish in another man, I will myself, as far
          as I can, refrain from”; Aristotle: “We should behave toward our
          friends as we should wish them to behave toward us”; Tobit, 4:15—“What
          thou hatest, do to no one”; Philo: “What one hates to endure, let him
          not do”; Seneca bids us “give as we wish to receive”; Rabbi Hillel:
          “Whatsoever is hateful to you, do not to another; this is the whole
          law, and all the rest is explanation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadus, in Am. Com. on Matthew, 161—“The sayings of Confucius,
          Isocrates, and the three Jewish teachers, are merely negative; that of
          Seneca is confined to giving, and that of Aristotle to the treatment
          of friends. Christ lays down a rule for positive action, and that
          toward all men.” He teaches that I am bound to do to others all that
          they could rightly desire me to do to them. The golden rule therefore
          requires a supplement, to show what others can rightly desire, namely,
          God’s glory first, and their good as second and incidental thereto.
          Christianity furnishes this divine and perfect standard; Confucianism
          is defective in that it has no standard higher than human convention.
          While Confucianism excludes polytheism, idolatry, and deification of
          vice, it is a shallow and tantalizing system, because it does not
          recognize the hereditary corruption of human nature, or furnish any
          remedy for moral evil except the “doctrines of the sages.” “The heart
          of man,” it says, “is naturally perfectly upright and correct.” Sin is
          simply “a disease, to be cured by self-discipline; a debt, to be
          canceled by meritorious acts; an ignorance, to be removed by study and
          contemplation.” See Bib. Sac., 1883:292, 293; N. Englander, 1883; 565;
          Marcus Dods, in Erasmus and other Essays, 239.

          2. The Indian Systems. Brahmanism, as expressed in the Vedas, dates
          back to 1000–1500 b.c. As Caird (in Faiths of the World, St. Giles
          Lectures, lecture i) has shown, it originated in the contemplation of
          the power in nature apart from the moral Personality that works in and
          through nature. Indeed we may say that all heathenism is man’s choice
          of a non-moral in place of a moral God. Brahamanism is a system of
          pantheism, “a false or illegitimate consecration of the finite.” All
          things are a manifestation of Brahma. Hence evil is deified as well as
          good. And many thousand gods are worshiped as partial representations
          of the living principle which moves through all. “How many gods have
          the Hindus?” asked Dr. Duff of his class. Henry Drummond thought there
          were about twenty-five. “Twenty-five?” responded the indignant
          professor; “twenty-five millions of millions!” While the early Vedas
          present a comparatively pure nature-worship, later Brahmanism becomes
          a worship of the vicious and the vile, of the unnatural and the cruel.
          Juggernaut and the suttee did not belong to original Hindu religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bruce, Apologetics, 15—“Pantheism in theory always means polytheism in
          practice.” The early Vedas are hopeful in spirit; later Brahmanism is
          a religion of disappointment. Caste is fixed and consecrated as a
          manifestation of God. Originally intended to express, in its four
          divisions of priest, soldier, agriculturist, slave, the different
          degrees of unworldliness and divine indwelling, it becomes an iron
          fetter to prevent all aspiration and progress. Indian religion sought
          to exalt receptivity, the unity of existence, and rest from
          self-determination and its struggles. Hence it ascribed to its gods
          the same character as nature-forces. God was the common source of good
          and of evil. Its ethics is an ethics of moral indifference. Its
          charity is a charity for sin, and the temperance it desires is a
          temperance that will let the intemperate alone. Mozoomdar, for
          example, is ready to welcome everything in Christianity but its
          reproof of sin and its demand for righteousness. Brahmanism degrades
          woman, but it deifies the cow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buddhism, beginning with Buddha, 600 b.c., “recalls the mind to its
          elevation above the finite,” from which Brahmanism had fallen away.
          Buddha was in certain respects a reformer. He protested against caste,
          and proclaimed that truth and morality are for all. Hence Buddhism,
          through its possession of this one grain of truth, appealed to the
          human heart, and became, next to Christianity, the greatest missionary
          religion. Notice then, first, its universalism. But notice also that
          this is a false universalism. for it ignores individualism and leads
          to universal stagnation and slavery. While Christianity is a religion
          of history, of will, of optimism. Buddhism is a religion of illusion,
          of quietism, of pessimism; see Nash, Ethics and Revelation, 107–109.
          In characterizing Buddhism as a missionary religion, we must notice,
          secondly, its element of altruism. But this altruism is one which
          destroys the self, instead of preserving it. The future Buddha, out of
          compassion for a famished tiger, permits the tiger to devour him.
          “Incarnated as a hare, he jumps into the fire to cook himself for a
          meal for a beggar, —having previously shaken himself three times, so
          that none of the insects in his fur should perish with him”; see
          William James, Varieties of Religious Experience, 283. Buddha would
          deliver man, not by philosophy, nor by asceticism, but by
          self-renunciation. All isolation and personality are sin, the guilt of
          which rests, however, not on man, but on existence in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Brahmanism is pantheistic, Buddhism is atheistic in its spirit.
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:285—“The Brahmanic Akosmism, that had
          explained the world as mere seeming, led to the Buddhistic Atheism.”
          Finiteness and separateness are evil, and the only way to purity and
          rest is by ceasing to exist. This is essential pessimism. The highest
          morality is to endure that which must be, and to escape from reality
          and from personal existence as soon as possible. Hence the doctrine of
          Nirvana. Rhys Davids, in his Hibbert Lectures, claims that early
          Buddhism meant by Nirvana, not annihilation, but the extinction of the
          self-life, and that this was attainable during man’s present mortal
          existence. But the term Nirvana now means, to the great mass of those
          who use it, the loss of all personality and consciousness, and
          absorption into the general life of the universe. Originally the term
          denoted only freedom from individual desire, and those who had entered
          into Nirvana might again come out of it; see Ireland, Blot on the
          Brain, 238. But even in its original form, Nirvana was sought only
          from a selfish motive. Self-renunciation and absorption in the whole
          was not the enthusiasm of benevolence,—it was the refuge of despair.
          It is a religion without god or sacrifice. Instead of communion with a
          personal God, Buddhism has in prospect only an extinction of
          personality, as reward for untold ages of lonely self-conquest,
          extending through many transmigrations. Of Buddha it has been truly
          said “That all the all he had for needy man Was nothing, and his best
          of being was But not to be,” Wilkinson, Epic of Paul, 296—“He by his
          own act dying all the time, In ceaseless effort utterly to cease, Will
          willing not to will, desire desiring To be desire no more, until at
          last The fugitive go free, emancipate But by becoming naught.” Of
          Christ Bruce well says: “What a contrast this Healer of disease and
          Preacher of pardon to the worst, to Buddha, with his religion of
          despair!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Buddhism is also fatalistic. It inculcates submission and
          compassion—merely negative virtues. But it knows nothing of manly
          freedom, or of active love—the positive virtues of Christianity. It
          leads men to spare others, but not to help them. Its morality revolves
          around self, not around God. It has in it no organizing principle, for
          it recognizes no God, no inspiration, no soul, no salvation, no
          personal immortality. Buddhism would save men only by inducing them to
          flee from existence. To the Hindu, family life involves sin. The
          perfect man must forsake wife and children. All gratification of
          natural appetites and passions is evil. Salvation is not from sin, but
          from desire, and from this men can be saved only by escaping from life
          itself. Christianity buries sin, but saves the man; Buddha would save
          the man by killing him. Christianity symbolizes the convert’s entrance
          upon a new life by raising him from the baptismal waters; the baptism
          of Buddhism should be immersion without emersion. The fundamental idea
          of Brahmanism, extinction of personality, remains the same in
          Buddhism; the only difference being that the result is secured by
          active atonement in the former, by passive contemplation in the
          latter. Virtue, and the knowledge that everything earthly is a
          vanishing spark of the original light, delivers man from existence and
          from misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. G. H. Palmer, of Harvard, in The Outlook, June 19,
          1897—“Buddhism is unlike Christianity in that it abolishes misery by
          abolishing desire; denies personality instead of asserting it; has
          many gods, but no one God who is living and conscious; makes a
          shortening of existence rather than a lengthening of it to be the
          reward of righteousness. Buddhism makes no provision for family,
          church, state, science, or art. It give us a religion that is little,
          when we want one that is large.” Dr. E. Benjamin Andrews:
          “Schopenhauer and Spencer are merely teachers of Buddhism. They regard
          the central source of all as unknowable force, instead of regarding it
          as a Spirit, living and holy. This takes away all impulse to
          scientific investigation. We need to start from a Person, and not from
          a thing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          For comparison of the sage of India, Sakya Muni, more commonly called
          Buddha (properly “the Buddha” = the enlightened; but who, in spite of
          Edwin Arnold’s “Light of Asia,” is represented as not pure from carnal
          pleasures before he began his work), with Jesus Christ, see Bib. Sac,
          July, 1882:458–498; W. C. Wilkinson, Edwin Arnold, Poetizer and
          Paganizer; Kellogg, The Light of Asia and the Light of the World.
          Buddhism and Christianity are compared in Presb. Rev., July,
          1883:505–548; Wuttke, Christian Ethics, 1:47–54; Mitchell, in Present
          Day Tracts, 6:33. See also Oldenberg, Buddha; Lillie, Popular Life of
          Buddha; Beal, Catena of Buddhist Scriptures. 153—“Buddhism declares
          itself ignorant of any mode of personal existence compatible with the
          idea of spiritual perfection, and so far it is ignorant of God”;
          157—“The earliest idea of Nirvana seems to have included in it no more
          than the enjoyment of a state of rest consequent on the extinction of
          all causes of sorrow.” The impossibility of satisfying the human heart
          with a system of atheism is shown by the fact that the Buddha himself
          has been apotheosized to furnish an object of worship. Thus Buddhism
          has reverted to Brahmanism.

          Monier Williams: “Mohammed has as much claim to be ‘the Light of Asia’
          as Buddha has. What light from Buddha? Not about the heart’s
          depravity, or the origin of sin, or the goodness, justice, holiness,
          fatherhood of God, or the remedy for sin, but only the ridding self
          from suffering by ridding self from life—a doctrine of merit, of
          self-trust, of pessimism, and annihilation of personality.” Christ,
          himself personal, loving and holy, shows that God is a person of
          holiness and love. Robert Browning: “He that created love, shall not
          he love?” Only because Jesus is God, have we a gospel for the world.
          The claim that Buddha is “the Light of Asia” reminds one of the man
          who declared the moon to be of greater value than the sun, because it
          gives light in the darkness when it is needed, while the sun gives
          light in the daytime when it is not needed.

          3. The Greek Systems. Pythagoras (584–504) based morality upon the
          principle of numbers. “Moral good was identified with unity; evil with
          multiplicity; virtue was harmony of the soul and its likeness to God,
          The aim of life was to make it represent the beautiful order of the
          Universe. The whole practical tendency of Pythagoreanism was ascetic,
          and included a strict self-control and an earnest culture.” Here
          already we seem to see the defect of Greek morality in confounding the
          good with the beautiful, and in making morality a mere
          self-development. Matheson, Messages of the Old Religions: Greece
          reveals the intensity of the hour, the value of the present life, the
          beauty of the world that now is. Its religion is the religion of
          beautiful humanity. It anticipates the new heaven and the new earth.
          Rome on the other hand stood for union, incorporation, a universal
          kingdom. But its religion deified only the Emperor, not all humanity.
          It was the religion, not of love, but of power, and it identified the
          church with the state.

          Socrates (469–400) made knowledge to be virtue. Morality consisted in
          subordinating irrational desires to rational knowledge. Although here
          we rise above a subjectively determined good as the goal of moral
          effort, we have no proper sense of sin. Knowledge, and not love, is
          the motive. If men know the right, they will do the right. This is a
          great overvaluing of knowledge. With Socrates, teaching is a sort of
          midwifery-not depositing information in the mind, but drawing out the
          contents of our own inner consciousness. Lewis Morris describes it as
          the life-work of Socrates to “doubt our doubts away.” Socrates holds
          it right to injure one’s enemies. He shows proud self-praise in his
          dying address. He warns against pederasty, yet compromises with it. He
          does not insist upon the same purity of family life which Homer
          describes in Ulysses and Penelope. Charles Kingsley, in Alton Locke,
          remarks that the spirit of the Greek tragedy was ‘man mastered by
          circumstance’; that of modern tragedy is ‘man mastering circumstance.’
          But the Greek tragedians, while showing man thus mastered, do still
          represent him as inwardly free, as in the case of Prometheus, and this
          sense of human freedom and responsibility appears to some extent in
          Socrates.

        <p>
          Plato (430–348) held that morality is pleasure in the good, as the
          truly beautiful, and that knowledge produces virtue. The good is
          likeness to God,—here we have glimpses of an extra-human goal and
          model. The body, like all matter, being inherently evil, is a
          hindrance to the soul,—here we have a glimpse of hereditary depravity.
          But Plato “reduced moral evil to the category of natural evil.” He
          failed to recognize God as creator and master of matter; failed to
          recognize man’s depravity as due to his own apostasy from God; failed
          to found morality on the divine will rather than on man’s own
          consciousness. He knew nothing of a common humanity, and regarded
          virtue as only for the few. As there was no common sin, so there was
          no common redemption. Plato thought to reach God by intellect alone,
          when only conscience and heart could lead to him. He believed in a
          freedom of the soul in a preëxistent state where a choice was made
          between good and evil, but he believed that, after that antemundane
          decision had been made, the fates determined men’s acts and lives
          irreversibly. Reason drives two horses, appetite and emotion, but
          their course has been predetermined. Man acts as reason prompts. All
          sin is ignorance. There is nothing in this life but determinism.
          Martineau, Types, 13, 18, 49, 78, 88—Plato in general has no proper
          notion of responsibility; he reduces moral evil to the catagory of
          natural evil. His Ideas with one exception are not causes. Cause is
          mind, and mind is the Good. The Good is the apex and crown of Ideas.
          The Good is the highest Idea, and this highest Idea is a Cause. Plato
          has a feeble conception of personality, whether in God or in man. Yet
          God is a person in whatever sense man is a person, and man’s
          personality is reflective self-consciousness. Will in God or man is
          not so clear. The Right is dissolved into the Good. Plato advocated
          infanticide and the killing off of the old and the helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aristotle (384–322) leaves out of view even the element of
          God-likeness and antemundane evil which Plato so dimly recognized, and
          makes morality the fruit of mere rational self-consciousness. He
          grants evil proclivities, but he refuses to call them immoral. He
          advocates a certain freedom of will, and he recognizes inborn
          tendencies which war against this freedom, but how these tendencies
          originated he cannot say, nor how men may be delivered from them. Not
          all can be moral; the majority must be restrained by fear. He finds in
          God no motive, and love to God is not so much as mentioned as the
          source of moral action. A proud, composed, self-centered, and
          self-contained man is his ideal character. See Nicomachean Ethics,
          7:6, and 10:10; Wuttke, Christian Ethics, 1:92–126. Alexander,
          Theories of Will, 39–54—Aristotle held that desire and reason are the
          springs of action. Yet he did not hold that knowledge of itself would
          make men virtuous. He was a determinist. Actions are free only in the
          sense of being devoid of external compulsion. He viewed slavery as
          both rational and right. Butcher, Aspects of Greek Genius, 76—“While
          Aristotle attributed to the State a more complete personality than it
          really possessed, he did not grasp the depth and meaning of the
          personality of the individual.” A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation,
          289—Aristotle had no conception of the unity of humanity. His doctrine
          of unity did not extend beyond the State. “He said that ‘the whole is
          before the parts,’ but he meant by ‘the whole’ only the pan-Hellenic
          world, the commonwealth of Greeks; he never thought of humanity, and
          the word ‘mankind’ never fell from his lips. He could not understand
          the unity of humanity, because he knew nothing of Christ, its
          organizing principle.” On Aristotle’s conception of God, see James Ten
          Broeke, in Bap. Quar. Rev., Jan. 1892—God is recognized as personal,
          yet he is only the Greek Reason, and not the living, loving,
          providential Father of the Hebrew revelation. Aristotle substitutes
          the logical for the dynamical in his dealing with the divine
          causality. God is thought, not power.

          Epicurus (342–270) regarded happiness, the subjective feeling of
          pleasure, as the highest criterion of truth and good. A prudent
          calculating for prolonged pleasure is the highest wisdom. He regards
          only this life. Concern for retribution and for a future existence is
          folly. If there are gods, they have no concern for men. “Epicurus, on
          pretense of consulting for their ease, complimented the gods, and
          bowed them out of existence.” Death is the falling apart of material
          atoms and the eternal cessation of consciousness. The miseries of this
          life are due to imperfection in the fortuitously constructed universe.
          The more numerous these undeserved miseries, the greater our right to
          seek pleasure. Alexander, Theories of the Will, 55–75—The Epicureans
          held that the soul is composed of atoms, yet that the will is free.
          The atoms of the soul are excepted from the law of cause and effect.
          An atom may decline or deviate in the universal descent, and this is
          the Epicurean idea of freedom. This indeterminism was held by all the
          Greek sceptics, materialists though they were.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zeno, the founder of the Stoic philosophy (340–264), regarded virtue
          as the only good. Thought is to subdue nature. The free spirit is
          self-legislating, self-dependent, self-sufficient. Thinking, not
          feeling, is the criterion of the true and the good. Pleasure is the
          consequence, not the end of moral action. There is an irreconcilable
          antagonism of existence. Man cannot reform the world, but he can make
          himself perfect. Hence an unbounded pride in virtue. The sage never
          repents. There is not the least recognition of the moral corruption of
          mankind. There is no objective divine ideal, or revealed divine will.
          The Stoic discovers moral law only within, and never suspects his own
          moral perversion. Hence he shows self-control and justice, but never
          humility or love. He needs no compassion or forgiveness, and he grants
          none to others. Virtue is not an actively outworking character, but a
          passive resistance to irrational reality. Man may retreat into
          himself. The Stoic is indifferent to pleasure and pain, not because he
          believes in a divine government, or in a divine love for mankind, but
          as a proud defiance of the irrational world. He has no need of God or
          of redemption. As the Epicurean gives himself to enjoyment of the
          world, the Stoic gives himself to contempt of the world. In all
          afflictions, each can say, “The door is open.” To the Epicurean, the
          refuge is intoxication; to the Stoic, the refuge is suicide: “If the
          house smokes, quit it.” Wuttke, Christian Ethics, 1:62–161, from whom
          much of this account of the Greeks systems is condensed, describes
          Epicureanism and Stoicism as alike making morality subjective,
          although Epicureanism regarded spirit as determined by nature, while
          Stoicism regarded nature as determined by spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Stoics were materialists and pantheists. Though they speak of a
          personal God, this is a figure of speech. False opinion is at the root
          of all vice. Chrysippus denied what we now call the liberty of
          indifference, saying that there could not be an effect without a
          cause. Man is enslaved to passion. The Stoics could not explain how a
          vicious man could become virtuous. The result is apathy. Men act only
          according to character, and this a doctrine of fate. The Stoic
          indifference or apathy in misfortune is not a bearing of it at all,
          but rather a cowardly retreat from it. It is in the actual suffering
          of evil that Christianity finds “the soul of good.” The office of
          misfortune is disciplinary and purifying; see Seth, Ethical
          Principles, 417. “The shadow of the sage’s self, projected on vacancy,
          was called God, and, as the sage had long since abandoned interest in
          practical life, he expected his Divinity to do the same.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Stoic reverenced God just because of his unapproachable majesty.
          Christianity sees in God a Father, a Redeemer, a carer for our minute
          wants, a deliverer from our sin. It teaches us to see in Christ the
          humanity of the divine, affinity with God, God’s supreme interest in
          his handiwork. For the least of his creatures Christ died. Kinship
          with God gives dignity to man. The individuality that Stoicism lost in
          the whole, Christianity makes the end of the creation. The State
          exists to develop and promote it. Paul took up and infused new meaning
          into certain phrases of the Stoic philosophy about the freedom and
          royalty of the wise man, just as John adopted and glorified certain
          phrases of Alexandrian philosophy about the Word. Stoicism was lonely
          and pessimistic. The Stoics said that the best thing was not to be
          born; the next best thing was to die. Because Stoicism had no God of
          helpfulness and sympathy, its virtue was mere conformity to nature,
          majestic egoism and self-complacency. In the Roman Epictetus (89),
          Seneca († 65), and Marcus Aurelius (121–180), the religious element
          comes more into the foreground, and virtue appears once more as
          God-likeness; but it is possible that this later Stoicism was
          influenced by Christianity. On Marcus Aurelius, see New Englander,
          July, 1881:415–431; Capes, Stoicism.

          4. Systems of Western Asia. Zoroaster (1000 b.c.?), the founder of the
          Parsees, was a dualist, at least so far as to explain the existence of
          evil and of good by the original presence in the author of all things
          of two opposing principles. Here is evidently a limit put upon the
          sovereignty and holiness of God. Man is not perfectly dependent upon
          him, nor is God’s will an unconditional law for his creatures. As
          opposed to the Indian systems, Zoroaster’s insistence upon the divine
          personality furnished a far better basis for a vigorous and manly
          morality. Virtue was to be won by hard struggle of free beings against
          evil. But then, on the other hand, this evil was conceived as
          originally due, not to finite beings themselves, but either to an evil
          deity who warred against the good, or to an evil principle in the one
          deity himself. The burden of guilt is therefore shifted from man to
          his maker. Morality becomes subjective and unsettled. Not love to God
          or imitation of God, but rather self-love and self-development,
          furnish the motive and aim of morality. No fatherhood or love is
          recognized in the deity, and other things besides God (e. g., fire)
          are worshiped. There can be no depth to the consciousness of sin, and
          no hope of divine deliverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the one merit of Parseeism that it recognizes the moral conflict
          of the world; its error is that it carries this moral conflict into
          the very nature of God. We can apply to Parseeism the words of the
          Conference of Foreign Mission Boards to the Buddhists of Japan: “All
          religions are expressions of man’s sense of dependence, but only one
          provides fellowship with God. All religions speak of a higher truth,
          but only one speaks of that truth as found in a loving personal God,
          our Father. AH religions show man’s helplessness, but only one tells
          of a divine Savior, who offers to man forgiveness of sin, and
          salvation through his death, and who is now a living person, working
          in and with all who believe in him, to make them holy and righteous
          and pure.” Matheson, Messages of Old Religions, says that Parseeism
          recognizes an obstructive element in the nature of God himself. Moral
          evil is reality; but there is no reconciliation, nor is it shown that
          all things work together for good. See Wuttke, Christian Ethics,
          1:47–64; Faiths of the World (St. Giles Lectures), 109–144; Mitchell,
          in Present Day Tracts, 3: no. 25; Whitney on the A vesta, in Oriental
          and Linguistic Studies.

          Mohammed (570–632 a.d.), the founder of Islam, gives us in the Koran a
          system containing four dogmas of fundamental immorality, namely,
          polygamy, slavery, persecution, and suppression of private judgement.
          Mohammedanism is heathenism in monotheistic form. Its good points are
          its conscientiousness and its relation to God. It has prospered
          because it has preached the unity of God, and because it is a
          book-religion. But both these it got from Judaism and Christianity. It
          has appropriated the Old Testament saints and even Jesus. But it
          denies the death of Christ and sees no need of atonement. The power of
          sin is not recognized. The idea of sin, in Moslems, is emptied of all
          positive content. Sin is simply a falling short, accounted for by the
          weakness and shortsightedness of man, inevitable in the fatalistic
          universe, or not remembered in wrath by the indulgent and merciful
          Father. Forgiveness is indulgence, and the conception of God is
          emptied of the quality of justice. Evil belongs only to the
          individual, not to the race. Man attains the favor of God by good
          works, based on prophetic teaching. Morality is not a fruit of
          salvation, but a means. There is no penitence or humility, but only
          self-righteousness; and this self-righteousness is consistent with
          great sensuality, unlimited divorce, and with absolute despotism in
          family, civil and religious affairs. There is no knowledge of the
          fatherhood of God or of the brotherhood of man. In all the Koran,
          there is no such declaration as that “God so loved the world”
          (Joh_3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          The submission of Islam is submission to an arbitrary will, not to a
          God of love. There is no basing of morality in love. The highest good
          is the sensuous happiness of the individual, God and man are external
          to one another. Mohammed is a teacher but not a priest. Mozley,
          Miracles, 140, 141—“Mohammed had no faith in human nature. There were
          two things which he thought men could do, and would do, for the glory
          of God—transact religious forms, and fight, and upon these two points
          he was severe; but within the sphere of common practical life, where
          man’s great trial lies, his code exhibits the disdainful laxity of a
          legislator who accomodates his rule to the recipient, and shows his
          estimate of the recipient by the accommodation which he adopts.…‘Human
          nature is weak,’ said he.” Lord Houghton: The Koran is all wisdom, all
          law, all religion, for all time. Dead men bow before a dead God.
          “Though the world rolls on from change to change, And realms of
          thought expand. The letter stands without expanse or range, Stiff as a
          dead man’s hand.” Wherever Mohammedanism has gone, it has either found
          a desert or made one. Fairbairn, in Contemp. Rev., Dec. 1882:866—“The
          Koran has frozen Mohammedan thought; to obey is to abandon progress.”
          Muir, in Present Day Tracts, 3: no. 14—“Mohammedanism reduces men to a
          dead level of social depression, despotism, and semi-barbarism. Islam
          is the work of man; Christianity of God.” See also Faiths of the World
          (St. Giles Lectures, Second Series), 361–396; J. F. Clarke, Ten Great

          indissolubly united, and the conception of Christ’s character, with

          The stylobate of the Parthenon at Athens rises about three inches in
          the middle of the 101 feet of the front, and four inches in the middle
          of the 228 feet of the flanks. A nearly parallel line is found in the
          entablature. The axes of the columns lean inward nearly three inches
          in their height of 34 feet, thus giving a sort of pyramidal character
          to the structure. Thus the architect overcame the apparent sagging of
          horizontal lines, and at the same time increased the apparent height
          of the edifice; see Murray, Handbook of Greece, 5th ed., 1884, 1:308,
          309; Ferguson, Handbook of Architecture, 268–270. The neglect to
          counteract this optical illusion has rendered the Madeleine in Paris a
          stiff and ineffective copy of the Parthenon. The Galilean peasant who
          should minutely describe these peculiarities of the Parthenon would
          prove, not only that the edifice was a historical reality, but that he
          had actually seen it. Bruce, Apologetics, 343—“In reading the memoirs
          of the evangelists, you feel as one sometimes feels in a
          picture-gallery. Your eye alights on the portrait of a person whom you
          do not know. You look at it intently for a few moments and then remark
          to a companion: ‘That must be like the original,—it is so life-like.’

          (a) No source can be assigned from which the evangelists could have
          derived such a conception. The Hindu avatars were only temporary
          unions of deity with humanity. The Greeks had men half-deified, but no
          unions of God and man. The monotheism of the Jews found the person of
          Christ a perpetual stumbling-block. The Essenes were in principle more
          opposed to Christianity than the Rabbinists.

          Herbert Spencer, Data of Ethics, 279—“The coëxistence of a perfect man
          and an imperfect society is impossible; and could the two coëxist, the
          resulting conduct would not furnish the ethical standard sought.” We
          must conclude that the perfect manhood of Christ is a miracle, and the
          greatest of miracles. Bruce, Apologetics, 346, 351—“When Jesus asks:
          ‘Why callest thou me good?’ he means: ‘Learn first what goodness is,
          and call no man good till you are sure that he deserves it.’ Jesus’
          goodness was entirely free from religious scrupulosity; it was
          distinguished by humanity; it was full of modesty and
          lowliness.…Buddhism has flourished 2000 years, though little is known
          of its founder. Christianity might have been so perpetuated, but it is
          not so. I want to be sure that the ideal has been embodied in an
          actual life. Otherwise it is only poetry, and the obligation to
          conform to it ceases.” For comparison of Christ’s incarnation with
          Hindu, Greek, Jewish, and Essene ideas, see Dorner, Hist. Doct. Person
          of Christ, Introduction. On the Essenes, see Herzog, Encyclop., art.:

          (b) No mere human genius, and much less the genius of Jewish
          fishermen, could have originated this conception. Bad men invent only
          such characters as they sympathize with. But Christ’s character
          condemns badness. Such a portrait could not have been drawn without
          supernatural aid. But such aid would not have been given to
          fabrication. The conception can be explained only by granting that
          Christ’s person and character were historical realities.

          Between Pilate and Titus 30,000 Jews are said to have been crucified
          around the walls of Jerusalem. Many of these were young men. What
          makes one of them stand out on the pages of history? There are two
          answers: The character of Jesus was a perfect character, and, He was
          God as well as man. Gore, Incarnation, 63—“The Christ of the gospels,
          if he be not true to history, represents a combined effort of the
          creative imagination without parallel in literature. But the literary
          characteristics of Palestine in the first century make the hypothesis
          of such an effort morally impossible.” The Apocryphal gospels show us
          what mere imagination was capable of producing. That the portrait of
          Christ is not puerile, inane, hysterical, selfishly assertive, and
          self-contradictory, can be due only to the fact that it is the
          photograph from real life.

          For a remarkable exhibition of the argument from the character of
          Jesus, see Bushnell, Nature and the Supernatural, 276–332. Bushnell
          mentions the originality and vastness of Christ’s plan, yet its
          simplicity and practical adaptation; his moral traits of independence,
          compassion, meekness, wisdom, zeal, humility, patience; the
          combination in him of seemingly opposite qualities. With all his
          greatness, he was condescending and simple; he was unworldly, yet not
          austere; he had strong feelings, yet was self-possessed; he had
          indignation toward sin, yet compassion toward the sinner; he showed
          devotion to his work, yet calmness under opposition; universal
          philanthropy, yet susceptibility to private attachments; the authority
          of a Savior and Judge, yet the gratitude and the tenderness of a son;
          the most elevated devotion, yet a life of activity and exertion. See
          chapter on The Moral Miracle, in Bruce, Miraculous Element of the
          Gospels, 43–78.

          B. The acceptance and belief in the New Testament descriptions of
          Jesus Christ cannot be accounted for except upon the ground that the
          person and character described had an actual existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) If these descriptions were false, there were witnesses still
          living who had known Christ and who would have contradicted them. (b)
          There was no motive to induce acceptance of such false accounts, but
          every motive to the contrary. (c) The success of such falsehoods could
          be explained only by supernatural aid, but God would never have thus
          aided falsehood. This person and character, therefore, must have been
          not fictitious but real; and if real, then Christ’s words are true,
          and the system of which his person and character are a part is a
          revelation from God.

          “The counterfeit may for a season Deceive the wide earth; But the lie
          waxing great comes to labor, And truth has its birth.” Matthew Arnold,
          The Better Part: “Was Christ a man like us? Ah, let us see, If we then
          too can be Such men as he!” When the blatant sceptic declared: “I do
          not believe that such a man as Jesus Christ ever lived,” George Warren
          merely replied: “I wish I were like him!” Dwight L. Moody was called a
          hypocrite, but the stalwart evangelist answered: “Well, suppose I am.
          How does that make your case any better? I know some pretty mean
          things about myself; but you cannot say anything against my Master.”
          Goethe: “Let the culture of the spirit advance forever; let the human
          spirit broaden itself as it will; yet it will never go beyond the
          height and moral culture of Christianity, as it glitters and shines in
          the gospels.”

          Renan, Life of Jesus: “Jesus founded the absolute religion, excluding
          nothing, determining nothing, save its essence.…The foundation of the
          true religion is indeed his work. After him, there is nothing left but
          to develop and fructify.” And a Christian scholar has remarked: “It is
          an astonishing proof of the divine guidance vouchsafed to the
          evangelists that no man, of their time or since, has been able to
          touch the picture of Christ without debasing it.” We may find an
          illustration of this in the words of Chadwick, Old and New
          Unitarianism, 207—“Jesus’ doctrine of marriage was ascetic, his
          doctrine of property was communistic, his doctrine of charity was
          sentimental, his doctrine of non-resistance was such as commends
          itself to Tolstoi, but not to many others of our time. With the
          example of Jesus, it is the same as with his teachings. Followed
          unreservedly, would it not justify those who say: ‘The hope of the
          race is in its extinction’; and bring all our joys and sorrows to a
          sudden end?” To this we may answer in the words of Huxley, who
          declares that Jesus Christ is “the noblest ideal of humanity which
          mankind has yet worshiped.” Gordon, Christ of To-Day, 179—“The
          question is not whether Christ is good enough to represent the Supreme
          Being, but whether the Supreme Being is good enough to have Christ for
          his representative. John Stuart Mill looks upon the Christian religion
          as the worship of Christ, rather than the worship of God, and in this
          way he explains the beneficence of its influence.”
        </p>
        <p>
          John Stuart Mill, Essays on Religion, 254—“The most valuable part of
          the effect on the character which Christianity has produced, by
          holding up in a divine person a standard of excellence and a model for
          imitation, is available even to the absolute unbeliever, and can never
          more be lost to humanity. For it is Christ rather than God whom
          Christianity has held up to believers as the pattern of perfection for
          humanity. It is the God incarnate, more than the God of the Jews or of
          nature, who, being idealized, has taken so great and salutary hold on
          the modern mind. And whatever else may be taken away from us by
          rational criticism, Christ is still left: a unique figure, not more
          unlike all his precursors than all his followers, even those who had
          the direct benefit of his personal preaching.…Who among his disciples,
          or among their proselytes, was capable of inventing the sayings
          ascribed to Jesus, or of imagining the life and character revealed in
          the Gospels? … About the life and sayings of Jesus there is a stamp of
          personal originality combined with profundity of insight which, if we
          abandon the idle expectation of finding scientific precision where
          something very different was aimed at, must place the Prophet of
          Nazareth, even in the estimation of those who have no belief in his
          inspiration, in the very first rank of the men of sublime genius of
          whom our species can boast. When this preëminent genius is combined
          with the qualities of probably the greatest moral reformer and martyr
          to that mission who ever existed upon earth, religion cannot be said
          to have made a bad choice in pitching on this man as the ideal
          representative and guide of humanity; nor even now would it be easy,
          even for an unbeliever, to find a better translation of the rule of
          virtue from the abstract into the concrete than the endeavor so to
          live that Christ would approve our life. When to this we add that, to
          the conception of the rational sceptic, it remains a possibility that
          Christ actually was … a man charged with a special, express and unique
          commission from God to lead mankind to truth and virtue, we may well
          conclude that the influences of religion on the character, which will
          remain after rational criticism has done its utmost against the
          evidences of religion, are well worth preserving, and that what they
          lack in direct strength as compared with those of a firmer belief is
          more than compensated by the greater truth and rectitude of the
          morality they sanction.” See also Ullmann, Sinlessness of Jesus;
          Alexander, Christ and Christianity, 129–157; Schaff, Person of Christ;

          Jesus.

          4. The testimony of Christ to himself—as being a messenger from God
          and as being one with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one personage in history has claimed to teach absolute truth, to
          be one with God, and to attest his divine mission by works such as
          only God could perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. This testimony cannot be accounted for upon the hypothesis that
          Jesus was an intentional deceiver: for (a) the perfectly consistent
          holiness of his life; (b) the unwavering confidence with which he
          challenged investigation of his claims and staked all upon the result;
          (c) the vast improbability of a lifelong lie in the avowed interests
          of truth; and (d) the impossibility that deception should have wrought
          such blessing to the world,—all show that Jesus was no conscious
          impostor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fisher, Essays on the Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 515–538—Christ
          knew how vast his claims were, yet he staked all upon them. Though
          others doubted, he never doubted himself. Though persecuted unto
          death, he never ceased his consistent testimony. Yet he lays claim to
          humility: Mat_11:29—“I am meek and lowly in heart.” How can we
          reconcile with humility his constant self-assertion? We answer that
          Jesus’ self-assertion was absolutely essential to his mission, for he
          and the truth were one: he could not assert the truth without
          asserting himself, and he could not assert himself without asserting
          the truth. Since he was the truth, he needed to say so, for men’s sake
          and for the truth’s sake, and he could be meek and lowly in heart in
          saying so. Humility is not self-depreciation, but only the judging of
          ourselves according to God’s perfect standard. ‘Humility’ is derived
          from ‘humus’. It is the coming down from airy and vain
          self-exploitation to the solid ground, the hard-pan, of actual fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          God requires of us only so much humility as is consistent with truth.
          The self-glorification of the egotist is nauseating, because it
          indicates gross ignorance or misrepresentation of self. But it is a
          duty to be self-asserting, just so far as we represent the truth and
          righteousness of God. There is a noble self-assertion which is
          perfectly consistent with humility. Job must stand for his integrity.
          Paul’s humility was not of the Uriah Heep variety. When occasion
          required, he could assert his manhood and his rights, as at Philippi
          and at the Castle of Antonia. So the Christian should frankly say out
          the truth that is in him. Each Christian has an experience of his own,
          and should tell it to others. In testifying to the truth he is only
          following the example of “Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate
          witnessed the good confession” (1Ti_6:13).
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Nor can Jesus’ testimony to himself be explained upon the
          hypothesis that he was self-deceived: for this would argue (a) a
          weakness and folly amounting to positive insanity. But his whole
          character and life exhibit a calmness, dignity, equipoise, insight,
          self-mastery, utterly inconsistent with such a theory. Or it would
          argue (b) a self-ignorance and self-exaggeration which could spring
          only from the deepest moral perversion. But the absolute purity of his
          conscience, the humility of his spirit, the self-denying beneficence
          of his life, show this hypothesis to be incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rogers, Superhuman Origin of the Bible, 39—If he were man, then to
          demand that all the world should bow down to him would be worthy of
          scorn like that which we feel for some straw-crowned monarch of
          Bedlam. Forrest, The Christ of History and of Experience, 22,
          76—Christ never united with his disciples in prayer. He went up into
          the mountain to pray, but not to pray with them: Luk_9:18—“as he was
          alone praying, his disciples were with him.” The consciousness of
          preëristence is the indispensable precondition of the total demand
          which he makes in the Synoptics. Adamson, The Mind in Christ, 81,
          82—We value the testimony of Christians to their communion with God.
          Much more should we value the testimony of Christ. Only one who, first
          being divine, also knew that he was divine, could reveal heavenly
          things with the clearness and certainty that belong to the utterances
          of Jesus. In him we have something very different from the momentary
          flashes of insight which leave us in all the greater darkness.

          Nash, Ethics and Rev_5:1-14—“Self-respect is bottomed upon the ability
          to become what one desires to be; and, if the ability steadily falls
          short of the task, the springs of self-respect dry up; the motives of
          happy and heroic action wither. Science, art, generous civic life, and
          especially religion, come to man’s rescue,”—showing him his true
          greatness and breadth of being in God. The State is the individual’s
          larger self. Humanity, and even the universe, are parts of him. It is
          the duty of man to enable all men to be men. It is possible for men
          not only truthfully but also rationally to assert themselves, even in
          earthly affairs. Chatham to the Duke of Devonshire: “My Lord, I
          believe I can save this country, and that no one else can.” Leonardo
          da Vinci, in his thirtieth year, to the Duke of Milan: “I can carry
          through every kind of work in sculpture, in clay, marble, and bronze;

          well as any one whosoever.”

          Horace: “Exegi monumentum ære perennius.” Savage, Life beyond Death,
          209—A famous old minister said once, when a young and zealous
          enthusiast tried to get him to talk, and failing, burst out with,
          “Have you no religion at all?” “None to speak of,” was the reply. When
          Jesus perceived a tendency in his disciples to self-glorification, he
          urged silence; but when he saw the tendency to introspection and
          inertness, he bade them proclaim what he had done for them (Mat_8:4;
          Mar_5:19). It is never right for the Christian to proclaim himself;
          but, if Christ had not proclaimed himself, the world could never have
          been saved. Rush Rhees, Life of Jesus of Nazareth, 235–237—“In the
          teaching of Jesus, two topics have the leading place—the Kingdom of
          God, and himself. He sought to be Lord, rather than Teacher only. Yet
          the Kingdom is not one of power, national and external, but one of
          fatherly love and of mutual brotherhood.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Did Jesus do anything for effect, or as a mere example? Not so. His
          baptism had meaning for him as a consecration of himself to death for
          the sins of the world, and his washing of the disciples’ feet was the
          fit beginning of the paschal supper and the symbol of his laying aside
          his heavenly glory to purify us for the marriage supper of the Lamb.
          Thomas à Kempis: “Thou art none the holier because thou art praised,
          and none the worse because thou art censured. What thou art, that thou
          art, and it avails thee naught to be called any better than thou art
          in the sight of God.” Jesus’ consciousness of his absolute sinlessness
          and of his perfect communion with God is the strongest of testimonies
          to his divine nature and mission. See Theological Eclectic, 4:137;
          Liddon, Our Lord’s Divinity, 153; J. S. Mill, Essays on Religion, 253;

          Professors, 37–62.

          If Jesus, then, cannot be charged with either mental or moral
          unsoundness, his testimony must be true, and he himself must be one
          with God and the revealer of God to men.

          Neither Confucius nor Buddha claimed to be divine, or the organs of
          divine revelation, though both were moral teachers and reformers.
          Zoroaster and Pythagoras apparently believed themselves charged with a
          divine mission, though their earliest biographers wrote centuries
          after their death. Socrates claimed nothing for himself which was
          beyond the power of others, Mohammed believed his extraordinary states
          of body and soul to be due to the action of celestial beings; he gave
          forth the Koran as “a warning to all creatures,” and sent a summons to
          the King of Persia and the Emperor of Constantinople, as well as to
          other potentates, to accept the religion of Islam; yet he mourned when
          he died that he could not have opportunity to correct the mistakes of
          the Koran and of his own life. For Confucius or Buddha, Zoroaster or
          Pythagoras, Socrates or Mohammed to claim all power in heaven and
          earth, would show insanity or moral perversion. But this is precisely
          what Jesus claimed. He was either mentally or morally unsound, or his
          testimony is true. See Baldensperger, Selbstbewusstsein Jesu; E.
          Ballentine, Christ his own Witness.
