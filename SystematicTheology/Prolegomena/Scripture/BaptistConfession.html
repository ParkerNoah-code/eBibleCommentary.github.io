          1. The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible
          rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.<sup>1</sup>
          Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence
          do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave
          men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of
          God and his will which is necessary unto salvation.<sup>2</sup>
          Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to
          reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church;<sup>
            3</sup
          >
          and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth,
          and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against
          the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the
          world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy
          Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing
          his will unto his people being now ceased.<sup>4</sup>
          <br />(<sup>1</sup>2 Tim 3:15-17, Isa 8:20, Luke 16:29, 31, Eph 2:20;
          <sup>2</sup>Rom 1:19-21, Rom 2:14-15, Ps 19:1-3; <sup>3</sup>Heb 1:1;
          <sup>4</sup>Prov 22:19-21, Rom 15:4, 2 Pet 1:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are
          now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are
          these:
        </p>
        <p>OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</p>
        <p>
          Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
          Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II
          Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs,
          Ecclesiastes, The Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,
          Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,
          Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi
        </p>
        <p>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>
        <p>
          Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul's Epistle to
          the Romans, I Corinthians, II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians,
          Philippians, Colossians, I Thessalonians, II Thessalonians, I Timothy,
          II Timothy, To Titus, To Philemon, The Epistle to the Hebrews, Epistle
          of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second,
          and third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation All of
          which are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and
          life.<sup>5</sup> <br />(<sup>5</sup>2 Tim 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
          inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and,
          therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any
          otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.<sup>
            6</sup
          >
          <br />(<sup>6</sup>Luke 24:27, 44; Rom 3:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
          believed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but
          wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore
          it is to be received because it is the Word of God.<sup>7</sup>
          <br />(<sup>7</sup>2 Pet 1:19-21, 2 Tim 3:16, 2 Thes 2:13, 1 Jhn 5:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God
          to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the
          heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the
          majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the
          whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes
          of the only way of man's salvation, and many other incomparable
          excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it
          doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet
          notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
          truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the
          Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup>
            8</sup
          >
          <br />(<sup>8</sup>Jhn 16:13-14, 1 Cor 2:10-12, 1 Jhn 2:20, 27).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his
          own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set
          down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which
          nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the
          Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup>9</sup> Nevertheless, we acknowledge
          the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the
          saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word,<sup
            >10</sup
          >
          and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God,
          and government of the church, common to human actions and societies,
          which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence,
          according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be
          observed.<sup>11</sup> <br />(<sup>9</sup>2 Tim 3:15-17, Gal 1:8-9;
          <sup>10</sup>Jhn 6:45, 1 Cor 2:9-12; <sup>11</sup>1 Cor 11:13-14,
          14:26,40).
        </p>
        <p>
          7. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
          alike clear unto all;<sup>12</sup> yet those things which are
          necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so
          clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other,
          that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary
          means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.<sup>13</sup>
          <br />(<sup>12</sup>2 Pet 3:16; <sup>13</sup>Ps 19:7, Ps 119:130).
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the
          people of God of old),<sup>14</sup> and the New Testament in Greek
          (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to
          the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular
          care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so
          as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal
          to them.<sup>15</sup> But because these original tongues are not known
          to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the
          Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read,<sup>
            16</sup
          >
          and search them,<sup>17</sup> therefore they are to be translated into
          the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,<sup>
            18</sup
          >
          that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him
          in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the
          Scriptures may have hope.<sup>19</sup> <br />(<sup>14</sup>Rom 3:2;
          <sup>15</sup>Is 8:20; <sup>16</sup>Acts 15:15; <sup>17</sup>Jhn 5:39;
          <sup>18</sup>1 Cor 14:6, 9, 11-12, 24, 28; <sup>19</sup>Col 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          9. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
          itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full
          sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be
          searched by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>20</sup>
          <br />(<sup>20.</sup>2 Pet 1:20-21, Acts 15:15-16).
        </p>
        <p>
          10. The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to
          be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
          writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined,
          and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy
          Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered,
          our faith is finally resolved.<sup>21</sup> <br />(<sup>21</sup>Mat
          22:29, 31-32, Eph 2:20, Acts 28:23).
