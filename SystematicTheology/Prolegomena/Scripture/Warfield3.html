        <h2>III. The Biblical Idea of Inspiration:</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          THE word "inspire" and its derivatives seem to have come into Middle
          English from the French, and have been employed from the first (early
          in the fourteenth century) in a considerable number of significations,
          physical and metaphorical, secular and religious. The derivatives have
          been multiplied and their applications extended during the procession
          of the years, until they have acquired a very wide and varied use.
          Underlying all their use, however, is the constant implication of an
          influence from without, producing in its object movements and effects
          beyond its native, or at least its ordinary powers. The noun
          "inspiration," although already in use in the fourteenth century,
          seems not to occur in any but a theological sense until late in the
          sixteenth century. The specifically theological sense of all these
          terms is governed, of course, by their usage in Latin theology; and
          this rests ultimately on their employment in the Latin Bible. In the
          Vulgate Latin Bible the verb inspiro (Gen. ii. 7; Wisd. xv. 11;
          Ecclus. iv. 12; 2 Tim. iii. 16; 2 Pet. i. 21) and the noun inspiratio
          (2 Sam, xxii. 16; Job xxxii. 8; Ps. xvii. 16; Acts xvii. 25) both
          occur four or five times in somewhat diverse applications. In the
          development of a theological nomenclature, however, they have acquired
          (along with other less frequent applications) a technical sense with
          reference to the Biblical writers or the Biblical books. The Biblical
          books are called inspired as the Divinely determined products of
          inspired men; the Biblical writers are called inspired as breathed
          into by the Holy Spirit, so that the product of their activities
          transcends human powers and becomes Divinely authoritative.
          Inspiration is, therefore, usually defined as a supernatural influence
          exerted on the sacred writers by the Spirit of God, by virtue of which
          their writings are given Divine trustworthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, for English-speaking men, these terms have virtually ceased
          to be Biblical terms. They naturally passed from the Latin Vulgate
          into the English versions made from it (most fully into the
          Rheims-Douay: Job xxxii. 8; Wisd. xv. 11; Ecclus. iv. 12; 2 Tim. iii.
          16; 2 Pet. i. 21). But in the development of the English Bible they
          have found ever-decreasing place. In the English versions of the
          Apocrypha (both Authorized Version and Revised Version) "inspired" is
          retained in Wisd. xv. 11; but in the canonical books the nominal form
          alone occurs in the Authorized Version and that only twice: Job xxxii.
          8, "But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty
          giveth them understanding"; and 2 Tim. iii. 16, "All scripture is
          given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
          reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." The
          Revised Version removes the former of these instances, substituting
          "breath" for "inspiration"; and alters the latter so as to read:
          "Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for
          reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness,"
          with a marginal alternative in the form of, "Every scripture is
          inspired of God and profitable," etc. The word "inspiration" thus
          disappears from the English Bible, and the word "inspired" is left in
          it only once, and then, let it be added, by a distinct and even
          misleading mistranslation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Greek word in this passage - qeo,pneustoj( theópneustos - very
          distinctly does not mean "inspired of God." This phrase is rather the
          rendering of the Latin, divinitus inspirata, restored from the Wyclif
          ("Al Scripture of God ynspyrid is . . .") and Rhemish ("All Scripture
          inspired of God is . . .") versions of the Vulgate. The Greek word
          does not even mean, as the Authorized Version translates it, "given by
          inspiration of God," although that rendering (inherited from Tindale:
          "All Scripture given by inspiration of God is . . ." and its
          successors; cf. Geneva: "The whole Scripture is given by inspiration
          of God and is . . .") has at least to say for itself that it is a
          somewhat clumsy, perhaps, but not misleading, paraphrase of the Greek
          term in the theological language of the day. The Greek term has,
          however, nothing to say of inspiring or of inspiration: it speaks only
          of a "spiring" or "spiration." What it says of Scripture is, not that
          it is "breathed into by God" or is the product of the Divine
          "inbreathing" into its human authors, but that it is breathed out by
          God, "Godbreathed," the product of the creative breath of God. In a
          word, what is declared by this fundamental passage is simply that the
          Scriptures are a Divine product, without any indication of how God has
          operated in producing them. No term could have been chosen, however,
          which would have more emphatically asserted the Divine production of
          Scripture than that which is here employed. The "breath of God" is in
          Scripture just the symbol of His almighty power, the bearer of His
          creative word. "By the word of Jehovah," we read in the significant
          parallel of Ps. xxxiii. 6, "were the heavens made, and all the host of
          them by the breath of his mouth." And it is particularly where the
          operations Of God are energetic that this term (whether x;Wr, rūah,̣ or
          hm';v'n., neshāmāh) is employed to designate them - God's breath is
          the irresistible outfloew of His power. When Paul declares, then, that
          "every scripture," or "all scripture" is the product of the Divine
          breath, "is God-breathed," he asserts with as much energy as he could
          employ that Scripture is the product of a specifically Divine
          operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) 2 Tim. iii. 16: In the passage in which Paul makes this energetic
          assertion of the Divine origin of Scripture he is engaged in
          explaining the greatness of the advantages which Timothy had enjoyed
          for learning the saving truth of God. He had had good teachers; and
          from his very infancy he had been, by his knowledge of the Scriptures,
          made wise unto salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The
          expression, "sacred writings," here employed (ver. 15), is a technical
          one, not found elsewhere in the New Testament, it is true, but
          occurring currently in Philo and Josephus to designate that body of
          authoritative books which constituted the Jewish "Law." It appears
          here anarthrously because it is set in contrast with the oral teaching
          which Timothy had enjoyed, as something still better: he had not only
          had good instructors, but also always "an open Bible," as we should
          say, in his hand. To enhance yet further the great advantage of the
          possession of these Sacred Scriptures the apostle adds now a sentence
          throwing their nature strongly up to view. They are of Divine origin
          and therefore of the highest value for all holy purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is room for some difference of opinion as to the exact
          construction of this declaration. Shall we render "Every Scripture" or
          "All Scripture"? Shall we render "Every [or all] Scripture is
          Godbreathed and [therefore] profitable," or "Every [or all] Scripture,
          being God-breathed, is as well profitable"? No doubt both questions
          are interesting, but for the main matter now engaging our attention
          they are both indifferent. Whether Paul, looking back at the Sacred
          Scriptures he had just mentioned, makes the assertion he is about to
          add, of them distributively, of all their parts, or collectively, of
          their entire mass, is of no moment: to say that every part of these
          Sacred Scriptures is God-breathed and to say that the whole of these
          Sacred Scriptures is God-breathed, is, for the main matter, all one.
          Nor is the difference great between saying that they are in all their
          parts, or in their whole extent, God-breathed and therefore
          profitable, and saying that they are in all their parts, or in their
          whole extent, because God-breathed as well profitable. In both cases
          these Sacred Scriptures are declared to owe their value to their
          Divine origin; and in both cases this their Divine origin is
          energetically asserted of their entire fabric. On the whole, the
          preferable construction would seem to be, "Every Scripture, seeing
          that it is God-breathed, is as well profitable." In that case, what
          the apostle asserts is that the Sacred Scriptures, in their every
          several passage - for it is just "passage of Scripture" which
          "Scripture" in this distributive use of it signifies - is the product
          of the creative breath of God, and, because of this its Divine
          origination, is of supreme value for all holy purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be observed that the apostle does not stop here to tell us
          either what particular books enter into the collection which he calls
          Sacred Scriptures, or by what precise operations God has produced
          them. Neither of these subjects entered into the matter he had at the
          moment in hand. It was the value of the Scriptures, and the source of
          that value in their Divine origin, which he required at the moment to
          assert; and these things he asserts, leaving to other occasions any
          further facts concerning them which it might be well to emphasize. It
          is also to be observed that the apostle does not tell us here
          everything for which the Scriptures are made valuable by their Divine
          origination. He speaks simply to the point immediately in hand, and
          reminds Timothy of the value which these Scriptures, by virtue of
          their Divine origin, have for the "man of God." Their spiritual power,
          as God-breathed, is all that he had occasion here to advert to.
          Whatever other qualities may accrue to them from their Divine origin,
          he leaves to other occasions to speak of. (2) 2 Pet. i. 19-21: What
          Paul tells here about the Divine origin of the Scriptures is enforced
          and extended by a striking passage in 2 Pet. (i. 19-21). Peter is
          assuring his readers that what had been made known to them of "the
          power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" did not rest on "cunningly
          devised fables." He offers them the testimony of eyewitnesses of
          Christ's glory. And then he intimates that they have better testimony
          than even that of eyewitnesses. "We have," says he, "the prophetic
          word" (English versions, unhappily, "the word of prophecy"): and this,
          he says, is "more sure," and therefore should certainly be heeded. He
          refers, of course, to the Scriptures. Of what other "prophetic word"
          could he, over against the testimony of the eyewitnesses of Christ's
          "excellent glory" (Authorized Version) say that "we have" it, that is,
          it is in our hands? And he proceeds at once to speak of it plainly as
          "Scriptural prophecy." You do well, he says, to pay heed to the
          prophetic word, because we know this first, that "every prophecy of
          scripture . . ." It admits of more question, however, whether by this
          phrase he means the whole of Scripture, designated according to its
          character, as prophetic, that is, of Divine origin; or only that
          portion of Scripture which we discriminate as particularly prophetic,
          the immediate revelations contained in Scripture. The former is the
          more likely view, inasmuch as the entirety of Scripture is elsewhere
          conceived and spoken of as prophetic. In that case, what Peter has to
          say of this "every prophecy of scripture" - the exact equivalent, it
          will be observed, in this case of Paul's "every scripture" (2 Tim.
          iii. 16) - applies to the whole of Scripture in all its parts. What he
          says of it is that it does not come "of private interpretation"; that
          is, it is not the result of human investigation into the nature of
          things, the product of its writers' own thinking. This is as much as
          to say it is of Divine gift. Accordingly, he proceeds at once to make
          this plain in a supporting clause which contains both the negative and
          the positive declaration: "For no prophecy ever came [margin "was
          brought"] by the will of man, but it was as borne by the Holy Spirit
          that men spoke from God." In this singularly precise and pregnant
          statement there are several things which require to be carefully
          observed. There is, first of all, the emphatic denial that prophecy -
          that is to say, on the hypothesis upon which we are working, Scripture
          - owes its origin to human initiative: "No prophecy ever was brought -
          'came' is the word used in the English version text, with 'was
          brought' in Revised Version margin - by the will of man." Then, there
          is the equally emphatic assertion that its source lies in God: it was
          spoken by men, indeed, but the men who spoke it "spake from God." And
          a remarkable clause is here inserted, and thrown forward in the
          sentence that stress may fall on it, which tells us how it could be
          that men, in speaking, should speak not from themselves, but from God:
          it was "as borne" - it is the same word which was rendered "was
          brought" above, and might possibly be rendered "brought" here - "by
          the Holy Spirit" that they spoke. Speaking thus under the determining
          influence of the Holy Spirit, the things they spoke were not from
          themselves, but from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is as direct an assertion of the Divine origin of Scripture as
          that of 2 Tim. iii. 16. But there is more here than a simple assertion
          of the Divine origin of Scripture. We are advanced somewhat in our
          understanding of how God has produced the Scriptures. It was through
          the instrumentality of men who "spake from him." More specifically, it
          was through an operation of the Holy Ghost on these men which is
          described as "bearing" them. The term here used is a very specific
          one. It is not to be confounded with guiding, or directing, or
          controlling, or even leading in the full sense of that word. It goes
          beyond all such terms, in assigning the effect produced specifically
          to the active agent. What is "borne" is taken up by the "bearer," and
          conveyed by the "bearer's" power, not its own, to the "bearer's" goal,
          not its own. The men who spoke from God are here declared, therefore,
          to have been taken up by the Holy Spirit and brought by His power to
          the goal of His choosing. The things which they spoke under this
          operation of the Spirit were therefore His things, not theirs. And
          that is the reason which is assigned why "the prophetic word" is so
          sure. Though spoken through the instrumentality of men, it is, by
          virtue of the fact that these men spoke "as borne by the Holy Spirit,"
          an immediately Divine word. It will be observed that the proximate
          stress is laid here, not on the spiritual value of Scripture (though
          that, too, is seen in the background), but on the Divine
          trustworthiness of Scripture. Because this is the way every prophecy
          of Scripture "has been brought," it affords a more sure basis of
          confidence than even the testimony of human eyewitnesses. Of course,
          if we do not understand by "the prophetic word" here the entirety of
          Scripture described, according to its character, as revelation, but
          only that element in Scripture which we call specifically prophecy,
          then it is directly only of that element in Scripture that these great
          declarations are made. In any event, however, they are made of the
          prophetic element in Scripture as written, which was the only form in
          which the readers of this Epistle possessed it, and which is the thing
          specifically intimated in the phrase "every prophecy of scripture."
          These great declarations are made, therefore, at least of large tracts
          of Scripture; and if the entirety of Scripture is intended by the
          phrase "the prophetic word," they are made of the whole of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Jn. x. 34 f.: How far the supreme trustworthiness of Scripture,
          thus asserted, extends may be conveyed to us by a passage in one of
          Our Lord's discourses recorded by John (Jn. x. 34- 35). The Jews,
          offended by Jesus' "making himself God," were in the act to stone Him,
          when He defended Himself thus: "Is it not written in your law, I said,
          Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came
          (and the scripture cannot be broken), say ye of him, whom the Father
          sanctified [margin "consecrated"] and sent unto the world, Thou
          blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?" It may be thought
          that this defence is inadequate. It certainly is incomplete: Jesus
          made Himself God (Jn. x. 33) in a far higher sense than that in which
          "Ye are gods" was said of those "unto whom the word of God came": He
          had just declared in unmistakable terms, "I and the Father are one."
          But it was quite sufficient for the immediate end in view - to repel
          the technical charge of blasphemy based on His making Himself God: it
          is not blasphemy to call one God in any sense in which he may fitly
          receive that designation; and certainly if it is not blasphemy to call
          such men as those spoken of in the passage of Scripture adduced gods,
          because of their official functions, it cannot be blasphemy to call
          Him God whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world. The point
          for us to note, however, is merely that Jesus' defence takes the form
          of an appeal to Scripture; and it is important to observe how He makes
          this appeal. In the first place, He adduces the Scriptures as law: "Is
          it not written in your law?" He demands. The passage of Scripture
          which He adduces is not written in that portion of Scripture which was
          more specifically called "the Law," that is to say, the Pentateuch;
          nor in any portion of Scripture of formally legal contents. It is
          written in the Book of Psalms; and in a particular psalm which is as
          far as possible from presenting the external characteristics of legal
          enactment (Ps. lxxxii. 6). When Jesus adduces this passage, then, as
          written in the "law" of the Jews, He does it, not because it stands in
          this psalm, but because it is a part of Scripture at large. In other
          words, He here ascribes legal authority to the entirety of Scripture,
          in accordance with a conception common enough among the Jews (cf. Jn.
          xii. 34), and finding expression in the New Testament occasionally,
          both on the lips of Jesus Himself, and in the writings of the
          apostles. Thus, on a later occasion (Jn. xv. 25), Jesus declares that
          it is written in the "law" of the Jews, "They hated me without a
          cause," a clause found in Ps. xxxv. 19. And Paul assigns passages both
          from the Psalms and from Isaiah to "the Law" (1 Cor, xiv. 21; Rom.
          iii. 19), and can write such a sentence as this (Gal. iv. 21 f.):
          "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
          For it is written . . ." quoting from the narrative of Genesis. We
          have seen that the entirety of Scripture was conceived as "prophecy";
          we now see that the entirety of Scripture was also conceived as "law":
          these three terms, the law, prophecy, Scripture, were indeed,
          materially, strict synonyms, as our present passage itself advises us,
          by varying the formula of adduction in contiguous verses from "law" to
          "scripture." And what is thus implied in the manner in which Scripture
          is adduced, is immediately afterward spoken out in the most explicit
          language, because it forms an essential element in Our Lord's defence.
          It might have been enough to say simply, "Is it not written in your
          law?" But Our Lord, determined to drive His appeal to Scripture home,
          sharpens the point to the utmost by adding with the highest emphasis:
          "and the scripture cannot be broken." This is the reason why it is
          worth while to appeal to what is "written in the law," because "the
          scripture cannot be broken." The word "broken" here is the common one
          for breaking the law, or the Sabbath, or the like (Jn. v. 18; vii. 23;
          Mt. v. 19), and the meaning of the declaration is that it is
          impossible for the Scripture to be annulled, its authority to be
          withstood, or denied. The movement of thought is to the effect that,
          because it is impossible for the Scripture - the term is perfectly
          general and witnesses to the unitary character of Scripture (it is
          all, for the purpose in hand, of a piece) - to be withstood, therefore
          this particular Scripture which is cited must be taken as of
          irrefragable authority. What we have here is, therefore, the strongest
          possible assertion of the indefectible authority of Scripture;
          precisely what is true of Scripture is that it "cannot be broken."
          Now, what is the particular thing in Scripture, for the confirmation
          of which the indefectible authority of Scripture is thus invoked? It
          is one of its most casual clauses - more than that, the very form of
          its expression in one of its most casual clauses. This means, of
          course, that in the Saviour's view the indefectible authority of
          Scripture attaches to the very form of expression of its most casual
          clauses. It belongs to Scripture through and through, down to its most
          minute particulars, that it is of indefectible authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sometimes suggested, it is true, that Our Lord's argument here
          is an argumentum ad hominem, and that his words, therefore, express
          not His own view of the authority of Scripture, but that of His Jewish
          opponents. It will scarcely be denied that there is a vein of satire
          running through Our Lord's defence: that the Jews so readily allowed
          that corrupt judges might properly be called "gods," but could not
          endure that He whom the Father had consecrated and sent into the world
          should call Himself Son of God, was a somewhat pungent fact to throw
          up into such a high light. But the argument from Scripture is not ad
          hominem but e concessu; Scripture was common ground with Jesus and His
          opponents. If proof were needed for so obvious a fact, it would be
          supplied by the circumstance that this is not an isolated but a
          representative passage. The conception of Scripture thrown up into
          such clear view here supplies the ground of all Jesus' appeals to
          Scripture, and of all the appeals of the New Testament writers as
          well. Everywhere, to Him and to them alike, an appeal to Scripture is
          an appeal to an indefectible authority whose determination is final;
          both He and they make their appeal indifferently to every part of
          Scripture, to every element in Scripture, to its most incidental
          clauses as well as to its most fundamental principles, and to the very
          form of its expression. This attitude toward Scripture as an
          authoritative document is, indeed, already intimated by their constant
          designation of it by the name of Scripture, the Scriptures, that is
          "the Document," by way of eminence; and by their customary citation of
          it with the simple formula, "It is written." What is written in this
          document admits so little of questioning that its authoritativeness
          required no asserting, but might safely be taken for granted. Both
          modes of expression belong to the constantly illustrated habitudes of
          Our Lord's speech. The first words He is recorded as uttering after
          His manifestation to Israel were an appeal to the unquestionable
          authority of Scripture; to Satan's temptations He opposed no other
          weapon than the final "It is written"! (Mt. iv. 4.7.10; Lk. iv. 4.8).
          And among the last words which He spoke to His disciples before He was
          received up was a rebuke to them for not understanding that all things
          "which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and psalms"
          concerning Him - that is (ver. 45) in the entire "Scriptures"- "must
          needs be" (very emphatic) "fulfilled" (Lk. xxiv. 44). "Thus it is
          written," says He (ver. 46), as rendering all doubt absurd. For, as He
          had explained earlier upon the same day (Lk. xxiv. 25 ff.), it argues
          only that one is "foolish and slow at heart" if he does not "believe
          in" (if his faith does not rest securely on, as on a firm foundation)
          "all" (without limit of subjectmatter here) "that the prophets"
          (explained in ver. 27 as equivalent to "all the scriptures") "have
          spoken."
        </p>
        <p>
          The necessity of the fulfilment of all that is written in Scripture,
          which is so strongly asserted in these last instructions to His
          disciples, is frequently adverted to by Our Lord. He repeatedly
          explains of occurrences occasionally happening that they have come to
          pass "that the scripture might be fulfilled" (Mk. xiv. 49; Jn. xiii.
          18; xvii. 12; cf. xii. 14; Mk. ix. 12.13). On the basis of Scriptural
          declarations, therefore, He announces with confidence that given
          events will certainly occur: "All ye shall be offended [literally
          "scandalized"] in me this night: for it is written . . ." (Mt. xxvi.
          31; Mk. xiv. 27; cf. Lk. xx. 17). Although holding at His command
          ample means of escape, He bows before on-coming calamities, for, He
          asks, how otherwise "should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
          must be?" (Mt. xxvi. 54). It is not merely the two disciples with whom
          He talked on the way to Emmaus (Lk, xxiv. 25) whom He rebukes for not
          trusting themselves more perfectly to the teaching of Scripture. "Ye
          search the scriptures," He says to the Jews, in the classical passage
          (Jn. v. 39), "because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and
          these are they which bear witness of me; and ye will not come to me,
          that ye may have life!" These words surely were spoken more in sorrow
          than in scorn: there is no blame implied either for searching the
          Scriptures or for thinking that eternal life is to be found in
          Scripture; approval rather. What the Jews are blamed for is that they
          read with a veil lying upon their hearts which He would fain take away
          (2 Cor. iii. 15 f.). "Ye search the scriptures" - that is right: and
          "even you" (emphatic) "think to have eternal life in them" - that is
          right, too. But "it is these very Scriptures" (very emphatic) "which
          are bearing witness" (continuous process) "of me; and" (here is the
          marvel! ) "ye will not come to me and have life!" that you may, that
          is, reach the very end you have so properly in view in searching the
          Scriptures. Their failure is due, not to the Scriptures but to
          themselves, who read the Scriptures to such little purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quite similarly Our Lord often finds occasion to express wonder at the
          little effect to which Scripture had been read, not because it had
          been looked into too curiously, but because it had not been looked
          into earnestly enough, with sufficiently simple and robust trust in
          its every declaration. "Have ye not read even this scripture?" He
          demands, as He adduces Ps. cxviii. to show that the rejection of the
          Messiah was already intimated in Scripture (Mk. xii. 10; Mt. xxi. 42
          varies the expression to the equivalent: "Did ye never read in the
          scriptures?"). And when the indignant Jews came to Him complaining of
          the Hosannas with which the children in the Temple were acclaiming
          Him, and demanding, "Hearest thou what these are saying?" He met them
          (Mt. xxi. 16) merely with, "Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouths
          of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?" The underlying
          thought of these passages is spoken out when He intimates that the
          source of all error in Divine things is just ignorance of the
          Scriptures: "Ye do err," He declares to His questioners, on an
          important occasion, "not knowing the scriptures" (Mt. xxii. 29); or,
          as it is put, perhaps more forcibly, in interrogative form, in its
          parallel in another Gospel: "Is it not for this cause that ye err,
          that ye know not the scriptures?" (Mk. xii. 24). Clearly, he who
          rightly knows the Scriptures does not err. The confidence with which
          Jesus rested on Scripture, in its every declaration, is further
          illustrated in a passage like Mt. xix. 4. Certain Pharisees had come
          to Him with a question on divorce and He met them thus: "Have ye not
          read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and
          female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and
          mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one
          flesh? . . . What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
          asunder." The point to be noted is the explicit reference of Gen. ii.
          24 to God as its author: "He who made them . . . said"; "what
          therefore God hath joined together." Yet this passage does not give us
          a saying of God's recorded in Scripture, but just the word of
          Scripture itself, and can be treated as a declaration of God's only on
          the hypothesis that all Scripture is a declaration of God's. The
          parallel in Mk. (x. 5 ff.) just as truly, though not as explicitly,
          assigns the passage to God as its author, citing it as authoritative
          law and speaking of its enactment as an act of God's. And it is
          interesting to observe in passing that Paul, having occasion to quote
          the same passage (1 Cor. vi. 16), also explicitly quotes it as a
          Divine word: "For, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh" - the
          "he" here, in accordance with a usage to be noted later, meaning just
          "God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus clear is it that Jesus' occasional adduction of Scripture as an
          authoritative document rests on an ascription of it to God as its
          author. His testimony is that whatever stands written in Scripture is
          a word of God. Nor can we evacuate this testimony of its force on the
          plea that it represents Jesus only in the days of His flesh, when He
          may be supposed to have reflected merely the opinions of His day and
          generation. The view of Scripture He announces was, no doubt, the view
          of His day and generation as well as His own view. But there is no
          reason to doubt that it was held by Him, not because it was the
          current view, but because, in His Divine-human knowledge, He knew it
          to be true; for, even in His humiliation, He is the faithful and true
          witness. And in any event we should bear in mind that this was the
          view of the resurrected as well as of the humiliated Christ. It was
          after He had suffered and had risen again in the power of His Divine
          life that He pronounced those foolish and slow of heart who do not
          believe all that stands written in all the Scriptures (Lk. xxiv. 25) ;
          and that He laid down the simple "Thus it is written" as the
          sufficient ground of confident belief (Lk. xxiv. 46). Nor can we
          explain away Jesus' testimony to the Divine trustworthiness of
          Scripture by interpreting it as not His own, but that of His
          followers, placed on His lips in their reports of His words. Not only
          is it too constant, minute, intimate and in part incidental, and
          therefore, as it were, hidden, to admit of this interpretation; but it
          so pervades all our channels of information concerning Jesus' teaching
          as to make it certain that it comes actually from Him. It belongs not
          only to the Jesus of our evangelical records but as well to the Jesus
          of the earlier sources which underlie our evangelical records, as
          anyone may assure himself by observing the instances in which Jesus
          adduces the Scriptures as Divinely authoritative that are recorded in
          more than one of the Gospels (e.g. "It is written," Mt. iv. 4.7.10
          [Lk. iv. 4.8.10]; Mt. xi. 10; [Lk. vii. 27]; Mt. xxi. 13 [Lk. xix. 46;
          Mk. xi. 17]; Mt. xxvi. 31 [Mk. xiv. 21]; "the scripture" or "the
          scriptures," Mt. xix. 4 [Mk. x. 9]; Mt. xxi. 42 [Mk, xii. 10; Lk. xx.
          17]; Mt. xxii. 29 [Mk. xii. 24; Lk. xx. 37]; Mt. xxvi. 56 [Mk. xiv.
          49; Lk. xxiv. 44]). These passages alone would suffice to make clear
          to us the testimony of Jesus to Scripture as in all its parts and
          declarations Divinely authoritative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attempt to attribute the testimony of Jesus to His followers has
          in its favor only the undeniable fact that the testimony of the
          writers of the New Testament is to precisely the same effect as His.
          They, too, cursorily speak of Scripture by that pregnant name and
          adduce it with the simple "It is written," with the implication that
          whatever stands written in it is Divinely authoritative. As Jesus'
          official life begins with this "It is written" (Mt. iv. 4), so the
          evangelical proclamation begins with an "Even as it is written" (Mk.
          i. 2); and as Jesus sought the justification of His work in a solemn
          "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again
          from the dead the third day" (Lk. xxiv. 46 ff.), so the apostles
          solemnly justified the Gospel which they preached, detail after
          detail, by appeal to the Scriptures, "That Christ died for our sins
          according to the scriptures" and "That he hath been raised on the
          third day according to the scriptures" (1 Cor. xv. 3.4; cf. Acts viii.
          35; xvii. 3; xxvi. 22, and also Rom. i. 17; iii. 4.10; iv. 17; xi. 26;
          xiv. 11; 1 Cor. i. 19; ii. 9; iii. 19; xv. 45; Gal. iii. 10.13; iv.
          22.27). Wherever they carried the gospel it was as a gospel resting on
          Scripture that they proclaimed it (Acts xvii. 2; xviii. 24.28); and
          they encouraged themselves to test its truth by the Scriptures (Acts
          xvii. 11). The holiness of life they inculcated, they based on
          Scriptural requirement (1 Pet. i. 16), and they commended the royal
          law of love which they taught by Scriptural sanction (Jas. ii. 8).
          Every detail of duty was supported by them by an appeal to Scripture
          (Acts xxiii. 5; Rom. xii. 19). The circumstances of their lives and
          the events occasionally occurring about them are referred to Scripture
          for their significance (Rom. ii. 26; viii. 36; ix. 33; xi. 8; xv.
          9.21; 2 Cor, iv. 13). As Our Lord declared that whatever was written
          in Scripture must needs be fulfilled (Mt. xxvi. 54; Lk. xxii. 37;
          xxiv. 44), so His followers explained one of the most startling facts
          which had occurred in their experience by pointing out that "it was
          needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit
          spake before by the mouth of David" (Acts i. 16). Here the ground of
          this constant appeal to Scripture, so that it is enough that a thing
          "is contained in scripture" (1 Pet. ii. 6) for it to be of
          indefectible authority, is plainly enough declared: Scripture must
          needs be fulfilled, for what is contained in it is the declaration of
          the Holy Ghost through the human author. What Scripture says, God
          says; and accordingly we read such remarkable declarations as these:
          "For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I
          raise thee up" (Rom. ix. 17); "And the scripture, foreseeing that God
          would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand
          unto Abraham, . . . In thee shall all the nations be blessed" (Gal.
          iii. 8). These are not instances of simple personification of
          Scripture, which is itself a sufficiently remarkable usage (Mk, xv.
          28; Jn. vii. 38.42; xix. 37; Rom. iv. 3; x. 11; xi. 2; Gal. iv. 30; Z
          Tim. v. 18: Jas. ii. 23; iv. 5 f.), vocal with the conviction
          expressed by James (iv. 5) that Scripture cannot speak in vain. They
          indicate a certain confusion in current speech between "Scripture and
          "God," the outgrowth of a deep-seated conviction that the word of
          Scripture is the word of God. It was not "Scripture" that spoke to
          Pharaoh, or gave his great promise to Abraham, but God. But
          "Scripture" and "God" lay so close together in the minds of the
          writers of the New Testament that they could naturally speak of
          "Scripture" doing what Scripture records God as doing. It was,
          however, even more natural to them to speak casually of God saying
          what the Scriptures say; and accordingly we meet with forms of speech
          such as these: "Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye
          shall hear His voice," etc. (Heb. iii. 7, quoting Ps. xcv. 7); "Thou
          art God . . . who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did
          the heathen rage," etc. (Acts iv. 25 Authorized Version, quoting Ps.
          ii. 1); "He that raised him from the dead . . . hath spoken on this
          wise, I will give you . . . because he saith also in another [place] .
          . ." (Acts xiii. 34, quoting Isa. Iv. 3 and Ps. xvi. 10), and the
          like. The words put into God's mouth in each case are not words of God
          recorded in the Scriptures, but just Scripture words in themselves.
          When we take the two classes of passages together, in the one of which
          the Scriptures are spoken of as God, while in the other God is spoken
          of as if He were the Scriptures, we may perceive how close the
          identification of the two was in the minds of the writers of the New
          Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          This identification is strikingly observable in certain catenae of
          quotations, in which there are brought together a number of passages
          of Scripture closely connected with one another. The first chapter of
          the Epistle to the Hebrews supplies an example. We may begin with ver.
          5: "For unto which of the angels said he"- the subject being
          necessarily "God" -"at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I
          begotten thee?"- the citation being from Ps. ii. 7 and very
          appropriate in the mouth of God - "and again, I will be to him a
          Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"-from 2 S. vii. 14, again a
          declaration of God's own - "And when he again bringeth in the
          firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God
          worship him" - from Deut. xxxii. 43, Septuagint, or Ps. xcvii. 7, in
          neither of which is God the speaker - "And of the angels he saith, Who
          maketh his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire"- from Ps.
          civ. 4, where again God is not the speaker but is spoken of in the
          third person -"but of the Son he saith. Thy throne, O God, etc." -
          from Ps. xlv. 6.7 where again God is not the speaker, but is addressed
          - "And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning," etc. - from Ps. cii. 2527,
          where again God is not the speaker but is addressed - "But of which of
          the angels hath he said at any time, Sit thou on my right hand?" etc.
          - from Ps. cx. 1, in which God is the speaker. Here we have passages
          in which God is the speaker and passages in which God is not the
          speaker, but is addressed or spoken of, indiscriminately assigned to
          God, because they all have it in common that they are words of
          Scripture, and as words of Scripture are words of God. Similarly in
          Rom. xv. 9 ff. we have a series of citations the first of which is
          introduced by "as it is written," and the next two by "again he
          saith," and "again," and the last by "and again, Isaiah saith," the
          first being from Ps. xviii. 49; the second from Deut. xxxii. 43; the
          third from Ps. cxvii. 1; and the last from Isa. xi. 10. Only the last
          (the only one here assigned to the human author) is a word of God in
          the text of the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          This view of the Scriptures as a compact mass of words of God
          occasioned the formation of a designation for them by which this their
          character was explicitly expressed. This designation is "the sacred
          oracles," "the oracles of God." It occurs with extraordinary frequency
          in Philo, who very commonly refers to Scripture as "the sacred
          oracles" and cites its several passages as each an "oracle." Sharing,
          as they do, Philo's conception of the Scriptures as, in all their
          parts, a word of God, the New Testament writers naturally also speak
          of them under this designation. The classical passage is Rom. iii. 2
          (cf. Heb. v. 12; Acts vii. 38). Here Paul begins an enumeration of the
          advantages which belonged to the chosen people above other nations;
          and, after declaring these advantages to have been great and numerous,
          he places first among them all their possession of the Scriptures:
          "What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of
          circumcision? Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted
          with the oracles of God." That by "the oracles of God" here are meant
          just the Holy Scriptures in their entirety, conceived as a direct
          Divine revelation, and not any portions of them, or elements in them
          more especially thought of as revelatory, is perfectly clear from the
          wide contemporary use of this designation in this sense by Philo, and
          is put beyond question by the presence in the New Testament of
          habitudes of speech which rest on and grow out of the conception of
          Scripture embodied in this term. From the point of view of this
          designation, Scripture is thought of as the living voice of God
          speaking in all its parts directly to the reader; and, accordingly, it
          is cited by some such formula as "it is said," and this mode of citing
          Scripture duly occurs as an alternative to "it is written" (Lk. iv.
          12, replacing "it is written" in Mt.; Heb. iii. 15; cf. Rom. iv. 18).
          It is due also to this point of view that Scripture is cited, not as
          what God or the Holy Spirit "said," but what He "says," the present
          tense emphasizing the living voice of God speaking in Scriptures to
          the individual soul (Heb. iii. 7; Acts xiii. 35; Heb. i. 7. 8. 10;
          Rom. xv. 10). And especially there is due to it the peculiar usage by
          which Scripture is cited by the simple "saith," without expressed
          subject, the subject being too well understood, when Scripture is
          adduced, to require stating; for who could be the speaker of the words
          of Scripture but God only (Rom. xv. 10; 1 Cor. vi. 16; 2 Cor. vi. 2;
          Gal. iii. 16; Eph. iv. 8; v. 14)? The analogies of this pregnant
          subjectless "saith" are very widespread. It was with it that the
          ancient Pythagoreans and Platonists and the mediaeval Aristotelians
          adduced each their master's teaching; it was with it that, in certain
          circles, the judgments of Hadrian's great jurist Salvius Julianus were
          cited; African stylists were even accustomed to refer by it to
          Sallust, their great model. There is a tendency, cropping out
          occasionally, in the old Testament, to omit the name of God as
          superfluous, when He, as the great logical subject always in mind,
          would be easily understood (cf. Job xx. 23; xxi. 17; Ps. cxiv. 2; Lam.
          iv. 22). So, too, when the New Testament writers quoted Scripture
          there was no need to say whose word it was: that lay beyond question
          in every mind. This usage, accordingly, is a specially striking
          intimation of the vivid sense which the New Testament writers had of
          the Divine origin of the Scriptures, and means that in citing them
          they were acutely conscious that they were citing immediate words of
          God. How completely the Scriptures were to them just the word of God
          may be illustrated by a passage like Gal. iii. 16: "He saith not, And
          to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
          Christ." We have seen Our Lord hanging an argument on the very words
          of Scripture (Jn. x. 34); elsewhere His reasoning depends on the
          particular tense (Mt. xxii. 32) or word (Mt. xxii. 43) used in
          Scripture. Here Paul's argument rests similarly on a grammatical form.
          No doubt it is the grammatical form of the word which God is recorded
          as having spoken to Abraham that is in question. But Paul knows what
          grammatical form God employed in speaking to Abraham only as the
          Scriptures have transmitted it to him; and, as we have seen, in citing
          the words of God and the words of Scripture he was not accustomed to
          make any distinction between them. It is probably the Scriptural word
          as a Scriptural word, therefore, which he has here in mind: though, of
          course, it is possible that what he here witnesses to is rather the
          detailed trustworthiness of the Scriptural record than its direct
          divinity - if we can separate two things which apparently were not
          separated in Paul's mind. This much we can at least say without
          straining, that the designation of Scripture as "scripture" and its
          citation by the formula., "It is written," attest primarily its
          indefectible authority; the designation of it as "oracles" and the
          adduction of it by the formula, "It says," attest primarily its
          immediate divinity. Its authority rests on its divinity and its
          divinity expresses itself in its trustworthiness; and the New
          Testament writers in all their use of it treat it as what they declare
          it to be - a God-breathed document, which, because God-breathed, as
          through and through trustworthy in all its assertions, authoritative
          in all its declarations, and down to its last particular, the very
          word of God, His "oracles."
        </p>
        <p>
          That the Scriptures are throughout a Divine book, created by the
          Divine energy and speaking in their every part with Divine authority
          directly to the heart of the readers, is the fundamental fact
          concerning them which is witnessed by Christ and the sacred writers to
          whom we owe the New Testament. But the strength and constancy with
          which they bear witness to this primary fact do not prevent their
          recognizing by the side of it that the Scriptures have come into being
          by the agency of men. It would be inexact to say that they recognize a
          human element in Scripture: they do not parcel Scripture out,
          assigning portions of it, or elements in it, respectively to God and
          man. In their view the whole of Scripture in all its parts and in all
          its elements, down to the least minutiae, in form of expression as
          well as in substance of teaching, is from God; but the whole of it has
          been given by God through the instrumentality of men. There is,
          therefore, in their view, not, indeed, a human element or ingredient
          in Scripture, and much less human divisions or sections of Scripture,
          but a human side or aspect to Scripture; and they do not fail to give
          full recognition to this human side or aspect. In one of the primary
          passages which has already been before us, their conception is given,
          if somewhat broad and very succinct, yet clear expression. No
          'prophecy,' Peter tells us (2 Pet. i. 21), 'ever came by the will of
          man; but as borne by the Holy Ghost, men spake from God.' Here the
          whole initiative is assigned to God, and such complete control of the
          human agents that the product is truly God's work. The men who speak
          in this "prophecy of scripture" speak not of themselves or out of
          themselves, but from "God": they speak only as they are "borne by the
          Holy Ghost." But it is they, after all, who speak. Scripture is the
          product of man, but only of man speaking from God and under such a
          control of the Holy Spirit as that in their speaking they are "borne"
          by Him. The conception obviously is that the Scriptures have been
          given by the instrumentality of men; and this conception finds
          repeated incidental expression throughout the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this conception, for example, which is expressed when Our Lord,
          quoting Ps. cx., declares of its words that "David himself said in the
          Holy Spirit" (Mk. xii. 36). There is a certain emphasis here on the
          words being David's own words, which is due to the requirements of the
          argument Our Lord was conducting, but which none the less sincerely
          represents Our Lord's conception of their origin. They are David's own
          words which we find in Ps. cx., therefore; but they are David's own
          words, spoken not of his own motion merely, but "in the Holy Spirit,"
          that is to say - we could not better paraphrase it - "as borne by the
          Holy Spirit." In other words, they are "God-breathed" words and
          therefore authoritative in a sense above what any words of David, not
          spoken in the Holy Spirit, could possibly be. Generalizing the matter,
          we may say that the words of Scripture are conceived by Our Lord and
          the New Testament writers as the words of their human authors when
          speaking "in the Holy Spirit," that is to say, by His initiative and
          under His controlling direction. The conception finds even more
          precise expression, perhaps, in such a statement as we find - it is
          Peter who is speaking and it is again a psalm which is cited - in Acts
          i. 16, "The Holy Spirit spake by the mouth of David." Here the Holy
          Spirit is adduced, of course, as the real author of what is said (and
          hence Peter's certainty that what is said will be fulfilled); but
          David's mouth is expressly designated as the instrument (it is the
          instrumental preposition that is used) by means of which the Holy
          Spirit speaks the Scripture in question. He does not speak save
          through David's mouth. Accordingly, in Acts iv. 25, 'the Lord that
          made the heaven and earth,' acting by His Holy Spirit, is declared to
          have spoken another psalm 'through the mouth of . . . David,' His
          "servant"; and in Mt. xiii. 35 still another psalm is adduced as
          "spoken through the prophet" (cf. Mt. ii. 5). In the very act of
          energetically asserting the Divine origin of Scripture the human
          instrumentality through which it is given is constantly recognized.
          The New Testament writers have, therefore, no difficulty in assigning
          Scripture to its human authors, or in discovering in Scripture traits
          due to its human authorship. They freely quote it by such simple
          formulae as these: "Moses saith" (Rom. x. 19); "Moses said" (Mt. xxii.
          24; Mk. vii. 10; Acts iii. 22); "Moses writeth" (Rom. x. 5); "Moses
          wrote" (Mk. xii. 19; Lk. xx. 28); "Isaiah . . . saith" (Rom. x. 20);
          "Isaiah said" (Jn. xii. 39); "Isaiah crieth" (Rom. ix. 27); "Isaiah
          hath said before" (Rom. ix. 29); "said Isaiah the prophet" (Jn. i.
          23); "did Isaiah prophesy" (Mk. vii. 6; Mt. xv. 7); "David saith" (Lk.
          xx. 42; Acts ii. 25; Rom. xi. 9); "David said" (Mk. xii. 36). It is to
          be noted that when thus Scripture is adduced by the names of its human
          authors, it is a matter of complete indifference whether the words
          adduced are comments of these authors or direct words of God recorded
          by them. As the plainest words of the human authors are assigned to
          God as their real author, so the most express words of Gvd, repeated
          by the Scriptural writers, are cited by the names of these human
          writers (Mt. xv. 7; Mk. vii. 6; Rom, x. 5.19.20; cf. Mk. vii. 10 from
          the Decalogue). To say that "Moses" or "David says," is evidently thus
          only a way of saying that "Scripture says," which is the same as to
          say that "God says." Such modes of citing Scripture, accordingly,
          carry us little beyond merely connecting the name, or perhaps we may
          say the individuality, of the several writers with the portions of
          Scripture given through each. How it was given through them is left
          meanwhile, if not without suggestion, yet without specific
          explanation. We seem safe only in inferring this much: that the gift
          of Scripture through its human authors took place by a process much
          more intimate than can be expressed by the term "dictation," and that
          it took place in a process in which the control of the Holy Spirit was
          too complete and pervasive to permit the human qualities of the
          secondary authors in any way to condition the purity of the product as
          the word of God. The Scriptures, in other words, are conceived by the
          writers of the New Testament as through and through God's book, in
          every part expressive of His mind, given through men after a fashion
          which does no violence to their nature as men, and constitutes the
          book also men's book as well as God's, in every part expressive of the
          mind of its human authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we attempt to get behind this broad statement and to obtain a more
          detailed conception of the activities by which God has given the
          Scriptures, we are thrown back upon somewhat general representations,
          supported by the analogy of the modes of God's working in other
          spheres of His operation. It is very desirable that we should free
          ourselves at the outset from influences arising from the current
          employment of the term "inspiration" to designate this process. This
          term is not a Biblical term and its etymological implications are not
          perfectly accordant with the Biblical conception of the modes of the
          Divine operation in giving the Scriptures. The Biblical writers do not
          conceive of the Scriptures as a human product breathed into by the
          Divine Spirit, and thus heightened in its qualities or endowed with
          new qualities; but as a Divine product produced through the
          instrumentality of men. They do not conceive of these men, by whose
          instrumentality Scripture is produced, as working upon their own
          initiative, though energized by God to greater effort and higher
          achievement, but as moved by the Divine initiative and borne by the
          irresistible power of the Spirit of God along ways of His choosing to
          ends of His appointment. The difference between the two conceptions
          may not appear great when the mind is fixed exclusively upon the
          nature of the resulting product. But they are differing conceptions,
          and look at the production of Scripture from distinct points of view -
          the human and the Divine; and the involved mental attitudes toward the
          origin of Scripture are very diverse. The term "inspiration" is too
          firmly fixed, in both theological and popular usage, as the technical
          designation of the action of God in giving the Scriptures, to be
          replaced; and we may be thankful that its native implications lie as
          close as they do to the Biblical conceptions. Meanwhile, however, it
          may be justly insisted that it shall receive its definition from the
          representations of Scripture, and not be permitted to impose upon our
          thought ideas of the origin of Scripture derived from an analysis of
          its own implications, etymological or historical. The Scriptural
          conception of the relation of the Divine Spirit to the human authors
          in the production of Scripture is better expressed by the figure of
          "bearing" than by the figure of "inbreathing"; and when our Biblical
          writers speak of the action of the Spirit of God in this relation as a
          breathing, they represent it as a "breathing out" of the Scriptures by
          the Spirit, and not a "breathing into" the Scriptures by Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          So soon, however, as we seriously endeavor to form for ourselves a
          clear conception of the precise nature of the Divine action in this
          "breathing out" of the Scriptures - this "bearing" of the writers of
          the Scriptures to their appointed goal of the production of a book of
          Divine trustworthiness and indefectible authority - we become acutely
          aware of a more deeply lying and much wider problem, apart from which
          this one of inspiration, technically so called, cannot be profitably
          considered. This is the general problem of the origin of the
          Scriptures and the part of God in all that complex of processes by the
          interaction of which these books, which we call the sacred Scriptures,
          with all their peculiarities, and all their qualities of whatever
          sort, have been brought into being. For, of course, these books were
          not produced suddenly, by some miraculous act - handed down complete
          out of heaven, as the phrase goes; but, like all other products of
          time, are the ultimate effect of many processes cooperating through
          long periods. There is to be considered, for instance, the preparation
          of the material which forms the subject-matter of these books: in a
          sacred history, say, for example, to be narrated; or in a religious
          experience which may serve as a norm for record; or in a logical
          elaboration of the contents of revelation which may be placed at the
          service of God's people; or in the progressive revelation of Divine
          truth itself, supplying their culminating contents. And there is the
          preparation of the men to write these books to be considered, a
          preparation physical, intellectual, spiritual, which must have
          attended them throughout their whole lives, and, indeed, must have had
          its beginning in their remote ancestors, and the effect of which was
          to bring the right men to the right places at the right times, with
          the right endowments, impulses, acquirements, to write just the books
          which were designed for them. When "inspiration," technically so
          called, is superinduced on lines of preparation like these, it takes
          on quite a different aspect from that which it bears when it is
          thought of as an isolated action of the Divine Spirit operating out of
          all relation to historical processes. Representations are sometimes
          made as if, when God wished to produce sacred books which would
          incorporate His will - a series of letters like those of Paul, for
          example - He was reduced to the necessity of going down to earth and
          painfully scrutinizing the men He found there, seeking anxiously for
          the one who, on the whole, promised best for His purpose; and then
          violently forcing the material He wished expressed through him,
          against his natural bent, and with as little loss from his
          recalcitrant characteristics as possible. Of course, nothing of the
          sort took place. If God wished to give His people a series of letters
          like Paul's, He prepared a Paul to write them, and the Paul He brought
          to the task was a Paul who spontaneously would write just such
          letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we bear this in mind, we shall know what estimate to place upon the
          common representation to the effect that the human characteristics of
          the writers must, and in point of fact do, condition and qualify the
          writings produced by them, the implication being that, therefore, we
          cannot get from man a pure word of God. As light that passes through
          the colored glass of a cathedral window, we are told, is light from
          heaven, but is stained by the tints of the glass through which it
          passes; so any word of God which is passed through the mind and soul
          of a man must come out discolored by the personality through which it
          is given, and just to that degree ceases to be the pure word of God.
          But what if this personality has itself been formed by God into
          precisely the personality it is, for the express purpose of
          communicating to the word given through it just the coloring which it
          gives it? What if the colors of the stained-glass window have been
          designed by the architect for the express purpose of giving to the
          light that floods the cathedral precisely the tone and quality it
          receives from them? What if the word of God that comes to His people
          is framed by God into the word of God it is, precisely by means of the
          qualities of the men formed by Him for the purpose, through which it
          is given? When we think of God the Lord giving by His Spirit a body of
          authoritative Scriptures to His people, we must remember that He is
          the God of providence and of grace as well as of revelation and
          inspiration, and that He holds all the lines of preparation as fully
          under His direction as He does the specific operation which we call
          technically, in the narrow sense, by the name of "inspiration." The
          production of the Scriptures is, in point of fact, a long process, in
          the course of which numerous and very varied Divine activities are
          involved, providential, gracious, miraculous, all of which must be
          taken into account in any attempt to explain the relation of God to
          the production of Scripture. When they are all taken into account we
          can no longer wonder that the resultant Scriptures are constantly
          spoken of as the pure word of God. We wonder, rather, that an
          additional operation of God - what we call specifically "inspiration,"
          in its technical sense - was thought necessary. Consider, for example,
          how a piece of sacred history - say the Book of Chronicles, or the
          great historical work, Gospel and Acts, of Luke - is brought to the
          writing. There is first of all the preparation of the history to be
          written: God the Lord leads the sequence of occurrences through the
          development He has designed for them that they may convey their
          lessons to His people: a "teleological" or "aetiological" character is
          inherent in the very course of events. Then He prepares a man, by
          birth, training, experience, gifts of grace, and, if need be, of
          revelation, capable of appreciating this historical development and
          eager to search it out, thrilling in all his being with its lessons
          and bent upon making them clear and effective to others. When, then,
          by His providence, God sets this man to work on the writing of this
          history, will there not be spontaneously written by him the history
          which it was Divinely intended should be written? Or consider how a
          psalmist would be prepared to put into moving verse a piece of
          normative religious experience: how he would be born with just the
          right quality of religious sensibility, of parents through whom he
          should receive just the right hereditary bent, and from whom he should
          get precisely the right religious example and training, in
          circumstances of life in which his religious tendencies should be
          developed precisely on right lines; how he would be brought through
          just the right experiences to quicken in him the precise emotions he
          would be called upon to express, and finally would be placed in
          precisely the exigencies which would call out their expression. Or
          consider the providential preparation of a writer of a didactic
          epistle - by means of which he should be given the intellectual
          breadth and acuteness, and be trained in habitudes of reasoning, and
          placed in the situations which would call out precisely the
          argumentative presentation of Christian truth which was required of
          him. When we give due place in our thoughts to the universality of the
          providential government of God, to the minuteness and completeness of
          its sway, and to its invariable efficacy, we may be inclined to ask
          what is needed beyond this mere providential government to secure the
          production of sacred books which should be in every detail absolutely
          accordant with the Divine will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is, Nothing is needed beyond mere providence to secure such
          books - provided only that it does not lie in the Divine purpose that
          these books should possess qualities which rise above the powers of
          men to produce, even under the most complete Divine guidance. For
          providence is guidance; and guidance can bring one only so far as his
          own power can carry him. If heights are to be scaled above man's
          native power to achieve, then something more than guidance, however
          effective, is necessary. This is the reason for the superinduction, at
          the end of the long process of the production of Scripture, of the
          additional Divine operation which we call technically "inspiration."
          By it, the Spirit of God, flowing confluently in with the
          providentially and graciously determined work of men, spontaneously
          producing under the Divine directions the writings appointed to them,
          gives the product a Divine quality unattainable by human powers alone.
          Thus these books become not merely the word of godly men, but the
          immediate word of God Himself, speaking directly as such to the minds
          and hearts of every reader. The value of "inspiration" emerges, thus,
          as twofold. It gives to the books written under its "bearing" a
          quality which is truly superhuman; a trustworthiness, an authority, a
          searchingness, a profundity, a profitableness which is altogether
          Divine. And it speaks this Divine word immediately to each reader's
          heart and conscience; so that he does not require to make his way to
          God, painfully, perhaps even uncertainly, through the words of His
          servants, the human instruments in writing the Scriptures, but can
          listen directly to the Divine voice itself speaking immediately in the
          Scriptural word to him.

          That the writers of the New Testament themselves conceive the
          Scriptures to have been produced thus by Divine operations extending
          through the increasing ages and involving a multitude of varied
          activities, can be made clear by simply attending to the occasional
          references they make to this or that step in the process. It lies, for
          example, on the face of their expositions, that they looked upon the
          Biblical history as teleological. Not only do they tell us that
          "whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
          learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures
          we might have hope" (Rom. xv. 4; cf. Rom. iv. 23.24); they speak also
          of the course of the historical events themselves as guided for our
          benefit: "Now these things happened unto them by way of example" - in
          a typical fashion, in such a way that, as they occurred, a typical
          character, or predictive reference impressed itself upon them; that is
          to say, briefly, the history occurred as it did in order to bear a
          message to us - "and they were written for our admonition, upon whom
          the ends of the ages are come" (1 Cor. x. 11; cf. ver. 6).
          Accordingly, it has become a commonplace of Biblical exposition that
          "the history of redemption itself is a typically progressive one"
          (Kuper), and is "in a manner impregnated with the prophetic element,"
          so as to form a "part of a great plan which stretches from the fall of
          man to the first consummation of all things in glory; and, in so far
          as it reveals the mind of God toward man, carries a respect to the
          future not less than to the, present" (P. Fairbairn). It lies equally
          on the face of the New Testament allusions to the subject that its
          writers understood that the preparation of men to become vehicles of
          God's message to man was not of yesterday, but had its beginnings in
          the very origin of their being. The call by which Paul, for example,
          was made an apostle of Jesus Christ was sudden and apparently without
          antecedents; but it is precisely this Paul who reckons this call as
          only one step in a long process, the beginnings of which antedated his
          own existence: "But when it was the good pleasure of God, who
          separated me, even from my mother's womb, and called me through his
          grace, to reveal his Son in me" (Gal, i. 15.16; cf. Jer. i. 5; Isa.
          xlix. 1.5). The recognition by the writers of the New Testament of the
          experiences of God's grace, which had been vouchsafed to them as an
          integral element in their fitting to be the bearers of His gospel to
          others, finds such pervasive expression that the only difficulty is to
          select from the mass the most illustrative passages. Such a statement
          as Paul gives in the opening verses of 2 Cor. is thoroughly typical.
          There he represents that he has been afflicted and comforted to the
          end that he might "be able to comfort them that are in any affliction,
          through the comfort wherewith" he had himself been "comforted of God."
          For, he explains, "Whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort
          and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort,
          which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we
          also suffer" (2 Cor. i. 4-6). It is beyond question, therefore, that
          the New Testament writers, when they declare the Scriptures to be the
          product of the Divine breath, and explain this as meaning that the
          writers of these Scriptures wrote them only as borne by the Holy
          Spirit in such a fashion that they spoke, not out of themselves, but
          "from God," are thinking of this operation of the Spirit only as the
          final act of God in the production of the Scriptures, superinduced
          upon a long series of processes, providential, gracious, miraculous,
          by which the matter of Scripture had been prepared for writing, and
          the men for writing it, and the writing of it had been actually
          brought to pass. It is this final act in the production of Scripture
          which is technically called "inspiration"; and inspiration is thus
          brought before us as, in the minds of the writers of the New
          Testament, that particular operation of God in the production of
          Scripture which takes effect at the very point of the writing of
          Scripture - understanding the term "writing" here as inclusive of all
          the processes of the actual composition of Scripture, the
          investigation of documents, the collection of facts, the excogitation
          of conclusions, the adaptation of exhortations as means to ends and
          the like - with the effect of giving to the resultant Scripture a
          specifically supernatural character, and constituting it a Divine, as
          well as human, book. Obviously the mode of operation of this Divine
          activity moving to this result is conceived, in full accord with the
          analogy of the Divine operations in other spheres of its activity, in
          providence and in grace alike, as confluent with the human activities
          operative in the case; as, in a word, of the nature of what has come
          to be known as "immanent action."
        </p>
        <p>
          It will not escape observation that thus "inspiration" is made a mode
          of "revelation." We are often exhorted, to be sure, to distinguish
          sharply between "inspiration" and "revelation"; and the exhortation is
          just when "revelation" is taken in one of its narrower senses, of,
          say, an external manifestation of God, or of an immediate
          communication from God in words. But "inspiration" does not differ
          from "revelation" in these narrowed senses as genus from genus, but as
          a species of one genus differs from another. That operation of God
          which we call "inspiration," that is to say, that operation of the
          Spirit of God by which He "bears" men in the process of composing
          Scripture, so that they write, not of themselves, but "from God," is
          one of the modes in which God makes known to men His being, His will,
          His operations, His purposes. It is as distinctly a mode of revelation
          as any mode of revelation can be, and therefore it performs the same
          office which all revelation performs, that is to say, in the express
          words of Paul, it makes men wise, and makes them wise unto salvation.
          All "special " or "supernatural" revelation (which is redemptive in
          its very idea, and occupies a place as a substantial element in God's
          redemptive processes) has precisely this for its end; and Scripture,
          as a mode of the redemptive revelation of God, finds its fundamental
          purpose just in this: if the "inspiration" by which Scripture is
          produced renders it trustworthy and authoritative, it renders it
          trustworthy and authoritative only that it may the better serve to
          make men wise unto salvation. Scripture is conceived, from the point
          of view of the writers of the New Testament, not merely as the record
          of revelations, but as itself a part of the redemptive revelation of
          God; not merely as the record of the redemptive acts by which God is
          saving the world, but as itself one of these redemptive acts, having
          its own part to play in the great work of establishing and building up
          the kingdom of God. What gives it a place among the redemptive acts of
          God is its Divine origination, taken in its widest sense, as inclusive
          of all the Divine operations, providential, gracious and expressly
          supernatural, by which it has been made just what it is - a body of
          writings able to make wise unto salvation, and profitable for making
          the man of God perfect. What gives it its place among the modes of
          revelation is, however, specifically the culminating one of these
          Divine operations, which we call "Inspiration": that is to say, the
          action of the Spirit of God in so "bearing" its human authors in their
          work of producing Scripture, as that in these Scriptures they speak,
          not out of themselves, but "from God." It is this act by virtue of
          which the Scriptures may properly be called "God-breathed."
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been customary among a certain school of writers to speak of
          the Scriptures, because thus "inspired," as a Divine-human book, and
          to appeal to the analogy of Our Lord's Divine-human personality to
          explain their peculiar qualities as such. The expression calls
          attention to an important fact, and the analogy holds good a certain
          distance. There are human and Divine sides to Scripture, and, as we
          cursorily examine it, we may perceive in it, alternately, traits which
          suggest now the one, now the other factor in its origin. But the
          analogy with Our Lord's Divine-human personality may easily be pressed
          beyond reason. There is no hypostatic union between the Divine and the
          human in Scripture; we cannot parallel the "inscripturation" of the
          Holy Spirit and the incarnation of the Son of God. The Scriptures are
          merely the product of Divine and human forces working together to
          produce a product in the production of which the human forces work
          under the initiation and prevalent direction of the Divine: the person
          of Our Lord unites in itself Divine and human natures, each of which
          retains its distinctness while operating only in relation to the
          other. Between such diverse things there can exist only a remote
          analogy; and, in point of fact, the analogy in the present instance
          amounts to no more than that in both cases Divine and human factors
          are involved, though very differently. In the one they unite to
          constitute a Divine-human person, in the other they cooperate to
          perform a Divine-human work. Even so distant an analogy may enable us,
          however, to recognize that, as, in the case of Our Lord's person, the
          human nature remains truly human while yet it can never fall into sin
          or error because it can never act out of relation with the Divine
          nature into conjunction with which it has been brought; so in the case
          of the production of Scripture by the conjoint action of human and
          Divine factors, the human factors have acted as human factors, and
          have left their mark on the product as such, and yet cannot have
          fallen into that error which we say it is human to fall into, because
          they have not acted apart from the Divine factors, by themselves, but
          only under their unerring guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament testimony is to the Divine origin and qualities of
          "Scripture"; and "Scripture" to the writers of the New Testament was
          fundamentally, of course, the Old Testament. In the primary passage,
          in which we are told that "every" or "all Scripture" is
          "God-breathed," the direct reference is to the "sacred writings" which
          Timothy had had in knowledge since his infancy, and these were, of
          course, just the sacred books of the Jews (2 Tim. iii. 16). What is
          explicit here is implicit in all the allusions to inspired Scriptures
          in the New Testament. Accordingly, it is frequently said that our
          entire testimony to the inspiration of Scripture concerns the Old
          Testament alone. In many ways, however, this is overstated. Our
          present concern is not with the extent of "Scripture" but with the
          nature of "Scripture"; and we cannot present here the considerations
          which justify extending to the New Testament the inspiration which the
          New Testament writers attribute to the Old Testament. It will not be
          out of place, however, to point out simply that the New Testament
          writers obviously themselves made this extension. They do not for an
          instant imagine themselves, as ministers of a new covenant, less in
          possession of the Spirit of God than the ministers of the old
          covenant: they freely recognize, indeed, that they have no sufficiency
          of themselves, but they know that God has made them sufficient (2 Cor.
          iii. 5.6). They prosecute their work of proclaiming the gospel,
          therefore, in full confidence that they speak "by the Holy Spirit" (1
          Pet. i. 12), to whom they attribute both the matter and form of their
          teaching (1 Cor. ii. 13). They, therefore, speak with the utmost
          assurance of their teaching (Gal. i. 7.8); and they issue commands
          with the completest authority (1 Thess. iv. 2.14; 2 Thess. iii. 6.12),
          making it, indeed, the test of whether one has the Spirit that he
          should recognize what they demand as commandments of God (1 Cor. xiv.
          37). It would be strange, indeed, if these high claims were made for
          their oral teaching and commandments exclusively. In point of fact,
          they are made explicitly also for their written injunctions. It was
          "the things" which Paul was "writing," the recognition of which as
          commands of the Lord, he makes the test of a Spirit-led man (1 Cor.
          xiv. 37). It is his "word by this epistle," obedience to which he
          makes the condition of Christian communion (2 Thess. iii. 14). There
          seems involved in such an attitude toward their own teaching, oral and
          written, a claim on the part of the New Testament writers to something
          very much like the "inspiration" which they attribute to the writers
          of the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all doubt is dispelled when we observe the New Testament writers
          placing the writings of one another in the same category of
          "Scripture" with the books of the Old Testament. The same Paul who, in
          2 Tim. iii. 16, declared that 'every' or 'all scripture is
          Godbreathed' had already written in 1 Tim. v. 18: "For the scripture
          saith, Thou shall not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.
          And, The laborer is worthy of his hire." The first clause here is
          derived from Deuteronomy and the second from the Gospel of Luke,
          though both are cited as together constituting, or better, forming
          part of the "Scripture" which Paul adduces as so authoritative as by
          its mere citation to end all strife. Who shall say that, in the
          declaration of the later epistle that "all" or "every" Scripture is
          Godbreathed, Paul did not have Luke, and, along with Luke, whatever
          other new books he classed with the old under the name of Scripture,
          in the back of his mind, along with those old books which Timothy had
          had in his hands from infancy? And the same Peter who declared that
          every "prophecy of scripture" was the product of men who spoke "from
          God," being 'borne' by the Holy Ghost (2 Pet. i. 21), in this same
          epistle (iii. 16), places Paul's Epistles in the category of Scripture
          along with whatever other books deserve that name. For Paul, says he,
          wrote these epistles, not out of his own wisdom, but "according to the
          wisdom given to him," and though there are some things in them hard to
          be understood, yet it is only "the ignorant and unstedfast" who wrest
          these difficult passages - as what else could be expected of men who
          wrest "also the other Scriptures" (obviously the Old Testament is
          meant) -"unto their own destruction" ? Is it possible to say that
          Peter could not have had these epistles of Paul also lurking somewhere
          in the back of his mind, along with "the other scriptures," when he
          told his readers that every "prophecy of scripture" owes its origin to
          the prevailing operation of the Holy Ghost? What must be understood in
          estimating the testimony of the New Testament writers to the
          inspiration of Scripture is that "Scripture" stood in their minds as
          the title of a unitary body of books, throughout the gift of God
          through His Spirit to His people; but that this body of writings was
          at the same time understood to be a growing aggregate, so that what is
          said of it applies to the new books which were being added to it as
          the Spirit gave them, as fully as to the old books which had come down
          to them from their hoary past. It is a mere matter of detail to
          determine precisely what new books were thus included by them in the
          category "Scripture." They tell us some of them themselves. Those who
          received them from their hands tell us of others. And when we put the
          two bodies of testimony together we find that they constitute just our
          New Testament. It is no pressure of the witness of the writers of the
          New Testament to the inspiration of the Scripture, therefore, to look
          upon it as covering the entire body of "Scriptures," the new books
          which they were themselves adding to this aggregate, as well as the
          old books which they had received as Scripture from the fathers.
          Whatever can lay claim by just right to the appellation of
          "Scripture," as employed in its eminent sense by those writers, can by
          the same just right lay claim to the "inspiration" which they ascribe
          to this Scripture."
