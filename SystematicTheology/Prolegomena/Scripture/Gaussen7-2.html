        <h2>II. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          It follows from all we have said, that there are in the Christian
          world but two schools, or two religions: that which puts the Bible
          above every thing, and that which puts something above the Bible. The
          former was evidently that of Jesus Christ; the latter has been that of
          the rationalists of all denominations and of all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motto of the former is this: The whole written Word is inspired by
          God, even to a single jot and tittle; the Scripture cannot be
          destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motto of the second is this: There are human judges lawfully
          entitled to pass judgment on the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of putting the Bible above all, it is, on the contrary, either
          science, or reason, or human tradition, or some new inspiration, which
          it places above that book. Hence all rationalisms; hence all false
          religions.
        </p>
        <p>
          They (profess to) correct the Word of God, or (to) complete it; they
          contradict it, or they interdict it; they make it be read without
          reverence by their pupils, or they prohibit the reading of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those rationalists, for example, who, at the present day, profess
          Judaism, place above the Bible, if not their own reason, that at least
          of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries; that is to say, the human
          traditions of their Targums, the Mischna, and the Gemara of their two
          enormous Talmuds. That is their Alkoran: under its weight, they have
          smothered the law and the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those rationalists who profess the Roman religion, will, in their
          turn, subject the Bible, not to their own reason, but, first, to the
          reason of the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries,
          which they call tradition, (that is to say, the reason of Dionysius
          the Little, Hincmar, Radbert, Lanfranc, Damascenus, Anastasius
          Bibliothecarius, Burkardt, Ives of Chartres, Gratian, Isidore
          Mercator); and next, to that of a priest, ordinarily an Italian, whom
          they call Pope, and whom they declare to be infallible in the
          definition of matters of faith. Does the Bible require the adoration
          of the virgin, the service of angels, payment for pardons, the
          worshipping of images, auricular confession to a priest, forbidding to
          marry, forbidding the use of meats, praying in a foreign tongue,
          interdicting the Scriptures to the people, and that there should be a
          sovereign pontiff? And when it speaks of a future Rome,2 is it
          otherwise (all the first fathers of the church are agreed about this)
          than by pointing to it as the seat of the Man of Sin; as the centre of
          a vast apostasy; as a Babylon, drunk with the blood of the saints and
          the witnesses of Jesus Christ, which made all the nations to drink of
          the wine of the fury of her fornication; as the mother of fornications
          and abominations of the earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          Those rationalists that profess an impure Protestantism, and who
          reject the doctrines of the Reformation, will put above the Bible, if
          not the reason of Socinus and Priestley, or of Eichhorn and Paulus, or
          of Strauss and Hegel, at least their own. There is a mixture, they
          will tell you, in the Word of God. They sift it, they correct it; and
          it is with the Bible in their hand that they come to tell you: There
          is no divinity in Christ, no resurrection of the body, no Holy Ghost,
          no devil, no demons, no hell, no expiation in the death of Jesus
          Christ, no native corruption in man, no eternity in punishments, no
          miracles in facts, (what do I say even?) no reality in Jesus Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          Those rationalists, in fine, who profess Mysticism (the Illuminati,
          the Shakers, the Paracelsists, the Bourignonists, the Labadists, the
          BÅ“hmists) will put above the text (of the Bible) their own
          hallucinations, their inward word, their revelations, and the Christ
          who (they say) is within them. They will speak with disdain of the
          letter, of the literal meaning, of the gospel facts, of the man Jesus,
          or of the outward Christ (as they call him), of the cross of Golgotha,
          of preaching, of worship, of the sacraments. They are above all these
          carnal helps! Hence their dislike for the doctrine of God's judiciary
          righteousness, of the reality of sin, of the divine wrath against
          evil, of grace, of election, of satisfaction, of Christ's imputed
          righteousness, of the punishments to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disciples of the Saviour, hearken to what he says in his Word: there
          it is that he speaks to us; there is our reason, there our
          inspiration, there our tradition. It is the lamp for our feet.
          "Sanctify me by thy truth, O Lord, thy word is truth!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Let our reason, then, put forth all its energies, under the eye of
          God, first, in order to recognize the Scriptures as being from him,
          and then to study them. Let it every day turn more closely to these
          divine oracles, in order to correct itself by them, not to correct
          them by it; there to seek for God's meaning, not to put our own in its
          place; to present itself before their holy utterances as a meek and
          teachable handmaiden, not as a noisy and conceited sybil. Let its
          daily prayer, amid the night that surrounds it, be that of the infant
          Samuel, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth!" "The law of the Lord
          is perfect; the words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried in a
          furnace of earth, purified seven times."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, on the other hand, let us seek the Holy Spirit; "let us have the
          unction of the Holy One;" let us be baptized with it. It is the Spirit
          alone that will lead us into the whole truth of the Scriptures; which
          will by them shed the love of God abroad in our hearts, and will
          witness with our spirits that we are the children of God; by applying
          to us their promises, by giving us in these the earnest of our
          inheritance, and the pledges of his adoption. In vain should we bear
          in our hands, during eighteen hundred years, the holy Scriptures, as
          the Jews still do: without that Spirit we should never comprehend in
          them the things of the Spirit of God: "They would appear to us
          foolishness, because the natural man receives them not, and even
          cannot do so, seeing that they are spiritually discerned." But at the
          same time, while we ever distinguish the Spirit from the letter, let
          us beware of ever separating them. Let it always be before the Word,
          in the Word, and by the Word, that we seek this divine Spirit. It is
          by it that he acts; by it that he enlightens and affects; by it that
          he casts down and raises up. His constant work is to make it
          understood by our souls, to apply it to them, and to make them love
          it.
        </p>
        <p>The Bible, then, is in all its parts from God.</p>
        <p>
          Still, no doubt, we shall have to meet with many passages of which we
          shall fail to perceive either the use or the beauty; but the light of
          the last day will erelong bring out their now hidden radiance. And as
          in the case of those deep crystalline caves, into which torches have
          been brought, after having been long consigned to darkness, the
          dawning of the day of Jesus Christ, bathing all things in a flood of
          light, will pierce into every part of the Scriptures, revealing every
          where gems unseen till then, and causing them to dazzle us with
          innumerable splendours. Then will the beauty, the wisdom, the
          proportions, the harmony of all their revelations be manifested; and
          the prospect will fill the elect with ravishing admiration, with ever
          fresh raptures, with unutterable joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this respect, the history of the past ought to lead us to
          anticipate that of the future; and we may judge, from what has already
          taken place, of the flood of light which we may look to see poured
          upon the Scriptures at the second coming of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold what beams of living light were at once diffused over all parts
          of the Old Testament, at the first advent of the Son of God; and from
          this sole fact try to form an idea of what will be the splendour of
          both Testaments, at his second appearance. Then will God's plan be
          consummated, then will our Lord and our King, "fairer than any of the
          sons of men," be revealed from heaven, up borne on the word of truth,
          meekness, and righteousness; then shall his brightness fill the hearts
          of the redeemed; and the awful grandeur of the work of redemption
          burst in all its glory on the contemplation of the children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark how many chapters of Scripture, even as early as the age of
          Jeremiah, or later, during the long reign of the Maccabees, and during
          the whole time that the second temple lasted, from Malachi to John the
          Baptist; mark, we say, how many chapters of the Scripture, now radiant
          for us with the divinest lustre, must have then appeared vapid and
          meaningless to rationalistic men in the ancient synagogue. How
          childish, commonplace, senseless, and useless must have seemed to them
          so many verses and so many chapters that now nourish our faith, that
          fill us with wonder at the majestic unity of the Scriptures, that
          compel us to weep, and that have ere now led so many weary and
          heavy-laden souls to the feet of Jesus Christ! What would people say
          then of the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah?â€” Doubtless, with the
          Ethiopian of Queen Candace:â€”"How can I understand except some man
          should guide me? Of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or
          some other man?" What purpose seems likely to be served by this
          mysterious history of Melchizedec? Why these long details about the
          tabernacle, Aaron's garments, things clean and unclean, worship, and
          sacrifices? What meaning could there be in the wordsâ€”"Neither shall ye
          break a bone thereof?" What meaning could be attached to the
          twenty-second, sixty-ninth, and so many other psalms:â€”"My God, my God,
          why hast thou forsaken me?" "They have pierced my hands and my feet."
          Why (they must have thought) does David occupy himself at such length,
          in his psalms, with the common incidents of his adventurous life? When
          was it, besides, that they parted his garments among them, and cast
          lots on his vesture? What mean those wordsâ€”"All they that see me shake
          the head, saying, He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him;
          let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him?" What, then, is that
          vinegar, and what is the meaning of the gallâ€”"They gave me also gall
          for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink?" And
          those exaggerated and inexplicable wordsâ€”"I hid not my face from shame
          and spitting; they smote me on the cheek, and the ploughers ploughed
          my back?" And what would the prophet mean â€”"Behold, a virgin shall be
          with child?" Who, again, is that king, lowly, and mounted on an
          ass:â€”"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; behold, thy King cometh
          unto thee. He is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an
          ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass?" What, then, is that
          sepultureâ€”"And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
          his death?"
        </p>
        <p>
          How must all these expressions, and many others of a like kind, have
          appeared strange, and little worthy of the Lord, to the presumptuous
          scribes of those remote times! What humanity, would they have said,
          what individuality, what occasionally (to put into the mouths of those
          men of ancient times the language of the present day)! They were
          taught, no doubt, in their academies, at that time, learned systems
          and long conjectural speculations on the conjunctures in which the
          prophets were placed when writing such details, and no more would be
          seen in their words than the ordinary impress of the entirely personal
          circumstances which had given rise to their emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what, then, was done by the true disciples of the Word of life?
          How did ye act, Hezekiah, Daniel, Josiah, Nehemiah, Ezraâ€”our brethren
          in the same hope and in the same faith? and ye, too, holy women, who
          hoped in God, and waited for the consolation of Israel? Ah! ye bowed
          with respect over all those depths, as the angels of light still do;
          and desiring to see them to the bottom, ye waited! Yes, they waited!
          They knew that in what was the most insignificant passage in their
          eyes, there might be, as was said by one of the church fathers,
          "mountains of doctrine." Thus it was that in "searching (as Peter has
          said) what the Spirit of Christ, which was in the prophets, did
          signify, when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and
          the glory that should follow," they never doubted that afterwards,
          when time and events should have passed their hand over this
          sympathetic ink, there would come forth from it wondrous pages, all
          bearing the stamp of divinity, and all full of the gospel. The day was
          to come, after the first appearance of the Messiah, when the least in
          the kingdom of God would be greater than the greatest of the prophets;
          and that day has arrived. But we ourselves know, also, that the day is
          yet to come, after his second appearance, when the least among the
          redeemed shall be greater in knowledge than ever were the Augustines,
          the Calvins, the Jonathan Edwardses, the Pascals, and the Leightons;
          for then the ears of children will hear, and their eyes will see,
          "things which the apostles themselves desired to see and did not see,
          and to hear and did not hear."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, what doctors, prophets, and saints used to do with
          passages that were still obscure to them, and now luminous to us, we
          will do with passages that are still obscure to us, but which will
          erelong be luminous to the heirs of life, when all the prophecies will
          be accomplished, and when Jesus Christ will appear in the clouds, in
          the last epiphany of his glorious advent.
        </p>
        <p>
          What lustre, as soon as it has been perceived, have we not seen shed
          on many a passage, many a psalm, many a prophecy, many a type, many a
          description, the profound beauty of which had until then passed
          unobserved! What a wondrous gospel has there not emanated from them!
          what appeals to the conscience! what a display of the love shown in
          redemption! Let us wait, then, for analogous revelations, but much
          more glorious still, on the day when our Master shall descend again
          from the heavens; "for in the Scriptures," says IrenÃ¦us, "there are
          some difficulties which even at present we can resolve by the grace of
          God; but there are others which we leave to him, not only for this age
          but for the age which is to come, in order that God may perpetually
          teach, and man also perpetually learn from God the things that are
          God's."
        </p>
        <p>
          If the lights of grace have eclipsed those of nature, how shall the
          lights of glory, in their turn, eclipse those of grace? How many stars
          of the first magnitude, as yet unseen by us, shall, at the approach of
          that great day, be kindled in the firmament of the Scriptures? and
          when, at last, it shall have arisen without a cloud over the ransomed
          world, what harmonies, what celestial tints, what new glories, what
          unlooked-for splendours, shall burst upon the heirs of eternal life!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then will be seen the meaning of many a prophecy, many a fact, and
          many a lesson, the divinity of which, as yet, reveals itself only in
          detached traits; but the evangelical beauties of which will shine
          forth from every part of them. Then will be known the entire bearing
          of those parables, even now so solemnizing,â€”of the fig tree, of the
          master returning from a far country, of the bridegroom and the bride,
          of the net drawn to the shore of eternity, of Lazarus, of the invited
          to the feast, of the talents, of the vine dressers, of the virgins, of
          the marriage feast. Then will there be known all the glory involved in
          such expressions as the following:â€”"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit
          thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." "Thy
          people, O Lord, shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
          beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew
          of thy youth." "He shall strike through kings in the day of his
          wrath." "He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he
          lift up the head."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, also, shall our eyes behold, in all his glory, Jesus Christ, the
          Saviour, the Comforter, and the Friend of the wretched, our Lord and
          our God! He that liveth and was dead, and is alive for evermore! Then
          all the science of the heavens will be summed up in him. This was ever
          all the science of the Holy Ghost, who cometh down from heaven; it was
          all the science of the Scriptures, for the testimony of Jesus is the
          spirit of prophecy. It is even now all the life of the saints; "their
          life eternal is to know him!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The celebrated traveller, who first brought to us from Constantinople
          the only horse-chestnut that the West had ever seen, and who planted
          it, they say, in the court of his mansion-house, could he have told
          all that he held in his hand, and all that was to come forth from
          it?â€”The infinite in the finite! forests innumerable in a humble nut,
          and within its insignificant shell trees in thousands, adorning with
          their majestic foliage and bunches of flowers our gardens and
          shrubberies, darkening with their shade our public squares, and the
          terraces and avenues of our cities; people celebrating their national
          festivals under their ample bowers; our children playing at their
          feet, and the house sparrow twittering to its mate in their branches;
          whilst each of those trees will itself produce, year after year,
          thousands of nuts similar to that from which it sprung, and all
          likewise bearing in them the imbedded germs of countless forests in
          countless generations!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the Christian traveller, on passing from the church militant into
          his heavenly country, into the city of his God, to his Father's house,
          with one of the thousand passages of the Holy Bible in his hands,
          knows that in that he brings the infinite in the finiteâ€”a germ from
          God, of the developments and the glory of which he may doubtless even
          now have a glimpse, but all the grandeurs of which he cannot yet tell.
          Possibly it may be the smallest of seeds; but he knows that there is
          to come forth from it a mighty tree, an eternal tree, under the
          branches of which the inhabitants of heaven will take shelter. As to
          many of these passages he can as yet, perhaps, see no more than their
          germ lying within a rough shell; but he knows, at the same time, that
          once admitted to the Jerusalem that is from above, under the bright
          effulgence of the Sun of Righteousness, he will see beaming in those
          words of wisdom, on their being brought to the light of which the Lamb
          is the everlasting source, splendours now latent, and still enclosed
          in their first envelopment. Then it is that in an ineffable melting of
          the heart with gratitude and felicity, he will discover agreements,
          harmonies, and glories, which here below he but dimly saw or waited to
          see with lowly reverence. Prepared in God's eternal counsels before
          the foundation of the world, and enclosed as germs in his Word of
          life, they will burst forth under that new heaven, and for that new
          earth wherein will dwell righteousness.
