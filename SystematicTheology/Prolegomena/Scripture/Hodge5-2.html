        <p>V. Roman Catholic Doctrine Concerning the Rule of Faith:</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          § 2.
          <b>Roman Catholic Doctrine concerning the Scriptures</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          On this subject Romanists agree with Protestants, (1.) In teaching the
          plenary inspiration and consequent infallible authority of the sacred
          writings. Of these writings the Council of Trent says that God is
          their author, and that they were written by the dictation of the Holy
          Spirit ("Spiritu sancto dictante"). (2.) They agree with us in
          receiving into the sacred canon all the books which we regard as of
          divine authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romanists differ from Protestants in regard to the Scriptures,—1. In
          receiving into the canon certain books which Protestants do not admit
          to be inspired, namely: Tobit, Judith, Sirach, parts of Esther, the
          Wisdom of Solomon, First, Second, and Third Books of the Maccabees
          (the Third Book of Maccabees, however, is not included in the
          Vulgate), Baruch, the Hymn of the Three Children, Susanna, and Bel and
          the Dragon. These books are not all included by name in the list given
          by the Council of Trent. Several of them are parts of the books there
          enumerated. Thus, the Hymn of the Three Children, Susanna, and Bel and
          the Dragon, appear as parts of the book of Daniel. Some modern
          theologians of the Romish Church refer all the apocryphal books to
          what they call "The Second Canon," and admit that they are not of
          equal authority with those belonging to the First Canon. The Council
          of Trent, however, makes no such distinction. Incompleteness of the
          Scriptures
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A second point of difference is that Romanists deny, and
          Protestants affirm, the completeness of the sacred Scriptures. That
          is, Protestants maintain that all the extant supernatural revelations
          of God, which constitute the rule of faith to his Church, are
          contained in his written word. Romanists, on the other hand, hold that
          some doctrines which all Christians are bound to believe, are only
          imperfectly revealed in the Scriptures; that others are only obscurely
          intimated; and that others are not therein contained at all. The
          Preface to the Romish Catechism (Quest. 12) says, "Omnis doctrinæ
          ratio, quæ fidelibus tradenda sit, verbo Dei continetur, quod in
          scripturam traditionesque distributum est." Bellarmin says expressly,
          "Nos asserimus, in Scripturis non contineri expressè totam doctrinam
          necessariam, sive de fide sive de moribus: et proinde praeter verbum
          Dei scriptum requiri etiam verbum Dei nonscriptum, i.e., divinas et
          apostolicas traditiones." On this point the Romish theologians are of
          one mind; but what the doctrines are, which are thus imperfectly
          revealed in the Scriptures, or merely implied, or entirely omitted,
          has never been authoritatively decided by the Church of Rome. The
          theologians of that Church, with more or less unanimity, refer to one
          or the other of these classes the following doctrines: (1.) The canon
          of Scripture. (2.) The inspiration of the sacred writers. (3.) The
          full doctrine of the Trinity. (4.) The personality and divinity of the
          Holy Spirit. (5.) Infant baptism. (6.) The observance of Sunday as the
          Christian Sabbath. (7.) The threefold orders of the ministry. (8.) The
          government of the Church by bishops. (9.) The perpetuity of the
          apostleship. (10.) The grace of orders. (11.) The sacrificial nature
          of the Eucharist. (12.) The seven sacraments. (13.) Purgatory. It lies
          in the interests of the advocates of tradition to depreciate the
          Scriptures, and to show how much the Church would lose if she had no
          other source of knowledge of divine truth but the written word. On
          this subject the author of No. 85 of the Oxford Tracts, when speaking
          even of essential doctrines, says, "It is a near thing that they are
          in the Scriptures at all. The wonder is that they are all there.
          Humanly judging they would not be there but for God's interposition;
          and, therefore, since they are there by a sort of accident, it is not
          strange they shall be but latent there, and only indirectly producible
          thence." "The gospel doctrine," says the same writer, "is but
          indirectly and covertly recorded in Scripture under the surface."
        </p>
        <p>
          Tradition is always represented by Romanists as not only the
          interpreter, but the complement of the Scriptures. The Bible,
          therefore, is, according to the Church of Rome, incomplete. It does
          not contain all the Church is bound to believe; nor are the doctrines
          which it does contain therein fully or clearly made known. Obscurity
          of the Scriptures
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third point of difference between Romanists and Protestants
          relates to the perspicuity of Scripture, and the right of private
          judgment. Protestants hold that the Bible, being addressed to the
          people, is sufficiently perspicuous to be understood by them, under
          the guidance of the Holy Spirit; and that they are entitled and bound
          to search the Scripture, and to judge for themselves what is its true
          meaning. Romanists, on the other hand, teach that the Scriptures are
          so obscure that they need a visible, present, and infallible
          interpreter; and that the people, being incompetent to understand
          them, are bound to believe whatever doctrines the Church, through its
          official organs, declares to be true and divine. On this subject the
          Council of Trent (Sess. 4), says: "Ad cöercenda petulantia ingenia
          decernit (Synodus), ut nemo, suæ prudentiæ innixus, in rebus fidei et
          morum ad ædificationem doctrinæ Christianæ pertinentium, Sacram
          Scripturam ad suas sensus contorquens contra eum sensum, quern tenuit
          et tenet sancta mater Ecclesia, cujus est judicare de vero sensu et
          interpretatione Scripturarum Sanctarum, aut etiam contra unanimem
          consensum patrum ipsam scripturam sacram interpretari audeat, etiamsi
          hujus modi interpretationes nullo unquam tempore in lucem edendæ
          forent. Qui contravenerint, per ordinarios declarentur et pœnis a jure
          statutis puniantur." Bellarmin says: "Non ignorabat Deus multas in
          Ecclesia exorituras difficultates circa fidem, debuit igitur judicem
          aliquem Ecclesiæ providere. At iste judex non potest esse Scriptura,
          neque Spiritus revelans privatus, neque princeps secularis, igitur
          princeps ecclesiasticus vel solus vel certe cum consilio et consensu
          coepiscoporum."
        </p>
        <p>
          From this view of the obscurity of Scripture it follows that the use
          of the sacred volume by the people, is discountenanced by the Church
          of Rome, although its use has never been prohibited by any General
          Council. Such prohibitions, however, have repeatedly been issued by
          the Popes; as by Gregory VII., Innocent III., Clemens XI., and Pius
          IV., who made the liberty to read any vernacular version of the
          Scriptures, dependent on the permission of the priest. There have
          been, however, many Romish prelates and theologians who encouraged the
          general reading of the Bible. The spirit of the Latin Church and the
          effects of its teaching, are painfully manifested by the fact that the
          Scriptures are practically inaccessible to the mass of the people in
          strictly Roman Catholic countries.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin Vulgate</p>
        <p>
          4. The fourth point of difference concerns the authority due to the
          Latin Vulgate. On this subject the Council of Trent (Sess. 4), says:
          "Synodus considerans non parum utilitatis accedere posse Ecclesiæ Dei,
          si ex omnibus Latinis editionibus quæ circumferentur, sacrorum
          librorum, quænam pro authentica habenda sit, innotescat: statuit et
          declarat, ut hæc ipsa vetus et vulgata editio, quæ longo tot seculorum
          usu in ipsa Ecclesia probata est, in publicis lectionibus,
          disputationibus, prædicationibus et expositionibus pro authentica
          habeatur et nemo illam rejicere quovis prætextu audeat vel præsumat."
          The meaning of this decree is a matter of dispute among Romanists
          themselves. Some of the more modern and liberal of their theologians
          say that the Council simply intended to determine which among several
          Latin versions was to be used in the service of the Church. They
          contend that it was not meant to forbid appeal to the original
          Scriptures, or to place the Vulgate on a par with them in authority.
          The earlier and stricter Romanists take the ground that the Synod did
          intend to forbid an appeal to the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, and to
          make the Vulgate the ultimate authority. The language of the Council
          seems to favor this interpretation. The Vulgate was to be used not
          only for the ordinary purposes of public instruction, but in all
          theological discussions, and in all works of exegesis.
