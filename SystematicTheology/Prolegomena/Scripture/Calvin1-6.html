        <h2>
          Chapter VI. The Guidance And Teaching Of The Scripture Necessary To
          Lead To The Knowledge Of God The Creator
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. God gives his elect a better help to the knowledge of himself,
          viz., the Holy Scriptures. This he did from the very first.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. First, By oracles and visions, and the ministry of the Patriarchs.
          Secondly, By the promulgation of the Law, and the preaching of the
          Prophets. Why the doctrines of religion are committed to writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This view confirmed, (1) By the depravity of our nature making it
          necessary in every one who would know God to have recourse to the
          word; (2) From those passages of the Psalms in which God is introduced
          as reigning.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Another confirmation from certain direct statements in the Psalms.
          Lastly, From the words of our Saviour.
        </p>

        <h2>
          1.God bestows the actual knowledge of himself upon us only in the
          Scriptures
        </h2>
        <p>
          Therefore, though the effulgence which is presented to every eye, both
          in the heavens and on the earth, leaves the ingratitude of man without
          excuse, since God, in order to bring the whole human race under the
          same condemnation, holds forth to all, without exception, a mirror of
          his Deity in his works, another and better help must be given to guide
          us properly to God as a Creator. Not in vain, therefore, has he added
          the light of his Word in order that he might make himself known unto
          salvation, and bestowed the privilege on those whom he was pleased to
          bring into nearer and more familiar relation to himself. For, seeing
          how the minds of men were carried to and fro, and found no certain
          resting-place, he chose the Jews for a peculiar people, and then
          hedged them in that they might not, like others, go astray. And not in
          vain does he, by the same means, retain us in his knowledge, since but
          for this, even those who, in comparison of others, seem to stand
          strong, would quickly fall away. For as the aged, or those whose sight
          is defective, when any books however fair, is set before them, though
          they perceive that there is something written are scarcely able to
          make out two consecutive words, but, when aided by glasses, begin to
          read distinctly, so Scripture, gathering together the impressions of
          Deity, which, till then, lay confused in our minds, dissipates the
          darkness, and shows us the true God clearly. God therefore bestows a
          gift of singular value, when, for the instruction of the Church, he
          employs not dumb teachers merely, but opens his own sacred mouth; when
          he not only proclaims that some God must be worshipped, but at the
          same time declares that He is the God to whom worship is due; when he
          not only teaches his elect to have respect to God, but manifests
          himself as the God to whom this respect should be paid.
        </p>
        <h2>(Two sorts of knowledge of God in Scripture)</h2>
        <p>
          The course which God followed towards his Church from the very first,
          was to supplement these common proofs by the addition of his Word, as
          a surer and more direct means of discovering himself. And there can be
          no doubt that it was by this help, Adam, Noah, Abraham, and the other
          patriarchs, attained to that familiar knowledge which, in a manner,
          distinguished them from unbelievers. I am not now speaking of the
          peculiar doctrines of faith by which they were elevated to the hope of
          eternal blessedness. It was necessary, in passing from death unto
          life, that they should know God, not only as a Creator, but as a
          Redeemer also; and both kinds of knowledge they certainly did obtain
          from the Word. In point of order, however, the knowledge first given
          was that which made them acquainted with the God by whom the world was
          made and is governed. To this first knowledge was afterwards added the
          more intimate knowledge which alone quickens dead souls, and by which
          God is known not only as the Creator of the worlds and the sole author
          and disposer of all events, but also as a Redeemer, in the person of
          the Mediator. But as the fall and the corruption of nature have not
          yet been considered, I now postpone the consideration of the remedy,
          (for which, see Book 2 c. 6 &c.) Let the reader then remember, that I
          am not now treating of the covenant by which God adopted the children
          of Abraham, or of that branch of doctrine by which, as founded in
          Christ, believers have, properly speaking, been in all ages separated
          from the profane heathen. I am only showing that it is necessary to
          apply to Scripture, in order to learn the sure marks which distinguish
          God, as the Creator of the world, from the whole herd of fictitious
          gods. We shall afterward, in due course, consider the work of
          Redemption. In the meantime, though we shall adduce many passages from
          the New Testament, and some also from the Law and the Prophets, in
          which express mention is made of Christ, the only object will be to
          show that God, the Maker of the world, is manifested to us in
          Scripture, and his true character expounded, so as to save us from
          wandering up and down, as in a labyrinth, in search of some doubtful
          deity.
        </p>
        <h2>2.The Word of God as Holy Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          Whether God revealed himself to the fathers by oracles and visions,
          or, by the instrumentality and ministry of men, suggested what they
          were to hand down to posterity, there cannot be a doubt that the
          certainty of what he taught them was firmly engraven on their hearts,
          so that they felt assured and knew that the things which they learnt
          came forth from God, who invariably accompanied his word with a sure
          testimony, infinitely superior to mere opinion. At length, in order
          that, while doctrine was continually enlarged, its truth might subsist
          in the world during all ages, it was his pleasure that the same
          oracles which he had deposited with the fathers should be consigned,
          as it were, to public records. With this view the law was promulgated,
          and prophets were afterwards added to be its interpreters. For though
          the uses of the law were manifold, (Book 2 c. 7 and 8,) and the
          special office assigned to Moses and all the prophets was to teach the
          method of reconciliation between God and man, (whence Paul calls
          Christ "the end of the law," Rom. 10: 4;) still I repeat that, in
          addition to the proper doctrine of faith and repentance in which
          Christ is set forth as a Mediator, the Scriptures employ certain marks
          and tokens to distinguish the only wise and true God, considered as
          the Creator and Governor of the world, and thereby guard against his
          being confounded with the herd of false deities. Therefore, while it
          becomes man seriously to employ his eyes in considering the works of
          God, since a place has been assigned him in this most glorious theatre
          that he may be a spectator of them, his special duty is to give ear to
          the Word, that he may the better profit. Hence it is not strange that
          those who are born in darkness become more and more hardened in their
          stupidity; because the vast majority instead of confining themselves
          within due bounds by listening with docility to the Word, exult in
          their own vanity. If true religion is to beam upon us, our principle
          must be, that it is necessary to begin with heavenly teaching, and
          that it is impossible for any man to obtain even the minutest portion
          of right and sound doctrine without being a disciple of Scripture.
          Hence, the first step in true knowledge is taken, when we reverently
          embrace the testimony which God has been pleased therein to give of
          himself. For not only does faith, full and perfect faith, but all
          correct knowledge of God, originate in obedience. And surely in this
          respect God has with singular Providence provided for mankind in all
          ages.
        </p>
        <h2>3.Without Scripture we fall into error</h2>
        <p>
          For if we reflect how prone the human mind is to lapse into
          forgetfulness of God, how readily inclined to every kind of error, how
          bent every now and then on devising new and fictitious religions, it
          will be easy to understand how necessary it was to make such a
          depository of doctrine as would secure it from either perishing by the
          neglect, vanishing away amid the errors, or being corrupted by the
          presumptuous audacity of men. It being thus manifest that God,
          foreseeing the inefficiency of his image imprinted on the fair form of
          the universe, has given the assistance of his Word to all whom he has
          ever been pleased to instruct effectually, we, too, must pursue this
          straight path, if we aspire in earnest to a genuine contemplation of
          God; - we must go, I say, to the Word, where the character of God,
          drawn from his works is described accurately and to the life; these
          works being estimated, not by our depraved judgement, but by the
          standard of eternal truth. If, as I lately said, we turn aside from
          it, how great soever the speed with which we move, we shall never
          reach the goal, because we are off the course. We should consider that
          the brightness of the Divine countenance, which even an apostle
          declares to be inaccessible, (1 Tim. 6: 16,) is a kind of labyrinth, -
          a labyrinth to us inextricable, if the Word do not serve us as a
          thread to guide our path; and that it is better to limp in the way,
          than run with the greatest swiftness out of it. Hence the Psalmist,
          after repeatedly declaring (Psalm 93, 96, 97, 99, &c.) that
          superstition should be banished from the world in order that pure
          religion may flourish, introduces God as reigning; meaning by the
          term, not the power which he possesses and which he exerts in the
          government of universal nature, but the doctrine by which he maintains
          his due supremacy: because error never can be eradicated from the
          heart of man until the true knowledge of God has been implanted in it.
        </p>
        <h2>
          4.Scripture can communicate to us what the revelation in the creation
          cannot
        </h2>
        <p>
          Accordingly, the same prophet, after mentioning that the heavens
          declare the glory of God, that the firmament sheweth forth the works
          of his hands, that the regular succession of day and night proclaim
          his Majesty, proceeds to make mention of the Word: - "The law of the
          Lord," says he, "is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the
          Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are
          right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure,
          enlightening the eyes," (Psalm 19: 1-9.) For though the law has other
          uses besides, (as to which, see Book 2 c. 7, sec. 6, 10, 12,) the
          general meaning is, that it is the proper school for training the
          children of God; the invitation given to all nations, to behold him in
          the heavens and earth, proving of no avail. The same view is taken in
          the 29th Psalm, where the Psalmist, after discoursing on the dreadful
          voice of God, which, in thunder, wind, rain, whirlwind, and tempest,
          shakes the earth, makes the mountains tremble, and breaks the cedars,
          concludes by saying, "that in his temple does every one speak of his
          glory," unbelievers being deaf to all God's words when they echo in
          the air. In like manner another Psalm, after describing the raging
          billows of the sea, thus concludes, "Thy testimonies are very sure;
          holiness becometh thine house for ever," (Psalm 93: 5.) To the same
          effect are the words of our Saviour to the Samaritan woman, when he
          told her that her nation and all other nations worshipped they knew
          not what; and that the Jews alone gave worship to the true God, (John
          4: 22.) Since the human mind, through its weakness, was altogether
          unable to come to God if not aided and upheld by his sacred word, it
          necessarily followed that all mankind, the Jews excepted, inasmuch as
          they sought God without the Word, were labouring under vanity and
          error.
