        <h2>VI. Errors contrary to Natural Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          It will be admitted, we have been sometimes told, that the apparent or
          real contradictions in the dates, quotations, and narratives of the
          Holy Bible, may possibly be removed by the resources of a more or less
          laborious exegesis; but there are others which you cannot reconcile:
          such are all those expressions in which the sacred writers appear in
          manifest opposition to the now better known laws of nature.
          Nevertheless (these objectors desire to add), though this argument be
          irrefragable against the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures, it
          compromises in nothing the divinity of their doctrines, any more than
          the great religious facts which they report to us. In inspiring his
          apostles and his prophets, God desired to make us, not scientific, but
          holy persons. Thus he could, without danger, allow the writers he
          employed to speak in ignorance of the phenomena of the material world;
          and their prejudices on such matters are innocent though
          incontestable. Do you not often find them expressing themselves as if
          the earth were immovable and the sun in motion? That star, according
          to them, rises and falls: "his going forth is from the end of the
          heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it" (Ps. 19); the moon and
          the stars are equally in movement; the sun, at the command of Joshua
          became immovable in the midst of the heavens, it "stood still upon
          Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon" (Josh. 10:12); the earth
          is "founded on the seas" (Ps. 24:2); "drawn from the water, it
          subsists amid the water" (2 Peter 3:5); "God hath laid its
          foundations, it shall never be moved" (Ps. 104:5)—Can you admit that
          this is really the language of the Creator of the heavens and of the
          earth, when addressing his creatures?
        </p>
        <p>
          We proceed to reply to this objection, and we are delighted to meet it
          on our path, seeing that the examination of it can only redound to the
          glory of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          We most fully admit that were there some physical errors, duly
          ascertained, in the book of the Scriptures, it would not be entirely
          from God; but we proceed to put it beyond a doubt that there are no
          such errors; and we will venture to defy our adversaries to produce a
          single such error in the whole of the Bible. Nay, we will even go much
          farther; and will show how much latent science, on the contrary,
          betrays itself there, beneath the simplicity of its language.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall begin by saying a few words on Joshua's miracle, inasmuch as
          a disposition has often been shown to turn it to account in combating
          either the plenary inspiration, or even the divine mission of the men
          of God. Several unbelieving writers have attacked it with that
          arrogance and irony which too often characterize them. But it is easy
          to reply to them. We have no thoughts of discussing here the methods
          by which the miracle might have been accomplished; we would only
          remark, from this example, how lightly people hasten to pronounce,
          that because certain passages of Scripture are not understood,
          therefore they must needs be irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sun, on the day of the battle of Beth-horon, stood still in the
          midst of heaven, we are told in the 10th chaper of Joshua; and there
          was no day like that before it or after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been said in Germany—"This phrase, taken in its natural sense,
          seems to us absurd; it is erroneous, therefore, and altogether human."
          Elsewhere it has been pronounced so absurd, that another meaning must
          be given to it. But both opinions are drawn from false premises. The
          fact is far from being absurd; it is only miraculous.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall give the objection in the very words in which it has been
          stated:—"The most fearless methodist," it has been said, "will feel
          constrained to own that in the system of our globe, were the sun to
          stop for an instant, or were the earth's motion to be slackened,
          belligerent armies, and all that is on the earth's surface, would be
          swept away like chaff before the wind!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, it is this very objection which is an error. In point of
          fact, if the miracle, instead of stopping the rotation of the globe
          suddenly, in an indivisible instant, took only the short space of a
          few seconds to accomplish it, by a supple and continuous action, then
          you have enough in this feeble circumstance to be assured that such a
          phenomenon would have had no very sensible effect mechanically beyond
          that of raising the waters diffused over the surface of the earth, and
          making them to flow from west to east. A child might tell it you. Let
          a carriage in rapid motion meet a curbstone—it shatters itself upon
          it, because the stone is immovable; and all that are in the carriage
          are projected to a distance, and thrown with violence on the ground.
          But let it be stopt by a continuous resistance, operating in a
          successive manner, and consummating itself in three or four seconds:
          then the smallest children seated in the carriage will remain in their
          seats; they will not even feel the impulsion which three seconds
          before was impressed on them by the impetuous movement of the horses,
          and which, without this precaution, would have sufficed to launch them
          to a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rotation of the earth is, at the equator, 1426 feet the second; at
          Jerusalem, 1212 feet. This is the initial speed of a canon ball
          projected by a charge the fifth part of its own weight. It is capable
          (abstraction being made of the resistance of the air) of raising that
          projectile to the extreme height of 24,000 feet; and yet a child, six
          years old, would destroy, without danger, in two-thirds of a minute,
          the whole of this force by the continued action of his fingers. Put
          into his little hands a canon ball of eight pounds weight, and let him
          hold it against the action of its weight during two-thirds of a
          minute; during the same time, allow another bullet of quite the same
          weight to drop freely through the air, and from the height of the
          summit of the Himalaya range. When forty seconds only have expired,
          the force of gravitation, after having acted by the same impulsions
          upon both these projectiles, will not have done more with respect to
          the first than have fatigued the feeble hands that resist it, while it
          would have made the other acquire a speed equal to that which the
          rotation of the earth impressed on the belligerent armies on the hill
          of Bethhoron. Since, then, a child might destroy, by the continuous
          effort of his little hands, a force capable (if concentrated on a
          single instant) of launching a canon bullet to the height of
          Chimborazo, we can easily conceive that, if God, on the day of the
          battle of Beth-horon, had employed two-thirds of a minute to arrest,
          by short and successive resistances, the rotation of our globe, then
          the projectile impulsions which a mass of eight pounds of iron would
          have received continually during these forty seconds, would not even
          have been so strong as that a child might not have destroyed them by
          the sole effort of his fingers, and without expending more force than
          he would have to put forth in sustaining with his hands a weight of
          eight pounds during the same space of time. And if the mass, instead
          of having the form of a bullet, had had that of a quoit or a cube, it
          would not have had enough of that impulsion to make it overcome the
          resistance of friction, and to change its place on the surface of the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be objected, perhaps, that the rotation of the earth at
          Bethhoron, was twenty-seven times more rapid than that of a
          steamcarriage on a railway. This is true; but since the retarding
          force necessary for exhausting a given impulsion is in the inverse
          ratio of the time employed in it, grant that the miracle took eighteen
          minutes for its consummation; take eighteen minutes (instead of forty
          seconds) for the entire stoppage of the movement of the terrestrial
          globe at the voice of Joshua; and then the belligerent armies, instead
          of being "swept away as if by a tempest," would not have felt more
          from what happened, than do the thousands of travellers that are stopt
          at each of the stations on a railway. Other difficulties of a like
          kind have been started with regard to this miracle of Joshua. Had the
          earth, it has been said, suspended its motion during ten hours, the
          attractive force of the sun acting singly upon it, would in that time
          have made it fall 900 leagues in the direction of the sun's blazing
          focus, and the annual conditions of our orbit would have been sensibly
          troubled.
        </p>
        <p>
          This objection is no less futile than the preceding. The miracle, in
          fact, does not imply the slightest perturbation in the progressive
          movement of the earth; it requires it only in its rotation. Now,
          according to the laws of the celestial mechanism, the rotation of a
          star upon its axis is entirely independent of the movement impressed
          on its centre of gravity, and which makes it move onwards in its
          elliptical course. Experience had attested this before it was
          demonstrated by calculation. It had long been observed that the speed
          of the sun (or rather of the earth) in its orbit, ceases not to vary
          from one end of the year to the other; and yet there does not exist in
          nature a more uniform movement than that which makes the whole
          celestial sphere daily revolve to our eyes. We are even assured, from
          the observations of the movement of the moon, that for more than 2000
          years the sidereal day has not varied so much as the hundredth part of
          a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let there be supposed, then, a double shock impressed upon the earth
          above and below its centre, and in two contrary and parallel
          directions, and we shall have explained how its rotation on its axis
          might have been suspended without any change in its onward movement.
          But here I check myself. It would be rash, do I say? it would be
          childish to pretend to enter into the details of the prodigy with the
          view of ascertaining its causes; and my only wish has been to show the
          futility of the objections. The true one, which people do not state,
          is that they find the miracle too great for its object. But, for men
          who believe in the great miracle of redemption by the Son of God,
          nothing is too great, and all things advance in due proportions, in
          the divine revelations. Moreover, and I hasten to say it, it would not
          even be necessary, in order to account for this prodigy, to suppose so
          sovereign an act of Omnipotence as the suspension of the rotation of
          our globe. God might have employed for this purpose only one of those
          numerous means which divert the light from its paths, and produce the
          innumerable illusions of optics; some one of those refractions, for
          example, which daily displace to our eyes, in different measures, all
          the stars of the celestial sphere. Is it not matter of notoriety, that
          in the polar regions the power of the horizontal refractions makes the
          sun appear to the inhabitants of those cold countries ten days before
          he really rises above the horizon? Such might have been the cause of
          the miracle of Beth-horon. We decide nothing; we do not even venture
          on a hypothesis. We would only say, that the miracle was duly
          consummated (whatever the means by which it was produced), provided
          that the sun, to the eyes of the inhabitants of Palestine, stood still
          upon Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the Scriptures are reproached with holding a language on
          the daily phenomena of nature, apparently betokening ignorance, and
          incompatible with a plenary inspiration. According to the writers of
          the Bible, the sun rises, the sun sets, the sun stands still, the
          earth remains unmoved. People will have it that the Creator, in
          speaking to us in a book inspired by him, would have more clearly
          shown us that the Spirit, that made the sacred historians speak, knew
          before we did the rotation of our globe, its periodical revolution,
          and the respective immobility of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>Let us, then, examine this reproach.</p>
        <p>
          We ask, first of all, of the persons who give utterance to it, if they
          would have had the Bible to speak like Sir Isaac Newton. Would they
          dismiss from their minds the consideration that if God, in speaking of
          the decrees of nature, were to express himself, I do not say only as
          he sees them, but as the scientific men of future ages will be able to
          see them, then even the great Newton could have understood nothing of
          what was said? Moreover, even the most advanced language of science is
          not yet, and never will be, after all, more than the language of
          appearances. The visible world, much more than you suppose, is a
          passing shadow, a scene of illusions and of phantoms. What you call a
          reality is still in itself but a phenomenon considered in its relation
          to a more exalted reality, and to an ulterior analysis. In our mortal
          lips the word reality has nothing absolute; it is a term altogether
          relative, merely intimating that people think they have added one new
          step to the deep ladder of our ignorances. The human eye sees objects
          under only two dimensions, and projects them all as if on the same
          canvass, until touch and repeated experience have assured us of the
          reality of a depth, or of a third dimension. Colours are accidents,
          and it is only by reflection or illusion that they belong to the
          object which presents them to you. Even the impenetrability of bodies,
          their solidity, their extension, are no more than an appearance, and
          present themselves as a reality only until the farther progress of one
          science shall substitute another for it. Who would venture to say
          where this analysis ought to stop, and in what terms should we speak
          of creatures with which we are most familiar, were we but endowed with
          one more sense, with antennæ, for example, like ants and bees? The
          expression of appearances, accordingly, provided it be exact, is,
          among men, philosophically correct, and what it behoved the Scriptures
          to employ. Would men have the Bible speak to us of the scenes of
          nature otherwise than we speak of them to one another, in our social
          or domestic intercourse, otherwise even than they are spoken of among
          the most enlightened persons? When Sir John Herschel tells his
          domestics to waken him precisely at midnight, to observe the passage
          of some star over his meridian telescope, does he feel himself called
          upon to speak to them about the rotation of the earth, and of the
          moment when it will have brought their nadir into the plane of its
          orbit? I should think not; and were you even to hear him converse in
          Greenwich Observatory with the scientific Airey, you would find, that
          even in that sanctuary of science, the habitual language of these
          astronomers is still quite like that of the Scriptures. For them the
          stars rise, the equinoxes recede, the planets go forward and
          accelerate their speed, stop and go back. Would you, then, that Moses
          should speak to all the generations of men in a more scientific
          language than La Place or Arago?
        </p>
        <p>
          But more than this. Here we would bid the reader notice two general
          facts, that throw out a deal of light the moment we study them, and
          which soon betray in the Scriptures the pen of Almighty God. Here, as
          every where else, the objections, when narrowly examined, come back
          upon you, loudly retract themselves, and become arguments on the other
          side.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two facts are analogous to what you might observe in the words
          of a scientific astronomer conversing with his sons in their boyhood,
          and pointing out the earth and the heavens to them with his finger. If
          you follow him into these conversations, where his affection, stooping
          to their level, presents to their growing intelligence such images and
          words as it can comprehend, you will soon notice his respect for truth
          shown under a double character. First, he will never say any thing to
          them that is not true; and, secondly, there will be many intimations
          in his words that he knows more on the subject than he wishes to tell
          them. He will make no pretension, it is true, to teach them science;
          but, on the one hand, nothing in all he says will contradict its
          principles; and, on the other hand, several of his words will at once
          reveal that while he restrains himself from speaking about it, still
          he knows it. Afterwards, when his children, grown up to manhood, come
          to recall his words, not only will they find them exempt from all
          error, but they will farther recognize in them such a skilful choice
          of expression as to put them at once in a pre-established harmony with
          science, and to present it to them, while not aware of it, in its
          germ. In proportion to the gradual advance of their own knowledge,
          they will see with admiration, under the reserve and simplicity of his
          language, concealed marks of wisdom, instances of a scientific
          precision, a general phraseology and particular expressions
          harmonizing with events then unknown to them, but that had long been
          known to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, such also is the double observation which every attentive
          reader may make on the phraseology of the Scriptures. They speak
          poetically, but with precision, the true language of appearances. In
          them we hear a father condescending to address his youngest sons, yet
          in such a manner that the oldest can never find there a single
          sentence contrary to the true condition of the things he has created;
          and in such a manner also he suffers to escape from him, without
          affectation, enough to demonstrate to them that all that they have
          learned of his works during the last four thousand years, he knew
          before them and better than they. It is thus that, in the Bible,
          Eternal Wisdom addresses his children. In proportion as they advance
          in growth, they see that the Scripture is made for their age, is
          adapted to their development, appearing to grow with their growth, and
          always presenting the two facts which we have pointed out: on the one
          hand, the absence of all error; on the other, indirect yet
          incontestable indications of a science which preceded all that of man.
        </p>
        <p>First fact.—There is no physical error in the Word of God.</p>
        <p>
          If there were any, we have admitted it, the book would not be from
          God. "God is not man that he should lie," nor the son of man that he
          should be mistaken. He behoves, no doubt, in order to his being
          understood, to stoop to our weakness, but without in the least
          partaking in it; and his language will always be found to witness to
          his condescension, never to his ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This remark is still more serious than one would suppose before having
          reflected on it. It becomes very striking on a close examination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examine all the false theologies of the ancients and moderns; read in
          Homer or in Hesiod, the religious codes of the Greeks; study those of
          the Buddhists, those of the Brahmins, those of the Mahommedans; you
          will not only find in these repulsive systems on the subject of the
          Godhead, but will meet with the grossest errors on the material world.
          You will be revolted with their theology no doubt; but their natural
          philosophy and their astronomy also, ever allied to their religion,
          will be found to rest on the most absurd notions.

          Read in the Chou-king and the Y-king of the Chinese, their fantastic
          systems on the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water),
          and on their omnipotent influences on all divine and human affairs.

          Read in the Shaster, in the Pouran, in the four books of the Vedham,
          or law of the Hindus, their revolting cosmogony. The moon is 50,000
          leagues higher than the sun; it shines with its own light; it animates
          our body. Night is caused by the sun's setting behind the mountain
          Someyra, situated in the middle of the earth, and several thousand
          miles high. Our earth is flat and triangular, composed of seven
          stages, each with its own degree of beauty, its own inhabitants, and
          its own sea, the first of honey, another of sugar, another of butter,
          another of wine; in fine, the whole mass is borne on the heads of
          countless elephants which, in shaking themselves, cause earthquakes in
          this nether world! In one word, they have placed the whole history of
          their gods in relations at once the most fantastic and the most
          necessary with the physical world and all the phenomena of the
          universe. Thus, the missionaries of India have often repeated that a
          telescope, silently planted in the midst of the holy city of Benares,
          or in the ancient A va, would prove a battery, powerful as lightning,
          for overturning the whole system of Brahma, and the whole of that of
          Boudhou.

          Read farther the philosophers of Greek and Roman antiquity, Aristotle,
          Seneca, Pliny, Plutarch, Cicero. How many expressions of opinion will
          you not find there, any single one of which would be enough to
          compromise all our doctrines of inspiration, if it could be met with
          in any book of Holy Scripture! Read Mahomet's Koran, making mountains
          to be created "to prevent the earth from moving, and to hold it fast
          as if with anchors and cables." What do I say? Read even the cosmogony
          of Buffon, or some of Voltaire's sneers on the doctrine of a deluge,
          or on the fossil animals of a primitive world. We will go much
          farther. Read again, we do not say the absurd reasonings of the
          pagans, of Lucretius, of Pliny, or of Plutarch, against the theory of
          the antipodes, but even the fathers of the Christian Church. Hear the
          theological indignation of the admirable Augustine, who says that it
          is opposed to the Scriptures; and the scientific eloquence of
          Lactantius, who considers it so opposed to common sense: "Num aliquid
          loquuntur!" he exclaims; "is there any man so silly as to believe that
          men exist having their feet above their heads, trees with their fruit
          hanging downwards, rain, snow, and hail falling topsy turvy!" "They
          would answer you," he adds, "by maintaining that the earth is a globe!
          Quid dicam de iis nescio, qui cum semel aberraverint, constanter in
          stultitia perseverant, et vanis vana defendunt!" "One knows not what
          to say of such men, who, when they have once run into error, persist
          in their folly, and defend one absurdity by another!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen, farther, to the legate Boniface, who brought Virgilius, for
          his opinion in this matter, as a heretic before the Pope; listen to
          Pope Zachary treating that unhappy bishop as homo malignus. "If it be
          proved," says he, "that Virgilius maintains the existence of other men
          under this earth, call a council, condemn him, put him out of the
          Church, depose him from the priesthood!" Listen, at a later period, to
          the whole clergy of Spain, and especially to the imposing Council of
          Salamanca, indignant at the geographical system by which Christopher
          Columbus was led to look for a whole new continent. Listen, at the
          epoch of Newton's birth, to the great Galileo, who "ascended," says
          Kepler, "the highest ramparts of the universe," and who justified at
          once by his genius and by his telescope the disowned and condemned
          system of Copernicus; behold him groaning, at the age of eighty, in
          the prisons of Rome, for having discovered the movement of the earth,
          after having had to pronounce these words, ten years before (28th June
          1633), before their Eminences, at the palace of the Holy Office: "I,
          Galileo, in the seventieth year of my age, on my knees before your
          Eminences, having before my eyes, and touching with my own hands, the
          Holy Scriptures, abjure, curse, and detest, the error of the earth's
          movement."

          What might we not have been entitled to say of the Scriptures, had
          they expressed themselves on the phenomena of nature, as these have
          been spoken of by all the ancient sages?—had they referred all to four
          elements, as people did for so long a period?—had they said the stars
          were of crystal, as did Philoläus of Crotona; and had they, like
          Empedocles, lighted up the two hemispheres of our world with two
          suns?—had they taught, like Leucippus, that the fixed stars, set
          ablaze by the swiftness of their diurnal movement round the earth,
          feed the sun with their fires?—had they, like Diodorus of Sicily, and
          all the Egyptian sages, formed the heavens and the earth by the motion
          of the air and the natural ascent of fire?—or had they thought, like
          Philoläus, that the sun has only a borrowed light, and is only a
          mirror, which receives and sends down to us the light of the celestial
          spheres?—had they, like Anaxagoras, conceived it to be a mass of iron
          larger than the Peloponnesus, and the earth to be a mountain, whose
          roots stretched infinitely downwards?—had they imagined the heaven to
          be a solid sphere, to which the fixed stars are attached, as was done
          by Aristotle, and almost all the ancients?—had they called the
          celestial vault a firmamentum, or a στερέωμα, as their interpreters
          have done, both in Latin and in Greek?—had they spoken, as has been
          done so recently, and even among people professing Christianity, of
          the influence exerted by the movements of the heavens on the elements
          of this lower world, on the characters of men, and on the course of
          human affairs? Such is the natural proneness of all nations to this
          superstition, that, notwithstanding their religion, the ancient Jews,
          and the Christians themselves, equally fell into it. "The modern
          Greeks," says D'Alembert, "have carried it to excess; hardly do we
          find one of their authors who does not, on all occasions, speak of
          predictions by the stars, of horoscopes, and talismans, so that there
          was hardly an edifice in Constantinople, and in all Greece, that had
          not been erected according to the rules of the apotelesmatic
          astrology." French historians observe, that astrology was so much in
          fashion under Catherine de Medicis, that people dared not undertake
          any thing of importance without having consulted the stars; and even
          under Henry III. and Henry IV., the predictions of astrologers formed
          the engrossing subject of ordinary conversation at court. "We have
          seen, towards the close of the last century," says Ph. Giulani, "an
          Italian send Pope Innocent XI. a prediction, in the manner of a
          horoscope, on Vienna, at that time besieged by the Turks, and which
          was very well received." And in our own days the Count de
          Boulainvilliers has written very seriously on the subject.

          Open now the Bible; study its fifty sacred authors, from that
          wonderful Moses who held the pen in the wilderness, four hundred years
          before the war of Troy, down to the fisherman, son of Zebedee, who
          wrote fifteen hundred years afterwards, in Ephesus and in Patmos,
          under the reign of Domitian; open the Bible, and try if you can to
          find any thing of this sort there. No. None of those blunders which
          the science of every successive age discovers in the books of those
          that preceded it; none of those absurdities, above all, which modern
          astronomy points out, in such numbers, in the writings of the
          ancients, in their sacred codes, in their systems of philosophy, and
          in the finest pages even of the fathers of the Church; no such errors
          can be found in any of our sacred books; nothing there will ever
          contradict what, after so many ages, the investigations of the learned
          world have been able to reveal to us of what is certain in regard to
          the state of our globe or of that of the heavens. Carefully peruse our
          Scriptures from one end to the other, in search of such blemishes
          there; and while engaged in this research, remember that it is a book
          which speaks of every thing, which describes nature, which proclaims
          its grandeur, which tells the story of its creation, which informs us
          of the structure of the heavens, of the creation of light, of the
          waters, of the atmosphere, of the mountains, of animals, and of
          plants;—it is a book that tells us of the first revolutions of the
          world, and foretells to us also the last; a book that relates them in
          circumstantial narratives, exalts them in a sublime poesy, and chants
          them in strains of fervent psalmody;—it is a book replete with the
          glow of oriental rapture, elevation, variety, and boldness;—it is a
          book which speaks of the earth and of things visible, at the same time
          that it speaks of the celestial world and of things invisible;—it is a
          book to which nearly fifty writers of every degree of mental
          cultivation, of every rank, of every condition, and separated by
          fifteen hundred years from each other, have successively put their
          hand;—it is a book composed first in the centre of Asia, among the
          sands of Arabia, or in the deserts of Judea, or in the fore-court of
          the temple of the Jews, or in the rustic schools of the prophets of
          Bethel and of Jericho, or in the sumptuous palaces of Babylon, or on
          the idolatrous banks of Chebar; and afterwards, at the centre of
          western civilisation, amid the Jews with their manifold ignorance,
          amid polytheism and its ideas, as well as in the bosom of pantheism
          and its silly philosophy;—it is a book the first writer of which had
          been for the space of forty years a pupil of the magicians of Egypt,
          who looked upon the sun, and the stars, and the elements as endowed
          with intelligence, as re-acting upon the elements, and as governing
          the world by continual effluxes;—it is a book the first chapters of
          which preceded by more than NINE HUNDRED YEARS the most ancient
          philosphers of ancient Greece and of Asia, the Thaleses, the
          Pythagorases, the Zaleucuses, the Xenophaneses, the Confuciuses;— it
          is a book which carries its narratives even into the field of the
          invisible world, even into the hierarchies of the angels, even into
          the remotest realms of futurity, and the glorious scenes of the last
          day;— well then, search through these 50 authors, search through these
          66 books, search through these 1189 chapters, and these 31,173 verses
          … search for one single error of those thousands with which ancient
          and modern books abound, when they speak either of the heaven or of
          the earth, or of their revolutions, or of their elements; search, but
          you will search in vain.

          There is nothing constrained or reserved in its language; it speaks of
          all things and in all tones; it is the prototype, it is the
          unapproachable model; it has been the inspirer of all the most exalted
          productions of poetry. Ask this of Milton, of the two Racines, of
          Young, of Klopstock. They will tell you that this divine poesy is of
          all the most lyrical, the boldest in its flights, and the most
          sublime: it rises on a cherub and soars on the wings of the wind. And
          yet never does this book do violence to the facts or to the principles
          of a sound philosophy of nature. Never will you find it in opposition,
          in the case of a single sentence, with the correct notions which
          science has enabled us to reach with regard to the form of our globe,
          its size, or its geology; on the vacuum and on space; on the inert and
          obedient materiality of all the stars; on the planets, on their
          masses, on their courses, on their dimensions, or on their influences;
          on the suns that people the depths of space, on their number, on their
          nature, or their immensity. Just as in speaking of the invisible
          world, and of a subject so new, so unknown, and so delicate, as that
          of the angels, this book has not one of its authors that, in the
          course of the 1560 years which it took to write it, has varied in the
          character of charity, humility, fervour, and purity which belongs to
          those mysterious beings; just as in speaking of the relations of the
          celestial world with God, never has one of these fifty writers, either
          in the Old or in the New Testament, uttered a single word that favours
          that constant leaning to pantheism which characterises the whole
          philosophy of the Gentiles; so likewise you will not find one of the
          authors of the Bible who, in speaking of the visible world, has
          sufferred a single one of those expressions of opinion to escape him,
          which, in other books, contradict the reality of facts—not one which
          makes the heaven to be a firmament, as has been done by the
          Septuagint, St Jerome, and all the Fathers of the Church—not one that
          makes the world, as Plato did, an intelligent animal—not one that
          reduces all things here below to the four elements of the physical
          system of the ancients—not one that holds with the Jews, with the
          Latins, with the Greeks, with the finest minds of antiquity, with the
          great Tacitus among the ancients, with the great De Thou among the
          moderns, with the sceptic Michael Montaigne, that "the stars have
          domination and power, not only over our lives and the conditions of
          our fortune, but even over our inclinations, our discourses, our
          wills; that they govern, impel, and agitate them at the mercy of their
          influences; and that (according as our reason teaches us and finds it
          to be) the whole world feels the impulsion of the slightest celestial
          movements. Facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab astris;"—not one
          that speaks of the mountains as Mahomet has done, of the cosmogony
          like Buffon, of the antipodes like Lucretius, like Plutarch, like
          Pliny, like Lactantius, like St Augustine, like Pope
          Zachary.—Assuredly, were there to be found in the Bible a single one
          of those errors that abound among philosophers, as well ancient as
          modern, our faith in the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures would
          be more than compromised by it; we should have to acknowledge that
          there are errors in the Word of God, and that these delusive
          expressions are those of a fallible writer, not those of the Holy
          Ghost; for God is not man that he should lie; in him there is no
          variableness, neither shadow of falsity; and He to whom lying lips are
          an abomination, could not have been capable of contradicting himself
          and dictating that which is false.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no physical error, then, in the Scriptures; and this great
          fact, which becomes all the more striking the more narrowly we look
          into it, is the manifest proof of an inspiration carried into their
          choice of the smallest expressions they employ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we have more to say than this, and now come to the second fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only has the Bible not admitted any false statement of opinion or
          expression; but further, it has often allowed words to escape which
          enable us to see, beyond all possibility of our being mistaken, the
          science of the Almighty. His grand aim, no doubt, is to reveal to us
          the eternal glories of the invisible world, not the barren secrets of
          that which is doomed to perish. Meanwhile, however, it often happens
          that his language, when we listen to it with attention, allows a
          science to be seen which it is not his design to teach, but of which
          he cannot be ignorant, because it is in him a great deep. Not only
          will he never teach us any thing false, even cursorily; but, further,
          you will often stumble on words which betray the voice of the Creator
          of all worlds. Often you will remark in these a wisdom, a forethought,
          an exactness, of which the ages of antiquity had no idea, and which
          nothing but the discoveries of the telescope, the calculating
          processes, and the science of the moderns, have enabled us to
          appreciate; so that its language will be found to bear, by means of
          these traits, the evident characters of the most entire inspiration.
          The discretion and departure from usual practice shown in its
          expressions, the nature of certain details, the perfect propriety and
          divine adaptation of which to the facts have remained unrevealed till
          three thousand years afterwards; the reserve of the language,
          sometimes its very hardihood, and its strangeness for the time in
          which it was written: all these signs will enable you to recognize the
          savant par excellence, the Ancient of days, who addresses himself to
          his children no doubt, but who speaks as the father of the family, and
          who knows the whole of his house.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Scripture speaks of the form of our earth, it makes it A
          GLOBE. When it speaks of the position of this globe in the bosom of
          the universe, it HANGS IT UPON NOTHING (בלימה על). When it speaks of
          its age, not only does it place its creation, as well as that of the
          heavens, IN THE BEGINNING, that is, before ages which it cannot or
          will not number; but, further, it takes care to place before the
          disembroilment of chaos and the creation of man, that of angels and
          archangels, principalities and powers, their probation, the fall of
          some and their ruin, the perseverance of others and their glory. When
          it speaks, afterwards, of the origin of our continents, and of the
          last creation of plants, animals, and men, it then gives to our new
          world, and to this proud race of ours, so young an age, that men of
          all times, among all earth's peoples, and even in our modern schools,
          have foolishly revolted at it; still it is an age to which they have
          been compelled to resign themselves since the labours of the De Lucs,
          the Cuviers, and the Bucklands, have so fully demonstrated that the
          state of the globe's surface, as well as the monuments of history and
          those of science, must compel alike the learned and the vulgar to
          submit to it. When it speaks of the heavens, it employs, in alluding
          to them and defining them, the most philosophic and the most beautiful
          expression; an expression which the Greeks in their Septuagint, the
          Latins in the Vulgate, and all the Church Fathers in their discourses,
          have made bold to correct, and which they have perverted from its
          proper meaning, because it seemed opposed to the science of their
          times. The heavens, in the Bible, are the EXPANSE, expansum, רקיע;
          that is to say, it is the void, or the ether, or the immensity, and
          not the firmamentum of St Jerome; nor the στερέωμα of the Alexandrine
          interpreters; nor the eighth heaven, firm, solid, crystalline, and
          incorruptible of Aristotle, and all the ancients. And although this,
          which is so remarkable a term of the Hebrew, recurs seventeen times in
          the Old Testament, and although seventeen times the seventy have
          rendered it by στερέωμα (firmament), never has the New Testament
          thought fit to make use, in this sense, of that expression of the
          Greek interpreters. When it speaks of light, it represents it to us as
          an element independent of the sun, and as anterior by three epochs to
          that in which that great luminary was kindled;2 thus anticipating the
          systems of the moderns, whom we have seen led, along with the great
          Newton, to suppose in the universe an ether, eminently subtile,
          powerfully elastic, and diffused every where, the contractions and
          dilatations of which would produce, not only the various phenomena of
          light, but those too of gravitation. When it speaks of the creation of
          plants, it makes them vegetate, grow, and bear seed before the
          appearance of the sun, and under conditions of light, heat, and
          humidity, which were not those under which our vegetables live at the
          present day;4 and it is thus that it reveals to us, some thousands of
          years ago, an order of things which the Fossil Botany of these late
          times of ours has declared incontestable, and the necessary existence
          of which is attested by the gigantic forms of the vegetables lately
          discovered in Canada, and at Baffin's Bay; some, like M. Marcel de
          Serres, having recourse, in order to explain it, to a terrestrial
          magnetism at that time more intense, or to more luminous auroræ
          boreales; others, like M. de Candolle,6 to a great inclination of the
          ecliptic, although in reality (according to the famous theorem of La
          Grange) the mechanism of the heavens confines within very narrow
          limits this variation of the planetary orbs.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it speaks of the air, the weight of which was unknown before the
          time of Galileo, it tells us that at the creation "God gave to the air
          ITS WEIGHT (סשקל(, and to the waters their just measure." When it
          speaks of our atmosphere and of the upper waters,3 it assigns to them
          an importance which the science of the moderns alone has been able to
          demonstrate; seeing that, according to their calculations, the force
          annually employed by nature for the formation of clouds is equal to an
          amount of work which the whole human race could not do in less than
          200,000 years.5 And when it separates the higher waters from the
          lower, it is by an expansion, and not by a solid sphere, as its
          imprudent translators would do, both in Greek and in Latin. When it
          speaks of the mountains, it distinguishes them, in point of fact, into
          primitive and secondary; it speaks of them as generated, as raised, as
          melted like wax; it lowers the valleys; in a word, it speaks as a
          geological poet of our own days would do. "The mountains arose, O
          Lord, and the valleys went down unto the place which thou hadst
          founded for them." When it speaks of the human races of every tribe,
          of every colour, and of every language, it gives one and the same
          origin, notwithstanding that the philosophy of all ages would so often
          have revolted against this truth; which we have seen that of the
          moderns forced at length to acknowledge.7 When it speaks of the
          internal state of our globe, it declares to us two great facts, of
          which the learned were long ignorant, but now rendered. incontestable
          by their last discoveries; the one relating to its solid crust, and
          the other to the great waters which it covers. When it speaks of its
          solid envelope, it informs us, that if its surface gives us bread,
          underneath (תחתיה) the earth is ON FIRE; that, besides, it is reserved
          unto fire, and that it will be burnt in the last times, with all the
          works that are therein.2 And when it speaks of the waters which our
          globe contains, it alone accounts, at least in this respect, for the
          immense cataclysms which (according to what we are told by men of
          science themselves) have completely, and for long periods, submerged
          it at different epochs. And while the latter tell us of the
          inconsiderable depth of the seas; while they assure us that a rise of
          two hundred metres only, or of once-and-a-half the height of the tower
          of Strasbourg, would suffice for the disappearance of the Baltic, the
          North Sea, the English and St George's Channels; and that Mont Blanc,
          or at least Chimborazo, if thrown into the deepest part of the Pacific
          Ocean, would be found high enough to form an island; while La Place
          thought there was ground to conclude, from the size of the tides, that
          the mean depth of the ocean does not exceed a million of metres (the
          height of the Saleve or of Hecla); while we have thus demonstrated to
          us the absolute insufficiency of the seas for these immense
          submersions which our globe has undergone; … the Scripture teaches us
          that the earth was taken out of the water, and subsists in the water,
          "and that its solid crust covers a GREAT DEEP (תהום.), the waters of
          which were broken up (נבקעו), with surges and violence, at the epoch
          of the deluge, as at that of chaos and of the countless ages that
          preceded it." When it speaks of the deluge, it supposes submersions
          and subversions, which all unbelievers of former times said were too
          great to be believed, and which at the present day geologists have
          found too insufficient rather to explain all the subversions which our
          earth has discovered to them. When it relates the preparatives and the
          progressive steps of that immense cataclysm, it reveals facts which
          the science of the moderns may not yet have universally adopted, but
          neither has it been able to contradict them by other facts: it assumes
          the existence of an interior fire, which, by raising the temperature
          of the seas and of the deep waters, must have produced, on the one
          hand, an enormous evaporation, and impetuous rains, as if the
          flood-gates of the heavens had been opened; and, on the other, a
          resistless dilatation, which not only raised the waters from their
          abysses, broke up the fountains of the GREAT DEEP, and swelled them
          into mighty waves reaching to the top of the highest mountains, but
          caused immense stratifications of carbonate of lime, under the double
          action of an enormous heat and of a pressure equivalent to 80,000
          atmospheres. When it describes the state of our globe, in the days
          which preceded the bringing of order out of chaos, it assumes the
          existence in it of an internal heat, and of submarine fires, while
          covering the whole of it with water in a liquid state.2 When it speaks
          of the creation of birds and fishes, it assigns them a common origin;
          and we know that modern naturalists have ascertained, that between
          those two classes of animals there are deep-seated points of
          resemblance, which there is nothing to indicate to our eyes, but which
          are revealed in their anatomy, and even in the microscopic form of the
          globules of their blood. When it lays an arrest on the sun—that is to
          say, on the earth's rotation—in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, it
          takes care, too, to make the moon to stop also, in the same proportion
          with the sun, and from the same cause; a precaution, as Chaubard has
          shown,2 which never would have been thought of by an astronomy that
          was a stranger to the knowledge of our daily movement; since, after
          all, nothing more was required for the purposes of this miracle than
          the prolongation of the day. When it speaks of the Lord's coming as a
          flash of lightning, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last day, it
          once more bears witness to the rotation of the earth, and to the
          existence of the antipodes; for, at that solemn moment, it says it
          will be day for one part of men, and it will be night at the same hour
          for another part.4 When it describes the past and future riches of the
          land of Canaan, to which a marvellous force of vegetation is promised
          for the last times, it speaks of it as rich, not only in springs, but
          in subterranean waters, and seems to anticipate the perforations by
          which the moderns have learned to fertilize an arid country, by boring
          the soil, so as to cause water to gush up. When it speaks of the
          language of men, it gives it a primitive unity, which a first study of
          our innumerable idioms seems to contradict, but which comes to be
          confirmed by a more profound examination. When it describes the
          deliverance of Noah, it gives to the ark dimensions which we at first
          sight pronounce to be too small, which we would have made a hundred
          times greater had we been charged with that narrative, but which a
          study of the fact has made appear sufficient. When it speaks to us of
          the number of the stars, instead of supposing them to be a thousand
          (1022), as in the catalogue of Hipparchus, or as in that of Ptolemy;
          whilst, in both hemispheres taken together, the most practised eyes
          are incapable of discovering more than five thousand; whilst, before
          the invention of the telescope, a man could not see, even in the
          finest night, more than a thousand, the Scripture calls them
          INNUMERABLE; it compares them, as Herschel would do, to sand on the
          sea-shore; it tells us that God has sown them with his hand in the
          immensity of space like dust, and that, nevertheless, "he calls them
          all by their name." When it speaks of that immensity, hark with what a
          learned and divine wisdom it portrays it to you! how guarded it
          remains in its noble poesy, and how wise in its sublimity! "The
          heavens declare the glory of God, and the EXPANSE showeth his
          handywork. There is no speech nor language; nevertheless we hear their
          voice." When it speaks of the relations borne by the stars to this
          sublunary world, instead of supposing them animated, as the ancients
          did—instead of ever attributing to them some influence on human
          affairs, as was fondly imagined for so long a period even by the
          professedly Christian populations of Italy and France, down to the
          days of the Reformation, they are composed of inert matter, it tells
          you, shining, no doubt, but passively acted upon. The heavens, even
          the heaven of heavens, advance with the order, consistency, and unity
          of an army which advances to battle. "Lift up your eyes on high, and
          behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by
          number; he calleth them all by names; not one faileth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why sayest thou, O Jacob, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment
          is passed over from my God?" When it describes the heavens, it takes
          care to distinguish three; first, the heaven of the birds, of
          tempests, of the powers of the air and spiritual wickednesses; next,
          the heaven of the stars; and, finally, the third heaven, the heaven of
          heavens. But when it speaks of the God of all this, mark how beautiful
          its language! The sound of his thunder is in the rotundity of the air,
          it tells us; but the heavens, and even the heaven of heavens, cannot
          contain him.3 "In what place would you enclose him? and what likeness
          will ye compare unto him? He hath set his glory above the heavens, and
          he even humbleth himself when he beholds the heavens! Were you to take
          the wings of the morning, and fly with the speed of light, whither
          shouldst thou go from his face, or whither shouldst thou flee from his
          presence?" But after having deemed that it has said enough of all
          those visible grandeurs, it tells us that "these are but the skirts of
          his ways; and how small is the portion that we know of them!" And,
          finally, when holy Scripture thinks enough has been said of all the
          grandeurs even of the Creator of these immensities, listen to it
          farther. "He telleth the number of the stars," it says to you, "and he
          healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds."5 "Wonderful
          in counsel, and magnificent in the means he employs, he putteth thy
          tears into his bottle; a sparrow falleth not to the ground without his
          permission; the very hairs of your head are numbered." "The eternal
          God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms."7 "O my
          God, how manifold are thy works! and thou hast magnified thy Word
          above all thy name!"
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, amid all these proofs of greatness … "where shall wisdom be
          found? and where is the place of understanding? The depth saith, It is
          not in me; and the sea answers, It is not with me! God alone
          understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.… He
          who looketh unto the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole
          heaven; to make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters
          by measure. When he made a decree for the rain and a way for the
          lightning of the thunder; then did he see wisdom, and sound it to the
          bottom; and unto man he said, Behold the fear of the Lord, that is
          wisdom; and to depart from evil, is understanding!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, then, is the inspiration of the holy Scriptures; and it is thus
          we may see there celestial reflections emanating from the very places
          where people had thought they might detect blemishes. If, with a calm
          and reverential hand, you uplift the veil of obscurity with which it
          required, on your account, to shroud its face, you will discover there
          a majestic brightness; for it comes down, as Moses did, from the holy
          mountain, and brings to you in its hands the tables of the testimony!
          At the very place where you had dreaded an obscurity, you find a
          splendour; at the place where people had noted an objection, God has
          turned it into a testimony; at the place where there was a doubt, you
          find an assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude, then, again, that with regard to this seventh objection,
          the difficulties become proofs; and that, on this head, as well as on
          so many others, we cannot fail at every page to recognise in the whole
          of the Bible a communication from God.
        </p>
        <p>But let us listen farther to a last objection.</p>
