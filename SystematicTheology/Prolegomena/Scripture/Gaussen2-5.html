        <h2>V. The Examples of the Apostles, and of their Master</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, consider what use is made by the apostles themselves of
          the Word of God, and the terms in which they quote it. See how, in
          doing this, they not only think it enough to say, "God hath said;"
          "the Holy Ghost saith;"2 "God saith in such a prophet;" but observe,
          farther, when they quote it, with what respect they speak of what are
          for them its smallest particles; how attentively they weigh every
          word; with what a religious assurance they often insist on a single
          word, in order to deduce from it the most serious consequences, and
          the most fundamental doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          For ourselves, we confess nothing more strongly impresses us than this
          view of the subject; nothing has begot in us so deep and firm a
          confidence in the entire inspiration of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The preceding reasonings and testimonies seem of themselves sufficient
          to carry conviction to every attentive mind; but if we felt conscious
          of any need on our own part of having our belief of this truth
          fortified, we feel that we should not go so far in search of reasons.
          It would be enough for us to inquire what holy Scripture was in the
          view of God's apostles, and how far, according to their apprehension,
          its language was inspired. What, for example, were St Paul's
          sentiments on the subject? For we make no pretension to be more
          enlightened divines than the twelve apostles. Cleaving to the
          dogmatical theology of St Peter and the exegetical of St Paul, among
          all the systems ever broached on the inspiration of the Scriptures,
          theirs is what we have decidedly resolved to prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear, then, the apostle Paul when he quotes them, and proceeds to
          comment upon them. On such occasions he discusses their minutest
          expressions; and often, when about to deduce the most important
          consequences from them, he employs arguments which, were it we that
          should employ them in discussions with the doctors of the Socinian
          school, would be treated as childish or absurd. For such a respect for
          the words of the text, we should be sent back to the sixteenth century
          with its gross orthodoxy and its superannuated theology. Mark with
          what reverence the apostle dwells upon their most minute expressions;
          with what confidence he expects the submission of the Church, while he
          notes the use of such a word rather than of such another; with what
          studiousness and affection he as it were presses every one of them in
          his hands till the last drop of meaning has been obtained from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among so many examples which we might adduce, let us confine
          ourselves, for brevity's sake, to the Epistle to the Hebrews.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how, at verse 8th of chapter 2, after quoting these words, "Thou
          hast put all things under his feet," the sacred author argues from the
          authority of the word all.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how, at the 11th verse, in quoting the 22d Psalm, he argues from
          the expression my brethren, that the Son of God behoved to put on the
          nature of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how, at the 27th verse of chapter 12, in quoting the prophet
          Haggai, he argues from the word once more, "Yet once more."
        </p>
        <p>
          See at the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th verses, how largely he argues
          from these words my son, of the 3d chapter of the Proverbs, "My son,
          despise not thou the chastening of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          See how, at the 10th chapter, in quoting the 40th Psalm, he argues
          from the words Lo I come, set against the words, "Thou wouldest not."
        </p>
        <p>
          See how, at chapter 8, from the 8th to the 13th verses, in quoting
          Jeremiah 31:31, he argues from the word new.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, at chapter 3:7–19, and 4:2–11, with urgency in quoting the 95th
          Psalm, he argues from the word "to-day," from the words "I have
          sworn," and, above all, from the words "my rest," illustrated by that
          other expression of Genesis, "And God rested on the seventh day."
        </p>
        <p>
          See how, at chapter 3:2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, he argues from these words
          servant and my house, taken from the book of Numbers, "My servant
          Moses, who is faithful in all my house."
        </p>
        <p>
          See, especially at chapter 7, the use he makes successively of all the
          words of the 110th Psalm; mark how he takes up each of its
          expressions, one after another, in order to deduce from them the very
          highest doctrines: "The Lord hath sworn;" "he hath sworn by himself;"
          Thou art a priest;" "Thou art a priest for ever;" "Thou art a priest
          after the order of Melchisedec;" "of Melchisedec king of Sedec," and
          "of Melchisedec king of Salem." The exposition of the doctrines
          contained in each of these words will be found to occupy three
          chapters, the 5th, the 6th, and the 7th.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here I pause. Can we fail to conclude from such examples, that, in
          the view of the apostle Paul, the Scriptures were inspired by God,
          even to their most minute expressions? Let each of us, then, place
          himself in the school of the man to whom had been given, by the Spirit
          of God, the knowledge of the mystery of Christ, as to a holy apostle
          and prophet. One must necessarily either account him an enthusiast,
          and reject in his person the testimonies of the Holy Bible, or receive
          with him the precious and fruitful doctrine of the plenary inspiration
          of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          O ye who read these lines, to what school will ye attach yourselves?
          to that of the apostles, or to that of the doctors of this age? "If
          any man take away from the words of this book" (this I testify, says
          St John), "God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and
          out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this
          Book."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, farther, let us turn from the apostles, prophets as they are—men
          sent by God for the establishment of his kingdom, the pillars of the
          Church, the mouths of the Holy Ghost, ambassadors of Jesus Christ; let
          us, for an instant, turn from them as men who had not yet quite thrown
          off their Jewish traditions and clownish prejudices, and let us go to
          the Master. Let us inquire of him what the Scriptures were in his view
          of them. Here is the grand question. The testimonies to which we have
          appealed are peremptory, no doubt; and the doctrine of a plenary and
          entire inspiration is taught as clearly in Scripture as that of the
          resurrection of the dead can be; that ought of itself to be enough for
          us; but we repeat, nevertheless, here is an argument which for us
          renders all else superfluous. How did Jesus Christ appeal to the Holy
          Bible? What were his views of the letter of the Scriptures? What use
          did he make of it, he who is its object and inspirer, beginning and
          end, first and last? he whose Holy Spirit, says St Peter, animated all
          the prophets of the Old Testament (2 Peter 1:21), who was in heaven in
          the bosom of the Father at the same time that he was seen here below,
          dwelling among us and preaching the gospel to the poor? Among the most
          ardent defenders of their verbal inspiration, we know not one that
          ever expressed himself with more respect for the altogether divine
          authority and everlasting endurance of their most minute expressions
          than was done by the man Jesus. And we scruple not to say, that were
          any modern writer to quote the Bible, as Jesus Christ did, with the
          view of deducing from it any doctrine, he would forthwith have to be
          ranked among the most zealous partisans of the doctrine we defend. I
          am asked, What is your view of the Holy Letters? I answer, What
          thought my Master of them? how did he appeal to them? what use did he
          make of them? what were their smallest details in his eyes?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! speak to them thyself, Eternal Wisdom, Uncreated Word, Judge of
          judges! and as we proceed to repeat to them here the declarations of
          thy mouth, show them the majesty in which the Scriptures appeared to
          thee—show them the perfection thou didst recognise in them, that
          everlasting endurance, above all, which thou didst assign to their
          smallest iota, and which will make them outlast the universe, after
          the very heavens and the earth have passed away!
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not afraid to say it: when we hear the Son of God quote the
          Scriptures, every thing is said, in our view, on their divine
          inspiration —we need no farther testimony. All the declarations of the
          Bible are, no doubt, equally divine; but this example of the Saviour
          of the world has settled the question for us at once. This proof
          requires neither long nor learned researches; it is grasped by the
          hand of a child as powerfully as by that of a doctor. Should any
          doubt, then, assail your soul, let it turn to the Lord of lords; let
          it behold him in presence of the Scriptures!
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow Jesus in the days of his flesh. With what serious and tender
          respect does he constantly hold in his hands "the volume of the Book,"
          to quote every part of it, and note its shortest verses. See how one
          word, one single word, whether of a psalm or of an historical book,
          has for him the authority of a law. Mark with what confident
          submission he receives the whole Scriptures, without ever contesting
          its sacred canon; for he knows that "salvation cometh of the Jews,"
          and that, under the infallible providence of God, "to them were
          committed the oracles of God." Did I say, he receives them? From his
          childhood to the grave, and from his rising again from the grave to
          his disappearance in the clouds, what does he bear always about with
          him, in the desert, in the temple, in the synagogue? What does he
          continue to quote with his resuscitated voice, just as the heavens are
          about to exclaim, "Lift up your heads, ye everlasting doors, and the
          king of glory shall come in?" It is the Bible, ever the Bible; it is
          Moses, the Psalms, and the prophets: he quotes them, he explains them,
          but how? Why, verse by verse, and word by word.
        </p>
        <p>
          In what alarming and melancholy contrast, after beholding all this, do
          we see those misguided men present themselves in our days, who dare to
          judge, contradict, cull, and mutilate the Scriptures. Who does not
          tremble, after following with his eyes the Son of Man as he commands
          the elements, stills the storms, and opens the graves, while, filled
          with so profound a respect for the sacred volume, he declares that he
          is one day to judge by that book the quick and the dead? Who does not
          shudder, whose heart does not bleed, when, after observing this, we
          venture to step into a Rationalist academy, and see the professor's
          chair occupied by a poor mortal, learned, miserable, a sinner,
          responsible, yet handling God's Word irreverently; when we follow him
          as he goes through this deplorable task before a body of youths,
          destined to be the guides of a whole people—youths capable of doing so
          much good if guided to the heights of the faith, and so much mischief
          if tutored in disrespect for those Scriptures which they are one day
          to preach? With what peremptory decision do such men display the
          phantasmagoria of their hypotheses; they retrench, they add, they
          praise, they blame, and pity the simplicity which, reading the Bible
          as it was read by Jesus Christ, like him clings to every syllable, and
          never dreams of finding error in the Word of God! They pronounce on
          the intercalations and retrenchments that Holy Scripture must have
          undergone—intercalations and retrenchments never suspected by Jesus
          Christ; they lop off the chapters they do not understand, and point
          out blunders, ill-sustained or ill-concluded reasonings, prejudices,
          imprudences, and instances of vulgar ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          May God forgive my being compelled to put this frightful dilemma into
          words, but the alternative is inevitable! Either Jesus Christ
          exaggerated and spoke incoherently when he quoted the Scriptures thus,
          or these rash wretched men unwittingly blaspheme their divine majesty.
          It pains us to write these lines. God is our witness that we could
          have wished to recall, and then to efface them; but we venture to say,
          with profound feeling, that it is in obedience, it is in charity, that
          they have been penned. Alas! in a few short years both the doctors and
          the disciples will be laid in the tomb, they shall wither like the
          grass; but not one jot or tittle of that divine book will then have
          passed away; and as certainly as the Bible is the truth, and that it
          has changed the face of the world, as certainly shall we see the Son
          come in the clouds of heaven, and judge, by his eternal Word, the
          secret thoughts of all men! … "All flesh is as grass, and all the
          glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the
          flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth for
          ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you;"2
          this is the word which will judge us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, we proceed to close our proofs, by reviewing, under this
          aspect, the ministry of Jesus Christ. Let us follow him from the age
          of twelve to his descent into the grave, or rather, to his passing
          into the cloud, in which he went out of sight; and throughout the
          whole course of that incomparable career, let us see what the
          Scriptures were in the eye of Him who "upholds all things by the word
          of his power."
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, let us contemplate him at the age of twelve years. He
          grew, like one of the children of men, in wisdom and in stature; he is
          in the midst of the doctors in the temple of Jerusalem; he ravishes
          with his answers those who hear him; for, said they, "he knows the
          Scriptures without having studied them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold him from the time he commenced his ministry. See him filled
          with the Holy Ghost; he is led into the wilderness, there to sustain,
          as the first Adam did in Eden, a mysterious contest with the powers of
          darkness. The impure spirit dares to approach him, bent on his
          overthrow; but how will the Son of God repel him, even he who had come
          to destroy the works of the Devil? Solely with the Bible. His only
          weapon, three successive times, in his divine hands, is the sword of
          the Spirit, the Bible. He quotes, thrice successively, the Book of
          Deuteronomy. On every fresh temptation, he, the Word made flesh,
          defends himself by a sentence of the oracles of God, and by a
          sentence, too, the whole force of which lies in the use of a single
          word, or of two words; first of these words (ἄρτῳ μόνῳ), bread alone;
          then of those words, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord (οὐκ ἐκπειράσεις
          Κύριον);" then, finally, of these two words (θεὸν προσκυνήσεις), Thou
          shalt worship God.
        </p>
        <p>
          What an example for us! His whole reply, his whole defence is this:
          —"It is written;" "Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written;" and
          as soon as this terrible and mysterious contest closed, the angels
          drew near to minister to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, mark this farther, such was the respect of the Son of man for the
          authority of every word of the Scriptures, that the impure spirit
          himself, powerful as he was in evil, and who knew what all the words
          of the Bible were in his antagonist's eyes, could fancy no surer means
          of shaking his will than by quoting to him (but at the same time
          mutilating) a verse of the 91st psalm; and forthwith Jesus Christ, to
          confound him, thinks it is enough to reply once more with, "It is
          written."
        </p>
        <p>
          See how his priestly ministry commenced—with the use of the
          Scriptures; and see how his prophetic ministry commenced soon
          after—with the use of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once engaged in his work, let us follow him as he goes from place to
          place doing good, displaying in his poverty his creative power ever
          for the relief of others, never for his own. He speaks, and it is
          done; he casts out devils, he turns the storm into a calm, he raises
          the dead. Yet, amid all these tokens of greatness, observe what the
          Scriptures are to him. The Word is ever with him; not in his hands,
          for he knows it thoroughly, but in his memory and in his incomparable
          heart. Mark how he speaks of it! When he unrols the sacred volume, it
          is as if an opening were made in heaven, that we may hear Jehovah's
          voice. With what reverence, with what submission, does he expound the
          Scriptures, comment upon them, quote them word by word! See how it
          becomes his grand concern to heal men's diseases and to preach the
          Scriptures, as it was afterwards to die and to fulfil the Scriptures!
        </p>
        <p>
          See who comes, "as his custom was," into the synagogue on the
          Sabbath-day; for we are told he taught in their synagogues. He goes
          into that at Nazareth; and what do we find him doing there—he, the
          everlasting Wisdom, possessed by Jehovah in the beginning of his way,
          brought forth when there were no depths, before the mountains were
          settled, and before the hills?2 He rises and takes the Bible, opens it
          at Isaiah, reads some words there; then having closed the book, he
          sits down, and while the eyes of all that are in the synagogue are
          fastened on him, he begins to say, "This day is this Scripture
          fulfilled in your ears."
        </p>
        <p>
          See him as he passes through Galilee, and mark how he employs himself
          there. "The volume of the book" is still in his hands; he explains it
          line by line, word by word; he points out to our respect its most
          minute expressions, as he would those of "the ten words" uttered on
          Sinai.
        </p>
        <p>
          See him once more in Jerusalem, before the pool of Bethesda; what do
          we find him saying to the people? "Search the Scriptures."—(John
          5:39.)
        </p>
        <p>
          See him in the holy place, in the midst of which he had dared to say
          aloud, "In this place is one greater than the holy place."—(Matt.
          12:6.) Follow him into the presence of the Sadducees and the
          Pharisees, while he reprehends them successively with these words, "It
          is written," as he had done in the case of Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen to his reply to the Sadducees who denied the resurrection of
          the body. How does he refute them? By ONE SOLE WORD of an HISTORICAL
          passage of the Bible; by a single verb in the present tense, instead
          of that same verb in the past tense. "Ye greatly err," said he to
          them, "NOT KNOWING THE SCRIPTURES. Have ye not read that which was
          spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham!" It is thus
          that he proves to them the doctrine of the resurrection. God, on Mount
          Sinai, four hundred years after the death of Abraham, says to Moses,
          not "I was," but "I am" the God of Abraham; I am that now (אברהם אלחי
          אנכי), which the Holy Ghost translates—(Ἐγώ ἐιμι ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ). There
          is a resurrection, then; for God is not the God of a few handfuls of
          dust, the God of the dead, the God of nothing: he is the God of the
          living. Those men therefore are, in the view of God, still alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, behold him in the presence of the Pharisees. It is again by the
          letter of the Word that he proceeds to confound them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some had by this time followed him into the coasts of Judea beyond
          Jordan, and came to him asking to be informed what were his doctrines
          on the subject of marriage and divorce. Now, what followed on the part
          of Jesus Christ? He might certainly have given an authoritative reply,
          and announced his own laws on the subject. Is he not himself the King
          of kings and Lord of lords? But no; it was to the Bible that he made
          his appeal, still for the same purpose of making it the basis of
          doctrine; it was to these simple words taken from a purely historical
          passage in Genesis,—"HAVE YE NOT READ, that he which made them at the
          beginning made them male and female; so that they twain shall be one
          flesh? What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
          asunder."
        </p>
        <p>
          But listen to him, especially when in the temple he would prove to
          other Pharisees, by the Scriptures, the divinity of the expected
          Messiah. Here likewise, to demonstrate this, he still insists on the
          use of A SINGLE WORD, which he proceeds to take from the Book of
          Psalms: "If the Messiah be the son of David," said he, "how doth
          David, BY THE SPIRIT, call him LORD; saying (at the 110th Psalm), The
          Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand? If David then call
          him Lord, how is he his son?"
        </p>
        <p>
          How happens it, that among those Pharisees none was found to say in
          reply, "What! do you mean to insist on a single word, and still more
          on a term borrowed from a poesy eminently lyrical, where the royal
          Psalmist might, without material consequence, have employed too lively
          a construction, high-flown expressions, and words which, doubtless, he
          had not theologically pondered before throwing them into his verses?
          Would you follow such a mode of minutely interpreting each expression
          as is at once fanatical and servile? Would you worship the letter of
          the Scriptures to such an extreme? Would you build a whole doctrine
          upon a word?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I do, is Christ's reply; yes, I will throw myself on a single
          word, because that word is God's! And, to cut short all your
          objections, I tell you that it is BY THE SPIRIT that David wrote all
          the words of his hymns; and I ask you "how, if the Messiah be his son,
          David, BY THE SPIRIT, can call him his Lord, when he says, The Lord
          said unto my Lord?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Students of God's Word, and you especially who are to be his
          ministers, and who, as your preparation for preaching it, would desire
          first of all to have received it into a good and honest heart, behold
          what every saying, every single word of the Book of God, was in the
          regard of your Master. Go and do likewise!
        </p>
        <p>
          But more than this. Again let us listen to him, even on the cross.
          There he poured out his soul as an offering for sin; all his bones
          were out of joint; he was poured out as water; his heart was like wax,
          melted in the midst of his bowels; his tongue cleaved to his jaws; he
          was about to give up his spirit to his Father. But, previous to this,
          what do we find him do? He desires to collect his remaining strength,
          in order to recite a psalm which the Church of Israel had sung on her
          religious festivals for a thousand years, and which told over, one
          after another, all his sorrows and all his prayers: "Eli, Eli, lama
          sabachthani (my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me)?" He does even
          more than this: listen to him. There remained in the Scriptures one
          word which had not yet been fulfilled. Vinegar had still to be given
          him on that cross (this the Holy Ghost had declared a thousand years
          before in the 69th Psalm). "After this," it is written, "Jesus knowing
          that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be
          fulfilled, saith, I thirst. When Jesus therefore had received the
          vinegar, he said, It is finished: and having bowed his head, he gave
          up the ghost."
        </p>
        <p>
          When David sang the 69th Psalm on Shoshannim and the 22d Psalm on
          Aijeleth, did he know the prophetic meaning of all these words, of
          those hands and feet that were pierced, of that gall poured out, of
          that vinegar, of those garments that were parted, of that vesture on
          which a lot was cast, of that mocking populace, wagging their heads
          and making mouths? It matters little to us his understanding it; the
          Holy Ghost at least understood it, and David spake BY THE SPIRIT, said
          Jesus Christ. The heaven and the earth shall pass away; but there was
          not in that book a jot or tittle that could pass away till all was
          fulfilled.—(John 10:35; Matt. 5:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          Mean while, behold something, if possible, more striking still. Jesus
          Christ rises from the tomb; he has overcome death; he is about to
          return to the Father, there to resume that glory which he had with the
          Father before the world began. Let us follow him, then, during those
          fleeting moments with which he would still favour the earth. What
          words are now about to proceed from that mouth, again restored to
          life? Why, words from Holy Scripture. Still he quotes it, explains it,
          preaches it. See him, first of all, on the way to Emmaus, walking with
          Cleopas and his friend; afterwards in the upper chamber; and, later
          still, on the borders of the lake. How is he employed? In expounding
          the sacred books; he begins with Moses, he continues through all the
          Prophets and the Psalms; he shows them what had been said concerning
          him in all the Scriptures; he opens their minds to understand them; he
          makes their hearts burn within them as he speaks of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we have not yet done. All these quotations show us what the Holy
          Bible was in the eyes of Him "in whom are hid all the treasures of
          wisdom and knowledge" (Col. 2:3); and "by whom all things subsist"
          (Col. 1:17). But on the letter of the Scriptures, listen further to
          two declarations, and a last example of our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is easier," says he, "for heaven and earth to pass, than for one
          tittle (κεραία) of the law to fall; and by the law Jesus Christ
          understood the whole of the Scriptures, and even, more particularly,
          the Book of Psalms.2 What terms could possibly be imagined capable of
          expressing, with greater force and precision, the principle which we
          defend; that is to say, the authority, the entire divine inspiration,
          and the perpetuity of all the parts, and of the very letter of the
          Scriptures? Ye who study God's Word, here behold the theology of your
          Master! Be ye then divines after his manner; be your Bible the same as
          that of the Son of God! Of that not a single tittle can fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Till heaven and earth pass," saith he, "one jot or one tittle shall
          in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."—(Matt. 5:18.)
          All the words of the Scriptures, accordingly, even to the smallest
          stroke of a letter, are no less than the words OF JESUS CHRIST; for he
          hath also said, "Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall
          not pass away."—(Luke 21:33.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The impugners of these doctrines ask us if we are bold enough to
          maintain that Holy Scripture is a law of God even in its words, as
          hyssop, or as an oak, is a work of God even in its leaves. We reply,
          with all the Fathers of the Church, Yes, even in its "words, even to
          (ἰῶτα ἓν, ἢ μία κεραία) one jot or one tittle!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But, passing from these two declarations, let us finally direct our
          attention to a last example given by our Lord which we have not yet
          adduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is still Jesus Christ who is about to quote the Scriptures, but
          claiming for their smallest words such an authority, that one is
          compelled to rank him among the most ardent partisans of verbal
          inspiration, and that we do not think, that had we before us all the
          writings of divines the most uncompromising in their orthodoxy, we
          should any where find an example of more profound respect for the
          letter of Scripture, and for the plenitude of their divine
          inspiration. It was winter. Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's
          (the eastern) porch; the Jews came about him, upon which he said to
          them, "I give eternal life unto my sheep, and they shall never perish,
          neither shall any pluck them out of my hand: I and the Father are
          one." People were astonished at such language; but he assumed a still
          bolder tone, until at last the Jews, exclaiming that it was blasphemy,
          took up stones to stone him, telling him they did so, "because thou,
          being a man, makest thyself God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now then, let the reader carefully mark the several points involved in
          the answer made by Jesus Christ. He quotes a saying taken from one of
          the psalms, and proceeds to rest the whole of his doctrine on that
          single saying: for "he made himself equal with God," says John
          elsewhere (5:18). In maintaining the most sublime and most mysterious
          of his doctrines, and, in order to legitimitize the most extraordinary
          of his pretensions, he appeals to certain words in the 82d Psalm. But,
          mark well! before pronouncing the words he takes care to interrupt
          himself; he pauses in a solemn parenthesis, and exclaims in a tone of
          authority, And the Scripture cannot be broken (και ὸ ὐ δύναται λυθῆναι
          ἡ γραφή)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Has sufficient attention been paid to this? Not only is our Lord's
          argument here founded entirely on the use made by the Psalmist of a
          single word, and not only does he proceed to establish the most
          astonishing of his doctrines on this expression; but further, in thus
          quoting the Book of Psalms in order to make us understand that in his
          eyes the whole book was dictated by the Holy Ghost, and that every
          word of it carried the authority of the law, Jesus calls it by the
          name of LAW, and says to the Jews, "Is it not written in your law, I
          have said ye are gods?" These words are placed in the middle of a
          hymn; they might seem to have escaped from the unreflecting fervour of
          the prophet Asaph, or from the burning raptures of his poetry. And
          were we not to admit the full inspiration of all that is written, one
          might be tempted to tax them with indiscretion, since the imprudent
          use which the Psalmist may have made of them, might have led the
          people to usages elsewhere censured by the Word of God, and to
          idolatrous imaginations. How then, once more we ask, was there no
          rationalist scribe from the universities of Israel to be found there,
          under Solomon's porch, to say to him, "You cannot, Lord, claim the
          authority of that expression. The use that Asaph makes of it can have
          been neither considerate nor becoming. Although inspired as respects
          the thoughts suggested by his piety, he no doubt did not maturely
          weigh every little word with a very scrupulous regard to the use that
          might possibly be made of them a thousand years after his own day. It
          were rash, therefore, to insist upon them."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, let the reader mark, how our Lord anticipates the profane
          rashness of such an objection. Observe well: he solemnly reproves it;
          he proceeds to pronounce words concerning himself which would be
          blasphemy in the mouth of an archangel. "I and the Father are one;"
          but he interrupts himself, and immediately after saying, "Is it not
          written in your law, ye are gods?" he stops, and, fixing his eyes with
          a look of authority on the doctors who surround him, he exclaims, "AND
          THE SCRIPTURE CANNOT BE BROKEN!" As if he had said, "Beware! there is
          not in the sacred books a single word to be found fault with, nor a
          single word that one can neglect. This which I cite in this 82d Psalm,
          has been traced by the hand that made the heavens." If, then, he has
          been willing to give the name of gods to men, in so far as they were
          christs (anointed ones), and types of the true Christ, who is
          emphatically the Anointed One, and taking care nevertheless to call to
          mind "that they should die like men," how shall it not still more
          appertain to me to take that name to myself? I, "the everlasting
          Father," Emmanuel, the God-man, who do the works of my Father, and on
          whom the Father hath put his seal?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, we ask of every serious reader (and our argument, be it
          well observed, is altogether independent of the orthodox meaning or
          the Socinian meaning people may choose to give to the words of Jesus
          Christ); we ask, Is it possible to admit that the Being who makes such
          a use of the Scriptures DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR PLENARY VERBAL
          INSPIRATION? And if he could have imagined that the words of the Bible
          were left to the free choice and pious fancies of the sacred writers,
          would he ever have dreamed of founding such arguments on such a word?
          The Lord Jesus, our Saviour and our Judge, believed then in the most
          complete inspiration of the Scriptures; and for him the first rule of
          all hermeneutics, and the commencement of all exegesis, was this
          simple maxim applied to the most minute expressions of the written
          word, "AND THE SCRIPTURE CANNOT BE BROKEN."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let, then, the Prince of Life, the light of the world, reckon all of
          us as his scholars! What he believed let us receive. What he respected
          let us revere. Let us press to our sickly hearts that Word to which he
          submitted his saviour heart, and all the thoughts of his holy
          humanity, and to it let us subject all the thoughts of our fallen
          humanity. There let us look for God, even in its minutest passages; in
          it let us daily dip the roots of our being, "like the tree planted by
          the rivers of waters, which bringeth forth his fruit in his season,
          and his leaf shall not wither."
