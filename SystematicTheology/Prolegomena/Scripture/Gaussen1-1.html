        <h2>I. Definition of Theopneustia</h2>
        <p>
          This term is used for the mysterious power which the Divine Spirit put
          forth on the authors of the scriptures of the Old and New Testament,
          in order to their composing these as they have been received by the
          Church of God at their hands. "All Scripture," says an apostle, "is
          theopneustic."
        </p>
        <p>
          This Greek expression, at the time when St Paul employed it, was new
          perhaps even among the Greeks; yet though the term was not used among
          the idolatrous Greeks, such was not the case among the Hellenistic
          Jews. The historian Josephus, a contemporary of St Paul's, employs
          another closely resembling it in his first book against Apion, when,
          in speaking of all the prophets who composed, says he, the twenty-two
          sacred books of the Old Testament,2 he adds, that they wrote according
          to the pneustia (or the inspiration) that comes from God. And the
          Jewish philosopher Philo,4 himself a contemporary of Josephus, in the
          account he has left us of his embassy to the emperor Caius, making
          use, in his turn, of an expression closely resembling that of St Paul,
          calls the Scriptures "theochrest oracles;" that is to say, oracles
          given under the agency and dictation of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theopneustia is not a system, it is a fact; and this fact, like every
          thing else that has taken place in the history of redemption, is one
          of the doctrines of our faith.
