        <h2>II. The Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
        <p>
          Meanwhile it is of consequence for us to say, and it is of consequence
          that it be understood, that this miraculous operation of the Holy
          Ghost had not the sacred writers themselves for its object—for these
          were only his instruments, and were soon to pass away; but that its
          objects were the holy books themselves, which were destined to reveal
          from age to age, to the Church, the counsels of God, and which were
          never to pass away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power then put forth on those men of God, and of which they
          themselves were sensible only in very different degrees, has not been
          precisely defined to us. Nothing authorizes us to explain it.
          Scripture has never presented either its manner or its measure as an
          object of study. What it offers to our faith is solely the inspiration
          of what they say—the divinity of the book they have written. In this
          respect it recognises no difference among them. What they say, they
          tell us, is theopneustic: their book is from God. Whether they recite
          the mysteries of a past more ancient than the creation, or those of a
          future more remote than the coming again of the Son of man, or the
          eternal counsels of the Most High, or the secrets of man's heart, or
          the deep things of God—whether they describe their own emotions, or
          relate what they remember, or repeat contemporary narratives, or copy
          over genealogies, or make extracts from uninspired documents —their
          writing is inspired, their narratives are directed from above; it is
          always God who speaks, who relates, who ordains or reveals by their
          mouth, and who, in order to this, employs their personality in
          different measures: for "the Spirit of God has been upon them," it is
          written, "and his word has been upon their tongue." And though it be
          always the word of man, since they are always men who utter it, it is
          always, too, the word of God, seeing that it is God who superintends,
          employs, and guides them. They give their narratives, their doctrines,
          or their commandments, "not with the words of man's wisdom, but with
          the words taught by the Holy Ghost;" and thus it is that God himself
          has not only put his seal to all these facts, and constituted himself
          the author of all these commands, and the revealer of all these
          truths, but that, further, he has caused them to be given to his
          Church in the order, and in the measure, and in the terms which he has
          deemed most suitable to his heavenly purpose.

          Were we asked, then, how this work of divine inspiration has been
          accomplished in the men of God, we should reply, that we do not know;
          that it does not behove us to know; and that it is in the same
          ignorance, and with a faith quite of the same kind, that we receive
          the doctrine of the new birth and sanctification of a soul by the Holy
          Ghost. We believe that the Spirit enlightens that soul, cleanses it,
          raises it, comforts it, softens it. We perceive all these effects; we
          admire and we adore the cause; but we have found it our duty to be
          content never to know the means by which this is done. Be it the same,
          then, with regard to divine inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          And were we, further, called to say at least what the men of God
          experienced in their bodily organs, in their will, or in their
          understandings, while engaged in tracing the pages of the sacred book,
          we should reply, that the powers of inspiration were not felt by all
          to the same degree, and that their experiences were not at all
          uniform; but we might add, that the knowledge of such a fact bears
          very little on the interests of our faith, seeing that, as respects
          that faith, we have to do with the book, and not with the man. It is
          the book that is inspired, and altogether inspired: to be assured of
          this ought to satisfy us.
