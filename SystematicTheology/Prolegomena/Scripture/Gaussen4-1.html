        <h2>I. The Translations</h2>
        <p>
          The first objection may be stated thus. It is sometimes said to us,
          You assert that the inspiration of the Scriptures extended to the very
          words of the original text; but wherefore all this verbal exactness of
          the Holy Word, seeing that, after all, the greater number of
          Christians can make use of such versions only as are more or less
          inexact? Thus, then, the privilege of such an inspiration is lost to
          the Church of modern times; for you will not venture to say that any
          translation is inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a difficulty which, on acount of its insignificance, we felt
          at first averse to noticing; but we cannot avoid doing so, being
          assured that it has obtained some currency among us, and some credit
          also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first remark on this objection must be, that it is not one at all.
          It does not bear against the fact of the verbal inspiration of the
          Scriptures; it only contests the advantages of that inspiration. With
          regard to the greater number of readers, it says, the benefit of such
          an intervention on the part of God, would be lost; because, instead of
          the infallible words of the original, they never can have better than
          the fallible words of a translation. But no man is entitled to deny a
          fact, because he does not at first perceive all the use that may be
          made of it; and no man is entitled to reject a doctrine for no better
          reason than that he has not perceived its utility. All the
          expressions, for example, and all the letters of the Ten Commandments
          were certainly written by the finger of God, from the aleph with which
          they commence, to the caph with which they end; yet, would any one
          venture to say that the credibility of this miraculous fact, is
          weakened by most unlettered readers, at the present day, being under
          the necessity of reading the Decalogue in some translation? No one
          would dare to say so. It must be acknowledged, then, that this
          objection, without directly attacking the dogma which we defend, only
          questions its advantages: these, it tells us, are lost to us, in the
          operation of translating from the original, and in that metamorphosis
          disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          We proceed, then, to show how even this assertion, when reduced to
          these last terms, rests on no good foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The divine word which the Bible reveals to us, passes through four
          successive forms before reaching us in a translation. First, it was
          from all eternity in the mind of God. Next, it was passed by Him into
          the mind of man. In the third place, under the operation of the Holy
          Ghost, and by a mysterious process, it passed from the prophets'
          thoughts, into the types and symbols of an articulate language; it
          took shape in words. Finally, after having undergone this first
          translation, alike important and inexplicable, men have reproduced and
          counter-chalked it, by a new translation, in passing it from one human
          language into another human language. Of these four operations, the
          three first are divine; the fourth alone is human and fallible. Shall
          it be said, that because the last is human, the divinity of the three
          former should be a matter of indifference to us? Mark, however, that
          between the third and the fourth—I mean to say, between the first
          translation of the thought by the sensible signs of a human language,
          and the second translation of the words by other words—the difference
          is enormous. Between the doubts that may cleave to us respecting the
          exactness of the versions, and those with which we should be racked
          with respect to the correctness of the original text (if not inspired
          even in its language), the distance is infinite. It is said; of what
          consequence is it to me that the third operation is effected by the
          Spirit of God, if the last be accomplished only by the spirit of man?
          In other words, what avails it to me that the primitive language be
          inspired, if the translated version be not so? But people forget, in
          speaking thus, that we are infinitely more assured of the exactness of
          the translators, than we could be of that of the original text, in the
          case of all the expressions not being given by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this, however, we may become perfectly convinced, by attending to
          the five following considerations:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The operation by which the sacred writers express with words the
          mind of the Holy Ghost, is, we have said, itself a rendering not of
          words by other words, but of divine thoughts by sensible symbols. Now
          this first translation is an infinitely nicer matter, more mysterious
          and more liable to error (if God puts not his hand to it) than the
          operation can be afterwards, by which we should render a Greek word of
          that primitive text, by its equivalent in another tongue. In order to
          a man's expressing exactly the thought of God, it is necessary, if he
          be not guided in his language from above, that he have thoroughly
          comprehended it in its just measure, and in the whole extent and depth
          of its meaning. But this is by no means necessary in the case of a
          mere translation. The divine thought being already incarnated, as it
          were, in the language of the sacred text, what remains to be done in
          translation is no longer the giving of it a body, but only the
          changing of its dress, making it say in French what it had already
          said in Greek, and modestly substituting for each of its words an
          equivalent word. Such an operation is comparatively very inferior,
          very immaterial, without mystery, and infinitely less subject to error
          than the preceding. It even requires so little spirituality, that it
          may be performed to perfection by a trustworthy pagan who should
          possess in perfection a knowledge of both languages. The version of an
          accomplished rationalist who desires to be no more than a translator,
          I could better trust than that of an orthodox person and a saint, who
          should paraphrase the text, and undertake to present it to me more
          complete or more clear in his French than he found it in the Greek or
          in the Hebrew of the original. And let no one be surprised at this
          assertion; it is justified by facts. Thus, is not De Wette's
          translation, among the Germans, preferred at the present day to that
          even of the great Luther? At least, is there not greater confidence
          felt in having the mind of the Holy Ghost in the lines of the Basel
          professor than in those of the great reformer; because the former has
          always kept very close to the expressions of his text, as a man of
          learning subject to the rules of philology alone; while the latter
          seems at times to have momentarily endeavoured after something more,
          and sought to make himself interpreter as well as translator? The
          more, then, one reflects on this first consideration, the more
          immeasurable ought the difference to appear between these two orders
          of operations; to wit, between the translation of the divine thoughts
          into the words of a human language, and the translation of the same
          thoughts into the equivalent terms of another language. No longer,
          therefore, be it said, "What avails it to me, if the one be human,
          that the other is divine?"
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A second character by which we perceive how different these two
          operations must be, and by which the making of our versions will be
          seen to be infinitely less subject to the chances of error than the
          original text (assuming that to be uninspired), is, that while the
          work required by our translations is done by a great many men of every
          tongue and country, capable of devoting their whole time and care to
          it—by men who have from age to age controlled and checked each other,
          and who have mutually instructed and perfected each other— the
          original text, on the contrary, behoved to be written at a given
          moment, and by a single man. With that man there was none but his God
          to put him right if he made a mistake, and to supply him with better
          expressions if he had chosen imperfect ones. If God, therefore, did
          not do this, no one could have done it. And if that man gave a bad
          rendering of the mind of the Holy Ghost, he had not, like our
          translators, friends to warn, predecessors to guide, successors to
          correct, nor months, years, and ages in which to review and consummate
          his work. It was done by one man, and done once for all. This
          consideration, then, further shows how much more necessary the
          intervention of the Holy Ghost was to the sacred authors than to their
          translators.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A third consideration, which ought also to lead us to the same
          conclusion, is, that while all the translators of the Scriptures were
          literate and laborious persons, and versed in the study of language,
          the sacred authors, on the contrary, were, for the most part, ignorant
          men, without literary cultivation, without the habit of writing their
          own tongue, and liable, from that very circumstance, if they expressed
          fallibly the divine revelation, to give us an infallible thought in a
          faulty way.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A fourth very powerful consideration, which will make one feel
          still more sensibly the immense difference existing between the sacred
          writers and their translators, is, that whereas the thought from God
          passed like a flash of lightning before the soul of the prophet;
          whereas this thought could nowhere be found again upon earth, except
          in the rapid expression which was then given to it by the sacred
          writer; whereas, if he have expressed it ill, you know not where to go
          in search of its prototype in order to recover the thought meant to be
          conveyed by God in its purity; whereas, if he have made a mistake, his
          blunder is for ever irreparable; it must last longer than heaven and
          earth, it has blemished the eternal book remedilessly, and nobody on
          earth can correct it;—it is quite otherwise with translators. These,
          on the contrary, have always the divine text at hand, so as to be
          corrected and re-corrected, according to the eternal type, until they
          have become an exact counterpart of it. The inspired word leaves us
          not; we need not to go in search of it to the third heaven; it is
          still upon the earth, just as God himself first dictated it to us. You
          may thus devote ages to its study, in order that the human process of
          our translation may be subjected to its immutable truth. You can now,
          after the lapse of a hundred and thirty years, correct Osterwald and
          Martin, by means of a closer comparison of them with their infallible
          standard; after the lapse of three hundred and seventeen years, you
          can correct the work of Luther; after that, of fourteen hundred and
          forty years, that of St Jerome. God's phraseology is still before us,
          with which to confront our modern versions, as dictated by God
          himself, in Hebrew or in Greek, on the day of its being revealed; and,
          with our dictionaries in your hand, you may, age after age, return to
          the examination of the infallible expression which it has been his
          good pleasure to give to the divine thought, until you become assured
          that the language of the modern ones has truly received the counter
          impression, and given you the most faithful fac-simile of it for your
          own use. Say no more then, What avails it to me, that the one is
          divine since the other is human? If you would have a bust of Napoleon,
          would you say to the sculptor, What avails it to me that your model
          has been moulded at St Helena on the very face of Bonaparte, seeing
          that, after all, your copy cannot have been so?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In fine, what further distinguishes the first expression which the
          mind of God has received in the individual words of the sacred book,
          from its new expression in one of our translations, is that, if you
          assume the words of the one to be as little inspired as those of the
          other, nevertheless, the range of conjectures which you might make on
          their possible faults would be, as respects the original text, a space
          without bounds and ever enlarging itself; while that same range, as
          respects the translations, is a very limited space, which is
          constantly diminishing the longer you remain in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If some friend, returning from the East Indies, where your father has,
          at a great distance from you, breathed his last, were to bring you
          from him a last letter, written with his own hand, or dictated by him,
          word for word, in Bengalee, would that letter's being entirely from
          him be a matter of indifference to you, because you are not acquainted
          with the Bengalee language, and can read it only in a translation?
          Don't you know that you can cause translations of it to be multiplied,
          until they leave you no more doubt of the original meaning than if you
          had been a Hindoo? Will you not allow, that after each of these new
          translations your uncertainties will be always growing less and less,
          until they cease to be appreciable, as is the case in arithmetic with
          those fractionary and convergent progressions, the last terms of which
          are equivalent to zero; while, on the contrary, if the letter were not
          from your father himself, but from some stranger, who says he has only
          reproduced his thoughts, then you would find no limits to possible
          suppositions; and your uncertainties, transported into spheres new and
          boundless, would go on increasing the more you allowed your mind to
          dwell upon them; as is the case in arithmetic with those ascending
          progressions, the last terms of which represent infinitude. It is the
          same with the Bible. If I believe that God has dictated the whole of
          it, my uncertainties with respect to its translations are confined
          within a very narrow range; and even in this range, in proportion as
          it is re-translated, the limits of doubt are constantly drawn in more
          closely. But if left to think, on the contrary, that God has not
          entirely dictated it, and that human infirmity may have had its share
          in it, where shall I stop in assuming that there may be errors? I know
          not. The apostles were ignorant—shall I say, they were illiterate—they
          were Jews; they had popular prejudices; they judaized; they
          platonized; … I know not where to stop. I will begin like Locke, and
          end like Strauss. I will first deny the personality of Satan, as a
          rabbinical prejudice; I will end with denying that of Jesus Christ, as
          another prejudice. Between these two terms, in consequence, moreover,
          of the ignorance, on many points, to which the apostles were subject,
          I will proceed, as so many others have done, to admit, in spite of the
          letter of the Bible, and with the Bible in my hand, that there is no
          corruption in men, no personality in the Holy Ghost, no divinity in
          Jesus Christ, no expiation in his blood, no resurrection of the body
          in the grave, no eternity in future punishments, no anger in God, no
          devil, no miracle, no damned souls, no hell. St Paul was orthodox,
          shall I say? as others have done; but he misunderstood his Master.
          Whereas, on the contrary, if all have been dictated by God in the
          original, and even to the smallest expression, "to the least iota and
          tittle," who is the translator that could seduce me, by his labours,
          into any one of these negations, and make even the least of these
          truths disappear from my Bible?
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, who now can fail to perceive the enormous distance
          interposed by all these considerations between those two texts (that
          of the Bible and that of the translations), as respects the importance
          of verbal inspiration? Between the passing of the thoughts of God into
          human words, and the simple turning of these words into other words,
          the distance is as wide as from heaven to earth. God was required for
          the one; man sufficed for the other. Let it no longer be said, then,
          What would it avail to us that we have verbal inspiration in the one
          case, if we have not that inspiration in the other case? for between
          these two terms, which some would put on an equality, the difference
          is almost infinite.
