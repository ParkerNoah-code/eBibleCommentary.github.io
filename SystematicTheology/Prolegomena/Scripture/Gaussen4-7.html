        <h2>VII. The Declarations of Paul himself</h2>
        <p>
          It is idle to dream of disputing the fact of a partial and
          intermittent inspiration in the Scriptures (we are sometimes told)
          since the apostle Paul himself has clearly decided the question. Has
          he not carefully, in point of fact, distinguished what he pronounced
          by inspiration from what he advanced in his own name only, as a simple
          believer? And do we not find him, in his First Epistle to the
          Corinthians, express this distinction in the clearest manner, and
          three several times, on the occasion of the several questions that had
          been addressed to him on the subject of marriage?
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, at the 25th verse of chapter 7, when he says in so many
          terms, "Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord;
          yet I give AN ADVICE as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be
          faithful;"
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, at the 10th verse, when he writes, "And unto the married I
          command (NOT I, BUT THE LORD), Let not the wife depart from her
          husband, and let not the husband put away his wife;"
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, at the 12th verse, where he adds, "But to the rest speak
          I, not the Lord (I, AND NOT THE LORD), If any brother hath a wife that
          believeth not, … let him not put her away," &c.
        </p>
        <p>
          One sees clearly, then, say the objectors, from these three sentences,
          that there are in the apostle's epistles, passages that are Paul's,
          and other passages that are God's; that is to say, inspired passages
          and others that are not so.
        </p>
        <p>The reply is easy.</p>
        <p>
          No sooner do we examine more narrowly into the passages on which the
          objection is laid, than we perceive that they cannot be legitimately
          employed against the doctrine of a plenary inspiration. Far from
          imposing limits on the divinity of the apostolic sayings, these
          verses, on the contrary, hold a language which the most entire and
          sovereign inspiration alone could authorize. Paul could not speak thus
          without putting his epistles, as Peter has done, I was about to say
          "ON A LEVEL with THE OTHER holy Scriptures," we must say ABOVE them
          (inasmuch as he gives utterance there to a more recent and more
          obligatory expression of the Lord's desires). We proceed to judge how
          far this is the case. What is it that, in this 7th chapter, the
          apostle of Jesus Christ does? He treats three cases of conscience. As
          to one of these cases, God, says he, has neither commanded nor
          interdicted any thing. "He that marrieth his virgin sinneth not. I am
          not, therefore, charged with any order; but, in my character as an
          apostle, it is only an advice that I have to give you on the Lord's
          part,"—and he then takes care to add, at the 40th verse, "And I think,
          also, that I have the Spirit of God." The Lord, therefore, here
          desires to leave you free, says the apostle; he would not lay a snare
          for you; and if you do not think yourselves bound to follow the
          general advice that is given you, you violate no commandment—you sin
          not. Only, he who marries does well; he who marries not, does better.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the other case, on the contrary, beware; FOR THERE IS A
          COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD. The Lord has already pronounced his will
          (Matt. 5:31, 32; Mal. 2:14, 15); and I have nothing new to declare
          unto you: the Old Testament and Jesus Christ have spoken. It is NOT I,
          therefore, the apostle of Jesus Christ, it is THE LORD who has already
          made known his will to you: "To such Christians as are married, I
          command (not I, but the Lord), that the wife depart not from her
          husband, and that the husband put not away his wife."—(Verses 10, 11.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as for the third case, that is to say, as respects the brethren
          who may find themselves united to unbelieving wives, you have a
          commandment of the Lord's under the Old Testament; "I have repealed
          it; and I think that I have the Spirit of God! I abolish, therefore,
          the old order of things, and am commissioned to put a contrary order
          in its place. It is not the Lord (v. 12), that tells you to keep with
          you an unbelieving wife; it is I, Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ,
          not of men, neither by man, but by God the Father, and by Jesus
          Christ, whom he raised from the dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, we see it as clear as noonday, that the apostle, instead
          of appealing to the Lord's utterance of old, repeals it, in order to
          substitute an opposite order in its place; so that this passage, far
          from invalidating inspiration, fully confirms it; seeing that it would
          amount to the most outrageous blasphemy, if the apostle had not felt
          that in holding this language he was the mouth of God, and had he
          ventured to say of his own proper authority, "It is not the Lord, IT
          IS I! I, I say, and not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving
          wife, let him not send her away!"—The Lord had said the very contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must acknowledge, then, that these verses of St Paul, far from
          giving their sanction to the supposition of any human mixture in the
          writings of the New Testament, stand there to attest to us that in
          their epistles, and in the most familiar details of their epistles,
          the apostles were the mouth of God, and placed themselves, not only in
          the same line with Moses and the ancient prophets, but, further, above
          them; inasmuch as a second expression of God's will ought to take
          precedence of that which went before it; and as the New Testament
          ought, to surpass the Old, if not in excellence, at least in
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have heard some persons still further oppose to us, as an admission
          of the intermittence and imperfection of his inspiration, those words
          of St Paul, in which, after having told the Corinthians of his having
          been caught up into the third heaven, he adds, "Whether in the body or
          out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth." "Can it be supposed," it
          has been said, "that the Holy Ghost knew not how this miracle was
          performed? Necessarily, therefore, we must refer such a verse to Paul,
          not to God."
        </p>
        <p>
          We reply, that though the Holy Ghost was not ignorant of it, Paul was;
          and that the Holy Ghost desired that Paul himself should tell us of
          his ignorance. Can it be forgotten that God has never ceased, in
          revealing himself to us in the Scriptures, to employ the personality
          of the sacred writers, and that it is under this form that he has
          desired almost constantly to instruct his Church? When David,
          "speaking by the Spirit," exclaims in the Psalms, "that he
          acknowledges his transgressions, and that his sin is ever before him,
          and that he was shapen in iniquity," it is not the Holy Ghost,
          doubtless, that acknowledges his own transgressions, and that has his
          own sin before his eyes; but it is the Holy Ghost that put, for our
          sakes, those expressions of repentance in the heart and on the lips of
          his humbled prophet. It was in an analogous sense, then, that He could
          make St Paul say, "Whether in the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth."
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not yet done, however, with these objections. There still
          remain three more, which we have called evasions; because, instead of
          resting, like the former, on some certain argument, or facts, they are
          rather systems by which people imagine they can withdraw a part of the
          Scriptures from the action of the divine inspiration. It remains for
          us, therefore, to examine these.
