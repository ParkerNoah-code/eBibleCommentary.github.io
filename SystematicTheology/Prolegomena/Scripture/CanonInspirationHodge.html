        <h2>Lecture 4. The Holy Scriptures—The Canon and Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          I. I AM to speak this afternoon of the Bible, its genesis and its
          inspiration. The word "Bible" means book, the word "Scripture" means
          writing, and it is by the common consent of men that these words are
          applied to this one subject, because it is a Book of books, and
          because, beyond all comparison, it is the Writing of writings. It is
          the most important of all books, because, as a matter of historical
          fact, this book, more than any other force, has moulded the character
          of the great nations of the world and given birth to what we call the
          modern or Western civilization; because all historic churches, with
          one accord, declare it to be the foundation of their creeds—declare
          that this book is the Word of God; because, in spite of all our
          divisions, the whole Church really accepts this book as the only
          infallible and divinely authoritative rule of our faith and practice;
          and because it is, between all Christians, the standard of appeal on
          all subjects of debate, the only common ground upon which we stand,
          the only court of last resort.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. On what presuppositions does our doctrine rest? In every problem
          there are two elements—the a priori element of principle and the a
          posteriori element of fact. To this there is no exception in any of
          the problems of philosophy or of science or of theology. The a priori
          question of principle must be taken first, and will condition the
          whole argument. We must, before we take up the subject of the Bible,
          first take up the questions, Is there a God? Does he exist? What
          relation does he sustain to the universe? Can he reveal himself to
          man? Has he made a revelation of himself to man? Are men capable of
          receiving a divine revelation through the means of a book?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is held, on the basis of all the presuppositions of Atheism,
          of Materialism, of Agnosticism, and even of the old Deism, that it is
          absolutely absurd to talk of any supernatural revelation of God, or of
          any Bible as either containing or being the Word of God. I want,
          however, to assure the laymen who have not investigated these
          questions that nine-tenths of all the objections which men are making
          now to the Scriptures, in which they claim that the progress of
          knowledge, the progress of civilization, the progress of science, the
          progress of critical investigation, the vast aggregate of historical
          knowledge, all are sweeping away the foundations of our ancient faith
          in the Bible,—I wish to assure them that, these objections are not
          only untrue, but absurd. Those that are made are not founded upon
          facts, but are founded upon a priori philosophical principles. Neither
          science nor history nor criticism bears any testimony against the
          divine origin of the Bible. I appeal with confidence to the a priori
          principles of a contrary philosophy. We must meet them on their own
          ground, and appeal from the postulates of a false philosophy to the
          postulates of a true. We have as much right to believe our philosophy
          as they have to believe theirs. Renan, for instance, begins his
          discussion upon the Epistles with this assumption: "The supernatural
          is impossible;" therefore the supernatural is unhistorical, and
          therefore any piece of literature that claims to convey to us
          supernatural information must so far forth be incorrect and be the
          subject of correction by critical hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see that this is a mere assumption, and the whole principle on
          which it rests is that which underlies the philosophy, atheistic,
          materialistic, agnostic or deistic, of these errorists; and if this be
          swept away not only all the foundations for such a claim, but all
          color of presumption on which it rests, is swept away at once.
          Doubtless there are very many men of great ability who are perfectly
          honest who hold to this belief. They are thoroughly convinced of the
          principles of their a priori philosophy, and these principles are
          evidently inconsistent with the truths of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we discard the unproved assumptions, we invalidate their
          conclusions. There are others who ought to be treated kindly: they are
          thoroughly convinced, but they are half-educated, timid souls who are
          confused in this babel of tongues, and who do not know the
          deceitfulness of materialistic belief—who are inclined to believe in
          the ancient faith, but are also under pressure from the arrogant
          claims of philosophy. For such have great consideration, and instead
          of repelling them by words draw them to you by the Spirit of Christ,
          and by showing that you not only believe intellectually, but that you
          have a ground of assurance in your inward experience, in the testimony
          of the Holy Ghost, which must excite respect and confidence in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in beginning this argument I wish to claim, first, the truth of
          all that I have said in the three preceding lectures. You see,
          therefore, the logical reason for the order I adopted. I claim, as
          preliminary to the discussion of the doctrine of holy Scripture, the
          truths of the principles already established: to wit, there is a God;
          this God possesses the attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence,
          infinitude, etc.; he is everywhere present; immanent in all things at
          all times; working continuously and universally through all things
          from within. He is also transcendent and extra-mundane, acting upon
          the world from without on such points and at such times as he wills.
          The whole order of providence and of moral government, whether
          natural, supernatural or gracious, is presupposed in this argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a man does not believe in God as omnipresent and as active in all
          his creatures, if he does not believe that man is a free moral agent
          under the moral government of God, who is a holy, just and benevolent
          Ruler, then this lecture is not intended for him. But if a man does so
          believe we challenge him to present objections to the catholic
          doctrine of the Word of God which will be at the same time rational
          and consistent with Christian Theism.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. How do we Ascertain the Constituent Parts of Scripture?—i. e. how
          do we (1) ascertain the several books which make up the canon? and (2)
          how do we ascertain the words which make up the correct text of those
          books? I can of course attempt only a very bare sketch of what should
          be the full and critically-learned answer to these questions. You all
          fully understand that they fall outside of the particular department
          of study to which my life has been devoted. The amount of the highest
          talent and learning consecrated within the Christian Church to the
          defence and elucidation of the sacred Scriptures would infinitely
          surprise the cheap and shallow critics who are vociferously claiming
          that its pretensions have been disproved. They should remember that a
          few frogs in a swamp make incomparably more noise than all the herds
          of cattle browsing upon a hundred hills. Yet none are deceived, except
          the frogs themselves. In Princeton Theological Seminary the study of
          the subjects embraced within this single lecture consume the larger
          part of three years of study and the entire attention of four learned
          and able professors.
        </p>
        <p>
          (A.) 1. How do we Ascertain what Books Constitute the Canon of the Old
          Testament? The New Testament came into existence in an age in which a
          contemporaneous literature existed thoroughly illuminated by the light
          of history. But the Old Testament contains the very oldest extant
          literature of the world. It inaugurates human history, and therefore
          cannot, in its earliest contents, be verified by contemporaneous
          testimonies. It is only in its later periods that it receives
          confirmation unquestionable from the monuments of Egypt and the
          cylinders of Assyria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, we are certain that we have the very same canon which
          Christ recognized when he said to his disciples, and through them to
          us, "Search the Scriptures;.… they are they which testify of me." The
          very books which we have now are the very books to which Christ
          appealed. He cited them (1) by their classes, as "the Law," "the Law
          and the Prophets;" and (2) he quoted the writings severally, and
          attributed them to their respective authors—as to Moses, to David and
          to Esaias. The same was done by the inspired writers of the New
          Testament. That the canon endorsed by Christ is the very canon we now
          possess we know to our absolute certainty; by the Septuagint
          translation made nearly three hundred years before Christ, by the
          Hebrew Bible jealously guarded by the Jews from the earliest ages to
          the present time, from the testimony of Philo and of Josephus, the
          great Jewish writers of the first Christian century, and from the
          earliest Latin and Syriac translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to this point, indeed, there is no controversy. The simple question
          remains, which to real Christians is no question, whether the
          testimony of Christ our Lord is sufficient to establish the fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How do we Ascertain the True Text of the Several Books which
          Constitute this Canon? Our reliance here also is upon the guarantee of
          Christ. We are sure that we possess the Masoretic text which was
          collected and recorded by the Masorets from the fifth century onward.
          These were great Jewish scholars, who searched all manuscripts open to
          them, not to form a new text, but to ascertain the true text in the
          material that had descended to them. The Targums and the Talmud also
          make it certain that the text we now have is essentially the identical
          text which Christ had, and which he virtually guarantees to us. The
          same fact is proved to us by the Septuagint Greek version before
          referred to, and by the Peshito, the old Syriac version made at the
          end of the second century. The Septuagint, the Hebrew Bible, the
          Syriac Version, the Vulgate, the Masoretic notes must embody the text
          as it existed in the time of Christ. The agreement of all the various
          sources of information is so close that the greatest differences they
          suggest would not change a single doctrine nor cast doubt upon a
          single historic fact of any importance. I am justified, therefore, in
          affirming that we stand possessed to-day of the very same
          Old-Testament Scriptures to which Christ appealed and to which his
          authority binds our obedience and our faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these days you hear much of the ravages which a learned criticism
          has made in the integrity of our traditional Scriptures, and thus in
          the historical foundations of our faith. Ordinary historical criticism
          is a perfectly legitimate and necessary process by which all the
          light, external and internal, afforded by history, literature and the
          intrinsic characteristics of the books or texts in question is
          collected, and we judge by means of all the best evidence we have what
          conclusions we are to draw in reference to their genuineness and their
          integrity, or the reverse. But there is an arrogant phase of the
          "Higher Criticism" that is far more ambitious, and attempts to
          correct, or even to reconstruct, the existing text by wide inductions
          from the history of the times, from the other writings and from the
          known or supposed character, knowledge, style, situation or subject of
          the writer. The whole historical situation is vividly conceived by the
          Critic of this school, and he proceeds to infer therefrom what the
          writer must have said or could not have said. It is admitted that in
          some cases and within narrow limits such a process may be legitimate.
          When there is conflict or indefiniteness in the evidence afforded by
          direct explicit historical data of manuscript or version, it may be
          well to go farther afield for collateral or for inferential evidence.
          But it is very plain that this process of "Higher Criticism" is liable
          to be colored, and even wholly controlled, by the subjective
          conditions of the critic—by his sympathies, by his historical and
          philosophical and religious theories, and by his a priori judgments as
          to what the sacred writer ought to say. It is also very plain that the
          conclusions of this Criticism are of no value whatever when opposed to
          clearly-ascertained historical facts or documentary evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of Criticism applied to the Old or New Testament
          Scriptures in a spirit hostile to the long-received faith of the
          Christian Church, it is notorious that it is the outgrowth of a false
          philosophy, of naturalistic views of God's relation to the world, and
          of a priori theories of evolution applied to history. Throughout, its
          representatives are alien from evangelical sympathy and effort. When
          we remember, therefore, what can be clearly proved by historic fact
          and document, that Christ endorsed as the Word of God the very Old
          Testament Scripture, book and text, which we now possess, when we
          remember that all the evidence attainable from Egyptian monuments and
          Assyrian cylinders corroborates the claims of this Hebrew Bible in all
          its parts, it is very evident that the conceited claims of this
          Criticism are as profane as they are groundless and absurd. Let each
          man choose for himself this day between Jesus Christ and the
          "critics."
        </p>
        <p>
          (B.) 1. How do we Ascertain what Books of Right belong to the New
          Testament Canon? Here the case is different. Christ did not present us
          the collected books of the New Testament and guarantee their
          integrity. On the other hand, these books were written in the full
          light of an historically illuminated age, and come to us supported by
          a contemporaneous literature and followed by a copious consequent
          literature of their own creating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule by which the canonicity of any New Testament book is
          determined is: any book written by an apostle or received generally as
          canonical by the Church during the age in which it was presided over
          and instructed by the apostles is to be regarded as canonical. Take,
          for instance, the Epistle to the Hebrews. If written by Paul, then it
          would have a right to a place in the canon for that reason. But if not
          written by Paul, if it was received generally as canonical by the
          Church during the lives of Paul and John, then its right must be
          admitted on that ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the facts in question must be determined by an examination
          of two classes of evidence: (1) the internal character of the writing;
          (2) the external historical evidence of its genuineness and of its
          recognition as canonical by the Church of the first century. Of
          course, no external evidence can prove a book to have come from God if
          its contents are morally bad or intellectually contemptible.
          Nevertheless, no matter what the contents of a book may be, we cannot
          admit that it belongs to the New Testament canon except on the ground
          of explicit and sufficient historical proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kind of evidence by which we establish the canonicity of each of
          the books of the New Testament is precisely the same as that by which
          we prove the authenticity and genuineness of any ancient classic. The
          only difference is that in behalf of the books of the New Testament
          the evidence is incomparably more abundant. This evidence may be
          distributed under the following heads, each head representing copious
          literatures critically sifted and logically arranged: (1) quotations
          and references to these books found in the writings of early
          Christians; (2) early catalogues of the sacred books; (3) early
          translations; (4) general verdict of the Church; (5) internal
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          You hear a great deal to-day about the "Christian consciousness." The
          new critics, having destroyed the ancient historical foundations of
          our Scriptures and of our faith, wish now to build them up again upon
          a basis of Christian consciousness. Every book and every specific
          reading is to be received which is approved by the subjective tests,
          literary, scientific, æsthetic, religious and fantastic, of these
          self-appointed Scripture-tasters of the nineteenth century. We also
          believe in a Christian consciousness—that is, in a human consciousness
          modified by religious experience and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost.
          But the mouth-piece of that consciousness is no self-appointed,
          self-conscious group of cultured moderns. It is voiced only by the
          consensus of all Christians of all nations, all ecclesiastical folds
          and ages. These very critics deny the growth of the whole Church since
          St. Augustine because its uniform testimonies rebuke them. We, on the
          contrary, appeal from the self-elected representatives of "Christian
          consciousness" to the thing itself—to the consensus of the whole
          Church, ancient, mediæval and modern, Greek, Roman, Lutheran and
          Reformed. We appeal to the historic and abiding creeds, confessions,
          hymns and liturgies of all Christians. We appeal to the testimony of
          the Holy Ghost, to the witness of all saints and martyrs, to all
          reformations, revivals and missions since Pentecost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The progress of this controversy has been one unbroken march of
          triumph for the integrity of our traditional canon. The first
          destructive "critics" denied the authenticity and historic validity of
          the fourth Gospel and the originality and accuracy of the synoptic
          Gospels, and they admitted the genuineness of only four books—Romans,
          First and Second Corinthians and Galatians. These are admitted to have
          been the genuine writings of the apostle Paul by the general consent
          of the most destructive critics and of all branches and ages of the
          Christian Church. This admission alone defeats the enemy and
          establishes upon this rock of unquestionable historic fact the whole
          gospel system. The entire body of Christian doctrine can be shown to
          be taught in these four admitted original Christian documents, the
          entire person, office and work of Christ; the entire salvation,
          temporal and eternal, of his believing followers. Since that time the
          originality and validity of the synoptical Gospels have been
          victoriously vindicated. The genuineness of the fourth Gospel has been
          established beyond question, as is nobly admitted and maintained by
          the late Dr. Ezra Abbot, one of the most learned Unitarians America
          has ever produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How do we Ascertain the True Text of the Several Books of the New
          Testament? You can easily understand that through the process of
          multiplying manuscripts by hand, which is laborious and involves an
          infinitude of independent details, an untold number of variations
          would creep into the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The textus receptus was formed in the age of the Reformation by a
          hasty and uncritical gathering and comparison of the manuscripts which
          were found lying ready to hand, without respect to their various age
          or authority. Cardinal Ximenes, in Complutum, Spain, printed the first
          edition, A. D. 1514, which, however, was not published till 1520 or
          1521. The next edition was issued by Erasmus from Bâle, 1516, with
          succeeding editions of 1519, 1522, 1527, 1535; then that of Stephanus,
          from Paris, 1546; then that of Beza, from Geneva, 1565. Finally, the
          second Elzevir edition of 1633, Leyden, which claimed to give the
          textus receptus, was generally so received, and gave currency to that
          title. The text thus formed was the basis of the English version of
          King James and of all the New Testaments of all languages in modern
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          But during the present century the text of the New Testament has been
          carefully studied, a far wider collection of manuscripts has been
          gathered, the more ancient and valuable manuscripts have been made the
          basis of a corrected text, and a text nearly approximating to the
          original autographs of the sacred writers has been arrived at by a
          process of critical comparison and judgment of the immense material
          collected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is gathered—(1) From ancient manuscripts: e. g. the Codex
          Alexandrinus in the British Museum, dating from the beginning of the
          fifth century, from 400 to 450 after the birth of Christ; the Codex
          Vaticanus, dating from some time in the fourth century; the Codex
          Sinaiticus, believed by Tischendorf to be one of the fifty copies
          prepared by the order of Constantine by Eusebius, A. D. 331. (2) From
          the numerous quotations from the New Testament writings found in the
          works of the early Fathers. (3) From the early translations, such as
          the Peshito, or early Syriac, latter part of the second century; the
          Latin Vulgate of Jerome, A. D. 385; the Coptic, from the third
          century. From all these sources the new critical editions of the New
          Testament Greek text have been derived. The best of these in their
          order have been those of Griesbach, who died 1812; Lachmann, who died
          1851; Tischendorf, who died 1874; and of Westcott and Hort, which was
          made the basis of the New Revision in 1880.
        </p>
        <p>
          This much has been settled upon definite and sufficient historical
          evidence critically sifted. The testimony establishes the fact that
          these New Testament books constitute the second division of God's
          Word, and that the text in our possession is incomparably more
          accurate and more certain than that which is possessed of any other
          ancient book in the world. God has taken such care of his own Word
          that the differences which you may observe between the Revised Version
          and the Old Version of the Scriptures are such as do not involve the
          stability of a single important historic fact or of a single article
          of faith. We are brought by this process not only to the substance,
          but to the form and shading, of the truth as it came from the original
          organs of revelation. We can almost recognize the tone and inflection
          of the voice of Christ himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Our fourth question is, How was the Bible, this Book of books,
          produced? What was the true genesis of these Scriptures? Written
          evidently by men, how did they become the Word of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three distinct ways in which we can conceive that God might
          produce a book to be read by man: (1.) He could have produced it by
          his own immediate energy, acting directly and alone, as he did when he
          wrote the Ten Commandments with his own finger on tables of stone.
          (2.) He might have used men as his amanuenses, not as conscious and
          free penmen, but mechanically as his instruments of writing in simple
          obedience to his verbal dictation. (3.) The third way is the
          infinitely better one which God has chosen. It is the God-like way,
          which is in analogy with all his methods. He first created man and
          endowed him constitutionally with all his rational, emotional,
          aesthetic, moral and volitional powers. He then brought certain
          individual men into existence with the specific qualifications
          necessary for writing certain parts of Scripture, and placed them
          under their specific historical conditions and in their specific
          positions in the succession of sacred writers, and gave them the
          precise degree and quality of religious experience, of natural
          providential guidance, of supernatural revelation and inspiration
          necessary to stimulate their free activity and to determine the result
          as he would have it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the first place, the Bible is as intensely and thoroughly a
          human book as ever existed. As Christ was a true man, tempted in all
          points as we are, yet without sin, because also divine, so the Bible
          is thoroughly human, yet without error, because also divine. God is
          infinite, yet his word, the Bible, is finite—i. e. God's thought is
          expressed under all the limits of human thought and language, so that
          man may receive and profit by it. God is omniscient, but his word, the
          Bible, is not omniscient. It is narrowly limited in its range as a
          human book, produced by the instrumentality of human minds and
          addressed to human minds of all classes; but within that range it is
          infallible, without any error. It has its limitations, as every human
          work has. It is based on human intuitions; it proceeds through the
          lines of human logic; it implies human feelings, tastes, experiences.
          Every separate book is a spontaneous work of human genius, and bears
          the marks of all the personal idiosyncrasies and of the historic
          situation of its author. The individuality of Peter, Paul, John,
          David, Isaiah and Moses is as fully expressed in their writings as
          that of Shakespeare or Milton in theirs. Each biblical writer wrought
          as freely and as spontaneously as any other. Each of these books was
          also a book of its time, bore the marks of its age, and was
          specifically adapted to accomplish its immediate end among its
          contemporaries. The provincialisms of thought and idiom proper to the
          situation of their writers are found in these books. They make no
          claim to eminent purity of language or to high literary merit either
          in substance or form. Yet all these writings, severally and
          collectively, are books of all times, adapted perfectly to the
          edification and instruction of the Church of every age—of Moses, of
          David, of the prophets, of the time of Christ, of the ancient,
          mediæval, Reformation and modern Church. Of all books, it is the most
          comprehensively human. Of all God's works, it is the most
          characteristically divine. It is in one view an entire national
          literature; in another view it is two distinct volumes; in another
          view it is one single work, with one Author, subject, method and end.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the second place, the Bible is a divine book, bearing the
          attributes of its Author, God. All along the line of human authorship
          through which this wonderful book grew to be, during at least sixteen
          hundred years, God provided each specifically endowed and conditioned
          prophet for his appointed place in the succession, a place prepared
          for him by all who had preceded, and on this foundation already
          provided he proceeds to build up in organic continuity and in
          symmetrical proportion the system already inaugurated. To each prophet
          God has communicated his specific item of revelation and his specific
          impulse and direction through inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The result is that the whole is an organism, a whole consisting of
          many parts exquisitely correlated and vitally independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this respect you may compare the Koran of Mohammed with the
          Christian Bible. In the great debate between the missionary Henry
          Martyn and the Persian moulvies the latter showed a great superiority
          of logical and rhetorical power. They proved that the Koran was
          written by a great genius, that it was an epoch-making book, giving
          law to a language pre-eminent for elegance, inexhaustible fullness and
          precision, revolutionizing kingdoms, forming empires and moulding
          civilization. Nevertheless, it was a single work, within the grasp of
          one great man. But Henry Martyn proved that the Bible is one single
          book, one single, intricate, organic whole, produced by more than
          forty different writers of every variety of culture and condition
          through sixteen centuries of time; that is, through about fifty
          successive generations of mankind. As a great cathedral, erected by
          many hands through many years, is born of one conceiving mind and has
          had but one author, so only God can be the one Author of the whole
          Bible, for only he has been contemporaneous with all stages of its
          genesis; he only has been able to control and co-ordinate all the
          agents concerned in its production so as to conceive and realize the
          incomparable result.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This book, whatever we may think of the propriety of it,
          unquestionably claims to be the Word of God. At the opening of the
          book it demands the implicit credence and obedience of every reader.
          Its instant order to every reader is, "Believe on peril of your soul's
          life!" It does not point to evidence nor plead before the bar of human
          reason. But it utters the voice of God and speaks by authority. What
          other book does this? And this claim has been abundantly vindicated
          through the ages in the opinion of the wisest and best of mankind—(1)
          by its demonstrations of supernatural knowledge, (2) of supernatural
          works, (3) of supernatural power over the hearts and consciences of
          men; (4) by the accompanying witness of the Holy Ghost; (5) by its
          omnipresent beneficent influence through all Christian lands and ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would you think if to-day at high noon the existence and the
          light and heat and life-giving radiance of the sun were brought into
          question? How would you answer the skeptical denial of that
          self-evident fact by a blind man? To all the living the sun is its own
          witness. So all who question the divinity of the Bible only condemn
          themselves. What a sorry appearance the grotesque herd make even now!
        </p>
        <p>
          V. What is God's part in bringing this Book of books into existence?
          This falls under several heads, namely, providence; the gracious work
          of his Spirit on the heart; revelation; inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Providence. In a previous lecture I showed that God is to be
          conceived of as an infinite Spirit, presiding over all creatures and
          acting upon them from without at his will, but also as omnipresent, at
          every moment immanent in every ultimate element of every creature, and
          acting in and through all things from within. Thus God's activities
          are everywhere confluent with our own spontaneities. All creatures
          live and move and have their being in him. He works in us to will as
          well as to do; that is, as free agents, though willing to do according
          to his good pleasure. A great musician elicits his most perfect music
          out of instruments and under conditions made for him beforehand by
          other men. How much more completely would the artist be the sole
          creator of his work if he could at will first create his material with
          the very qualities he needs, then build and attune his instruments for
          his own purposes, and then bring out from them, thus prepared and
          adjusted, the very music in its fullness which his soul has designed
          from the first. So God from the first designed and adapted every human
          writer employed in the genesis of Scripture. Paul, John, Peter, David,
          Isaiah, have been made precisely what they were, and placed and
          conditioned precisely as they were, and then moved to write and
          directed in writing precisely what they wrote. The revelation was in a
          large measure through an historical series of events, led along by a
          providential guidance largely natural, but surcharged, as a cloud with
          electricity, with supernatural elements all along its line. Thus under
          God's providence the Scriptures grew to be, all the conspiring forces
          which contributed to their formation acting under the providential
          control of the ever present, ever-acting, immanent God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Spiritual Illumination. This includes the whole sum of God's
          gracious dealing with the soul of his prophet, qualifying him to be
          the fit organ for the communication of religious truth. In order to
          exhibit truth in its comprehensive logical relations God employed the
          logical and scholastically trained mind of Paul. In all his writing
          this natural and acquired faculty of Paul acted under God's guidance
          as spontaneously and naturally as the same faculty ever wrought in the
          case of any other writer. But in relation to spiritual truth the
          natural mind of man is blind and without feeling. Spiritual
          illumination by the Holy Ghost, a personal religious experience, was
          as necessary in the case of such writers as David, John and Paul as
          æsthetic taste and genius are in the case of a poet or artist. The
          spiritual intuition of John, the spiritualized understanding of Paul,
          the personal religious experience of David, have by the superadded
          gift of inspiration been rendered permanently typical and normal to
          the Church in all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Revelation. Spiritual illumination opens the organ of spiritual
          vision and clarifies it. Revelation, on the other hand, gives the
          additional light which nature does not supply. In every instance where
          supernatural knowledge of God, his attributes, his purposes, of the
          secrets of his grace or of the future of the Church in this world, of
          the life of body or of soul after death, came to be needed by a sacred
          writer, God immediately gave it to him by revelation. This was done in
          various ways, as by visions, dreams, direct mental suggestion, verbal
          dictation and the like; but whatever the method of communication it
          was perfectly adequate to the occasion and congruous to the nature of
          the person to whom it was made. This, of course, was never furnished
          except on the occasions when it was needed: it appears more frequently
          in some portions of Scripture than in others, but however frequent it
          was an occasional and not a constant element of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Inspiration. This was the absolutely constant attribute of every
          portion and of every element of the Scriptures, and that attribute
          which renders them infallible in every utterance, and which thus
          constitutes their grand distinguishing trait, separating them by the
          whole heavens from all other books. Revelation supernaturally
          communicated to the sacred writer the truth which he needed, and which
          he did not possess and could not attain by any natural means.
          Inspiration, on the other hand, is that influence of the immanent Holy
          Ghost which accompanied every thought and feeling and impulse and
          action of the sacred writer involved in the function of writing the
          word, and which guided him in the selection and utterance of truth—i.
          e. in its conception and in its verbal expression—so that the very
          mind of God in the premises was expressed with infallible accuracy.
          This influence was exerted from within the writer, not upon him from
          without. It in no degree constrains or forces; it directs through the
          writer's own spontaneity. It modifies action only so far as action
          would be otherwise divergent from the purpose of God or inadequate. It
          is like the directive agency of the plastic soul of the tree, which so
          directs the physical forces engaged in its erection that they
          spontaneously combine to form its intricate and voluminous organism.
          Or it is like the touch of the charioteer upon the reins which guide
          the courses of the racing steeds. Or it is like the touch of the hand
          of the steerer upon the rudder of the boat carried gently down the
          meandering stream by the currents of the air and water. These currents
          symbolize the natural powers and knowledge of the sacred writer,
          reinforced by revelation and by grace. The hand on the rudder
          symbolizes inspiration. It secures the fact that all things go right
          according to the will of the steersman. But it interferes only by
          gentle and alternate pressure, and thus only when otherwise the
          currents if left to themselves would not fulfill his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. What is the doctrine of the Christian Church as to the extent to
          which the Scriptures are inspired?
        </p>
        <p>
          The two opinions which individual Christian men have severally
          maintained on this subject are represented respectively by the two
          alternative phrases, "The Scriptures contain the Word of God," "The
          Scriptures are the Word of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is the loose formula of those who hold a low doctrine of
          inspiration. A river in India, "rolling down its golden sands," may be
          truly said to contain gold. But in that case we are left in doubt as
          to the relative proportion between the sand and the gold, and to our
          own resources to discriminate and separate the two. If the Bible only
          "contains the Word of God," it evidently can be no infallible rule of
          faith and practice, because we are confessedly left to the two very
          human and fallible instruments (1) of "Higher Criticism," and (2) of
          the "Christian consciousness," to determine what elements of the
          Scriptures are the very "Word of God" and what elements are only the
          word of man. A law can have no infallibility beyond that of the court
          which interprets it. So in this view of the case the Bible has no
          infallibility beyond that of the criticism and consciousness of our
          self-appointed, self-complacent guides.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Church has always held that "the Scriptures are the Word of
          God." This means that, however these books may have been produced
          through human agency, God has (1) so controlled the process of their
          genesis, and (2) he so absolutely endorses the result, that the Bible
          in every book and every word, both in matter and in form, is the very
          Word of God uttered to us. Hence it is in every part and in every word
          (of the original autographs) absolutely inerrant and of absolute
          divine authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase "verbal inspiration" applied to the Scriptures does not
          mean that the sacred writers were inspired or directed in their work
          by words dictated or suggested. But it means that the divine influence
          which we call inspiration, and which accompanied them throughout their
          entire work, extended to the verbal expression of every thought as
          well as to the thoughts themselves. This inspiration has extended
          equally to every part of Scripture, matter and form, thought and
          words, and renders the whole and every part inerrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calvin, in the sixth, seventh and eighth chapters of his Institutes,
          continually uses the phrases "Scripture," "the Scriptures," "the
          sacred volume," and "the Word of God" as synonymous. The first
          Reformed Confession of national authority, the First Helvetic, says,
          art. i., "Canonical Scripture is the Word of God." The Second Helvetic
          Confession was the most widely recognized of all the Reformed
          Confessions in Switzerland, France, Hungary, Poland, Scotland, and
          highly honored in England and Holland. It says, "We believe and
          confess that the canonical Scriptures of the holy prophets and
          apostles of both Testaments are the Word of God, and have plenary
          authority of themselves and not from men." Every Presbyterian minister
          and elder in England, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and the United States,
          North and South, believes this or he has forsworn himself. Each one
          has at his ordination solemnly declared, before God and man, that he
          believes these Scriptures "to be the Word of God" (Confession of
          Faith, Presbyterian Board of Publication, pp. 429, 434, 441). Thomas
          Cartwright, the father of English Presbyterianism, in his Treatise of
          the Christian Religion; or, The Whole Body and Substance of Divinity
          (London, A. D. 1616), has written his twelfth chapter "On the Word of
          God." This he identifies with the collection of canonical books, and
          accounts for their authority by saying, "for God is the Author of
          them."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the doctrine of the whole historical Church of God. The Roman
          Catholic Church declares it de fide to believe that God is the Author
          of every part of both Testaments (Can. Council of Trent, sec. 4; Dog.
          Decrees of Vatican Council, 1870, sec. 3, chap. 2). Also every branch
          of the Reformed Church—e. g. Belgic Confession, Art. 3; Second
          Helvetic Confession, chap. 1; Westminster Confession, chap. 1. In this
          respect the late Professor Henry B. Smith, the noble representative of
          the theology of the New School branch of the Presbyterian Church in
          the United States, precisely agrees with the late Professor Charles
          Hodge, who equally represented the theology of the Old School branch.
          In his sermon on The Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures, delivered
          before the Synod of New York and New Jersey, October 17, 1855, Dr.
          Smith said: "All the divine revelations which are here recorded are
          also inspired, but all that is the subject of inspiration need not be
          conceived of as distinctly revealed. Inspiration designates that
          divine influence under which prophets or apostles spake or wrote as
          they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Christ is the great Revealer, the
          Holy Spirit inspires.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Its function is to convey unto the world, through
          divinely-commissioned prophets and apostles, either orally or by
          writing, under the specific influence of the Holy Spirit, whatever has
          been thus revealed. Its object is the communication of truth in an
          infallible manner, so that when rightfully interpreted no error is
          conveyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It comprises both the matter and the form of the Bible—the matter in
          the form in which it is conveyed and set forth. It extends even to the
          language—not in the mechanical sense that each word is dictated by the
          Holy Spirit, but in the sense that under divine guidance each writer
          spake in his own language according to the measure of his knowledge,
          acquired by personal experience, the testimony of others or by
          immediate divine revelation.
        </p>

          "So wonderfully do the divine and human elements commingle in the
          Scriptures, as do the first and second causes also in the realm of
          providence, that it is vain to limit inspiration to doctrine and
          truth, excluding history from its sphere. The attempt is as
          unphilosophical as it is unscriptural. No analysis can detect such a
          line of separation. It is both invisible and not to be spiritually
          discerned.

          "The theory of plenary inspiration, as we have already given it,
          comprises whatever is true in all these views, subordinate to the
          prime position that the Bible not only contains, but is, the Word of
          God."

          Dr. H. B. Smith's Introduction to Christian Theology: "Inspiration
          gives us a book, properly called the Word of God, inspired in all its
          parts. The inspiration is plenary in the sense of extending to all the
          parts and of extending also to the words."

        <p>VII. What is to be said as to alleged discrepancies?</p>
        <p>
          The above statement unquestionably truly represents the ancient and
          catholic faith of the historic Church of Christ. The hostile critics
          and theorists object that the Scriptures are full of inaccuracies and
          discrepancies of statement—(1) as between the statements of Scripture
          and modern science or undoubted history; (2) as between one statement
          or quotation of Scripture and another.
        </p>
        <p>In answer to this we have time to say only—</p>
        <p>
          1st. We freely admit that many errors have crept into the sacred text
          as it exists at present, although none of these errors, nor all of
          them together, obscure one Christian doctrine or important fact. In
          order to make good the objection of the critics it is necessary that
          they show that the discrepancy exists when the clearly ascertained
          original text of Scripture is in question.

          2d. The Scriptures were not written from the scientific point of view
          nor intended to anticipate science. A distinction should be clearly
          drawn and strongly held between the speculations of science and its
          ascertained facts. The speculations of science are like the changing
          currents of the sea, while the Scriptures have breasted them like the
          rocks for two thousand years. The Scriptures speak of nature as it
          presents itself phenomenally. When this is remembered, the Bible
          contradicts no fact of science. On the contrary, the entire view of
          the genesis and order of the physical world presented by the Bible, in
          contrast with all the other ancient books whatsoever, is in
          correspondence with that presented by modern science to a degree
          perfectly miraculous. The men who press this objection are ignorant
          either of science or of the Bible, or, more probably, of both.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. As to the alleged discrepancies with history, it must be
          remembered (a) that the most modern discoveries (from Egypt and
          Assyria) most wonderfully confirm the historical accuracy of
          Scripture; (b) that when only a part of an ancient situation is
          historically illuminated, different accounts may appear inconsistent
          which are really complementary to each other and mutually supporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. As to the discrepancies alleged to exist in certain passages
          between the Scriptures themselves, it is evident that the question is
          one of fact, which can be settled only by a thorough, learned,
          intelligent and impartial investigation. Very few men are qualified to
          give an opinion. There is no possibility of commencing even an
          investigation in a popular lecture. It is sufficient for me that men
          like my learned colleagues in Princeton Seminary, who spend their
          lives in the special study of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, assure
          me that one single instance of such discrepancy has never been proved.
          Friends, let the frogs croak; in the mean time let us possess our
          souls in peace, waiting until the first case of discrepancy is proved.
