        <h2>2. The Scriptures</h2>
        <h2>
          QII: WHAT RULE HAS GOD GIVEN TO DIRECT US HOW WE MAY GLORIFY AND ENJOY
          HIM?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A: The Word of God, which is contained in the scriptures of the Old
          and New Testaments, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify
          and enjoy him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Tim 3:16. ‘All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,’ By
          Scripture is understood the sacred Book of God. It is given by divine
          inspiration; that is, the Scripture is not the contrivance of man’s
          brain, but is divine in its origin. The image of Diana was had in
          veneration by the Ephesians, because they supposed it fell from
          Jupiter. Acts 19:95. The holy Scripture is to be highly reverenced and
          esteemed, because we are sure it came from heaven. 2 Pet 1:11. The two
          Testaments are the two lips by which God has spoken to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            How does it appear that the Scriptures have a <em>Jus Divinum</em>,
            a divine authority stamped upon them?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the Old and New Testament are the foundation of all religion.
          If their divinity cannot be proved, the foundation on which we build
          our faith is gone. I shall therefore endeavour to prove this great
          truth, that the Scriptures are the very word of God. I wonder whence
          the Scriptures should come, if not from God. Bad men could not be the
          authors of it. Would their minds be employed in inditing such holy
          lines? Would they declare so fiercely against sin? Good men could not
          be the authors of it. Could they write in such a strain? or could it
          stand with their grace to counterfeit God’s name, and put, Thus saith
          the Lord, to a book of their own devising? Nor could any angel in
          heaven be the author of it, because the angels pry and search into the
          abyss of gospel mysteries, I Pet 1:12, which implies their nescience
          of some parts of Scripture; and sure they cannot be the authors of
          that book which they themselves do not fully understand. Besides, what
          angel in heaven durst be so arrogant as to personate God and, say, ‘I
          create,’ Isa 65:17, and, ‘I the Lord have said it,? Numb 14:45. So
          that it is evident, the pedigree of Scripture is sacred, and it could
          come from none but God himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Not to speak of the harmonious consent of all the parts of
            Scripture, there are seven cogent arguments which may evince it to
            be the Word of God.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          [I] Its antiquity. It is of ancient standing. The grey hairs of
          Scripture make it venerable. No human histories extant reach further
          than Noah’s flood: but the holy Scripture relates matters of fact that
          have been from the beginning of the world; it writes of things before
          time. That is a sure rule of Tertullian, ‘That which is of the
          greatest antiquity, <em>id verum quod primum</em>, is to be received
          as most sacred and authentic.’
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] We may know the Scripture to be the Word of God by its miraculous
          preservation in all ages. The holy Scriptures are the richest jewel
          that Christ has left us; and the church of God has so kept these
          public records of heaven, that they have not been lost. The Word of
          God has never wanted enemies to oppose, and, if possible, to extirpate
          it. They have given out a law concerning Scripture, as Pharaoh did the
          midwives, concerning the Hebrew women’s children, to strangle it in
          the birth; but God has preserved this blessed Book inviolable to this
          day. The devil and his agents have been blowing at Scripture light,
          but could never blow it out; a clear sign that it was lighted from
          heaven. Nor has the church of God, in all revolutions and changes,
          kept the Scripture that it should not be lost only, but that it should
          not be depraved. The letter of Scripture has been preserved, without
          any corruption, in the original tongue. The Scriptures were not
          corrupted before Christ’s time, for then Christ would not have sent
          the Jews to them. He said, ‘Search the Scriptures.’ He knew these
          sacred springs were not muddied with human fancies.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3] The Scripture appears to be the Word of God, by the matter
          contained in it. The mystery of Scripture is so abstruse and profound
          that no man or angel could have known it, had it not been divinely
          revealed. That eternity should be born; that he who thunders in the
          heavens should cry in the cradle; that he who rules the stars should
          suck the breasts; that the Prince of Life should die; that the Lord of
          Glory should be put to shame; that sin should be punished to the full,
          yet pardoned to the full; who could ever have conceived of such a
          mystery, had not the Scripture revealed it to us? So, for the doctrine
          of the resurrection; that the same body which is crumbled into a
          thousand pieces, should rise <em>idem numero</em>, the same individual
          body, else it were a creation, not a resurrection. How could such a
          sacred riddle, above all human disquisition, be known, had not the
          Scripture made a discovery of it? As the matter of Scripture is so
          full of goodness, justice and sanctity, that it could be breathed from
          none but God; so the holiness of it shows it to be of God. Scripture
          is compared to silver refined seven times. Psa 12:2. The Book of God
          has no <em>errata</em> in it; it is a beam of the Sun of
          Righteousness, a crystal stream flowing from the fountain of life. All
          laws and edicts of men have had their corruptions, but the Word of God
          has not the least tincture, it is of meridian splendour. Psa 119:940.
          ‘Thy word is very pure,’ like wine that comes from the grape, which is
          not mixed nor adulterated. It is so pure that it purifies everything
          else. John 17:17. ‘Sanctify them through thy truth.’ The Scripture
          presses holiness, so as no other book ever did: it bids us live
          ‘soberly, righteously, and godly;’ Titus 2:12; soberly, in acts of
          temperance; righteously, in acts of justice; godly, in acts of zeal
          and devotion. It commends to us, whatever is ‘just, lovely, and of
          good report.’ Phil 4:4. This sword of the Spirit cuts down vice. Eph
          6:67. Out of this tower of Scripture is thrown a millstone upon the
          head of sin. The Scripture is the royal law which commands not only
          the actions, but affections; it binds the heart to good behaviour.
          Where is there such holiness to be found, as is digged out of this
          sacred mine? Who could be the author of such a book but God himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          [4] That the Scripture is the Word of God is evident by its
          predictions. It prophesies of things to come, which shows the voice of
          God speaking in it. It was foretold by the prophet, ‘A virgin shall
          conceive,’ Isa 7:14, and, the ‘Messiah shall be cut off.’ Dan 9:26.
          The Scripture foretells things that would fall out many ages and
          centuries after; as how long Israel should serve in the iron furnace,
          and the very day of their deliverance. Exod 12:2I. ‘At the end of the
          four hundred and thirty years, even the self-same day, it came to pass
          that the host of the Lord went out of Egypt.’ This prediction of
          future things, merely contingent, and not depending upon natural
          causes, is a clear demonstration of its divine origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          [5] The impartiality of those men of God who wrote the Scriptures, who
          do not spare to set down their own failings. What man that writes a
          history would black his own face, by recording those things of himself
          that might stain his reputation? Moses records his own impatience when
          he struck the rock, and tells us, he could not on that account enter
          into the land of promise. David relates his own adultery and
          bloodshed, which stands as a blot in his escutcheon to succeeding
          ages. Peter relates his own pusillanimity in denying Christ. Jonah
          sets down his own passions, ‘I do well to be angry to the death.’
          Surely had their pen not been guided by God’s own hand, they would
          never have written that which reflects dishonour upon themselves. Men
          usually rather hide their blemishes than publish them to the world;
          but the penmen of holy Scripture eclipse their own name; they take
          away all glory from themselves, and give the glory to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          [6] The mighty power and efficacy that the Word has had upon the souls
          and consciences of men. It has changed their hearts. Some by reading
          Scripture have been turned into other men; they have been made holy
          and gracious. By reading other books the heart may be warmed, but by
          reading this book it is transformed. 2 Cor 3:3. ‘Ye are manifestly
          declared to be the epistle of Christ, written not with ink, but with
          the Spirit of the living God.’ The Word was copied out into their
          hearts, and they were become Christ’s epistle, so that others might
          read Christ in them. If you should set a seal upon marble, and it
          should make an impression upon the marble, and leave a print behind,
          there would be a strange virtue in that seal; so when the seal of the
          Word leaves a heavenly print of grace upon the heart, there must needs
          be a power going along with that Word no less than divine. It has
          comforted their hearts. When Christians have sat by the rivers
          weeping, the Word has dropped as honey, and sweetly revived them. A
          Christian’s chief comfort is drawn out of these wells of salvation.
          Rom 15:5. ‘That we through comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.’
          When a poor soul has been ready to faint, it has had nothing to
          comfort it but a Scripture cordial. When it has been sick, the Word
          has revived it. 2 Cor 4:17. ‘Our light affliction, which is but for a
          moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
          glory.’ When it has been deserted, the Word has dropped in the golden
          oil of joy. Lam 3:3I. ‘The Lord will not cast off for ever.’ He may
          change his providence, not his purpose; he may have the look of an
          enemy, but he has the heart of a father. Thus the Word has a power in
          it to comfort the heart. Psa 119:90. ‘This is my comfort in mine
          affliction; for thy word has quickened me.’ As the spirits are
          conveyed through the arteries of the body, so divine comforts are
          conveyed through the promises of the Word. Now, the Scriptures having
          such an exhilarating, heart-comforting power in them, shows clearly
          that they are of God, and it is he that has put the milk of
          consolation into these breasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          [7] The miracles by which Scripture is confirmed. Miracles were used
          by Moses, Elijah, and Christ, and were continued, many years after, by
          the apostles, to confirm the verity of the holy Scriptures. As props
          are set under weak vines, so these miracles were set under the weak
          faith of men, that if they would not believe the writings of the Word,
          they might believe the miracles. We read of God’s dividing the waters,
          making a pathway in the sea for his people to go over, the iron
          swimming, the oil increasing by pouring out, Christ’s making wine of
          water, his curing the blind, and raising the dead. Thus God has set a
          seal to the truth and divinity of the Scriptures by miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Papists cannot deny that the Scripture is divine and sacred; but
          they affirm <em>quoad nos</em>, with respect to us, it receives its
          divine authority from the church; and in proof of it they bring that
          Scripture, I Tim 3:15, where the church is said to be the ground and
          pillar of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, the church is the pillar of truth; but it does not
          therefore follow that the Scripture has its authority from the church.
          The king’s proclamation is fixed on the pillar, the pillar holds it
          out, that all may read, but the proclamation does not receive its
          authority from the pillar, but from the king; so the church holds
          forth the Scriptures, but they do not receive their authority from the
          church, but from God. If the Word of God be divine, merely because the
          church holds it forth, then it will follow, that our faith is to be
          built upon the church, and not upon the Word, contrary to Eph 2:20.
          ‘Built upon the foundation (that is the doctrine) of the apostles and
          prophets.’
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Are all the books in the Bible of the same divine authority?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Those which we call canonical.</p>
        <p><b>Why are the Scriptures called canonical?</b></p>
        <p>
          Because the Word is a rule of faith, a canon to direct our lives. The
          Word is the judge of controversies, the rock of infallibility. That
          only is to be received for truth which agrees with Scripture, as the
          transcript with the original. All maxims in divinity are to be brought
          to the touchstone of Scripture, as all measures are brought to the
          standard.
        </p>
        <p><b>Are the Scriptures a complete rule?</b></p>
        <p>
          The Scripture is a full and perfect canon, containing in it all things
          necessary to salvation. 2 Tim 3:15. ‘From a child thou hast known the
          holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.’ It
          shows the Credenda, what we are to believe; and the Agenda, what we
          are to practise. It gives us an exact model of religion, and perfectly
          instincts us in the deep things of God. The Papists, therefore, make
          themselves guilty, who eke out Scripture with their traditions, which
          they consider equal to it. The Council of Trent says, that the
          traditions of the church of Rome are to be received
          <em>pari pietatis affectu</em>, with the same devotion that Scripture
          is to be received; so bringing themselves under the curse. Rev 22:18.
          ‘If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
          plagues that are written in this book.’
        </p>
        <p><b>What is the main scope and end of Scripture?</b></p>
        <p>
          To reveal a way of salvation. It makes a clear discovery of Christ.
          John 20:01: ‘These things are written, that ye might believe that
          Jesus is the Christ, and that believing ye might have life through his
          name.’ The design of the Word is to be a test whereby our grace is to
          be tried; a sea-mark to show us what rocks are to be avoided. The Word
          is to sublimate and quicken our affections; it is to be our directory
          and consolatory; it is to waft us over to the land of promise.
        </p>
        <p><b>Who should have the power of interpreting Scripture?</b></p>
        <p>
          The Papists assert that it is in the power of the church. If you ask
          whom they mean by the church, they say, The Pope, who is head of it,
          and he is infallible; so Bellarmine. But that assertion is false,
          because many of the Popes have been ignorant and vicious, as Platina
          affirms, who writes the lives of Popes. Pope Liberius was an Arian,
          and Pope John XII denied the immortality of the soul; therefore Popes
          are not fit interpreters of Scripture; who then?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture is to be its own interpreter, or rather the Spirit
          speaking in it. Nothing can cut the diamond but the diamond; nothing
          can interpret Scripture but Scripture. The sun best discovers itself
          by its own beams; the Scripture interprets itself to the
          understanding. But the question is concerning hard places of
          Scripture, where the weak Christian is ready to wade beyond his depth;
          who shall interpret here?
        </p>
        <p>
          The church of God has appointed some to expound and interpret
          Scripture; therefore he has given gifts to men. The several pastors of
          churches, like bright constellations, give light to dark Scriptures.
          Mal 2:2. ‘The priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should
          seek the law at his mouth.’
        </p>
        <p><b>But this is to pin our faith upon men.</b></p>
        <p>
          We are to receive nothing for truth but what is agreeable to the Word.
          As God has given to his ministers gifts for interpreting obscure
          places, so he has given to his people so much of the spirit of
          discerning, that they can tell (at least in things necessary to
          salvation) what is consonant to Scripture, and what is not. I Cor
          12:20. ‘To one is given a spirit of prophecy, to another discerning of
          spirits.’ God has endued his people with such a measure of wisdom and
          discretion, that they can discern between truth and error, and judge
          what is sound and what is spurious. Acts 17:7: ‘The Bereans searched
          the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so.’ They weighed the
          doctrine they heard, whether it was agreeable to Scripture, though
          Paul and Silas were their teachers. 2 Tim 3:36.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Use one:</b> See the wonderful goodness of God, who, besides the
          light of nature, has committed to us the sacred Scriptures, The
          heathen are enveloped in ignorance. Psa 147:70. ‘As for his judgements
          they have not known them.’ They have the oracles of the Sibyls, but
          not the writings of Moses and the apostles. How many live in the
          region of death, where this bright star of Scripture never appeared!
          We have this blessed Book of God to resolve all our doubts, to point
          out a way of life to us. John 14:42. ‘Lord, how is it thou wilt
          manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?’
        </p>
        <p>
          God having given us his written Word to be our directory takes away
          all excuses from men. No man can say, I went wrong for want of light;
          God has given thee his Word as a lamp to thy feet; therefore if thou
          goest wrong, thou cost it wilfully. No man can say, If I had known the
          will of God, I would have obeyed it; thou art inexcusable, O man, for
          God has given thee a rule to go by, he has written his law with his
          own finger; therefore, if thou obeyest not, thou hast no apology left.
          If a master leave his mind in writing with his servant, and tells him
          what work he will have done, and the servant neglects the work, that
          servant is left without excuse, John 15:52. ‘Now you have no cloak for
          your sins.’
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          (I.) The Papists, who take away part of Scripture, and so clip the
          King of heaven’s coin. They expunge the second commandment out of
          their catechisms, because it makes against images; and it is usual
          with them, if they meet with anything in Scripture which they dislike,
          either to put a false gloss upon it, or, if that will not do, to
          pretend it is corrupted. They are like Ananias, who kept back part of
          the money. Acts 5:5. They keep back part of the Scripture from the
          people. It is a high affront to God to deface and obliterate any part
          of his Word, and brings us under that <em>premunire</em>, Rev 22:19,
          ‘If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
          prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life.’ Is
          all Scripture of divine inspiration?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It condemns the Antinomians, who lay aside the Old Testament as
          useless, and out of date; and call those who adhere to them Old
          Testament Christians. God has stamped a divine majesty upon both
          Testaments; and till they can show me where God has repealed the Old,
          it stands in force. The two Testaments are the two wells of salvation;
          the Antinomians would stop up one of these wells, they would dry up
          one of the breasts of Scripture. There is much gospel in the Old
          Testament. The comforts of the gospel in the New Testament have their
          rise from the Old. The great promise of the Messiah is in the Old
          Testament, ‘A virgin shall conceive and bear a son.’ Nay, I say more.
          The moral law, in some parts of it, speaks gospel - ‘I am the Lord thy
          God;’ here is the pure wine of the gospel. The saints’ great charter,
          where God promises to ‘sprinkle clean water upon them, and put his
          Spirit within them,’ is to be found primarily in the Old Testament.
          Ezek 36:65, 26. So that they who take away the Old Testament, as
          Samson pulled down the pillars, would take away the pillars of a
          Christian’s comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It condemns the Enthusiasts, who, pretending to have the Spirit,
          lay aside the whole Bible, and say the Scripture is a dead letter, and
          they live above it. What impudence is this! Till we are above sin, we
          shall not be above Scripture. Let not men so talk of a revelation from
          the Spirit, but suspect it to be an imposture. The Spirit of God acts
          regularly, it works in and by the Word; and he that pretends to a new
          light, which is either above the Word, or contrary to it, abuses both
          himself and the Spirit: his light is borrowed from him who transforms
          himself into an angel of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It condemns the slighters of Scripture; such as those who can go
          whole weeks and months and never read the Word. They lay it aside as
          rusty armour; they prefer a play or romance before Scripture. The
          <em>magnalia legis</em> are to them <em>minutula</em> [The weighty
          matters of the law are to them insignificant]. Oh how many can be
          looking at their faces in a glass all the morning, but their eyes
          begin to be sore when they look upon a Bible! Heathens die for want of
          Scripture, and these in contempt of it. They surely must needs go
          wrong who slight their guide. Such as lay the reins upon the neck of
          their lusts, and never use the curbing bit of Scripture to check them,
          are carried to hell, and never stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) It condemns the abusers of Scripture. Those who mud and poison
          this pure crystal fountain with their corrupt glosses, and who wrest
          Scripture. 2 Pet 3:16. The Greek word is, they set it upon the rack;
          they give wrong interpretations of it, not comparing Scripture with
          Scripture; as the Antinomians pervert that Scripture, Numb 23:3I, ‘He
          has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;’ from which they infer that God’s
          people may take liberty in sin, because God sees no sin in them. It is
          true, God sees no sin in his people with an eye of revenge, but he
          sees it with an eye of observation. He sees not sin in them, so as to
          damn them; but he sees it, so as to be angry, and severely to punish
          them. Did not David find it so, when he cried out of his broken bones?
          In like manner the Arminians wrest the Scripture in John 5:50, ’Ye
          will not come to me;’ where they bring in free will. This text shows
          how willing God is that we should have life; and that sinners may do
          more than they do, they may improve the talents God has given them;
          but it does not prove the power of free will, for it is contrary to
          that Scripture, John 6:64, ’No man can come to me, except the Father
          which has sent me draw him.’ These, therefore, wring the text so hard,
          that they make the blood come out; they do not compare Scripture with
          Scripture. Some jest with Scripture. When they are sad, they take the
          Scripture as their lute or minstrel to play upon, and so drive away
          the sad spirit; as a drunkard I have read of, who, having drunk off
          his cups, called to some of his fellows, ‘Give us of your oil, for our
          lamps are gone out.’ In the fear of God, take heed of this. Eusebius
          tells us of one, who took a piece of Scripture to make a jest of, but
          was presently struck with a frenzy and ran mad. It is a saying of
          Luther, <em>Quos Deus vult perdere</em>, &c.’ ‘Whom God intends to
          destroy, he gives them leave to play with Scripture.’
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Use three:</b> If the Scripture be of divine inspiration, then be
          exhorted,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) To study the Scripture. It is a copy of God’s will. Be
          Scripture-men, Bible-Christians. ‘I adore the fulness of Scripture,’
          says Tertullian. In the Book of God are scattered many truths as so
          many pearls. John 5:59. ‘Search the Scriptures.’ Search as for a vein
          of silver. This blessed Book will fill your head with knowledge, and
          your heart with grace. God wrote the two tables with his own fingers;
          and if he took pains to write, well may we take pains to read. Apollos
          was mighty in the Scriptures. Acts 18:84. The Word is our Magna Charta
          for Heaven; shall we be ignorant of our charter? Col 3:16. ‘Let the
          word of God dwell in you richly.’ The memory must be a tablebook where
          the Word is written. There is majesty sparkling in every line of
          Scripture; take but one instance, Isa 63:1: ‘Who is this that cometh
          from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in
          his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak
          in righteousness, mighty to save.’ Here is a lofty, magnificent style.
          What angel could speak after this manner? Junius was converted by
          reading one verse of John; he beheld a majesty in it beyond all human
          rhetoric. There is a melody in Scripture. This is that blessed harp
          which drives away sadness of spirit. Hear the sounding of this harp a
          little. I Tim 1:15. ‘This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;’
          he took not only our flesh upon him but our sins. And 1. ‘Come unto
          me, all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.’ How
          sweetly does this harp of Scripture sound, what heavenly music does it
          make in the ears of a distressed sinner, especially when the finger of
          God’s Spirit touches this instrument! There is divinity in Scripture.
          It contains the marrow and quintessence of religion. It is a rock of
          diamonds, a mystery of piety. The lips of Scripture have grace poured
          into them. The Scripture speaks of faith, self-denial, and all the
          graces which, as a chain of pearls, adorns a Christian. It excites to
          holiness; it treats of another world, it gives a prospect of eternity!
          Oh, then, search the Scripture! make the Word familiar to you. Had I
          the tongue of angels, I could not sufficiently set forth the
          excellency of Scripture. It is a spiritual optic-glass, in which we
          behold God’s glory; it is the tree of life, the oracle of wisdom, the
          rule of manners, the heavenly seed of which the new creature is
          formed. James 1:18. ‘The two Testaments,’ says Austin, ‘are the two
          breasts which every Christian must suck, that he may get spiritual
          nourishment.’ The leaves of the tree of life were for healing. Rev
          22:2. So these holy leaves of Scripture are for the healing of our
          souls. The Scripture is profitable for all things. If we are deserted,
          here is spiced wine that cheers the heavy heart; if we are pursued by
          Satan, here is the sword of the Spirit to resist him; if we are
          diseased with sin’s leprosy, here are the waters of the sanctuary,
          both to cleanse and cure. Oh, then, search the Scriptures! There is no
          danger in tasting this tree of knowledge. There was a penalty laid at
          first, that we might not taste of the tree of knowledge. Gen 2:27. ‘In
          the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.’ There is no
          danger in plucking from this tree of holy Scripture; if we do not eat
          of this tree of knowledge, we shall surely die. Oh, then, read the
          Scriptures! Time may come when the Scriptures may be kept from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the Bible with reverence. Think in every line you read that God
          is speaking to you. The ark wherein the law was put was overlaid with
          pure gold, and was carried on bars, that the Levites might not touch
          it. Exod 25:14. Why was this, but to give reverence to the law? Read
          with seriousness. It is matter of life and death; by this Word you
          must be tried; conscience and Scripture are the jury God will proceed
          by, in judging you. Read the Word with affection. Get your hearts
          quickened with the Word; go to it to fetch fire. Luke 24:42. ‘Did not
          our hearts burn within us?’ Labour that the Word may not only be a
          lamp to direct, but a fire to warm. Read the Scripture, not only as a
          history, but as a love letter sent you from God, which may affect your
          hearts. Pray that the same Spirit that wrote the Word may assist you
          in reading it; that God’s Spirit would show you the wonderful things
          of his law. ‘Go near,’ saith God to Philip, ‘join thyself to this
          chariot.’ Acts 8:89. So, when God’s Spirit joins himself with the
          chariot of his Word, it becomes effectual.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Be exhorted to prize the written Word. Job 23:12. David valued
          the Word more than gold. What would the martyrs have given for a leaf
          of the Bible! The Word is the field where Christ the pearl of price is
          hid. In this sacred mine we dig, not for a wedge of gold, but for a
          weight of glory. The Scripture is a sacred collyrium, or eye-salve to
          illuminate us. Prov 6:63. ‘The commandment is a lamp, and the law is
          light.’ The Scripture is the chart and compass by which we sail to the
          new Jerusalem. It is a sovereign cordial in all distresses. What are
          the promises but the water of life to renew fainting spirits? Is it
          sin that troubles? Here is a Scripture cordial. Psa 65:5. ‘Iniquities
          prevail against me; as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them
          away;’ or, as it is in the Hebrew, ‘thou shalt cover them.’ Do outward
          afflictions disquiet thee? Here is a Scripture cordial. Psa 91:15. ‘I
          will be with him in trouble,’ not only to behold, but to uphold. Thus,
          as in the ark manna was laid up, so promises are laid up in the ark of
          Scripture. The Scripture will make us wise. Wisdom is above rubies.
          Psa 119:104. ‘By thy precepts I get understanding.’ What made Eve
          desire the tree of knowledge? Gen 3:3. ‘It was a tree to make one
          wise.’ The Scriptures teach a man to know himself. They discover
          Satan’s snares and stratagems. 2 Cor 2:2: ‘They make one wise to
          salvation.’ 2 Tim 3:35. Oh, then, highly prize the Scriptures. I have
          read of Queen Elizabeth, that at her coronation, she received the
          Bible presented to her, with both her hands, and kissing it, laid it
          to her breast, saying, that that book had ever been her chief delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) If the Scripture is of divine inspiration, believe it. The
          Romans, that they might gain credit to their laws, reported they were
          inspired by the gods of Rome. Oh give credence to the Word! It is
          breathed from God’s own mouth. Hence arises the profaneness of men,
          that they do not believe the Scripture. Isa 53:3: ‘Who has believed
          our report?’ Did you believe the glorious rewards the Scripture speaks
          of, would you not give diligence to make your election sure? Did you
          believe the infernal torments the Scripture speaks of, would it not
          put you into a cold sweat, and cause a trembling at heart for sin? But
          people are in part atheists, they give but little credit to the Word,
          therefore they are so impious, and draw such dark shadows in their
          lives. Learn to realise Scripture, get your hearts wrought to a firm
          belief of it. Some think, if God should send an angel from heaven, and
          declare his mind, they would believe him; or, if he should send one
          from the damned, and preach the torments of hell all in flames, they
          would believe. But, ‘If they believe not Moses and the prophets,
          neither will they be persuaded though one arose from the dead.’ Luke
          16:61. God is wise, and he thinks the fittest way to make his mind
          known to us is by writing; and such as shall not be convinced by the
          Word, shall be judged by the Word. The belief of Scripture is of high
          importance. It will enable us to resist temptation. I John 2:14. ‘The
          Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.’ It
          conduceth much to our sanctification; therefore sanctification of the
          Spirit, and belief of the truth, are put together. 2 Thess 2:13. If
          the word written be not believed, it is like writing on water, which
          makes no impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Love the Word written. Psa 119:97. ‘Oh how love I thy law!’
          ‘Lord,’ said Augustine, ‘let the holy Scriptures be my chaste
          delight.’ Chrysostom compares the Scripture to a garden, every truth
          is a fragrant flower, which we should wear, not on our bosom, but in
          our heart. David counted the Word ‘sweeter than honey and the
          honeycomb.’ Psa 19:90. There is that in Scripture which may breed
          delight. It shows us the way to riches: Deut 28:8, Prov 3:30; to long
          life, Psa 34:42; to a kingdom, Heb 12:28. Well then may we count those
          the sweetest hours which are spent in reading the holy Scriptures;
          well may we say with the prophet, Jer 15:16, ‘Thy words were found,
          and I did eat them; and they were the joy and rejoicing of my heart.’
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Conform to Scripture. Let us lead Scripture lives. Oh that the
          Bible might be seen printed in our lives! Do what the Word commands.
          Obedience is an excellent way of commenting upon the Bible. Psa 86:6:
          ‘I will walk in thy truth.’ Let the Word be the sun-dial by which you
          set your life. What are we the better for having the Scripture, if we
          do not direct all our speeches and actions according to it? What is a
          carpenter the better for his rule about him, if he sticks it at his
          back, and never makes use of it for measuring and squaring his work?
          So, what are we the better for the rule of the Word, if we do not make
          use of it, and regulate our lives by it? How many swerve and deviate
          from the rule! The Word teaches to be sober and temperate, but they
          are drunk; to be chaste and holy, but they are profane; they go quite
          from the rule! What a dishonour is it to religion, for men to live in
          contradiction to Scripture! The Word is called a ‘light to our feet.’
          Psa 119:105. It is not only a light to our eyes to mend our sight, but
          to our feet to mend our walk. Oh let us lead Bible conversations!
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) Contend for Scripture. Though we should not be of contentious
          spirits, yet we ought to contend for the Word of God. This jewel is
          too precious to be parted with. Prov 4:13. ‘Keep her, for she is thy
          life.’ The Scripture is beset with enemies; heretics fight against it,
          we must therefore ‘contend for the faith once delivered to the
          saints.’ Jude 3. The Scripture is our book of evidences for heaven;
          shall we part with our evidences? The saints of old were both
          advocates and martyrs for truth; they would hold fast Scripture,
          though it were with the loss of their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7.) Be thankful to God for the Scriptures. What a mercy is it that
          God has not only acquainted us what his will is, but that he has made
          it known by writing! In the old times God revealed his mind by
          visions, but the Word written is a surer way of knowing God’s mind. 2
          Pet 1:18. ‘This voice which came from heaven we heard, we have also a
          more sure word of prophecy.’ The devil is God’s ape, and he can
          transform himself into an angel of light; he can deceive with false
          revelations; as I have heard of one who had, as he thought, a
          revelation from God to sacrifice his child, as Abraham had; whereupon,
          following this impulse of the devil, he killed his child. Thus Satan
          deceives people with delusion, instead of divine revelations;
          therefore we are to be thankful to God for revealing his mind to us by
          writing. We are not left in doubtful suspense that we should not know
          what to believe, but we have an infallible rule to go by. The
          Scripture is our pole-star to direct us to heaven, it shows us every
          step we are to take; when we go wrong, it instructs us; when we go
          right, it comforts us; and it is matter of thankfulness, that the
          Scriptures are made intelligible, by being translated.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8.) Adore God’s distinguishing grace, if you have felt the power and
          authority of the Word upon your conscience; if you can say as David,
          Psa 119:90, ’Thy word has quickened me.’ Christian, bless God that he
          has not only given thee his Word to be a rule of holiness, but his
          grace to be a principle of holiness. Bless God that he has not only
          written his Word, but sealed it upon thy heart, and made it effectual.
          Canst thou say it is of divine inspiration, because thou hast felt it
          to be of lively operation? Oh free grace! that God should send out his
          Word, and heal thee; that he should heal thee, and not others! That
          the same Scripture which to them is a dead letter, should be to thee a
          savour of life!
