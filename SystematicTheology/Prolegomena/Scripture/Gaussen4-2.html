        <h2>II. Use of the Septuagint Translation</h2>
        <p>
          People insist and say, We agree that the fact of these modern
          translations does not at all affect the question of the first
          inspiration of the Scriptures; but we have much more to urge. The
          sacred authors of the New Testament, when they themselves quote the
          old Hebrew Scriptures in Greek, employ for that purpose the Greek
          translation, called that of the Seventy, executed at Alexandria two
          centuries and a half before Jesus Christ. Now, no one among the
          moderns will dare to affirm (as was done in former times) that the
          Alexandrine interpreters were inspired. Would a man any more dare to
          contend that that version, still human at the time of Jesus Christ,
          acquired, by the sole fact of the apostolic quotations, a divinity
          which it did not previously possess? Would not this strange allegation
          resemble that of the Council of Trent, when it pronounced to be divine
          apocryphal writings, which the ancient Church rejected from the canon,
          and which St Jerome called "fables, and a medley of gold and clay;" or
          when it pronounced that translation by St Jerome to be authentic,
          which, at first, in the opinion of St Jerome himself, and thereafter
          in that of the Church for above a thousand years, was no more than a
          human work, respectable, no doubt, but imperfect? Would it not further
          resemble the silly infallibility of Sixtus V., who declared his
          edition of 1590 to be authentic; or that of his successor, Clement
          VIII., who, finding the edition of Sixtus V. intolerably incorrect,
          suppressed it in 1592, in order to substitute in its place another
          very different, and yet still more authentic?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we gladly recall this difficulty; because, like many others, when
          more closely examined, it converts the objections into arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          No more is required, in fact, than to study the manner in which the
          apostles employ the Septuagint, in order to see in it a striking sign
          of the verbal inspiration under which they wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Were a prophet to be sent by God in our day to the churches speaking
          the French tongue, how shall it be thought he would act in quoting the
          Scriptures? He would do so in French no doubt; but according to what
          version? As Osterwald and Martin's are those most extensively
          circulated, he would probably make his quotations in the words of one
          or other of them, in all cases where their translation should seem to
          him sufficiently exact. But also, notwithstanding our habitual
          practice and his, he would take care to abandon both those versions,
          and translate in his own way, as often as the thought intended to be
          conveyed by the original did not seem to him to be rendered with
          sufficient fidelity. Nay, he would sometimes even do more. In order to
          our being enabled to comprehend more fully in what sense he meant to
          make for us the application of such or such a Scripture, he would
          paraphrase the passage quoted, and in citing it, follow neither the
          letter of the original text nor that of the translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is precisely what has been done by the sacred writers of the New
          Testament with respect to the Septuagint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was the universal practice of the Hellenistic Jews,
          throughout the whole of the East, to read in their synagogues and to
          quote in their discussions the Old Testament according to that ancient
          version, the apostles show us the independence of the Spirit that
          guided them, by the three several methods they follow in their
          quotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, when the Alexandrine translators seem to them correct, they do
          not hesitate to conform to the recollections of their Hellenist
          auditors, and to quote the Septuagint version literatim and verbatim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, and this often occurs when dissatisfied with the work of the
          Seventy, they amend it, and make their quotations according to the
          original Hebrew, translating it more correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, in fine, when they would point out more clearly in what sense
          they adduce such or such a declaration of the holy books, they
          paraphrase it in quoting it. It is then the Holy Ghost who, by their
          mouth, quotes himself, modifying at the same time the expressions
          which he had previously dictated to the prophets of his ancient
          people. One may compare, for example, Mic. 5:2 with Matt. 2:6; Mal.
          3:1 with Matt. 11:10, Mark 1:2, and Luke 7:27, &c. &c.
        </p>
        <p>
          The learned Horne, in his "Introduction to the Critical Study of the
          Bible" (vol. i. p. 503,) has ranged under five distinct classes,
          relatively to the Septuagint version, the quotations made in the New
          Testament from the Old. We do not here warrant all his distinctions,
          nor all his figures; but our readers will comprehend the force of our
          argument, on our informing them that that learned author reckons
          eighty-eight verbal quotations that agree with the Alexandrine
          translations; sixty-four more that are borrowed from them, but with
          some variations; thirty-seven that adopt the same meaning with them
          without employing their words; sixteen that differ from them in order
          to agree more nearly with the Hebrew; and, finally, twenty that differ
          from both the Hebrew and the Septuagint, but in which the sacred
          authors have paraphrased the Old Testament, in order that the sense in
          which they quote it may be better understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          These numerical data will sufficiently enable the reader to form a
          just idea of the independence claimed by the Holy Ghost with regard to
          human versions, when he desired to quote, in the New Testament, that
          which he had previously caused to be written in the Old. Accordingly,
          they not only answer the objectionâ€”they convert it into a testimony.
