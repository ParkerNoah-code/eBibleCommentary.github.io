        <p><b>V. Roman Catholic Doctrine Concerning the Rule of Faith:</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>§ 3. Tradition</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          The word tradition (παράδοσις) means, (1.) The art of delivering over
          from one to another. (2.) The thing delivered or communicated. In the
          New Testament it is used (a.) For instructions delivered from some to
          others, without reference to the mode of delivery, whether it be
          orally or by writing; as in 2 Thess. 2:15, "Hold the traditions which
          ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle;" and 3:6,
          "Withdraw yourself from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not
          after the tradition which he received of us." (b.) For the oral
          instructions of the fathers handed down from generation to generation,
          but not contained in the Scriptures, and yet regarded as
          authoritative. In this sense our Lord so frequently speaks of "the
          traditions of the Pharisees." (c.) In Gal. 1:14, where Paul speaks of
          his zeal for the traditions of his fathers, it may include both the
          written and unwritten instructions which he had received. What he was
          so zealous about, was the whole system of Judaism as he had been
          taught it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early Church the word was used in this wide sense. Appeal was
          constantly made to "the traditions," i.e., the instructions which the
          churches had received. It was only certain churches at first which had
          any of the written instructions of the Apostles. And it was not until
          the end of the first century that the writings of the Evangelists and
          Apostles were collected, and formed into a canon, or rule of faith.
          And when the books of the New Testament had been collected, the
          fathers spoke of them as containing the traditions, i.e., the
          instructions derived from Christ and his Apostles. They called the
          Gospels "the evangelical traditions," and the Epistles "the
          apostolical traditions." In that age of the Church the distinction
          between the written and unwritten word had not yet been distinctly
          made. But as controversies arose, and disputants on both sides of all
          questions appealed to "tradition," i.e., to what they had been taught;
          and when it was found that these traditions differed, one church
          saying their teachers had always taught them one thing, and another
          that theirs had taught them the opposite, it was felt that there
          should be some common and authoritative standard. Hence the wisest and
          best of the fathers insisted on abiding by the written word, and
          receiving nothing as of divine authority not contained therein. In
          this, however, it must be confessed they were not always consistent.
          Whenever prescription, usage, or conviction founded on unwritten
          evidence, was available against an adversary, they did not hesitate to
          make the most of it. During all the early centuries, therefore, the
          distinction between Scripture and tradition was not so sharply drawn
          as it has been since the controversies between Romanists and
          Protestants, and especially since the decisions of the Council of
          Trent.

        <p>Tridentine Doctrine</p>
        <p>
          That Council, and the Latin Church as a body, teach on this subject,
          —(1.) That Christ and his Apostles taught many things which were not
          committed to writing, i.e., not recorded in the Sacred Scriptures.
          (2.) That these instructions have been faithfully transmitted, and
          preserved in the Church. (3.) That they constitute a part of the rule
          of faith for all believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These particulars are included in the following extracts from the acts
          of the Council: "Synodus—perspiciens hanc veritatem et disciplinam
          contineri in libris scriptis et sine scripto traditionibus, quæ ex
          ipsius Christi ore ab apostolis acceptae, aut ab ipsis apostolis,
          Spiritu Sancto dictante, quasi per manus traditæ, ad nos usque
          pervenerunt; orthodoxorum patrum exempla secuta, omnes libros tam
          Veteris quam Novi Testamenti, cum utriusque unus Deus sit auctor, nec
          non traditiones ipsas, tum ad fidem tum ad mores pertinentes, tanquam
          vel ore tenus a Christo, vel a Spiritu Sancto dictatas, et continua
          successione in Ecclesia Catholica conservatas, pari pietatis affectu
          et reverentia suscipit et veneratur." Bellarmin divides traditions
          into three classes: divine, apostolical, and ecclesiastical. "Divinæ
          dicuntur quæ acceptæ sunt ab ipso Christo apostolos docente, et
          nusquam in divinis literis inveniuntur.… Apostolicæ traditiones
          proprie dicuntur illæ, quæ ab apostolis institutæ sunt, non tamen sine
          assistentia Spiritus Sancti et nihilominus non extant scriptæ in eorum
          epistolis.… Ecclesiasticæ traditiones proprie dicuntur consuetudines
          quædam antiquæ vel a prælatis vel a populis inchoatæ, quæ paulatim
          tacito consensu populorum vim legis obtinuerunt. Et quidem traditiones
          divinæ eandem vim habent, quam divina præcepta sive divina doctrina
          scripta in Evangeliis. Et similiter apostolicæ traditiones non scriptæ
          eandem vim habent, quam apostolicæ traditiones scriptæ.… Ecclesiasticæ
          autem traditiones eandem vim habent, quam decreta et constitutiones
          ecclesiasticæ scriptæ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Petrus à Soto, quoted by Chemnitz says, "Infallibilis est regula et
          catholica. Quacunque credit, tenet, et servat Romana Ecclesia, et in
          Scripturis non habentur, illa ab apostolis esse tradita; item quarum
          observationum initium, author et origo ignoretur, vel inveniri non
          potest, illas extra omnem dubitationem ab apostolis tradita esse."
        </p>
        <p>
          From this it appears, 1. That these traditions are called unwritten
          because not contained in the Scriptures. They are, for the most part,
          now to be found written in the works of the Fathers, decisions of
          councils, ecclesiastical constitutions, and rescripts of the Popes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The office of tradition is to convey a knowledge of doctrines,
          precepts, and institutions not contained in Scripture; and also to
          serve as a guide to the proper understanding of what is therein
          written. Tradition, therefore, in the Church of Rome, is both the
          supplement and interpretation of the written word.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The authority due to tradition is the same as that which belongs to
          the Scriptures. Both are to be received "pari pietatis affectu et
          reverentia." Both are derived from the same source both are received
          through the same channel; and both are authenticated by the same
          witness. This authority, however, belongs properly only to traditions
          regarded as divine or apostolical. Those termed ecclesiastical are of
          less importance, relating to rites and usages. Still for them is
          claimed an authority virtually divine, as they are enjoined by a
          church which claims to have been endowed by Christ with full power to
          ordain rites and ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The criteria by which to distinguish between true and false
          traditions, are either antiquity and catholicity, or the testimony of
          the extant Church. Sometimes the one, and sometimes the other is
          urged. The Council of Trent gives the former; so does Bellarmin, and
          so do the majority of Romish theologians. This is the famous rule
          established by Vincent of Lerins in the fifth century, "quod semper,
          quod ubique, quod ab omnibus." On all occasions, however, the ultimate
          appeal is to the decision of the Church. Whatever the Church declares
          to be a part of the revelation committed to her, is to be received as
          of divine authority, at the peril of salvation.
