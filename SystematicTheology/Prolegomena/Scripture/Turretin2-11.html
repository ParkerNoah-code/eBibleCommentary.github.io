        <h2>The Authentic Version of Scripture</h2>
        <p>ELEVENTH QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Are the Hebrew version of the Old Testament and the Greek of the
            New the only authentic ones? Affirmative, against the Roman
            Catholics.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Some versions of Scripture are original and primary, originally
          prepared by the authors; others are secondary, versions in other
          languages into which it has been translated. No one denies that the
          Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New are original and
          first written, but there is a controversy between us and the Roman
          Catholics as to whether both are authentic, and deserve in themselves
          both faith and authority, and whether all other versions are to be
          tested by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Some Roman Catholics--Sixtus Senensis, Driedo, Andradius, and
          others--do justice to the sources by affirming their purity, as seen
          above, and, on account of their purity, ascribing authenticity to
          them, so that all versions, including even the Vulgate, may be
          corrected from them. But more of them do not, and hold that there is
          no certainty about the substance of the Hebrew, either for appeal to
          the sources in controversies over faith, or for correcting the Vulgate
          from it; for example, Stapleton, Cano, Lindanus, and others who
          contend for the corruption of the sources. This teaching is taken from
          the decree of the Council of Trent, session 4, which said: "Let the
          Latin Vulgate version be held authoritative for public reading,
          disputation, preaching, and exposition, in the sense that no one dare
          reject it for any reason." It is granted that many Roman Catholics,
          who are ashamed of this decree, try to construe it in another sense,
          as if the council had said nothing against the authenticity of the
          original text, and had not given the Vulgate precedence over the
          sources, but had only chosen one out of the Latin versions which were
          in circulation, which it declared superior to the others, as
          Bellarmine says (De Verba Dei 2.10), which is also the opinion of
          Andradius, Salmeron, Serarius, and others. That this is a distortion
          of the decree of the Synod Bannes rightly argues, and it can easily be
          seen from the words of the council itself. For if it is to be held as
          authoritative, and no one is to dare reject it for any reason, is it
          not equated with the sources, and indeed made superior to them? If it
          differs from the sources it will not be brought into harmony with
          them, but rather they made to agree with it. So Mariana concludes that
          after the promulgation of [the decrees of the] Council of Trent "the
          Greek and Hebrew have fallen with one blow." But our teaching is that
          only the Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New have
          been and are authentic in the sense that all controversies concerning
          faith and religion, and all versions, are to be tested and examined by
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. An authentic writing is one with regard to which all factors
          together produce confidence, and to which complete trust should be
          given in its field, from which it is evident both that it must come
          from the author whose name it bears, and that everything in it must be
          written as he wanted it written. Such a writing can be authentic in
          either of two senses--primary and original and secondary and
          derivative. The primary sense applies to what bears its own
          authentication, which proves itself by itself, and which is believed
          and clearly should be believed on its own showing (ob seipsum). In
          this category are the original copies of royal edicts, of the decrees
          of magistrates, wills, contracts, and anything else actually written
          by the author. In the secondary group are all copies accurately and
          faithfully made by qualified (idoneus) persons, such as the
          functionaries appointed and authorized by public authority to copy the
          edicts of princes and other public documents, or the various honest
          and faithful scribes and copyists of books and other writings. In the
          first sense only the "autographs" of Moses, the prophets and the
          apostles are authentic, but in the second sense faithful and accurate
          copies are also.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Furthermore, the authority of such authentic writing has two
          aspects: one rests on the substance of the matter with which it deals
          (in rebus ipsis de quibus id agitur), and concerns the people to whom
          the writing is directed; the other concerns the word itself and the
          writing and applies to the copies and translations made from it, and
          receives all its authority (ius) from the original, so that it should
          be compared to that authentic writing and corrected if there is any
          difference. The first kind of authority (authoritas) may be greater or
          less, depending on the authority of him by whom the writing was
          issued, and whether he has more or less authority (imperium) over the
          people to whom he addresses it. With the Holy Scripture, authority is
          found to the greatest degree, such as cannot reside in any other
          writing, since we ought simply to obey God, and be obedient to
          everything which he has, in his most holy authentic written Word,
          required either to be believed or to be done, on account of that
          supreme authority which he holds over mankind, as over all creation,
          and that supreme truth and wisdom which reside in him. But the second
          kind of authority consists in this, that faithful and accurate copies,
          not less than autographs, are norms for all other copies of his
          writing and for translations. If any discrepancy is found in these,
          whether it conflicts with the originals or the true copies, they are
          not worthy of the name "authentic," and must be rejected as false and
          corrupted, and there is no other reason for this rejection except the
          discrepancy. We wrote above, in question 4, about the first kind of
          authority. Here we discuss the second, which is found in the authentic
          version (editio).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Finally, authenticity can be seen in two ways: materially, with
          regard to the teaching (res enunciata), or formally, with regard to
          the words and the methods (modus enunciandi). It is not a question
          here of the first--we do not deny this authenticity to the versions
          when they agree with the sources--but only of the second, which
          belongs only to the sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The reasons are (1) only the sources are inspired both in
          substance and in wording (II TIm. 3:16); therefore only they can be
          authentic. For what men of God wrote they wrote guided by the Holy
          Spirit (II Peter 1:21), who, lest they fall into error, determined
          (dictavit) not only the substance but also the words, which cannot be
          said of any translation (versio). (2) They are the norm and rule by
          which all versions are to be tested,- as the ectype must be referred
          to the archetype and a brook is recognized from its source. The canon
          of Gratian based on Augustine reads: "That the trustworthiness of the
          old books be tested from the Hebrew manuscripts; thus the -truth of
          the Greek of the new falls short of the norm." Much is presented by
          Jerome in this matter as he argues for the authority of the Hebrew
          text: see his letter 102 to Marcellus and letters to Vltalus, and to
          Sunias and Fretellas. (3) These texts (editiones) have been held as
          authentic from the beginning, and were always so held by Jews and
          Christians, for many centuries after Christ, and no reason can be
          given why they should now cease to be authentic. For the reasons that
          have been suggested to support the concept of corruption not only
          assume what should be proved but also have been refuted by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (4) If the Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New
          are not authentic, there is no authentic version; no other has divine
          witness to its authenticity. If there is no authentic Word of God in
          the church, there will be no end of strife, for there will be no
          assured rule of faith and conduct to which all must agree, and
          Scripture will be like a wax nose, or a law of Lesbos interpreted in
          accordance with private judgment. (5) Our adversaries admit that in
          some cases it is necessary to refer to the sources. Bellarmine gives
          the following cases: (a) when there seems to be a copyist's error in
          the Latin manuscripts; (b) when there are variant readings, so that it
          is impossible to be sure which is right; (c) when there is ambiguity
          either in the words or the content; (d) when the force and connotation
          of the [Latin] words are not explicit enough (De Verba Dei 2.11). This
          could not be valid unless the sources were authentic. Arias Montanus,
          in his preface to the Bible, shows that errors in the versions cannot
          be corrected except from the truth of the original language. Vives
          lays it down as certain and beyond doubt that recourse must be had to
          the sources. Salmeron, Bonfrerius, Masius, Muisius, Jansen and his
          followers, and others who presently appeal to the sources have the
          same conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The variant readings that occur in Scripture do not detract from
          its authenticity, because they are easily recognized and understood,
          partly by the context (cohaerentia textus), and partly by collation of
          the better manuscripts; many are of such nature that, although they
          differ, yet they agree in meaning (licet diversae non male tamen eidem
          textui conveniant).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Although a number of controversies have arisen from the Hebrew and
          Greek sources, it does not follow that they cannot be authentic,
          because if they were not, there would be no authentic version of the
          Bible whatsoever to which appeal could be made; there is no language
          which would not offer much opportunity for argumentative disputation.
          Moreover, [controversy] is not the fault of the sources but of those
          who abuse the sources, either not understanding them or twisting them
          to their own opinions, and stubbornly sticking to the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The statement that the Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament and
          the Greek of the New have become defective is false, and the passages
          which are offered in proof of this by our adversaries cannot
          demonstrate it. Not the pericope of adultery (John 8), which, although
          it is lacking in the Syriac, is found in all the Greek manuscripts.
          Not the saying in I John 5:7, although formerly some called it into
          question, and heretics do so today. All the Greek witnesses
          (exemplaria) have it, as Sixtus Senensis recognizes: "The words always
          were of unquestioned truth, and are read in all Greek manuscripts from
          the time of the apostles themselves." Not Mark 16, which was lacking
          in a number of manuscripts in Jerome's time, as he admits, but now is
          found in all, and also in the Syriac, and isclearly necessary to
          complete the account of Christ's resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. It is useless for our adversaries to use the newness of the vowel
          points in the Hebrew manuscripts as a means of overcoming their
          authenticity, as if the points were merely a human innovation made by
          the Masoretes, depending therefore not on divine and infallible
          authority, but on human, and therefore subject to change by human
          decision, without risk, so that the meaning of the text remains
          forever uncertain and ambiguous. They can be answered in a number of
          ways. (1) Bellarmine will give this reply on our behalf: "The errors
          which arise on account of the addition of the points do not affect
          truth, because the points have been added externally, and do not
          change the text" (De Verba Dei 2.2). (2) On this hypothesis, not only
          does assurance concerning the original text leave us, but also
          assurance concerning the Vulgate, which was prepared from that source,
          unless it can be shown that the first author of that version, whether
          Jerome or somebody else, received directly from the Spirit the
          necessary revelation concerning the vowels, which otherwise surely
          came from the tradition of the Jews. If that was uncertain, all the
          authority of the sacred text totters.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. (3) Even if the points were added at a late date, as these who
          date their origin from the Masoretes of Tiberias claim, it does not
          follow that they are merely a human device, depending only on human
          judgment, which indeed, if it be assumed, considerably weakens the
          authority of the Hebrew manuscript. For the pointing, in the opinion
          of those who hold this hypothesis, is not supposed to have been done
          according to the judgment of the rabbis, but according to the analogy
          of Scripture, the nature (genius) of the sacred language, and the
          meaning that had long been accepted by the Jews, so that even if the
          points were not, as on this hypothesis, part of the original with
          regard to their shape, it cannot be denied that they always were part
          of it with regard to sound and value, or power. Otherwise, since
          vowels are the souls of consonants, the text would always have been
          ambiguous; indeed no clear meaning of the word would be possible
          unless [the vowels] were as old as the consonants, as Prideaux in his
          twelfth lecture on the antiquity of the points soundly observes: "That
          the points and accents were part of the original in respect to sound
          and value no one denies: [the question] only concerns the marks and
          characters." And again, "the vowels were as old as the consonants with
          regard to underlying quality (vis) and sound, although the dots and
          marks which are now employed had not then appeared." Indeed it is
          hardly possible to doubt that the vowels, if not with the same marks
          that are now written, were nevertheless indicated by some marks in
          place of the points, in order that the sure and unchanging message
          (sensus) of the Holy Spirit, which otherwise, depending merely on
          human learning and memory, could easily have been forgotten, or
          corrupted, might be retained. [This could have been done,] as some
          suppose, by the letters aleph, waw, andyodh, which are therefore
          called "the mothers of speech." Such is the opinion of the learned
          [Brian] Walton, who says, "By usage and the tradition of the elders,
          the true reading and pronounciation had been preserved by means of the
          three letters aleph, waw, andyodh which are called mothers of speech
          and which served in place of vowels before the introduction of the
          points" (Prolegomena to the [London] Polyglot 7).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. (4) Our adversaries arbitrarily assume what requires proof, that
          points are a modem and human addition, a conclusion with which a great
          many Jews, notably Eli Levi, who lived a century ago, disagreed, in
          which they were followed by many highly regarded philologists
          (grammatici) and theologians, both Protestant and Catholic--Junius,
          Illyricus, Reuchlin, Munster, Cevalerius, Pagninus, M. Marinus,
          Polanus, Deodatus, Broughton, Muisius, Taylor, Booth, Lightfoot, and
          most theologians since them. The whole case seems to have been settled
          by the Buxtorfs, father and son, the first in his Tiberias, the second
          in that most thorough work with which he refuted Arcanum punctationis
          revelatum. It would not be difficult to support this position by a
          number of considerations, if we should now turn our attention to it,
          but since the question is one of philology rather than of theology we
          do not care to make it our battle. It is enough to have it understood
          that to us the teaching that regards the points as of divine origin
          has always seemed truer and safer, for the support of the authenticity
          of the original text whole and complete against heretics, and the
          establishing of a sure and changeless principle of faith, whether [the
          points] come from Moses or from Ezra, the leader of the Great
          Synagogue, and so it is useless for our adversaries to seek to
          question the authority of the Hebrew manuscripts on the ground of the
          newness of the points.
