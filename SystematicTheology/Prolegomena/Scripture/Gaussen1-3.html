        <h2>III. Plenitude of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Three descriptions of men, in these late times, without disavowing the
          divinity of Christianity, and without venturing to decline the
          authority of the Scriptures, have thought themselves authorized to
          reject this doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these have disowned the very existence of this action of the
          Holy Ghost; others have denied its universality; others, again, its
          plenitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first, like Dr Schleiermacher, Dr De Wette, and many other German
          divines, reject all miraculous inspiration, and are unwilling to
          attribute to the sacred writers any more than Cicero accorded to the
          poets—afflatum spiritûs divini—"a divine action of nature, an interior
          power resembling the other vital forces of nature."
        </p>
        <p>
          The second, like Dr Michaelis, and like Theodore of Mopsuestia,3 while
          admitting the existence of a divine inspiration, would confine it to a
          part only of the sacred books: to the first and fourth of the four
          evangelists, for example; to a part of the epistles, to a part of
          Moses, a part of Isaiah, a part of Daniel. These portions of the
          Scriptures, say they, are from God, the others are from man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third class, in fine, like M. Twesten in Germany, and like many
          divines in England, extend, it is true, the notion of a divine
          inspiration to all parts of the Bible, but not to all equally (nicht
          gleichmaessig). Inspiration, as they understand it, might be universal
          indeed, but unequal; often imperfect, accompanied with innocent
          errors; and carried to very different degrees, according to the nature
          of different passages: of which degrees they constitute themselves,
          more or less, the judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of these, particularly in England, have gone so far as to
          distinguish four degrees of divine inspiration: the inspiration of
          superintendence, they have said, in virtue of which the sacred writers
          have been constantly preserved from serious error in all that relates
          to faith and life; the inspiration of elevation, by which the Holy
          Ghost, further, by carrying up the thoughts of the men of God into the
          purest regions of truth, must have indirectly stamped the same
          characters of holiness and grandeur on their words; the inspiration of
          direction, under the more powerful action of which the sacred writers
          were under God's guidance in regard to what they said and abstained
          from saying; finally, the inspiration of suggestion. Here, they say,
          all the thoughts, and even the words, have been given by God, by means
          of a still more energetic and direct operation of his Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Theopneustia," says M. Twesten, "extends unquestionably even to
          words, but only when the choice or the employment of them is connected
          with the religious life of the soul; for one ought, in this respect,"
          he adds, "to distinguish between the Old and New Testament, between
          the Law and the Gospel, between history and prophecy, between
          narratives and doctrines, between the apostles and their apostolical
          assistants."
        </p>
        <p>
          To our mind these are all fantastic distinctions; the Bible has not
          authorized them; the Church of the first eight centuries of the
          Christian era knew nothing of them; and we believe them to be
          erroneous in themselves, and deplorable in their results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our design then, in this book, in opposition to these three systems,
          is to prove the existence, the universality, and the plenitude of the
          divine inspiration of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, it concerns us to know if there has been a divine and
          miraculous inspiration for the Scriptures. We say that there has.
          Next, we have to know if the parts of Scripture that are divinely
          inspired are equally and entirely so; or, in other terms, if God have
          provided, in a certain though mysterious manner, that the very words
          of his holy book should always be what they ought to be, and that it
          should contain no error. This, too, we affirm to be the case. Finally,
          we have to know whether what is thus inspired by God in the
          Scriptures, be a part of the Scriptures, or the whole of the
          Scriptures. We say that it is the whole Scriptures;—the historical
          books as well as the prophecies; the Gospels as well as the Song of
          Solomon; the Gospels of Mark and Luke, as well as those of John and
          Matthew; the history of the shipwreck of St Paul in the waters of the
          Adriatic, as well as that of the shipwreck of the old world in the
          waters of the flood; the scenes of Mamre beneath the tents of Abraham,
          as well as those of the day of Christ in the eternal tabernacles; the
          prophetic prayers in which the Messiah, a thousand years before his
          first advent, cries in the Psalms, "My God, my God, why hast thou
          forsaken me?—they have pierced my hands and my feet—they have cast
          lots upon my vesture—they look and stare at me"—as well as the
          narratives of them by St John, St Mark, St Luke, or St Matthew.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, it has been our object to establish by the Word of God
          that the Scripture is from God, that the Scripture is throughout from
          God, and that the Scripture throughout is entirely from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, however, we must make ourselves clearly understood. In
          maintaining that all Scripture is from God, we are very far from
          thinking that man goes for nothing in it. We shall return in a
          subsequent section to this opinion; but we have felt it necessary to
          state it here. There, all the words are man's; as there, too, all the
          words are God's. In a certain sense, the Epistle to the Romans is
          altogether a letter of Paul's; and in a still higher sense, the
          Epistle to the Romans is altogether a letter of God's.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pascal might have dictated one of his Provincial Letters to some
          Clermont artisan, and another to the Abbess of Port-Royal. Could the
          former have been on that account less Pascalian than all the rest?
          Undoubtedly not. The great Newton, when he wished to hand over to the
          world his marvellous discoveries, might have employed some Cambridge
          youth to write out the fortieth, and some college servant the
          forty-first proposition of his immortal work, the Principia, while he
          might have dictated the remaining pages to Barrow and Halley. Should
          we any the less possess the discoveries of his genius, and the
          mathematical reasonings which lead us to refer to one and the same law
          all the movements in the universe? Would the whole work be any the
          less his? No, undoubtedly. Perhaps, however, some one at his leisure
          might have further taken some interest in knowing what were the
          emotions of those two great men, or the simple thoughts of that boy,
          or the honest musings of that domestic, at the time that their four
          pens, all alike docile, traced the Latin sentences that were dictated
          to them. You may have been told that the two latter, as they plied the
          quill, allowed their thoughts to revert indifferently to past scenes
          in the gardens of the city, or in the courts of Trinity College; while
          the two professors, following with the most intense interest every
          thought of their friend, and participating in his sublime career, like
          eaglets on their mother's back, sprang with him into the loftiest
          elevations of science, borne up by his mighty wings, soaring with
          delight into the new and boundless regions which he had opened to
          them. Nevertheless, you may have been told, among the lines thus
          dictated, there may have been some which neither the boy nor even the
          professors were capable of understanding. These details are of little
          consequence, you would have replied; I will not waste any time upon
          them; I will study the book. Its preface, its title, it first line,
          and its last line, all its theorems, easy or difficult, understood or
          not understood, are from the same author, and that is enough. Whoever
          the writers may have been, and however different the respective
          elevation of their thoughts, their hand, faithful to its task, and
          superintended while engaged in it, has equally traced their master's
          thoughts on the same roll of paper; and there I can always study, with
          equal confidence, in the very words of his genius, the mathematical
          principles of Newton's philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is the fact of the divine inspiration of the Scriptures; nearly
          to this extent, that in causing his books to be written by inspired
          men, the Holy Ghost has almost always, more or less, employed the
          instrumentality of their understanding, their will, their memory, and
          all the powers of their personality, as we shall erelong have occasion
          to repeat. And it is thus that God, who desired to make known to his
          elect, in a book that was to last for ever, the spiritual principles
          of divine philosophy, has caused its pages to be written, in the
          course of a period of sixteen hundred years, by priests, by kings, by
          warriors, by shepherds, by publicans, by fishermen, by scribes, by
          tentmakers, associating their affections and their faculties
          therewith, more or less, according as he deemed fit. Such, then, is
          God's book. Its first line, its last line, all its teachings,
          understood or not understood, are by the same author; and that ought
          to suffice for us. Whoever may have been the writers—whatever their
          circumstances, their impressions, their comprehension of the book, and
          the measure of their individuality in this powerful and mysterious
          operation—they have all written faithfully and under superintendence
          in the same roll, under the guidance of one and the same Master, for
          whom a thousand years are as one day; and the result has been the
          Bible. Therefore I will not lose time in idle questions; I will study
          the book. It is the word of Moses, the word of Amos, the word of John,
          the word of Paul; but still the thoughts expressed are God's thoughts,
          and the words are God's words. "Thou, Lord, hast spoken by the mouth
          of thy servant David." "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me," said he,
          "and his word was in my tongue."
        </p>
        <p>
          It would then, in our view, be holding very erroneous language to say
          —certain passages in the Bible are man's, and certain passages in the
          Bible are God's. No; every verse without exception is man's; and every
          verse without exception is God's, whether we find him speaking there
          directly in his own name, or whether he employs the entire personality
          of the sacred writer. And as St Bernard has said of the living works
          of the regenerated man, "that our will does nothing there without
          grace, but that grace does nothing there without our will;" so ought
          we to say, that in the Scriptures God has done nothing but by man, and
          man has done nothing but by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, it is with divine inspiration as with efficacious grace. In
          the operations of the Holy Ghost while causing the sacred books to be
          written, and in those of the same divine agent while converting a
          soul, and causing it to advance in the ways of sanctification, man is
          in different respects entirely active and entirely passive. God does
          all there; man does all there; and it may be said for both of these
          works what St Paul said of one of them to the Philippians, "It is God
          that worketh in you to will and to do." Thus you will see that in the
          Scriptures the same operations are attributed alternately to God and
          to man. God converts, and it is man that converts himself. God
          circumcises the heart, God gives a new heart; and it is man that
          should circumcise his heart, and make himself a new heart. "Not only
          because, in order to obtain such or such an effect, we ought to employ
          the means to obtain such or such an effect," says the famous President
          Edwards in his admirable remarks against the errors of the Arminians,
          "but because this effect itself is our act, as it is our duty; God
          producing all, and we acting all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, then, is the Word of God. It is God speaking in man, God
          speaking by man, God speaking as man, God speaking for man! This is
          what we have asserted, and must now proceed to prove. Possibly,
          however, it will be as well that we should first give a more precise
          definition of this doctrine.
