            Tradition</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          A. Difference between Tradition and the Analogy of Faith 1. The Romish
          doctrine of tradition differs essentially from the Protestant doctrine
          of the analogy of faith. Protestants admit that there is a kind of
          tradition within the limits of the sacred Scriptures themselves. One
          generation of sacred writers received the whole body of truth taught
          by those who preceded them. There was a tradition of doctrine, a
          traditionary usus loquendi, traditionary figures, types, and symbols.
          The revelation of God in his Word begins in a fountain, and flows in a
          continuous stream ever increasing in volume. We are governed by this
          tradition of truth running through the whole sacred volume. All is
          consistent. One part cannot contradict another. Each part must be
          interpreted so as to bring it into harmony with the whole. This is
          only saying that Scripture must explain Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again, Protestants admit that as there has been an uninterrupted
          tradition of truth from the protevangelium to the close of the
          Apocalypse, so there has been a stream of traditionary teaching
          flowing through the Christian Church from the day of Pentecost to the
          present time. This tradition is so far a rule of faith that nothing
          contrary to it can be true. Christians do not stand isolated, each
          holding his own creed. They constitute one body, having one common
          creed. Rejecting that creed, or any of its parts, is the rejection of
          the fellowship of Christians, incompatible with the communion of
          saints, or membership in the body of Christ. In other words,
          Protestants admit that there is a common faith of the Church, which no
          man is at liberty to reject, and which no man can reject and be a
          Christian. They acknowledge the authority of this common faith for two
          reasons. First, because what all the competent readers of a plain book
          take to be its meaning, must be its meaning. Secondly, because the
          Holy Spirit is promised to guide the people of God into the knowledge
          of the truth, and therefore that which they, under the teachings of
          the Spirit, agree in believing must be true. There are certain fixed
          doctrines among Christians, as there are among Jews and Mohammedans,
          which are no longer open questions. The doctrines of the Trinity, of
          the divinity and incarnation of the eternal Son of God; of the
          personality and divinity of the Holy Spirit; of the apostasy and
          sinfulness of the human race; the doctrines of the expiation of sin
          through the death of Christ and of salvation through his merits; of
          regeneration and sanctification by the Holy Ghost; of the forgiveness
          of sins, the resurrection of the body, and of the life everlasting,
          have always entered into the faith of every recognized, historical
          church on the face of the earth, and cannot now be legitimately called
          into question by any pretending to be Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the more philosophical of the Romish theologians would have us
          believe that this is all they mean by tradition. They insist, they
          say, only on the authority of common consent. Thus Moehler, Professor
          of Theology at Munich, in his "Symbolik, oder Darstellung der
          Dogmatischen Gegensätze," says, "Tradition, in the subjective sense of
          the word, is the common faith, or consciousness of the Church." "The
          ever-living word in the hearts of believers."2 It is, he says, what
          Eusebius means by the ἐκκλησιαστικὸν φρόνημα; and what Vincent of
          Lerins intends by the ecclesiastica intelligentia, and the Council of
          Trent by the universus ecclesiæ sensus. "In the objective sense of the
          word," Moehler says that "Tradition is the common faith of the Church
          as presented in external, historical witnesses through all centuries."
          "In this latter sense," he tells us, "tradition is commonly viewed
          when spoken of as a guide to the interpretation of the rule of faith."
          He admits that in this sense "Tradition contains nothing beyond what
          is taught in Scripture; the two as to their contents are one and the
          same." Nevertheless, he acknowledges that in the Church of Rome many
          things were handed down from the Apostles which are not contained in
          the Scriptures. This fact he does not deny. He admits that such
          additional revelations, or such revelations in addition to those
          contained in the written word, are of the highest importance. But he
          soon dismisses the subject, and devotes his strength to the
          first-mentioned view of the nature and office of tradition, and holds
          that up as the peculiar doctrine of Romanism as opposed to the
          Protestant doctrine. Protestants, however, admit the fact and the
          authority of a common consciousness, and a common faith, or common
          sense of the Church, while they reject the real and peculiar doctrine
          of Rome on this subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Points of Difference between the Romish Doctrine and that of
          Protestants on Common Consent
        </p>
        <p>
          The points of difference between the Protestant doctrine concerning
          the common faith of the Church and the Roman Catholic doctrine of
          tradition are:—
        </p>
        <p>
          First. When Protestants speak of common consent of Christians, they
          understand by Christians the true people of God. Romanists, on the
          other hand, mean the company of those who profess the true faith, and
          who are subject to the Pope of Rome. There is the greatest possible
          difference between the authority due to the common faith of truly
          regenerated, holy men, the temples of the Holy Ghost, and that due to
          what a society of nominal Christians profess to believe, the great
          majority of whom may be worldly, immoral, and irreligious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The common consent for which Protestants plead concerns only
          essential doctrines; that is, doctrines which enter into the very
          nature of Christianity as a religion, and which are necessary to its
          subjective existence in the heart, or which if they do not enter
          essentially into the religious experience of believers, are so
          connected with vital doctrines as not to admit of separation from
          them. Romanists, on the contrary, plead the authority of tradition for
          all kinds of doctrines and precepts, for rites and ceremonies, and
          ecclesiastical institutions, which have nothing to do with the life of
          the Church, and are entirely outside of the sphere of the promised
          guidance of the Spirit. Our Lord, in promising the Spirit to guide his
          people into the knowledge of truths necessary to their salvation, did
          not promise to preserve them from error in subordinate matters, or to
          give them supernatural knowledge of the organization of the Church,
          the number of the sacraments, or the power of bishops. The two
          theories, therefore, differ not only as to the class of persons who
          are guided by the Spirit, but also as to the class of subjects in
          relation to which that guidance is promised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. A still more important difference is, that the common faith
          of the Church for which Protestants contend, is faith in doctrines
          plainly revealed in Scripture. It does not extend beyond those
          doctrines. It owes its whole authority to the fact that it is a common
          understanding of the written word, attained and preserved under that
          teaching of the Spirit, which secures to believers a competent
          knowledge of the plan of salvation therein revealed. On the other
          hand, tradition is with the Romanists entirely independent of the
          Scriptures. They plead for a common consent in doctrines not contained
          in the Word of God, or which cannot be proved therefrom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly. Protestants do not regard "common consent" either as an
          informant or as a ground of faith. With them the written word is the
          only source of knowledge of what God has revealed for our salvation,
          and his testimony therein is the only ground of our faith. Whereas,
          with Romanists, tradition is not only an informant of what is to be
          believed, but the witness on whose testimony faith is to be yielded.
          It is one thing to say that the fact that all the true people of God,
          under the guidance of the Spirit, believe that certain doctrines are
          taught in Scripture, is an unanswerable argument that they are really
          taught therein, and quite another thing to say that because an
          external society, composed of all sorts of men, to whom no promise of
          divine guidance has been given, agree in holding certain doctrines,
          therefore we are bound to receive those doctrines as part of the
          revelation of God.
        </p>
        <p>C. Tradition and Development</p>
        <p>
          The Romish doctrine of tradition is not to be confounded with the
          modern doctrine of development. All Protestants admit that there has
          been, in one sense, an uninterrupted development of theology in the
          Church, from the apostolic age to the present time. All the facts,
          truths, doctrines, and principles, which enter into Christian
          theology, are in the Bible. They are there as fully and as clearly at
          one time as at another; at the beginning as they are now. No addition
          has been made to their number, and no new explanation has been
          afforded of their nature or relations. The same is true of the facts
          of nature. They are now what they have been from the beginning. They
          are, however, far better known, and more clearly understood now than
          they were a thousand years ago. The mechanism of the heavens was the
          same in the days of Pythagoras as it was in those of La Place; and yet
          the astronomy of the latter was immeasurably in advance of that of the
          former. The change was effected by a continual and gradual progress.
          The same progress has taken place in theological knowledge. Every
          believer is conscious of such progress in his own experience. When he
          was a child, he thought as a child. As he grew in years, he grew in
          knowledge of the Bible. He increased not only in the compass, but in
          the clearness, order, and harmony of his knowledge. This is just as
          true of the Church collectively as of the individual Christian. It is,
          in the first place, natural, if not inevitable, that it should be so.
          The Bible, although so clear and simple in its teaching, that he who
          runs may read and learn enough to secure his salvation, is still full
          of the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God; full of τὰ Βάθη
          τοῦ θεοῦ, the profoundest truths concerning all the great problems
          which have taxed the intellect of man from the beginning. These truths
          are not systematically stated, but scattered, so to speak,
          promiscuously over the sacred pages, just as the facts of science are
          scattered over the face of nature, or hidden in its depths. Every man
          knows that there is unspeakably more in the Bible than he has yet
          learned, as every man of science knows that there is unspeakably more
          in nature than he has yet discovered, or understands. It stands to
          reason that such a book, being the subject of devout and laborious
          study, century after century, by able and faithful men, should come to
          be better and better understood. And as in matters of science,
          although one false theory after another, founded on wrong principles
          or on an imperfect induction of facts, has passed away, yet real
          progress is made, and the ground once gained is never lost, so we
          should naturally expect it to be with the study of the Bible. False
          views, false inferences, misapprehensions, ignoring of some facts, and
          misinterpretations, might be expected to come and go, in endless
          succession, but nevertheless a steady progress in the knowledge of
          what the Bible teaches be accomplished. And we might also expect that
          here, too, the ground once surely gained would not again be lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, in the second place, what is thus natural and reasonable in
          itself is a patent historical fact. The Church has thus advanced in
          theological knowledge. The difference between the confused and
          discordant representations of the early fathers on all subjects
          connected with the doctrines of the Trinity and of the person of
          Christ, and the clearness, precision, and consistency of the views
          presented after ages of discussion, and the statement of these
          doctrines by the Councils of Chalcedon and Constantinople, is as great
          almost as between chaos and cosmos. And this ground has never been
          lost. The same is true with regard to the doctrines of sin and grace.
          Before the long-continued discussion of these subjects in the
          Augustinian period, the greatest confusion and contradiction prevailed
          in the teachings of the leaders of the Church; during those
          discussions the views of the Church became clear and settled. There is
          scarcely a principle or doctrine concerning the fall of man, the
          nature of sin and guilt, inability, the necessity of the Spirit's
          influence, etc., etc., which now enters into the faith of evangelical
          Christians, which was not then clearly stated and authoritatively
          sanctioned by the Church. In like manner, before the Reformation,
          similar confusion existed with regard to the great doctrine of
          justification. No clear line of discrimination was drawn between it
          and sanctification. Indeed, during the Middle Ages, and among the most
          devout of the schoolmen, the idea of guilt was merged in the general
          idea of sin, and sin regarded as merely moral defilement. The great
          object was to secure holiness. Then pardon would come of course. The
          apostolic, Pauline, deeply Scriptural doctrine, that there can be no
          holiness until sin be expiated, that pardon, justification, and
          reconciliation, must precede sanctification, was never clearly
          apprehended. This was the grand lesson which the Church learned at the
          Reformation, and which it has never since forgot. It is true then, as
          an historical fact, that the Church has advanced. It understands the
          great doctrines of theology, anthropology, and soteriology, far better
          now, than they were understood in the early post-apostolic age of the
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>Modern Theory of Development</p>
        <p>
          Very distinct from the view above presented is the modern theory of
          the organic development of the Church. This modern theory is avowedly
          founded on the pantheistic principles of Schelling and Hegel. With
          them the universe is the self-manifestation and evolution of the
          absolute Spirit. Dr. Schaff says, that this theory "has left an
          impression on German science that can never be effaced; and has
          contributed more than any other influence to diffuse a clear
          conception of the interior organism of history." In his work on the
          "Principles of Protestantism,"2 Dr. Schaff says that Schelling and
          Hegel taught the world to recognize in history "the ever opening sense
          of eternal thoughts, an always advancing rational development of the
          idea of humanity, and its relations to God." This theory of historical
          development was adopted, and partially Christianized by
          Schleiermacher, from whom it has passed over to Dr. Schaff, as set
          forth in his work above quoted, as well as to many other equally
          devout and excellent men. The basis of this modified theory is
          realism. Humanity is a generic life, an intelligent substance. That
          life became guilty and polluted in Adam. From him it passed over by a
          process of natural, organic development (the same numerical life and
          substance) to all his posterity, who therefore are guilty and
          polluted. This generic life the Son of God assumed into union with his
          divine nature, and thus healed it and raised it to a higher power or
          order. He becomes a new starting-point. The origin of this new form of
          life in Him is supernatural. The constitution of his person was a
          miracle. But from Him this life is communicated by a natural process
          of development to the Church. Its members are partakers of this new
          generic life. It is, however, a germ. Whatever lives grows. "Whatever
          is done is dead." This new life is Christianity. Christianity is not a
          form of doctrine objectively revealed in the Scriptures. Christian
          theology is not the knowledge, or systematic exhibition of what the
          Bible teaches. It is the interpretation of this inner life. The
          intellectual life of a child expresses itself in one way, of a boy in
          another way, and of a man in another and higher way. In each stage of
          his progress the man has views, feelings, and modes of thinking,
          appropriate to that stage. It would not do for a man to have the same
          views and thoughts as the child. Yet the latter are just as true, as
          right, and as proper, for the child, as those of the man for the man.
          It is thus with the Church. It passes through these stages of
          childhood, youth, and manhood, by a regular process. During the first
          centuries the Church had the indistinctness, vagueness, and
          exaggeration of views and doctrines, belonging to a period of infancy.
          In the Middle Ages it had a higher form. At the Reformation it
          advanced to the entrance on another stage. The form assumed by
          Christianity during the mediæval period, was for that period the true
          and proper, but not the permanent form. We have not reached that form
          as to doctrine yet. That will be reached in the Church of the future.
        </p>
        <p>Development as held by some Romanists</p>
        <p>
          There is still another and very different form of the doctrine of
          development. It does not assume the Mystical doctrine of the
          indwelling of the substance of Christ, in the soul, the development of
          which works out its illumination in the knowledge of the truth, and
          finally its complete redemption. It admits that Christianity is, or
          includes a system of doctrine, and that those doctrines are in the
          Scriptures; but holds that many of them are there only in their
          rudiments. Under the constant guidance and tuition of the Spirit, the
          Church comes to understand all that these rudiments contain, and to
          expand them in their fulness. Thus the Lord's Supper has been expanded
          into the doctrine of transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the mass;
          anointing the sick, into the sacrament of extreme unction; rules of
          discipline into the sacrament of penance, of satisfactions, of
          indulgences, of purgatory, and masses and prayers for the dead; the
          prominence of Peter, into the supremacy of the Pope. The Old Testament
          contains the germ of all the doctrines unfolded in the New; and so the
          New Testament contains the germs of all the doctrines unfolded, under
          the guidance of the Spirit, in the theology of the mediæval Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although attempts have been made by some Romanists and Anglicans to
          resolve the doctrine of tradition into one or other of these theories
          of development, they are essentially different. The only point of
          analogy between them is, that in both cases, little becomes much.
          Tradition has made contributions to the faith and institutions of the
          Christian Church; and development (in the two latter forms of the
          doctrine above mentioned) provides for a similar expansion.
        </p>
        <p>The Real Question</p>
        <p>
          The real status question, on this subject, as between Romanists and
          Protestants, is not (1) Whether the Spirit of God leads true believers
          into the knowledge of the truth; nor (2) whether true Christians agree
          in all essential matters as to truth and duty; nor (3) whether any man
          can safely or innocently dissent from this common faith of the people
          of God; but (4) whether apart from the revelation contained in the
          Bible, there is another supplementary and explanatory revelation,
          which has been handed down outside of the Scriptures, by tradition. In
          other words, whether there are doctrines, institutions, and
          ordinances, having no warrant in the Scriptures, which we as
          Christians are bound to receive and obey on the authority of what is
          called common consent. This Romanists affirm and Protestants deny.
        </p>
        <p>D. Arguments against the Doctrine of Tradition</p>
        <p>
          The heads of argument against the Romish doctrine on this subject are
          the following:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It involves a natural impossibility. It is of course conceded that
          Christ and his Apostles said and did much that is not recorded in the
          Scriptures; and it is further admitted that if we had any certain
          knowledge of such unrecorded instructions, they would be of equal
          authority with what is written in the Scriptures. But Protestants
          maintain that they were not intended to constitute a part of the
          permanent rule of faith to the Church. They were designed for the men
          of that generation. The showers which fell a thousand years ago,
          watered the earth and rendered it fruitful for men then living. They
          cannot now be gathered up and made available for us. They did not
          constitute a reservoir for the supply of future generations. In like
          manner the unrecorded teachings of Christ and his Apostles did their
          work. They were not designed for our instruction. It is as impossible
          to learn what they were, as it is to gather up the leaves which
          adorned and enriched the earth when Christ walked in the garden of
          Gethsemane. This impossibility arises out of the limitations of our
          nature, as well as its corruption consequent on the fall. Man has not
          the clearness of perception, the retentiveness of memory, or the power
          of presentation, to enable him (without supernatural aid) to give a
          trustworthy account of a discourse once heard, a few years or even
          months after its delivery. And that this should be done over and over
          from month to month for thousands of years, is an impossibility. If to
          this be added the difficulty in the way of this oral transmission,
          arising from the blindness of men to the things of the Spirit, which
          prevents their understanding what they hear, and from the disposition
          to pervert and misrepresent the truth to suit their own prejudices and
          purposes, it must be acknowledged that tradition cannot be a reliable
          source of knowledge of religious truth. This is universally
          acknowledged and acted upon, except by Romanists. No one pretends to
          determine what Luther and Calvin, Latimer and Cranmer, taught, except
          from contemporaneous written records. Much less will any sane man
          pretend to know what Moses and the prophets taught except from their
          own writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romanists admit the force of this objection. They admit that tradition
          would not be a trustworthy informant of what Christ and the Apostles
          taught, without the supernatural intervention of God. Tradition is to
          be trusted not because it comes down through the hands of fallible
          men, but because it comes through an infallibly guided Church. This,
          however, is giving up the question. It is merging the authority of
          tradition into the authority of the Church. There is no need of the
          former, if the latter be admitted. Romanists, however, keep these two
          things distinct. They say that if the Gospels had never been written,
          they would know by historical tradition the facts of Christ's life;
          and that if his discourses and the epistles of the Apostles had never
          been gathered up and recorded, they would by the same means know the
          truths which they contain. They admit, however, that this could not be
          without a special divine intervention.
        </p>
        <p>No Promise of Divine Intervention</p>
        <p>
          2. The second objection of Protestants to this theory is, that it is
          unphilosophical and irreligious to assume a supernatural intervention
          on the part of God, without promise and without proof, merely to suit
          a purpose,—Deus ex machina. Our Lord promised to preserve his Church
          from fatal apostasy; He promised to send his Spirit to abide with his
          people, to teach them; He promised that He would be with them to the
          end of the world. But these promises were not made to any external,
          visible organization of professing Christians, whether Greek or Latin;
          nor did they imply that any such Church should be preserved from all
          error in faith or practice; much less do they imply that instructions
          not recorded by the dictation of the Spirit, should be preserved and
          transmitted from generation to generation. There is no such promise in
          the Word of God, and as such preservation and transmission without
          divine, supernatural interposition, would be impossible, tradition
          cannot be a trustworthy informant of what Christ taught.
        </p>
        <p>No Criterion</p>
        <p>
          3. Romanists again admit that many false traditions have prevailed in
          different ages and in different parts of the Church. Those who receive
          them are confident of their genuineness, and zealous in their support.
          How shall the line be drawn between the true and false? By what
          criterion can the one be distinguished from the other? Protestants say
          there is no such criterion, and therefore, if the authority of
          tradition be admitted, the Church is exposed to a flood of
          superstition and error. This is their third argument against the
          Romish doctrine on this subject. Romanists, however, say they have a
          sure criterion in antiquity and universality. They have formulated
          their rule of judgment in the famous dictum of Vincent of Lerins:
          "Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus."
        </p>
        <p>Common Consent not a Criterion</p>
        <p>
          To this Protestants reply,—First, That they admit the authority of
          common consent among true Christians as to what is taught in the
          Scriptures. So far as all the true people of God agree in their
          interpretation of the Bible, we acknowledge ourselves bound to submit.
          But this consent is of authority only, (a) So far as it is the consent
          of true believers; (b) So far as it concerns the meaning of the
          written word; and, (c) So far as it relates to the practical,
          experimental, or essential doctrines of Christianity. Such consent as
          to matters outside of the Bible, or even supposed to be in the Bible,
          if they do not concern the foundation of our faith, is of no decisive
          weight. The whole Christian world, without one dissenting voice,
          believed for ages that the Bible taught that the sun moves round the
          earth. No man now believes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Common consent as to Christian doctrine cannot be pleaded
          except within narrow limits. It is only on the gratuitous and
          monstrous assumption that Romanists are the only Christians, that the
          least plausibility can be given to the claim of common consent. The
          argument is really this: The Church of Rome receives certain doctrines
          on the authority of tradition. The Church of Rome includes all true
          Christians. Therefore, the common consent of all Christians may be
          claimed in favour of those doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, thirdly, admitting that the Church of Rome is the whole Church,
          and admitting that Church to be unanimous in holding certain
          doctrines, that is no proof that that Church has always held them. The
          rule requires that a doctrine must be held not only ab omnibus, but
          semper. It is, however, a historical fact that all the peculiar
          doctrines of Romanism were not received in the early Church as matters
          of faith. Such doctrines as the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome; the
          perpetuity of the apostleship; the grace of orders;
          transubstantiation; the propitiatory sacrifice of the Mass; the power
          of the priests to forgive sins; the seven sacraments; purgatory; the
          immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, etc., etc., can all be
          historically traced in their origin, gradual development, and final
          adoption. As it would be unjust to determine the theology of Calvin
          and Beza from the Socinianism of modern Geneva; or that of Luther from
          the theology of the Germans of our day; so it is utterly unreasonable
          to infer that because the Latin Church believes all that the Council
          of Trent pronounced to be true, that such was its faith in the first
          centuries of its history. It is not to be denied that for the first
          hundred years after the Reformation the Church of England was
          Calvinistic; then under Archbishop Laud and the Stuarts it became
          almost thoroughly Romanized; then it became to a large extent
          Rationalistic, so that Bishop Burnet said of the men of his day, that
          Christianity seemed to be regarded as a fable "among all persons of
          discernment." To this succeeded a general revival of evangelical
          doctrine and piety; and that has been followed by a like revival of
          Romanism and Ritualism. Mr. Newman says of the present time: "In the
          Church of England, we shall hardly find ten or twenty neighboring
          clergymen who agree together; and that, not in nonessentials of
          religion, but as to what are its elementary and necessary doctrines;
          or as to the fact whether there are any necessary doctrines at all,
          any distinct and definite faith required for salvation." Such is the
          testimony of history. In no external, visible Church, has there been a
          consent to any form of faith, semper et ab omnibus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Latin Church is no exception to this remark. It is an undeniable
          fact of history that Arianism prevailed for years both in the East and
          West; that it received the sanction of the vast majority of the
          bishops, of provincial and ecumenical councils, and of the Bishop of
          Rome. It is no less certain that in the Latin Church, Augustinianism,
          including all the characteristic doctrines of what is now called
          Calvinism, was declared to be the true faith by council after council,
          provincial and general, and by bishops and popes. Soon, however,
          Augustinianism lost its ascendency. For seven or eight centuries no
          one form of doctrine concerning sin, grace, and predestination
          prevailed in the Latin Church. Augustinianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and
          Mysticism (equally irreconcilable with both), were in constant
          conflict; and that, too, on questions on which the Church had already
          pronounced its judgment. It was not until the beginning of the
          sixteenth century that the Council of Trent, after long conflict
          within itself, gave its sanction to a modified form of
          Semi-Pelagianism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The claim, therefore, for common consent, as understood by Romanists,
          is contrary to history. It is inconsistent with undeniable facts. This
          is virtually admitted by Romanists themselves. For with them it is
          common to say, We believe because the fifth century believed. But this
          is a virtual admission that their peculiar faith is not historically
          traceable beyond the fifth century. This admission of a want of all
          historical evidence of "common consent" is also involved, as before
          remarked, in their constant appeal to the authority of the Church.
          What the Church says is a matter of faith, we, the traditionists
          affirm, are bound to believe, has always been a matter of faith. The
          passage from "Petrus á Soto," quoted above, puts the case very
          concisely: "Quæcunque credit, tenet et servat Romana ecclesia, et in
          Scripturis non habentur illa ab Apostolis esse tradita." The argument
          amounts to this. The Church believes on the ground of common consent.
          The proof that a thing is a matter of common consent, and always has
          been, is that the Church now believes it.
        </p>
        <p>Inadequacy of the Evidences of Consent</p>
        <p>
          The second objection to the argument of Romanists from common consent
          in support of their traditions, is, that the evidence which they
          adduce of such consent is altogether inadequate. They appeal to the
          ancient creeds. But there was no creed generally adopted before the
          fourth century. No creed adopted before the eighth century contains
          any of the doctrines peculiar to the Church of Rome. Protestants all
          receive the doctrinal statements contained in what is called the
          Apostles' creed, and in those of Chalcedon, and of Constantinople,
          adopted A.D. 681.
        </p>
        <p>
          They appeal also to the decisions of councils. To this the same reply
          is made. There were no general councils before the fourth century. The
          first six ecumenical councils gave no doctrinal decisions from which
          Protestants dissent. They, therefore, present no evidence of consent
          in those doctrines which are now peculiar to the Church of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          They appeal again to the writings of the fathers. But to this
          Protestants object,—
        </p>
        <p>
          First. That the writings of the apostolic fathers are too few to be
          taken as trustworthy representatives of the state of opinion in the
          Church for the first three hundred years. Ten or twenty writers
          scattered over such a period cannot reasonably be assumed to speak the
          mind of the whole Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The consent of these fathers, or of the half of them, cannot
          be adduced in favour of any doctrine in controversy between
          Protestants and Romanists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. Almost unanimous consent can be quoted in support of
          doctrines which Romanists and Protestants unite in rejecting. The
          Jewish doctrine of the millennium passed over in its grossest form to
          the early Christian Church. But that doctrine the Church of Rome is
          specially zealous in denouncing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly. The consent of the fathers cannot be proved in support of
          doctrines which Protestants and Romanists agree in accepting. Not that
          these doctrines did not then enter into the faith of the Church, but
          simply that they were not presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly. Such is the diversity of opinion among the fathers
          themselves, such the vagueness of their doctrinal statements, and such
          the unsettled usus loquendi as to important words, that the authority
          of the fathers may be quoted on either side of any disputed doctrine.
          There is no view, for example, of the nature of the Lord's supper,
          which has ever been held in the Church, for which the authority of
          some early father cannot be adduced. And often the same father
          presents one view at one time, and another at a different time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixthly. The writings of the fathers have been notoriously corrupted.
          It was a matter of great complaint in the early Church that spurious
          works were circulated; and that genuine works were recklessly
          interpolated. Some of the most important works of the Greek fathers
          are extant only in a Latin translation. This is the case with the
          greater part of the works of Irenæus, translated by Rufinus, whom
          Jerome charges with the most shameless adulteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another objection to the argument from consent is, that it is a
          Procrustean bed which may be extended or shortened at pleasure. In
          every Catena Patrum prepared to prove this consent in certain
          doctrines, it will be found that two or more writers in a century are
          cited as evincing the unanimous opinion of that century, while double
          or fourfold the number, of equally important writers, belonging to the
          same period, on the other side, are passed over in silence. There is
          no rule to guide in the application of this test, and no uniformity in
          the manner of its use.
        </p>
        <p>
          While, therefore, it is admitted that there has been a stream of
          doctrine flowing down uninterruptedly from the days of the Apostles,
          it is denied, as a matter of fact, that there has been any
          uninterrupted or general consent in any doctrine not clearly revealed
          in the Sacred Scriptures; and not even in reference to such clearly
          revealed doctrines, beyond the narrow limits of essential truths. And
          it is, moreover, denied that in any external, visible, organized
          Church, can the rule, quod semper, quod ab omnibus, be applied even to
          essential doctrines. The argument, therefore, of Romanists in favor of
          their peculiar doctrines, derived from general consent, is utterly
          untenable and fallacious. This is virtually admitted by the most
          zealous advocates of tradition. "Not only," says Professor Newman, "is
          the Church Catholic bound to teach the truth, but she is divinely
          guided to teach it; her witness of the Christian faith is a matter of
          promise as well as of duty; her discernment of it is secured by a
          heavenly, as well as by a human rule. She is indefectible in it; and
          therefore has not only authority to enforce it, but is of authority in
          declaring it. The Church not only transmits the faith by human means,
          but has a supernatural gift for that purpose; that doctrine which is
          true, considered as an historical fact, is true also because she
          teaches it." The author of the Oxford Tract, No. 85, after saying, "We
          believe mainly because the Church of the fourth and fifth centuries
          unanimously believed," adds, "Why should not the Church be divine? The
          burden of proof surely is on the other side. I will accept her
          doctrines, and her rites, and her Bible—not one, and not the other,
          but all,—till I have clear proof that she is mistaken. It is I feel
          God's will that I should do so; and besides, I love these her
          possessions—I love her Bible, her doctrines, and her rites; and
          therefore, I believe." The Romanist then believes because the Church
          believes. This is the ultimate reason. The Church believes, not
          because she can historically prove that her doctrines have been
          received from the Apostles, but because she is supernaturally guided
          to know the truth. "Common consent," therefore, is practically
          abandoned, and tradition resolves itself into the present faith of the
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>Tradition not available by the People</p>
        <p>
          4. Protestants object to tradition as part of the rule of faith,
          because it is not adapted to that purpose. A rule of faith to the
          people must be something which they can apply; a standard by which
          they can judge. But this unwritten revelation is not contained in any
          one volume accessible to the people, and intelligible by them. It is
          scattered through the ecclesiastical records of eighteen centuries. It
          is absolutely impossible for the people to learn what it teaches. How
          can they tell whether the Church in all ages has taught the doctrine
          of transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the Mass, or any other popish
          doctrine. They must take all such doctrines upon trust, i.e., on the
          faith of the extant Church. But this is to deny that to them tradition
          is a rule of faith. They are required to believe, on the peril of
          their souls, doctrines, the pretended evidence of which it is
          impossible for them to ascertain or appreciate.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Romanists argue that such is the obscurity of the Scriptures, that
          not only the people, but the Church itself needs the aid of tradition
          in order to their being properly understood. But if the Bible, a
          comparatively plain book, in one portable volume, needs to be thus
          explained, What is to explain the hundreds of folios in which these
          traditions are recorded? Surely a guide to the interpretation of the
          latter must be far more needed than one for the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>Tradition destroys the Authority of the Scriptures</p>
        <p>
          6. Making tradition a part of the rule of faith subverts the authority
          of the Scriptures. This follows as a natural and unavoidable
          consequence. If there be two standards of doctrine of equal authority,
          the one the explanatory, and infallible interpreter of the other, it
          is of necessity the interpretation which determines the faith of the
          people. Instead, therefore, of our faith resting on the testimony of
          God as recorded in his Word, it rests on what poor, fallible, often
          fanciful, prejudiced, benighted men, tell us is the meaning of that
          word. Man and his authority take the place of God. As this is the
          logical consequence of making tradition a rule of faith, so it is an
          historical fact that the Scriptures have been made of no account
          wherever the authority of tradition has been admitted. Our Lord said,
          that the Scribes and Pharisees made the word of God of no effect by
          their traditions; that they taught for doctrines the commandments of
          men. This is no less historically true of the Church of Rome. A great
          mass of doctrines, rites, ordinances, and institutions, of which the
          Scriptures know nothing, has been imposed on the reason, conscience,
          and life of the people. The Roman Catholic religion of our day, with
          its hierarchy, ritual, image and saint worship; with its absolutions,
          indulgences, and its despotic power over the conscience and the life
          of the individual, is as little like the religion of the New
          Testament, as the present religion of the Hindus with its myriad of
          deities, its cruelties, and abominations, is like the simple religion
          of their ancient Vedas. In both cases similar causes have produced
          similar effects. In both there has been a provision for giving divine
          authority to the rapidly accumulating errors and corruptions of
          succeeding ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Tradition teaches error, and therefore cannot be divinely
          controlled so as to be a rule of faith. The issue is between Scripture
          and tradition. Both cannot be true. The one contradicts the other. One
          or the other must be given up. Of this at least no true Protestant has
          any doubt. All the doctrines peculiar to Romanism, and for which
          Romanists plead the authority of Scripture, Protestants believe to be
          anti-scriptural; and therefore they need no other evidence to prove
          that tradition is not to be trusted either in matters of faith or
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>The Scriptures not received on the Authority of Tradition</p>
        <p>
          8. Romanists argue that Protestants concede the authority of
          tradition, because it is on that authority they receive the New
          Testament as the word of God. This is not correct. We do not believe
          the New Testament to be divine on the ground of the testimony of the
          Church. We receive the books included in the canonical Scriptures on
          the twofold ground of internal and external evidence. It can be
          historically proved that those books were written by the men whose
          names they bear; and it can also be proved that those men were the
          duly authenticated organs of the Holy Ghost. The historical evidence
          which determines the authorship of the New Testament is not
          exclusively that of the Christian fathers. The testimony of heathen
          writers is, in some respects, of greater weight than that of the
          fathers themselves. We may believe on the testimony of English
          history, ecclesiastical and secular, that the Thirty-Nine Articles
          were framed by the English Reformers, without being traditionists. In
          like manner we may believe that the books of the New Testament were
          written by the men whose names they bear without admitting tradition
          to be a part of the rule of faith.

          Besides, external evidence of any kind is a very subordinate part of
          the ground of a Protestant's faith in the Scripture. That ground is
          principally the nature of the doctrines therein revealed, and the
          witness of the Spirit, with and by the truth, to the heart and
          conscience. We believe the Scriptures for much the same reason that we
          believe the Decalogue.

          The Church is bound to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has
          made it free, and not to be again entangled with the yoke of bondage,
          —a bondage not only to human doctrines and institutions, but to
          soul-destroying errors and superstitions.
