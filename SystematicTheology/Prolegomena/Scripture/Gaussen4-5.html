        <h2>V. Errors in the Narratives — Contradictions in the Facts</h2>
        <p>
          All these just repugnances felt to the reasonings or the doctrines of
          the sacred writers, will be abandoned, we are told, if it must be so,
          by admitting, that, on these matters, what is a difficulty for some
          may be none at all for others. But, if an appeal be now made to
          facts—if it be shown that there are manifest contradictions in the
          narratives of the Bible, in its dates, in its allusions to
          contemporary history, in its scriptural quotations—we might farther,
          perhaps, reproach those who object on the ground of having seen these,
          with not being consistent with themselves, and with going farther in
          this respect than their own thesis will admit. This, however, matters
          not; these, if facts at all, are facts which cannot be thrown out on
          any such preliminary plea, and which no reasoning can destroy.
          Reasoning no more destroys facts than it creates them. If, then, it is
          added, these contradictions exist, they may, indeed, convict their
          thesis of not going far enough; but they are three times more relevant
          against ours, in charging it with error.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, we acknowledge that, were it true that there were, as
          they tell us, erroneous facts and contradictory narratives in the Holy
          Scriptures, one must renounce any attempt to maintain their plenary
          inspiration. But we are not reduced to this: these alleged errors do
          not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          We admit, no doubt, that, among the numerous attacks made on the
          smallest details of the narratives of our sacred books, there are some
          which, at first sight, may give some embarrassment; but no sooner do
          we look at them more closely than these difficulties are cleared up
          and vanish. We proceed to give some examples of this, and will be
          careful to select them from among those which the adversaries of a
          plenary inspiration have seemed to regard as the most insurmountable.
        </p>
        <p>These we shall preface with some observations.</p>
        <p>
          1. The Scriptures have in all ages had their adversaries and their
          defenders—their Celsuses as well as their Origens—their Porphyries as
          well as their Eusebiuses—their Castellios and their Calvins, their
          Strausses and their Hengstenbergs. It is now sixteen hundred years
          since Malchus Porphyry, that learned and spiteful Syrian, who lived in
          Sicily under the reign of Diocletian, and whom Jerome calls rabidum
          adversus Christum canem, wrote fifteen books against Christianity. In
          these fifteen books—the fourth of which was directed against the
          Pentateuch, the twelfth and the thirteenth against Daniel —there was
          one (the first) entirely devoted to the bringing together of all the
          contradictions which, he maintained, he had found in the Scriptures.2
          From Celsus and Porphyry down to the English unbelievers of the 18th
          century, and from these down to Strauss, who has had hardly more to do
          than copy them, unceasing endeavours have been made to discover more,
          by comparing Scripture with Scripture, line with line, word with word,
          detail with detail. It was easy, therefore, to multiply them, and even
          to find some that were specious, in a book eminently anecdotic—where
          narratives of the same events are often repeated under different
          forms, by different historians, in different circumstances, with
          manifold objects, and with more or less extensive developments. After
          this, the reader must see that this fifth objection, which is composed
          altogether of detached observations, and resolves itself into an
          infinity of minute details, can only be refuted in detail, and by
          detached answers. The matter, accordingly, is inexhaustible. Every
          passage has its objection, and every objection its reply. Our sole
          general response, then, can only be this—Examine, and the obscurity
          will vanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is acknowledged, besides, by all parties, that the alleged
          contradictions, adduced by the adversaries of inspiration have not in
          themselves any religious importance, and bear only on dates, numbers,
          and other very minute circumstances. But though incapable of directly
          affecting Christian doctrine, they would tend, nevertheless, not less
          directly to subvert the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures. It is
          necessary, therefore, that they should be met. This is what the
          friends of religion have done in all ages; and this is what Mr
          Hengstenberg, at Berlin, has lately accomplished with such honourable
          success; it is this, too, which has been done, in these last times, by
          Messrs Barrett, Hales, Gerard, Dick, Horne, and others, in England.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is very easy to say, in a general manner, and in a peremptory
          tone, that there are contradictions in the Bible; and it has often
          happened that unreflecting though pious Christians have not taken the
          pains to look narrowly into the matter, and have suffered themselves
          to be led away into loose maxims on inspiration, before having
          sufficiently studied, on one hand, the general testimonies of the
          Scriptures on that doctrine, and, on the other, the nature of the
          objections that have been opposed to them. Then it is that they have
          been seen to seek in their own minds, rather than in the Bible, for a
          mitigated system of inspiration, such as can be reconciled with the
          alleged existence of some errors in the Word of God. Here, in the
          sixteenth century, lay the doctrine of Socinus, of Castellio,2 and
          some others; but it was then loudly rejected by all pious men. "Hoc
          non est causam tueri adversus atheos," said Francis Turretine, "sed
          illam turpiter prodere." "Non est eo concedendum, ad ea concilianda,
          ut dicamus codicem sacrum mendosum," said the learned and pious Peter
          Martyr, "the wonder of Italy," as Calvin called him. In our days, the
          estimable Dr Pye Smith,5 in England, and the worthy bishop of
          Calcutta, have allowed themselves to run into statements of opinion
          which we deplore, and which they would probably correct had they to
          make them again. And at Berlin, the learned rector of the university,
          M. Twesten, whom, for his labours and reputation in other respects, we
          honour, has not been afraid to say, in his work on dogmatic theology,7
          that all is not equally inspired in the holy Bible; and that if we
          refuse to admit that there are errors in the details of the
          evangelical narratives, we throw ourselves into inextricable
          difficulties in our endeavours to explain them. And what examples does
          he give, in passing, in justification of such maxims? Why, he quotes
          two of the passages which we are about to expound, (the first, that of
          the blind man of Jericho, the seventh, that of the census taken under
          Cyrenius). The reader may judge of the ease with which some can
          abandon the testimony which the Scriptures themselves render to their
          entire inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          We proceed, then, to give some examples both of the contradictions
          which objectors have fancied they could oppose to us, and of the
          causes of the precipitation with which some allow themselves to call
          certain passages contradictory; which, however, only require a little
          reflection in order to their being reconciled.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have said, and we repeat, that as it is out of our power to adduce
          more than a small number here, we have been at pains to select such as
          our adversaries have apparently regarded as the most embarrassing.
        </p>
        <p>
          [In the interval between the first and second edition of this book,
          several pious persons have blamed us for having resolved difficulties
          which were not such to them, while we had neglected others which
          seemed to them of greater weight. Other readers will, no doubt, pass a
          directly contrary judgment on these relative values. Such
          appreciations are altogether subjective. None is judge of the
          importance that may be attached elsewhere to his objections on such
          matters; so that they present a boundless field. Still, however, we
          think it right to bring under consideration, in this volume, the new
          difficulties that have been pointed out to us.]
        </p>
        <p>
          FIRST CAUSE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—The complement of the
          circumstances of two facts which happened in the East, eighteen
          hundred years ago, remains unknown, because the sacred historians
          relate them to us with signal brevity. Some persons, nevertheless,
          should the narrative not explain to us in what manner some of their
          traits may be reconciled, are in haste to declare them contradictory.
          Nothing is more irrational. Suppose (to give an instance not from the
          Scriptures) that a Hindu pundit happened to read three succinct
          histories, all three veridical, of the illustrious Napoleon. The first
          will tell him that the capture of Paris, preceded by much bloodshed at
          the gates of that capital, compelled him to abdicate; and that an
          English frigate was commissioned to transport him to an island in the
          Mediterranean. A second will relate that this great captain,
          vanquished by the English, who made themselves masters of Paris
          without opposition, was transported by them to St Helena, whither
          General Bertrand desired to follow him, and where he breathed his last
          in the arms of that faithful servant. A third will relate that the
          fallen emperor was accompanied in his exile by Generals Gourgaud,
          Bertrand, and Montholon. All these narratives would be true; and yet,
          how many palpable contradictions in these few words! the learned man
          of Benares might say. St Helena in the Mediterranean! Who knows not
          that it rises like a rock in the great ocean? So much for a first
          contradiction: one of these books must be false; we must reject it.
          But again: Paris taken without a blow being struck! and Paris taken
          after a bloody battle at the gates! There is a second. Once more: here
          we find one general, there three generals! showing a third
          contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, compare these supposed precipitate judgments with many of the
          objections that have been started against the narratives of our
          Gospels!
        </p>
        <p>
          First example.—Mark (16:5) relates to us, that the women "saw A YOUNG
          MAN (only one) sitting on the right side … who said to them, Be not
          affrighted. Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is
          risen."
        </p>
        <p>
          And Luke relates (24:4), that "TWO MEN stood by them … who said to
          them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is
          risen."
        </p>
        <p>
          These passages are objected to as irreconcilable with each other; but
          on what good grounds? No doubt there is a difference; but there is
          neither contradiction nor disagreement between the two narratives. If
          they are both true, wherefore would you insist on their being
          identical? It is enough that they be true, particularly in histories
          so admirably succinct. Does it not often happen with us, that, without
          ceasing to be exactly accordant with truth, we tell, twice in
          succession to different persons, the same adventure in two very
          different manners? Now, why should the apostles not do as much? Luke
          relates, that two personages presented themselves to the women; while
          Mark speaks only of that one of the two who at first had alone rolled
          away the stone, who sat on the right side of the sepulchre, and who
          addressed himself to them. It was thus that one of our (supposed)
          historians of the Life of Bonaparte spoke of three generals; while the
          other, without ceasing to be true, spoke only of Bertrand. It is thus
          that Moses, after having spoken of three men as appearing to Abraham
          at Mamre (Gen. 18), forthwith confines himself to speaking of one
          (ver. 2, 10, 17), as if he had been alone. It is thus that, twice in
          succession, and in a different manner, I may relate the same
          circumstance, without ceasing to be true: "I met three men, who told
          me the right way. I met a man, who put me on the proper road." Thus,
          though there be in the passages adduced a marked difference, still
          there is not even the semblance of a contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second example.—Matthew (20:30) says that as Jesus "departed from
          Jericho, a great multitude followed him. And, behold, two blind men,
          sitting by the way-side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried
          out, saying, Have mercy on us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          And Mark (10:46) tells us that "as Jesus went out of Jericho with his
          disciples, and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of
          Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging. And when he heard that it was
          Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of
          David, have mercy on me."
        </p>
        <p>Luke likewise (18:35) speaks of one blind man only.</p>
        <p>
          What is there here, we again ask, contradictory or incorrect? Of those
          two blind men whom Jesus, amid so many other works, healed at Jericho,
          there was one more remarkable than the other, better known perhaps in
          the country, and who spoke for both. Mark speaks of him only; he even
          goes on to tell us his name: he does not assure us that he was alone.
          Matthew, accordingly, might speak of two. The narratives of the three
          evangelists are equally true, without being like each other
          throughout. What, then, is there extraordinary in this?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, in this same narrative we are told there is a still greater
          difficulty; let us hear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This forms a third example.—Matthew and Mark relate that the
          occurrence took place as Jesus departed from Jericho.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas Luke tells us that it happened as Jesus drew near to Jericho.
          Here, once more, people have been found to exclaim, What a palpable
          contradiction!
        </p>
        <p>
          We must reply, How would you prove this? what know you about it? The
          details of this fact being unknown to you, how could you possibly
          demonstrate that they are irreconcilable? While it is very easy, on
          the contrary, by the simplest supposition, to make them agree?
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke, as he does so often in every part of his Gospel, has united in
          his narrative two successive circumstances of the same event. Mark
          well that he is the only one of the three historians who makes mention
          of the first question put by Bartimeus: "And hearing the multitude
          pass by, he asked what it meant." This question the blind man put
          before the entrance of Jesus into Jericho. Being then made aware who
          this great prophet was, whom hitherto he had not known, he followed
          him, and during our Lord's repast in the house of Zaccheus, took his
          place in the crowd that waited for his coming out. It was then that
          there was announced to him that "Jesus of Nazareth passed by" (these
          words are in St Luke). He followed him long thus; he was joined by the
          other blind man; and their cure was performed only when Jesus, on his
          way to Jerusalem, left Jericho, where he had stopped only for the
          purpose of being the guest of the happy Zaccheus. This very simple
          explanation instantly removes the alleged discrepancy of the three
          texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth example.—Matthew (in his 27th chapter verse 5) says that Judas
          "hanged himself;" St Peter, in the Acts (1:18), says that "falling
          headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed
          out."
        </p>
        <p>Here, again, we have been told, there is a contradiction.</p>
        <p>
          We remember that once, at a public conference at Geneva, where we
          defended this same thesis, our much-valued friend, professor Monod, at
          that time pastor at Lyons, adduced the analogous traits of a
          lamentable death of which he had almost been witness. An unhappy
          inhabitant of that city, in order to make the surer of committing
          suicide, and to give himself a double death, having seated himself
          outside of a fourth-storey window, fired a pistol into his mouth. The
          same relater of that sad event, said he might have given three
          different accounts of it, and all three correct. In the first he might
          have reported the whole that had happened; in the second, he might
          have said the man shot himself; and, in the third, he threw himself
          from a window and was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, also, was the self-inflicted punishment by which the unhappy
          Judas departed into his own place. He hanged himself, and fell
          headlong; he burst asunder, in the midst, and all his bowels gushed
          out. One single particular more on the frightful circumstances of one
          same death, would have showed us the connection. It has not been given
          to us; but who will venture, on that account, to maintain that here
          there is a contradiction?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth example.—Here ought to be placed the greater number of those
          cases where different numerical calculations may seem to disagree,
          such as that of the talents of gold brought from Ophir to King Solomon
          (1 Kings 9:28; 2 Chron. 8:18); that of the census taken of the
          Israelites in the days of David (2 Sam. 24:9; 1 Chron. 21:5); that of
          the children of the patriarch Jacob, transported into Egypt (Gen.
          46:27; Deut. 10:22; Acts 7:14), &c.
        </p>
        <p>
          One single additional circumstance in these rapid narratives would
          have instantly furnished the reconciliation required. King Solomon
          might, in the one case, reckon his gross revenues; and, in the other,
          deduct thirty talents for the expenses of the fleet. David's census
          might present two results, according as the ordinary and already
          numbered militia of the kingdom was included or left out (288,000 men
          with their officers of all ranks.)—(2 Chron. 27:1; 2 Sam. 23:8.)
          Finally, you might have sixty-six, seventy, or seventy-five persons as
          the patriarch's family, according as you reckon in it, or do not
          reckon, on the one hand, Jacob with Joseph and his two sons; on the
          other, Er, Onan, and Dinah; or again, the wives of the eleven
          patriarchs. We enter not into the combination of these details; we
          need only to point them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth example.—St Matthew, in his 27th chapter (verses 9, 10), quotes
          as those of Jeremiah words not to be found in the book of that
          prophet. "Then," says he, "was fulfilled that which was spoken by
          Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
          the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel
          did value."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, it has been said, what an evident error.—these words are met
          with only in the book of Zechariah (11:13).
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not answer, with Augustine, that as several Greek manuscripts
          have only these words, "Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
          the prophet," "one might say that the reference is to one of those who
          did not bear the name of Jeremiah." It is true, that even at this day,
          among the Greek manuscripts of our libraries, there are two which have
          not the name of that prophet; and that, among the most ancient
          versions, the Syrian and the Persian have it not. This solution,
          however, does not appear to us conformable to the ordinary rules of
          sacred criticism; and Augustine himself candidly admits that it does
          not satisfy him, seeing that, even in his time, the greater number of
          Latin copies, and of Greek copies, bore in this sentence the name of
          Jeremiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some learned men, consequently, presume that this name may have easily
          slipt into the text by some mistake; and that the copyists, having
          noticed on the margin the letters Ζου (signifying in abridgment the
          name of Zechariah), and having mistaken them for Ἰου, had slipped it
          into the text, thinking what they saw was the name Jeremiah.
          Meanwhile, even this explanation does not satisfy us any better, for
          it rests on a mere hypothesis gratuitously opposed to the testimony of
          the manuscripts, and opens a door for the admission of rash
          alterations. Our safety must ever lie in having the manuscripts
          respected.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer, therefore, Whitby's explanation, which is as follows:—"We
          know," says he, "from St Jerome, that there was still extant in his
          time, an apocryphal book of the prophet Jeremiah, in which was found
          every letter of the words quoted by St Matthew." We know also that the
          Second Book of Maccabees (2:1–9) relates many of the actions and words
          of Jeremiah, which are taken from another book than that of his
          canonical prophecies. Why, then, might not the words quoted by the
          evangelist have been pronounced really by Jeremiah, and have remained
          in the memory of the Church to the days of Zechariah, who might then
          have again given them a place theopneustically in holy Scripture, (as
          is the case with the unwritten words of Enoch, quoted in the Epistle
          of Jude, or the unwritten words of Jesus Christ, quoted by St Paul in
          the Book of the Acts?)3 What confirms this supposition is, that part
          only of the words quoted by St Matthew are found in Zechariah.
          Besides, it is known that this prophet was fond of recalling the words
          of Jeremiah. The Jews used to say that the spirit of Jeremiah was in
          Zechariah, and that the two prophets made only one. Mede thought it
          very probable that the 9th, 10th, and 11th chapters of Zechariah were
          written in the first instance by Jeremiah. Now, it is in the last of
          these chapters that we find the words quoted by St Matthew. That
          evangelist, therefore, could quote them as those of Jeremiah, in like
          manner as the apostle Jude has quoted as those of Enoch the words of
          his 14th and 15th verses.

          Seventh example.—Many difficulties have been started of late,
          especially in Germany, on the fourfold narrative given us of our
          Lord's resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of briefness we shall treat of the whole four accounts at
          once, taking care to distinguish them, in both objection and reply, by
          corresponding letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. According to St Luke (it has been said), the women of Galilee, on
          their return from the sepulchre, had prepared their spices before the
          Sabbath (Luke 23:56); while according to St Mark (16:1, 2), they
          bought them only on the Saturday evening, after the expiration of that
          sacred repose.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. The reading of St Matthew gives us to understand that these women
          were Mary of Magdala and the other Mary; while there must have been,
          besides, Salome, according to Mark (16:1); and even, according to Luke
          (24:10), there must further have been Joanna, and others, with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. According to Mark (16:2) they went to the sepulchre "at the rising
          of the sun:" according to John (20:1) "it was yet dark."
        </p>
        <p>
          D. If (according to St Matthew alone) the Jews had set men to guard
          the sepulchre, one can hardly comprehend how these women should risk
          visiting it, and think of opening it.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. According to Matthew (28:5) and Mark (16:5), the women saw only one
          angel at the sepulchre; they saw two according to St Luke (24:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          F. According to Matthew (28:8) and Luke (24:9, 10), the women, on
          departing from the sepulchre, "with fear and great joy," ran to tell
          the disciples what they had seen; whereas, according to Mark (16:8),
          they fled; "they trembled and were amazed; neither said they any thing
          to any man, for they were afraid."
        </p>
        <p>
          G. If, according to the first and the third Gospels, the women
          informed the disciples of what had passed (Matt. 28:8; Luke 24:9),
          according to the fourth, Simon Peter and John alone were informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          H. According to the three first Gospels, Mary of Magdala, on reaching
          the sepulchre, saw two angels, who informed her of the resurrection of
          Jesus; while according to St John (20:2), she had contented herself
          with saying to the disciples, "They have taken away the Lord out of
          the sepulchre!" and said nothing either about his resurrection or even
          about the angels. "We know not where they have laid him!" she adds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. According to Luke (24:12), it would appear that Peter, on being
          told, ran alone to the sepulchre; according to John, there was with
          Peter "that other disciple whom the Lord loved" (20:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          K. If you attend to the three first evangelists only, several women
          seem to have witnessed the appearance of the angels and the
          resurrection of Jesus; while from reading St John, you would believe
          that Mary of Magdala alone was honoured with these revelations.
        </p>
        <p>
          L. According to Luke (24:23, 24), and even according to John (20:2),
          Mary and the women, on returning from the sepulchre, merely told the
          disciples of the removal of the body of Jesus, and of their having
          seen the angels; they had not seen the Lord himself; while according
          to Matthew (28:9), Jesus had appeared to them "while they were yet in
          the way."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, we are told there are eleven contradictions, which do not,
          it is true, affect the essence of the sacred narrative, and which
          ought not by any means to affect our faith, but which rise
          irresistibly to testify against the alleged fact of an entire divine
          inspiration. [This objection, we will avow it, appeared to us too
          ill-founded, and to have been too often solved already, to find a
          place in the first edition of this work. Nevertheless it has been
          reproduced against us, and we have thought proper to make a reply.]
        </p>
        <p>
          The day of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, for the disciples, began
          with the first dawnings of morning (John 20:1), and was lengthened out
          to midnight (Luke 24:29, 33, 36). The sepulchre where their Lord had
          been laid was not far from where they dwelt, seeing that at this day
          it is placed within the circuit of modern Jerusalem. Thus the
          disciples and the women may have repaired thither often, and in
          various ways, during the course of that incomparable Sunday. But as
          each of the four evangelists imposed on himself a marvellous brevity
          in relating that event, it is quite natural that at the first aspect
          their narratives should present, on the innumerable incidents of the
          day, an apparent confusion. Each was called upon to relate the truth,
          and nothing but the truth; but none of them was bound to tell the
          whole; and owing to this conciseness, you may not at once perceive
          their perfect agreement. They relate, each for himself, according to
          one special point of view, and without embarrassing himself about a
          reconciliation which they knew lay in the reality of the facts. What
          more would you have? One speaks specially of Mary Magdalene, for to
          her Jesus desired to make his first appearance; the other of Peter,
          because Jesus made himself appear to him notwithstanding his crime,
          and because he was called to occupy a leading place in the Church of
          God; two others, of the astonishing meeting on the road to Emmaus,
          because that manifestation was the most significant and the most
          affecting; three others, in fine, of his appearing to the eleven,
          because these were to be the foundations and the pillars of the
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, you can perceive in their writings several traits which
          sufficiently indicate that, in giving an account of certain scenes,
          they knowingly abstain from mentioning others, the remembrance of
          which was no less dear to them, but which it was necessary to omit
          introducing, in order that their Gospels might be divinely short. Let
          us give some examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. You will hear St Paul reminding the Corinthians (1 Cor. 15:5) that
          Jesus "was seen first by Cephas, and then by the twelve;"—yet, not one
          of the four evangelists has told us of this appearance of Jesus to
          Simon Peter. Certainly it is well that it so happens that we read
          afterwards in St Luke (24:34) these words, said in passing, "The Lord
          hath appeared unto Simon." Without this expression (which occurs only
          casually in a conversation among the eleven and Cleopas), the
          adversaries of inspiration would not have failed to say that Paul was
          mistaken as to this fact, and that he had been a careless reader of
          his Gospels, seeing that not a word is said of this appearance in
          their fourfold account of the resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is thus, too, that St Luke, who (at the 12th verse) speaks only
          of Peter, takes care, however, to make the disciples of Emmaus say
          afterwards, "Certain of them that were with us went to the sepulchre."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is thus, also, that St Mark, who does not mention either the
          appearing of Jesus to the women or to Simon Peter, takes care,
          however, to insert in his account (16:9) a very few words which give
          us to understand that there were other manifestations, of which he was
          not to speak. "Jesus," says he, "appeared first (first!) to Mary of
          Magdala."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Finally, it is thus that St John, whose sole purpose it was to
          complete the preceding Gospels, and who speaks only of Mary Magdalene,
          informs us, by a simple pronoun, that she, notwithstanding, was not
          alone: "They have taken away the Lord, and WE KNOW NOT WHERE THEY HAVE
          LAID HIM."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then, in order to establish contradiction among the different
          parts of the quadruple statement, it were necessary that they should
          be proved irreconcilable with all the suppositions one must make on
          the unknown connecting links of the events of the day. But who can do
          this? On the contrary, it is easy to figure for ourselves the sequence
          of events in such a manner as that the separate details of the
          narrative should come to agree with each other. This is what several
          persons have attempted with success, and in different ways; so far is
          the problem from being incapable of being solved. All that was
          necessary for this, was to make different but equally admissible
          suppositions on the number and the sequence of the visits made to the
          tomb by Mary, the disciples, and the women. Olshausen, Hess, and
          Griesbach, reconcile the difficulties by assuming that at daybreak
          Mary of Magdala, while on the way to the sepulchre, parted from her
          companions, and arrived first. John Le Clerc figured to himself rather
          that Mary, coming to the sepulchre a second time, with the two
          apostles, remained longer than them near the tomb, and that the other
          disciples went home. Hengstenberg has made other suppositions, more
          simple perhaps, and not less acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such hypotheses, shall we be told, do not necessarily do away with the
          contradiction—they only show that possibly there may be none. What
          would we have more? The adversaries of inspiration only in their turn
          make contrary hypotheses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, instead of replying separately to each of the eleven
          objections above adduced, we will content ourselves with exhibiting
          the course of events, such as we may conceive it to have been,
          according to the four accounts taken as a whole. What we give is very
          nearly the arrangement proposed by John Le Clerc in his "Evangelical
          Harmony." Others will prefer, perhaps, that lately proposed by
          Olshausen, in his "Biblical Commentary,"2 or that which Hengstenberg
          more recently still has exhibited in his "Evangelical Gazette." But it
          is of no consequence. Our account, it will be seen, dissipates, one
          after another, the eleven alleged contradictions. (The same letters
          that distinguish them in the objection, will be re-inserted here
          before the particulars that correspond with them, and serve to solve
          them.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A. Jesus had yielded up the ghost on the cross on Friday evening, at
          the ninth hour of the day. The Sabbath, which began three hours later,
          was doubly solemn (being both the weekly and the paschal Sabbath). As
          it grew late (Matt. 27:46, 57; Mark 15:34, 42), Joseph of Arimathea
          went to ask from Pilate the body of the crucified one. He obtained it,
          and, accompanied by Nicodemus, who saw to there being taken to the
          sepulchre about a hundred-weight of myrrh and aloes (John 19:39); he
          bought a pall, had the body of Jesus taken down, wound it in linen
          clothes with the spices (John 19:40), and wrapped it in a
          winding-sheet, (Luke 23:53; Mark 15:46; Matt. 27:59); then at last,
          for want of time, he hastened to deposit it in a sepulchre not far
          from Golgotha. One will see, therefore, that the godly women (who had
          beheld from a distance these funereal scenes, down to the moment when
          a huge stone was placed on the entrance to the tomb), had very little
          time for going home and preparing the perfumes which they had at their
          disposal. The Sabbath was about to commence; and whatever might be, in
          their eyes, the sacred nature of their occupations, they ceased from
          them from the time of sunset; nothing could withdraw them from the
          repose and silence of that day (ἡσύχασαν, Luke 23:56). But as soon as
          it was over (that is to say, on Saturday at six o'clock at night),
          they ran to purchase aromatics to complete the pious preparations
          which they had been able only to commence. This funereal operation
          required a very considerable quantity of myrrh, aloes, and other
          substances; and, no doubt, in the evening, they could not have seen,
          from such a distance, that Nicodemas had already deposited in the
          sepulchre as much as a hundred-weight of perfumes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far, then, all is perfectly consistent; and it is by these
          touching details that Luke and Mark desired, each on his own side, to
          give prominence to the humble respect of these godly women for the law
          of the Sabbath; the one (Luke 23:56), by showing how submissively they
          at once intermitted the most sacred cares; and the other (Mark 16:1),
          with what scrupulous attention they resumed them only at the hour when
          they were again at liberty to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Meanwhile they left their homes to go to the sepulchre. John names
          Magdalene only, because Jesus Christ had chosen her to be the first
          witness of the greatest of his miracles, and because she was the
          essential actor in his narrative. He takes care, however, to make her
          say, "We know not where they have laid him" (20:2)! In general, the
          evangelists show little anxiety about accumulating testimonies. And if
          the appearance with which the holy women were favoured had not been
          the first, it is probable that the sacred historians would not even
          have mentioned it. This is what we might conclude, by analogy, from
          Paul's mode of procedure (1 Cor. 15:5, 8), who speaks only of the
          apostles, and says not a word about the women. His complete silence
          sufficiently explains to us the partial silence of the evangelists.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. It was still almost night (John 16:1), when the women left their
          residence, carrying the spices, to go to the sepulchre (ἐις τὸ
          μνημεῖον, Mark 16:3); but the sun had risen on their reaching it (ἐπὶ
          τὸ μνημεῖον, Mark 16:2). We know that in those southern latitudes, the
          evening and morning twilights are of very short duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          D. They asked themselves on the way how they should roll away the huge
          stone that covered the mouth of the sepulchral cave.—(Mark 16:3.)
          During the repose and the silence of the Sabbath (Luke 23:56), how
          could they have known that guards had been appointed?— (Matt. 27:66.)
        </p>
        <p>
          E. Meanwhile there had been an earthquake.—(Matt. 28:2.) An angel,
          whose countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow,
          had come from heaven and rolled away the stone. The guards were
          overcome with fear, and, after having become as dead men, fled. But
          what was not the astonishment of the women, when, on reaching the
          tomb, they found it open and empty! Only one young man, clothed in
          white, sat in the sepulchre, on the right side.—(Mark 16:5.) Then two
          men presented themselves in shining raiment (Luke 24:4); these were
          angels (Mark and Matthew mentioning only the one that had rolled away
          the stone, and spoken to them).
        </p>
        <p>
          F. Meanwhile, these holy women, hastening out of the sepulchre, fled,
          being overcome with feelings at once of terror and joy.—(Matt. 28:8;
          Mark 16:8.) In returning to the city they were careful not to speak to
          any one of what had happened. Did they dread the wrath of the
          Sanhedrim? At least, were they not unwilling to pour their emotions
          into the breasts of any but their brethren? Notwithstanding the early
          hour, they must have met a great many Israelites in the leading
          streets and squares of that immense city, where, during festivals,
          there were reckoned to be no fewer than three millions of inhabitants.
          The governor Florus, in the year 65, reckoned two hundred and fifty
          thousand paschal lambs, says Josephus; and this supposes at least two
          and a half millions of worshippers, without including the sick,
          unclean persons, and young children.
        </p>
        <p>
          G. On arriving among the eleven and the other disciples, the women
          told all that they had seen.—(Matt. 28:8; Luke 24:9.) But this recital
          seemed to them nothing but an idle tale.—(Luke 24:10.) Then Mary of
          Magdala, addressing herself more particularly to Peter and John,
          assured them that, at least, if their Master were not risen again, he
          must have been taken away.—(John 20:2.)
        </p>
        <p>
          H. According to the account itself of John, Mary must necessarily have
          said to those two disciples more than what that evangelist relates to
          us directly; for he adds, that they ran to the sepulchre; and that no
          sooner had John seen the arrangement of the linen clothes than he
          believed. But, alas! this language of Mary: "They have taken away the
          Lord, and I know not where they have laid him!" was but too natural.
          The fleeting apparition of the angels had not produced so firm a
          conviction in her mind as not to have been violently shaken by the
          cold and incredulous reception her tale had met from the apostles.
          These men, according to whose directions she habitually conformed
          herself, had doubtless more than once repressed the warmth of her
          imagination. She saw them treat her heavenly vision as a mere revery.
          After that, she felt only enough of confidence in herself to attest
          the ordinary and material part of the fact. At least, says she, the
          tomb is open, and the body is no longer there.
        </p>

          I. Nevertheless, on hearing these words, and whilst Cleopas went away
          to Emmaus, Peter rose, Luke tells us (24:12), and ran to the
          sepulchre, but he did not run thither alone (24); and John tells us
          that he was accompanied by that "other disciple whom Jesus
          loved."—(John 20:2, 3.) John being the younger, arrived first; he did
          not go in; but stooping down he saw the linen clothes lying on the
          ground. Peter, stooping also, saw the linen clothes lying (Luke
          24:12), and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the
          linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. He had the
          courage to go in, and wondered at what had come to pass (Luke 24:12);
          but John did more; he entered in his turn and believed. They then
          departed unto their own home.—(John 20:10; Luke 24:12.) Still there is
          nothing inconsistent in all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          K. Meanwhile, Mary of Magdala, who had followed them, having returned
          to the sepulchre, remained alone at the spot, weeping and disconsolate
          at not even being able to find again her Master's remains. She stooped
          down to look into the interior of the sepulchre, and then it was that
          anew two angels clothed in white presented themselves to her sight.
          They were seated, the one at the head and the other at the foot of the
          place where the body of Jesus had lain.— (John 20:11, 13.) Soon after,
          Mary having resumed her position, it was Jesus himself whom she saw
          behind her. "Go," said he to her, "to my brethren, and say unto them,
          I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God!"
          Mary hastened to go and tell the disciples that she had seen the Lord,
          and that he had spoken these things to her (John 20:18); but they
          believed not.—(Mark 16:10.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then, was it, as St Mark has said (16:9), that Jesus appeared
          first to Mary of Magdala.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole of this narrative is natural and harmonious; the historians
          here agree together in a manner which it is easy to comprehend. Only
          they relate each some one of the great facts of that incomparable day,
          without considering themselves called upon to relate the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          L. The two disciples on their departure from Jerusalem for Emmaus
          (Luke 24:21, 24), were as yet unaware of the events of the day beyond
          the first report of the women and of the two disciples, the opening of
          the sepulchre, the removal of the Lord, the appearing of the angels;
          but they had not yet learned the last news—the appearing of Jesus to
          Simon—Peter and Mary's second report.—(John 20:18; Mark 16:10.) Mark,
          however, what had afterwards happened. Following the Magdalene's
          example, who had returned a second time to the sepulchre, after having
          informed the apostles of her first discoveries, the other women also
          had betaken themselves thither while Mary was returning to the
          disciples; they had found the tomb empty; and, as they were returning
          to give a farther attestation to their brethren that the body of Jesus
          could not be found there, Jesus himself had condescended to appear to
          them alive and full of sympathy. They had worshipped him, and he had
          said to them: "Be not afraid: go tell my brethren, that they go into
          Galilee, and there shall they see me."—(Matt. 28:9, 10.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is the harmony of the sacred narratives. This concatenation seems
          to us satisfactory. One might, as we have said, propose some other;
          but this is enough. We must confess that we cannot understand the
          difficulties that have been found in it, or the noise that has been
          made about it.

          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—Certain reigns, such as that
          of Nebuchadnezzar, that of Jehoiachim, and that of Tiberius, had two
          commencements; and the dates that relate to these are pronounced
          irreconcilable! The first, previous to mounting the throne, reigned
          three years with his father; the second reigned ten years with his;
          the third was assumed by Augustus as his associate in the empire, from
          the 28th of August, of the 2d year of the Christian era, but succeeded
          him on the 19th of August, of the year 14.—(Velleius Paterculus, ii.
          c. 121.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Some examples.—See, for Jotham, 2 Kings 15:33, (he reigned sixteen
          years alone; but four years also during the lifetime of his father,
          who was leprous). See for Joash, 2 Kings 13:1, 10, (he must have
          reigned two or three years with his father, as did Jehoshaphat and his
          son, 2 Kings 8:16.) See 2 Kings 24:8; and 2 Chron. 36:9. See also
          Daniel 1:1; Jer. 25:1; 2 Chron. 36:5–7. See farther, Luke 3:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—The design of the Holy Ghost
          in one of the Gospels, is not often the same as his design in another
          Gospel while relating the same fact; yet some would have them all give
          the same turn to their narratives; nay, make bold, because of their
          differences, to declare them irreconcilable, and to assume that they
          are directly opposed to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example.—The Holy Spirit, in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, given in
          St Matthew (1:16), would show the Jews, that, according to the strict
          rigour of their law, Jesus Christ is the son and the heir of all the
          kings of Judah, by a legal descent; while the same Holy Spirit, in the
          genealogy given by St Luke (3:23–38), would show the Gentiles that
          Jesus Christ is the Son of David by a natural descent. And because,
          with this double object in view, they give us, the one his genealogy
          according to the law, by Solomon, the son of David, and by Jacob, the
          father of Joseph, the husband of Mary; and the other, his genealogy
          according to nature, by Nathan, another son of David, and by Heli, the
          father of Mary, people have thought, very absurdly, that they could
          make the one refute the other!
        </p>
        <p>
          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—A text mistranslated produces
          a meaning that is contrary to reason or to history; and forthwith the
          sacred writer is accused of committing the grossest blunder! People
          don't examine whether, in the simplicity of a literal translation, the
          same passage, better rendered, would not present itself free from
          every difficulty!
        </p>
        <p>
          First example (again one of those adduced by M. Twesten).—St Luke, we
          are told (2:1), has no sooner spoken of the taxing ordained by a
          public decree issued by Augustus Cæsar, at the time of the birth of
          Jesus Christ, than he adds these words at verse 2: "This taxing was
          first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria."
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it would follow that St Luke is here caught in flagrant
          contradiction with contemporary history; for, at the birth of Jesus
          Christ, Judea was governed by Herod, and Syria either by Saturninus,
          or rather (from the seventh year of the Christian era) by Quintilius
          Varus, who replaced him, and during whose administration the death of
          Herod the Great took place The Cyrenius (Publius Sulpicius Quirinius),
          under whom a second census took place, was not sent to the East until
          eleven or twelve years, at the least, after the birth of Jesus Christ.
          The historian Josephus tells us in express terms, that this census
          took place the thirty-seventh year after the defeat of Anthony; and
          Jesus Christ was born, at the latest, the twenty-sixth year after that
          great event. Luke, then, must have made a mistake of eleven years, and
          must have confounded these two epochs and these two censuses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before replying to this strange accusation, we would have the reader
          observe its extreme improbability, even taking St Luke to have been a
          mere uninspired man. What! Luke, the only one of the evangelists that
          was a person of erudition—Luke, the physician—Luke, who subsequently
          resumes the mention of the census of Quirinius, when he recalls that
          famous revolt of Judas the Galilean, which stirred up all Judea and
          caused the destruction of a great many people, who perished along with
          him—Luke, writing for all nations, and in four and twenty pages, an
          historical work, which he knew would be immortal—Luke could make such
          a mistake as to place in the days of Herod the Great so very serious
          an event which had happened within the preceding thirty years! What
          should we say at the present day of a physician, who, even in a simple
          conversation, should put the battle of Austerlitz in the days of
          Catherine II. and of the National Convention? And if this doctor were
          to publish a short narrative, in which such an absurdity should be
          found, what reception, think you, would he find even among his most
          unlettered contemporaries?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus, then, that often, when people would make the sacred
          writers contradict themselves, they scruple not to impute to them such
          silliness as would be almost miraculous.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us return to the passage. There is nothing simpler than its
          translation: it is a parenthesis. According to the accent placed on
          the first word (ἅυτη), it becomes either a demonstrative pronoun, or a
          pronominal adjective; and, in this alternative, the phrase ought to be
          translated literally, in the former case, by "This first census," and,
          in the latter case, by "The first census itself." It is in this latter
          sense that the word has been rendered by the authors of the new
          version, published some months ago by a society of ministers in
          Switzerland, and it is that also which we think ought to be adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then, there is nought but what is quite natural and quite
          correct in St Luke's narrative. After having spoken in the first verse
          of a decree from Augustus, which began to be executed under Herod's
          reign, he intimates (in the parenthesis of verse 2) that one must not
          confound what was done then with the too famous census of which all
          Judea still retained so tragical a recollection. The first census
          itself, says he, was effected while Cyrenius was Governor of Syria.
          Such is the plain literal translation of the Greek.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second example.—St Matthew (4:5), immediately after the first
          temptation, says, that "THEN the devil led Jesus into the holy city."
          … And when this second temptation was over, he adds (v. 8), in
          beginning to relate the third, that "AGAIN the devil taketh him up
          into an exceeding high mountain," &c.
        </p>
        <p>
          St Luke, on the contrary (4:5), immediately after the first tempation,
          says, that "THEN took him up into an high mountain;" and when this
          second temptation was ended, he adds, in beginning to tell of the
          third, "He brought him also to Jerusalem." …
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, we find two of the evangelists manifestly at variance as
          to the order in which the three temptations took place. One of the two
          must of necessity have been mistaken in putting the last before the
          second. Such is the objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will see this difficulty equally vanish as soon as, instead of
          following Osterwald's version or Martin's, you seek only to give a
          more faithful rendering to the original text. We might here adduce a
          good many other passages (chiefly in the Epistles) which these two
          translators have darkened, by not sufficiently marking the import of
          the conjunctions and adverbs και, δ̀ ὲ, γὰρ, οὖν, τότε, &c.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every one knows that St Luke, in writing his Gospel, did not restrain
          himself to the order of time, and that he had proposed to himself in
          his narratives to group together events and lessons rather according
          to the order of things (καθεξῆς). Both these methods of writing
          biography have their advantages. Among heathen writers, for example,
          Nepos has followed the first, and Suetonius the second. It was
          necessary, therefore, that the translators of St Luke, marking well
          his language, should not make him appear to use adverbs of time,
          order, or events, which he had no thought of employing, and which come
          in much out of place to alter the meaning of what he has to say.
          Re-establish here the conjunctions of the Greek, and you will see
          forthwith the contradiction which the two French texts had presented
          to you disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          St Matthew, who always follows the chronological order of the facts,
          takes care to employ very exact adverbs in proportion as he advances
          in his account of the temptation; τότε, τότε, πάλιν, τότε, τότε, then,
          then, anew, then, then. But Luke, on the contrary, who had not
          proposed to himself to follow the same course, and who confines his
          intention simply to letting us know the three attacks to which the Son
          of God behoved to subject his holy humanity, studiously abstains from
          using any adverb of order or of time, and contents himself with
          coupling, ten several times, the facts of his narrative by the
          copulative AND (και), ̀ which our translations have so improperly
          rendered by the adverb ALORS, or ENSUITE (English, THEN, or
          AFTERWARDS.)
        </p>
        <p>The contradiction then does not belong to the sacred text.</p>
        <p>
          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—It has not been sufficiently
          borne in mind, that certain discourses and certain acts were repeated
          more than once in the course of our Saviour's ministry. Hence the
          utmost rashness in concluding that certain detailed accounts given by
          two evangelists contradict each other, where there has been no more
          than an incomplete resemblance, and yet where people have imagined
          that the facts they read of were identically the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples.—In the double miracle of the multiplication of the loaves,
          we have a very striking instance of the ease with which one may in
          this way be led into error. On two occasions Jesus Christ, moved with
          compassion for the people, fed a famished multitude in the wilderness.
          Between these two miracles there are numerous and striking points of
          resemblance. Had it so happened that two of the evangelists had
          related only the first, and two others only the second, there would
          have been sure to be a cry that the two were but one, and that there
          was a contradiction in the statement of their details. What! in the
          one, five thousand men fed with five loaves; in the other, four
          thousand men fed with seven loaves! In the one twelve baskets
          (κοφίνους) taken away; in the other, seven hampers (σπυρίδας)! What a
          disagreement! Well it is that if Luke and John have mentioned the
          first only, Matthew and Mark, who relate the second, have also
          reported the first. But for this what a noise would not our
          adversaries have raised in the schools about such a passage!
        </p>
        <p>
          This remark may be applied to several particulars of the New
          Testament; for example, to the Lord's prayer, which was given twice,
          at least, to the disciples during our Lord's ministry.—(Matt. 6:9;
          Luke 11:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          See also Matt. 12:39, and 16:1, 4; Luke 8:21, 11:27, and Matt. 12:49;
          Luke 9:1, 10:1, and Matt. 10:1.
        </p>
        <p>We shall adduce one further example.</p>
        <p>
          It does not appear, on close examination, that the sermon called that
          of the mount (Matt. 5, 6, 7), and that given by St Luke in the latter
          half of his sixth chapter, were delivered on the same occasion. In
          fact, first, St Luke omits many of the sentences reported by St
          Matthew, and he alone adds some others (6:24–26); secondly, Matthew
          lets us know, that the sermon which he reports preceded the healing of
          the leprous person (8:3), and Luke that his followed it (Luke 5:12);
          thirdly, Luke puts Matthew in the number of those whom Jesus called to
          the apostleship, and who came down with him from the mountain, before
          he addressed to them his discourse; whereas Matthew himself tells us,
          that the sermon of which he speaks, long preceded his vocation;
          fourthly, one of those discourses was delivered on the mountain, while
          Jesus, who had sat down, had his disciples ranged around him; the
          other, on the contrary, was delivered on the plain, and with other
          circumstances attending it. We pause at this remark, in order to
          reassure such persons as may have heard adduced against the doctrine
          of inspiration, the alleged contradiction of the sentence in which
          Matthew (5:40) makes Jesus say, "If any man will take away thy coat
          (χιτῶνα), let him have thy cloak (ἱμάτιον) also;" and of that in
          which, according to Luke, he had said, "Him that taketh away thy
          cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also." One can no more, then, we
          say, make an objection of this diversity, seeing these two sentences
          were pronounced on different days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, we must not forget, at the same time, to observe,
          inasmuch as this remark applies to several other objections of the
          same nature. Even were it true that these two passages were cited as
          the same fragment of one and the same discourse, still their differing
          would not have anywise astonished us. We believe that the Holy Ghost,
          when he quotes the Holy Ghost, is not bound to use the same terms,
          provided the same meanings be retained. A man of an exact mind, in
          repeating what he has said before, or in quoting himself, by no means
          thinks himself bound to carry imitation thus far. And we think, that
          here our Lord's whole idea is found equally in the sentences of Luke
          and Matthew.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—One may sometimes pay no
          attention to a various reading critically respectable, and which
          resolves a difficulty; and prefer imputing some contradiction to the
          sacred writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example.—According to the three first evangelists (Mark 15:25, 33, 34;
          Matt. 27:45, 46; Luke 23:44, 45), our Saviour was put upon the cross
          at the third hour of the day (that is to say, at nine o'clock in the
          morning); the sun was darkened at the sixth hour, and Jesus gave up
          the ghost at the ninth hour; whereas, if we are to believe St John
          (19:14), the execution did not begin until the sixth hour of the day
          (at noon). Palpable contradiction! say some objectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before replying to this difficulty, we shall offer a remark, much like
          that already made on the census of Cyrenius. Was it likely that the
          apostle John was ignorant of the length of time that his Master's
          execution lasted, and could he possibly have made a mistake of three
          hours out of six—he who had remained beside the cross!
        </p>
        <p>
          But, if we consult the Greek manuscripts of St John, we shall find
          four in small letters, and three in uncial letters (among others,
          Beza's famous roll, preserved at Cambridge), which have here the third
          hour instead of the sixth. Numbers, in the Greek manuscripts, are
          often expressed in numerals; that is to say, in simple Greek letters;
          and 3 and 6 are expressed by two letters that are very easily
          confounded (the γάμμα and the ἐπίσημον): several of the ancients
          thought that the variation might have arisen from this cause.
          Griesbach, who has marked this variation with a sign of preference,
          quotes Severus of Antioch and Ammonius in Theophylact; and he adds,
          that the Chronicle of Alexandria appealed, in favour of this reading,
          to the best copies, and even to the original autograph (ἰδιοχείρῳ) of
          the Gospel of St John.

          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—People fail to seize the
          meaning of certain particulars in a narrative, and hasten to conclude
          that the author was mistaken!
        </p>
        <p>
          First example.—Jesus, in St Matthew (23:35, 36), denounced the most
          terrible judgments of God on the Jews, on account of the treatment
          they had given his saints, "in order," says he, "that upon this race
          (or this generation, γενεὰν) may come all the righteous blood shed
          upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of
          Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the
          altar!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, certainly, we are told, there is an awkward inadvertence, not on
          the part of Jesus Christ, no doubt, but of the evangelist who reports
          these words, and whose memory must have failed him. We know, from the
          Second Book of Chronicles (24:21), that this Zacharias, who was stoned
          to death by the Jews in the holy place (ἱερῷ), was the son, not of
          Barachias, but of Jehoiada. Here, then, there is an evident error. It
          does not affect doctrine, and cannot in the slightest degree disquiet
          our faith; but it suffices to attest, that the divine inspiration has
          not descended, as has been maintained, to the choice of expressions,
          or to matters of indifference, in the inspired narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is simple; would we could make it as short as it is
          conclusive. We shall first briefly state what it is. The Zacharias
          here is not the Zacharias you speak of: the Evangelist, therefore, has
          made no mistake in not naming him, for he was not thinking of him. Is
          there not, in fact, a manifest incompatibility in such a supposition
          with the idea that occupied our Lord's mind? Was it not his purpose to
          recall the long succession of homicides for which the Jewish race will
          have to render an account? And when he takes his first instance of
          murder from times preceding the flood, at the gate of paradise, to
          make them accountable for it, you would have him think it enough to
          adduce as the last, a crime committed above eight centuries before!
          After commencing with a son of Adam, can you imagine that he could end
          with the son of Jehoiada; thus holding the Jews innocent of the blood
          shed, during the 873 most scandalous years of their history? Would it
          not have been more rational to begin rather than to end with Jehoiada?
          Were not the Jews far more responsible for the murders they had
          committed during the last preceding nine centuries of their history,
          than they could be for blood shed before the deluge? Had they not
          persecuted, for example, and slain with frightful atrocity the prophet
          Urijah, 240 years after Jehoiada?—(Jer. 26:23.) "Which of the
          prophets," said St Stephen to them, "have not your fathers persecuted?
          They have even slain them which showed before of the coming of the
          Just One!"—(Acts 7:52.) In this passage of St Matthew, then, it is not
          the son of Jehoiada that is spoken of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here our reply might close; but we shall no doubt, be asked, Who then
          was the Zechariah spoken of by Jesus Christ? Even although we did not
          know, this would by no means be a difficulty, and we should content
          ourselves with replying: It was some just person whom the Jews slew,
          not only in the court of the temple (ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ) like the son of
          Jehoiada, but between the temple (τοῦ ναού) and the altar;" and this
          just person was son of Barachias! Nevertheless, one may go further
          still; for history speaks of two or three other Zachariahs, sons of
          Barachias (Βαραχίου or Βαρούχου), among whom the learned divide their
          suffrages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first was a man who had understanding in the visions of God (as he
          is called in the second book of Chronicles), and who is believed to be
          the same as he that is spoken of by Isaiah, in his 8th chapter. Be
          that as it may, he lived too short a time after the son of Jehoiada,
          for our objections against the one not to be equally valid against the
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is the prophet "Zachariah, the son of Berechiah, and the
          grandson of Iddo" (Zech. 1:1), who returned from Babylon with
          Zorobabel, 325 years after the days of Jehoiada, and whose writings
          form the second last book of the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture, it is true, has not related his martyrdom to us, any
          more than that of the other prophets, who were almost all persecuted
          and put to death. But the temple and the altar were rebuilt by his
          care, as well that of Haggai (Esdras 4:14, 15); and Zechariah, as it
          would appear, was slain "between that temple and that altar." We read
          in the Targum, or the Chaldee paraphrase of Jonathan BenUziel (said to
          have been a contemporary of Jesus Christ), the following passage,
          which attest to us what was even then, previous to the days of our
          Saviour, the tradition of the Jews with regard to this prophet, called
          indifferently the son of Hiddo and the son of Barachias (Zech. 1:1;
          Ezra 5:1; 6:14): The paraphrast (Lam. 2:20) introduces the "House of
          Judgment" replying to this complaint of Jeremiah: "Shall the priest
          and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?" "Was it well
          in you … to slay a prophet as you did Zechariah, the son of Hiddo, in
          the house of the Lord's sanctuary, because he endeavoured to withdraw
          you from your evil ways?" Thus it will be seen that Jesus Christ might
          remind the Jews of the sacrilegious murder of that prophet, son of
          Barachias, and son of Hiddo, with whom the prophecy of the Old
          Testament was to close.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there is still a third Zacharias, son of Barachias, (or of
          Baruch, Βαρόυχου), to whom our Lord's saying might be applied with
          still more likelihood. Flavius Josephus has made him known to us in
          that inestimable "History of the Jewish War," which confirms so many
          other prophecies of the New Testament. It was only three years before
          the final destruction of Jerusalem, that people saw a Zacharias, son
          of Barach slain by the Jewish zealots in the middle of the holy place
          (ἐν μέσῳ τῷ ἱερῷ), and his body was thrown over the walls of the mount
          on which the temple stood. He was a just man, according to Josephus;
          he was hated for his virtues, for his influence, for his hatred of
          evil, and for his zeal for liberty.3 At the close of that frightful
          night, which was, says Josephus, "the real commencement of the
          destruction of Jerusalem," (and in which the zealots butchered the
          chief of the nation, the high priest Ananus, and, soon after, twelve
          thousand youths of the Israelitish nobility), these infuriated men,
          affecting the forms of justice, had him dragged before a court of
          seventy judges, all of whom, however, had the courage to declare him
          innocent. Then, maddened with rage at hearing his reproaches, and at
          the noble spirit in which he addressed them, they rushed upon him and
          massacred him in the middle of the holy place." Here, as many
          commentators think, we behold the last of the just persons whose blood
          has to be required of that homicidal race. Abel is the first,
          Zacharias the last. Thus it is, that Jesus Christ, assuming the style
          of the prophets in using the past for the future, speaks of this crime
          as already committed: "Whom ye slew," he says to them, "between the
          temple and the altar!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The historian Josephus, it is true, speaks of Zacharias only as a
          righteous man, and not as a Christian or as a prophet. But, being a
          Jew, he could not hold any other language. And we see at another place
          (Antiq., lib. xx. c. 8), that as little does he speak of the apostle
          James (who, nevertheless, was also a prophet) as more than a good man,
          whom the high priest Ananus caused to be stoned, to the great regret
          of the more respectable classes, during the interregnum that followed
          the unexpected death of the governor Festus. No more does it appear to
          us that the difference in the terminations of the names Barachias and
          Baruch, is enough to destroy the argument arising from their
          etymological and radical resemblance. We see, in fact, in the New
          Testament, how much people were accustomed, among the Jews, Hebrew or
          Hellenist, to change the termination of their proper names. (Silas and
          Silvanus, Prisca and Priscilla,3 Rabba and Rabbath, Lucas and Lucius).
        </p>
        <p>
          Be this as it may, we conclude once more, that this passage could not
          refer to the son of Jehoiadah; and we leave to the reader to decide
          which of the two personages whom we have pointed out was the one
          contemplated by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second example.—Mark 11:12–14.—Jesus cursed a fig-tree which had only
          leaves; for the time for figs was not yet come. Here, we are told,
          there is no doubt a mistake: why look for fruit at a time when it
          could not reasonably be expected?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet there is nothing here but what is very simple. Had it been the
          season for gathering figs, the tree might have been stripped of all
          its fruit by the hand of man; and, in that case, there was no evidence
          of its barrenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But is a tree (we mention the objection in passing) guilty because it
          bears no fruit? Why punish it? We reply, that in this miracle, which
          is a type, the tree is as little a sufferer as it is a criminal, nor
          is its suffering more real than its morality. The one is symbolical,
          and so also is the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRECIPITATE JUDGMENT.—In questions of chronology,
          regard has not been paid to the following rule (which we take pleasure
          in expressing here in the very words of the great reformer of Italy,
          the excellent Peter Martyr).
        </p>
        <p>
          [The great divisions of time in the history of the people of God are
          pointed out to us by numerical dates of great precision. From the
          passing of Abraham into Canaan to the entrance of his grandson into
          Egypt, 215 years; from that to the passage of the Red Sea, 215 years
          more—hence in all 430 years (Gal. 3:17; Exod. 12:40); from that,
          further, to the foundation of the temple, 480 years (1 Kings 6:1); and
          from that, in fine, to the Babylonish captivity, 422 years more. But
          within these grand divisions of history, the precise and co-ordinate
          arrangement of all the short intermediate dates, the reconciling of
          the numbers presented to us by books of an almost monumental
          conciseness, and of an age contemporary with the siege of Troy (that
          of Judges, Kings, and Chronicles), respecting the reigns and
          interregnums, first of the Judges, then of the Kings, especially after
          the subdivision of the twelve tribes into two distinct kingdoms; this
          arrangement, we say, presents numerous difficulties, for which we find
          the elements of an entire solution sometimes wanting.]
        </p>
        <p>The following is the rule of Peter Martyr:—</p>
        <p>
          "Although obscure passages occur as to chronology, we must beware of
          pretending to reconcile them by imputing blunders to the inspired
          books. Therefore it is, that, should it sometimes happen that we know
          not how to account for the number of years, we ought simply to confess
          our ignorance, and consider that the Scriptures express themselves
          with so much conciseness that it is not always possible for us to
          discover at what epoch we ought to make such or such a computation
          commence. It often enough happens, that, in the history of the kings
          of Judah and of Israel, the respective numbers of their years are not
          easily reconciled; but these difficulties admit of explanation or
          adjustment in several ways. 1. The same year commenced by one of two,
          and finished by the other, is attributed to both. 2. Often the sons
          have reigned with their fathers during some years, which have been
          imputed sometimes to the fathers, sometimes to the sons. 3. There were
          often interregnums, which the Scripture attributes sometimes to the
          predecessor, sometimes to the successor. Finally, it sometimes happens
          that certain years, in which oppressive and profane princes have
          reigned, are not reckoned to them, being imputed to their immediate
          successor; thus, the twenty last years of Joram to his son Ahaziah.—(2
          Kings 8:26; 2 Chron. 22:2.)"
        </p>
        <p>
          We think that the examples we have thus far adduced, may suffice. We
          refrain from adducing more. What we have said may give one an idea of
          the weight to be attached to these difficulties, for (we repeat) we
          have been careful to adduce those which have been held as the most
          serious. Warned by these examples, and by so many others, let us learn
          then, should any embarrassment of the same kind occur to us in future,
          how to judge as did Origen's friend, Julius Africanus, sixteen hundred
          years ago, and as, before and after him, all the men of God have done.
          "Be that as it may (said he on the occasion of the two genealogies of
          Jesus Christ, which he had reconciled) be that as it may, the gospel
          certainly every where speaks true!"—Τὸ μέντοι Εὐαγγελιον πάντως
          ἀληθεύει.
