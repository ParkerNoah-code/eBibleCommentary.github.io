        <h2>V. Objections to the Doctrine of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          In connection with a divine-human work like the Bible, insoluble
          difficulties may be expected to present themselves. So long, however,
          as its inspiration is sustained by competent and sufficient evidence,
          these difficulties cannot justly prevent our full acceptance of the
          doctrine, any more than disorder and mystery in nature warrant us in
          setting aside the proofs of its divine authorship. These difficulties
          are lessened with time; some have already disappeared; many may be due
          to ignorance, and may be removed hereafter; those which are permanent
          may be intended to stimulate inquiry and to discipline faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is noticeable that the common objections to inspiration are urged,
          not so much against the religious teaching of the Scriptures, as
          against certain errors in secular matters which are supposed to be
          interwoven with it. But if these are proved to be errors indeed, it
          will not necessarily overthrow the doctrine of inspiration; it will
          only compel us to give a larger place to the human element in the
          composition of the Scriptures, and to regard them more exclusively as
          a text-book of religion. As a rule of religious faith and practice,
          they will still be the infallible word of God. The Bible is to be
          judged as a book whose one aim is man’s rescue from sin and
          reconciliation to God, and in these respects it will still be found a
          record of substantial truth. This will appear more fully as we examine
          the objections one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The Scriptures are given to teach us, not how the heavens go, but how
          to go to heaven.” Their aim is certainly not to teach science or
          history, except so far as science or history is essential to their
          moral and religious purpose. Certain of their doctrines, like the
          virgin-birth of Christ and his bodily resurrection, are historical
          facts, and certain facts, like that of creation, are also doctrines.
          With regard to these great facts, we claim that inspiration has given
          us accounts that are essentially trustworthy, whatever may be their
          imperfections in detail. To undermine the scientific trustworthiness
          of the Indian Vedas is to undermine the religion which they teach. But
          this only because their scientific doctrine is an essential part of
          their religious teaching. In the Bible, religion is not dependent upon
          physical science. The Scriptures aim only to declare the creatorship
          and lordship of the personal God. The method of his working may be
          described pictorially without affecting this substantial truth. The
          Indian cosmogonies, on the other hand, polytheistic or pantheistic as
          they are, teach essential untruth, by describing the origin of things
          as due to a series of senseless transformations without basis of will
          or wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          So long as the difficulties of Scripture are difficulties of form
          rather than substance, of its incidental features rather than its main
          doctrine, we may say of its obscurities as Isocrates said of the work
          of Heraclitus: “What I understand of it is so excellent that I can
          draw conclusions from it concerning what I do not understand.” “If
          Bengel finds things in the Bible too hard for his critical faculty, he
          finds nothing too hard for his believing faculty.” With John Smyth,
          who died at Amsterdam in 1612, we may say: “I profess I have changed,
          and shall be ready still to change, for the better”; and with John
          Robinson, in his farewell address to the Pilgrim Fathers: “I am verily
          persuaded that the Lord hath more truth yet to break forth from his
          holy word.” See Luthardt, Saving Truths, 205; Philippi, Glaubenslehre,
          205 sq.; Bap. Rev., April, 1881: art. by O. P. Eaches; Cardinal
          Newman, in 19th Century, Feb. 1884.
        </p>
        <p>1. Errors in matters of Science.</p>
        <p>Upon this objection we remark:</p>
        <p>
          (a) We do not admit the existence of scientific error in the
          Scripture. What is charged as such is simply truth presented in
          popular and impressive forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common mind receives a more correct idea of unfamiliar facts when
          these are narrated in phenomenal language and in summary form than
          when they are described in the abstract terms and in the exact detail
          of science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture writers unconsciously observe Herbert Spencer’s
          principle of style: Economy of the reader’s or hearer’s attention,—the
          more energy is expended upon the form the less there remains to
          grapple with the substance (Essays, 1–47). Wendt, Teaching of Jesus,
          1:130, brings out the principle of Jesus’ style: “The greatest
          clearness in the smallest compass.” Hence Scripture uses the phrases
          of common life rather than scientific terminology. Thus the language
          of appearance is probably used in Gen_7:19—“all the high mountains
          that were under the whole heaven were covered”—such would be the
          appearance, even if the deluge were local instead of universal; in
          Jos_10:12-13—“and the sun stood still”—such would be the appearance,
          even if the sun’s rays were merely refracted so as preternaturally to
          lengthen the day; in Psa_93:1—“The world also is established, that it
          cannot be moved”—such is the appearance, even though the earth turns
          on its axis and moves round the sun. In narrative, to substitute for
          “sunset” some scientific description would divert attention from the
          main subject. Would it be preferable, in the O. T., if we should read:
          “When the revolution of the earth upon its axis caused the rays of the
          solar luminary to impinge horizontally upon the retina, Isaac went out
          to meditate” (Gen_24:63)? “Le secret d’ennuyer est de tout dire.”
          Charles Dickens, in his American Notes, 72, describes a prairie
          sunset: “The decline of day here was very gorgeous, tinging the
          firmament deeply with red and gold, up to the very keystone of the
          arch above us” (quoted by Hovey, Manual of Christian Theology, 97).
          Did Dickens therefore believe the firmament to be a piece of solid
          masonry?
        </p>
        <p>
          Canon Driver rejects the Bible story of creation because the
          distinctions made by modern science cannot be found in the primitive
          Hebrew. He thinks the fluid state of the earth’s substance should have
          been called “surging chaos,” instead of “waters” (Gen_1:2). “An
          admirable phrase for modern and cultivated minds,” replies Mr.
          Gladstone, “but a phrase that would have left the pupils of the Mosaic
          writer in exactly the condition out of which it was his purpose to
          bring them, namely, a state of utter ignorance and darkness, with
          possibly a little ripple of bewilderment to boot”; see Sunday School
          Times, April 26, 1890. The fallacy of holding that Scripture gives in
          detail all the facts connected with a historical narrative has led to
          many curious arguments. The Gregorian Calendar which makes the year
          begin in January was opposed by representing that Eve was tempted at
          the outset by an apple, which was possible only in case the year began
          in September; see Thayer, Change of Attitude towards the Bible, 46.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It is not necessary to a proper view of inspiration to suppose
          that the human authors of Scripture had in mind the proper scientific
          interpretation of the natural events they recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is enough that this was in the mind of the inspiring Spirit.
          Through the comparatively narrow conceptions and inadequate language
          of the Scripture writers, the Spirit of inspiration may have secured
          the expression of the truth in such germinal form as to be
          intelligible to the times in which it was first published, and yet
          capable of indefinite expansion as science should advance. In the
          miniature picture of creation in the first chapter of Genesis, and in
          its power of adjusting itself to every advance of scientific
          investigation, we have a strong proof of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word “day” in Gen_1:1-31 is an instance of this general mode of
          expression. It would be absurd to teach early races, that deal only in
          small numbers, about the myriads of years of creation. The child’s
          object-lesson, with its graphic summary, conveys to his mind more of
          truth than elaborate and exact statement would convey. Conant
          (Gen_2:10) says of the description of Eden and its rivers: “Of course
          the author’s object is not a minute topographical description, but a
          general and impressive conception as a whole.” Yet the progress of
          science only shows that these accounts are not less but more true than
          was supposed by those who first received them. Neither the Hindu
          Shasters nor any heathen cosmogony can bear such comparison with the
          results of science. Why change our interpretations of Scripture so
          often? Answer: We do not assume to be original teachers of science,
          but only to interpret Scripture with the new lights we have. See Dana,
          Manual of Geology, 741–746; Guyot, in Bib. Sac., 1855:324; Dawson,
          Story of Earth and Man, 32.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conception of early Scripture teaching as elementary and suited
          to the childhood of the race would make it possible, if the facts so
          required, to interpret the early chapters of Genesis as mythical or
          legendary. God might condescend to “Kindergarten formulas.” Goethe
          said that “We should deal with children as God deals with us: we are
          happiest under the influence of innocent delusions.” Longfellow: “How
          beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams, With its illusions,
          aspirations, dreams! Book of beginnings, story without end, Each maid
          a heroine, and each man a friend!” We might hold with Goethe and with
          Longfellow, if we only excluded from God’s teaching all essential
          error. The narratives of Scripture might be addressed to the
          imagination, and so might take mythical or legendary form, while yet
          they conveyed substantial truth that could in no other way be so well
          apprehended by early man; see Robert Browning’s poem, “Development,”
          in Asolando. The Koran, on the other hand, leaves no room for
          imagination, but fixes the number of the stars and declares the
          firmament to be solid. Henry Drummond: “Evolution has given us a new
          Bible.…The Bible is not a book which has been made,—it has grown.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bagehot tells us that “One of the most remarkable of Father Newman’s
          Oxford sermons explains how science teaches that the earth goes round
          the sun, and how Scripture teaches that the sun goes round the earth;
          and it ends by advising the discreet believer to accept both.” This is
          mental bookkeeping by double entry; see Mackintosh, in Am. Jour.
          Theology, Jan. 1899:41. Lenormant, in Contemp. Rev.,
        </p>
        <p>
          Nov. 1879—“While the tradition of the deluge holds so considerable a
          place in the legendary memories of all branches of the Aryan race, the
          monuments and original texts of Egypt, with their many cosmogonic
          speculations, have not afforded any, even distant, allusion to this
          cataclysm.” Lenormant here wrongly assumed that the language of
          Scripture is scientific language. If it is the language of appearance,
          then the deluge may be a local and not a universal catastrophe. G. F.
          Wright, Ice Age in North America, suggests that the numerous
          traditions of the deluge may have had their origin in the enormous
          floods of the receding glacier. In South-western Queensland, the
          standard guage at the Meteorological Office registered 10¾, 20, 35¾,
          10¾ inches of rainfall, in all 77¼ inches, in four successive days.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It may be safely said that science has not yet shown any fairly
          interpreted passage of Scripture to be untrue.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to the antiquity of the race, we may say that owing to the
          differences of reading between the Septuagint and the Hebrew there is
          room for doubt whether either of the received chronologies has the
          sanction of inspiration. Although science has made probable the
          existence of man upon the earth at a period preceding the dates
          assigned in these chronologies, no statement of inspired Scripture is
          thereby proved false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usher’s scheme of chronology, on the basis of the Hebrew, puts the
          creation 4004 years before Christ. Hales’s, on the basis of the
          Septuagint, puts it 5411 b.c. The Fathers followed the LXX. But the
          genealogies before and after the flood may present us only with the
          names of “leading and representative men.” Some of these names seem to
          stand, not for individuals, but for tribes, e. g.; Gen_10:16—where
          Canaan is said to have begotten the Jebusite and the Amorite;
          29—Joktan begot Ophir and Havilah. In Gen_10:6, we read that Mizraim
          belonged to the sons of Ham. But Mizraim is a dual, coined to
          designate the two parts, Upper and Lower Egypt. Hence a son of Ham
          could not bear the name of Mizraim. Gen_10:13 reads: “And Misraim
          begat Ludim.” But Ludim is a plural form. The word signifies a whole
          nation, and “begat” is not employed in a literal sense. So in verses
          Gen_10:15-16 : “Canaan begat … the Jebusite,” a tribe; the ancestors
          of which would have been called Jebus. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
          however, are names, not of tribes or nations, but of individuals; see
          Prof. Edward König, of Bonn, in S. S. Times, Dec. 14, 1901. E.G.
          Robinson: “We may pretty safely go back to the time of Abraham, but no
          further.” Bib. Sac., 1899:403—“The lists in Genesis may relate to
          families and not to individuals.”
        </p>
        <p>
          G. F. Wright, Ant. and Origin of Human Race, lect. II—“When in David’s
          time it is said that ‘Shebuel, the son of Gorshom, the son of Moses,
          was ruler over the treasures’ (1Ch_23:16; 1Ch_26:24), Gershom was the
          immediate son of Moses, but Shebuel was separated by many generations
          from Gershom. So when Seth is said to have begotten Enosh when he was
          105 years old (Gen_5:6), it is, according to Hebrew usage, capable of
          meaning that Enosh was descended from the branch of Seth’s line which
          set off at the 105th year, with any number of intermediate links
          omitted.” The appearance of completeness in the text may be due to
          alteration of the text in the course of centuries; see Bib. Com.,
          1:30. In the phrase “Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of
          Abraham” (Mat_1:1) thirty-eight to forty generations are omitted. It
          may be so in some of the Old Testament genealogies. There is room for
          a hundred thousand years, if necessary (Conant). W. H. Green, in Bib.
          Sac., April, 1890:303, and in Independent, June 18, 1891—“The
          Scriptures furnish us with no data for a chronological computation
          prior to the life of Abraham. The Mosaic records do not fix, and were
          not intended to fix, the precise date of the Flood or of the Creation
          … They give a series of specimen lives, with appropriate numbers
          attached, to show by selected examples what was the original term of
          human life. To make them a complete and continuous record, and to
          deduce from them the antiquity of the race, is to put them to a use
          they were never intended to serve.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparison with secular history also shows that no such length of time
          as 100,000 years for man’s existence upon earth seems necessary.
          Rawlinson, in Jour. Christ. Philosophy, 1883:339–364, dates the
          beginning of the Chaldean monarchy at 2400 b.c. Lenormant puts the
          entrance of the Sanskritic Indians into Hindustan at 2500 b.c. The
          earliest Vedas are between 1200. and 1000 b.c. (Max Mtiller). Call of
          Abraham, probably 1945 b.c. Chinese history possibly began as early as
          2356 b.c. (Legge). The old Empire in Egypt possibly began as early as
          2650 b.c. Rawlinson puts the flood at 3600 b.c., and adds 2000 years
          between the deluge and the creation, making the age of the world 1886
          + 3600 + 2000 = 7486. S. R. Pattison, in Present Day Tracts, 3: no.
          13, concludes that “a term of about 8000 years is warranted by
          deductions from history, geology, and Scripture.” See also Duke of
          Argyll, Primeval Man, 76–128; Cowles on Genesis, 49–80; Dawson, Fossil
          Men, 246; Hicks, in Bap. Rev., July, 1884 (15000 years); Zöckler,
          Urgeschichte der Erde und des Menschen, 137–163. On the critical side,
          see Crooker, The New Bible and its Uses, 80–102.

          Evidence of a geological nature seems to be accumulating, which tends
          to prove man’s advent upon earth at least ten thousand years ago. An
          arrowhead of tempered copper and a number of human bones were found in
          the Rocky Point mines, near Gilman, Colorado, 460 feet beneath the
          surface of the earth, embedded in a vein of silverbearing ore. More
          than a hundred dollars worth of ore clung to the bones when they were
          removed from the mine. On the age of the earth and the antiquity of
          man, see G. F. Wright, Man and the Glacial Epoch, lectures iv and x,
          and in McClure’s Magazine, June, 1901, and Bib. Sac., 1903:31—“Charles
          Darwin first talked about 300 million years as a mere trifle of
          geologic time. His son George limits it to 50 or 100 million; Croll
          and Young to 60 or 70 million; Wallace to 28 million; Lord Kelvin to
          24 million; Thompson and Newcomb to only 10 million.” Sir Archibald
          Geikie, at the British Association at Dover in 1899, said that 100
          million years sufficed for that small portion of the earth’s history
          which is registered in the stratified rocks of the crust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaler, Interpretation of Nature, 122, considers vegetable life to
          have existed on the planet for at least 100 million years. Warren
          Upham, in Pop. Science Monthly, Dec. 1893:153—“How old is the earth?
          100 million years.” D. G. Brinton, in Forum, Dec. 1893:454, puts the
          minimum limit of man’s existence on earth at 50,000 years. G. F.
          Wright does not doubt that man’s presence on this continent was
          preglacial, say eleven or twelve thousand years ago. He asserts that
          there has been a subsidence of Central Asia and Southern Russia since
          man’s advent, and that Arctic seals are still found in lake Baikal in
          Siberia. While he grants that Egyptian civilization may go back to
          5000 b.c. he holds that no more than 6000 or 7000 years before this
          are needed as preparation for history. Le Conte, Elements of Geology,
          613—“Men saw the great glaciers of the second glacial epoch, but there
          is no reliable evidence of their existence before the first glacial
          epoch. Deltas, implements, lake shores, waterfalls, indicate only 7000
          to 10,000 years.” Recent calculations of Prof. Prestwich, the most
          eminent living geologist of Great Britain, tend to bring the close of
          the glacial epoch down to within 10,000 or 15,000 years.

          (d) Even if error in matters of science were found in Scripture, it
          would not disprove inspiration, since inspiration concerns itself with
          science only so far as correct scientific views are necessary to
          morals and religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great harm results from identifying Christian doctrine with specific
          theories of the universe. The Roman church held that the revolution of
          the sun around the earth was taught in Scripture, and that Christian
          faith required the condemnation of Galileo; John Wesley thought
          Christianity to be inseparable from a belief in witchcraft; opposers
          of the higher criticism regard the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch
          as “articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiæ.” We mistake greatly when
          we link inspiration with scientific doctrine. The purpose of Scripture
          is not to teach science, but to teach religion, and, with the
          exception of God’s creatorship and preserving agency in the universe,
          no scientific truth is essential to the system of Christian doctrine.
          Inspiration might leave the Scripture writers in possession of the
          scientific ideas of their time, while yet they were empowered
          correctly to declare both ethical and religious truth. A right spirit
          indeed gains some insight into the meaning of nature, and so the
          Scripture writers seem to be preserved from incorporating into their
          productions much of the scientific error of their day. But entire
          freedom from such error must not be regarded as a necessary
          accompaniment of inspiration.

        <p>2. Errors in matters of History.</p>
        <p>To this objection we reply:</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are often mere mistakes in transcription,
          and have no force as arguments against inspiration, unless it can
          first be shown that inspired documents are by the very fact of their
          inspiration exempt from the operation of those laws which affect the
          transmission of other ancient documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no right to expect that the inspiration of the original writer
          will be followed by a miracle in the case of every copyist. Why
          believe in infallible copyists, more than in infallible printers? God
          educates us to care for his word, and for its correct transmission.
          Reverence has kept the Scriptures more free from various readings than
          are other ancient manuscripts. None of the existing variations
          endanger any important article of faith. Yet some mistakes in
          transcription there probably are. In 1Ch_22:14, instead of 100,000
          talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver (=$3,750,000,000),
          Josephus divides the sum by ten. Dr. Howard Osgood: “A French writer,
          Revillout, has accounted for the differing numbers in Kings and
          Chronicles, just as he accounts for the same differences in Egyptian
          and Assyrian later accounts, by the change in the value of money and
          debasement of issues. He shows the change all over Western Asia.” Per
          contra, see Bacon, Genesis of Gen_45:1-28.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2Ch_13:3; 2Ch_13:17, where the numbers of men in the armies of
          little Palestine are stated as 400,000 and 800,000, and 500,000 are
          said to have been slain in a single battle, “some ancient copies of
          the Vulgate and Latin translations of Josephus have 40,000, 80,000,
          and 50,000”; see Annotated Paragraph Bible, in loco. In 2Ch_17:14-19,
          Jehoshaphat’s army aggregates 1,160,000, besides the garrisons of his
          fortresses. It is possible that by errors in transcription these
          numbers have been multiplied by ten. Another explanation however, and
          perhaps a more probable one, is given under (d) below. Similarly,
          compare 1Sa_6:19, where 50,070 are slain, with the 70 of Josephus;
          2Sa_8:4—“1,700 horsemen,” with 1Ch_18:4—“7,000 horsemen”;
          Est_9:16—75,000 slain by the Jews, with LXX—15,000. In Mat_27:9, we
          have “Jeremiah” for “Zechariah”—this Calvin allows to be a mistake;
          and, if a mistake, then one made by the first copyist, for it appears
          in all the uncials, all the manuscripts and all the versions except
          the Syriac Peshito where it is omitted, evidently on the authority of
          the individual transcriber and translator. In Act_7:16—“the tomb that
          Abraham bought”—Hackett regards “Abraham” as a clerical error for
          “Jacob” (compare Gen_33:18-19). See Bible Com., 3:165, 249, 251, 317.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Other so-called errors are to be explained as a permissible use of
          round numbers, which cannot be denied to the sacred writers except
          upon the principle that mathematical accuracy was more important than
          the general impression to be secured by the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Num_25:9, we read that there fell in the plague 24,000; 1Co_10:8
          says 23,000. The actual number was possibly somewhere between the two.
          Upon a similar principle, we do not scruple to celebrate the Landing
          of the Pilgrims on December 22nd and the birth of Christ on December
          25th. We speak of the battle of Bunker Hill, although at Bunker Hill
          no battle was really fought. In Exo_12:40-41, the sojourn of the
          Israelites in Egypt is declared to be 430 years. Yet Paul, in
          Gal_3:17, says that the giving of the law through Moses was 430 years
          after the call of Abraham, whereas the call of Abraham took place 215
          years before Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt, and Paul should
          have said 645 years instead of 430. Franz Delitzsch: “The Hebrew Bible
          counts four centuries of Egyptian sojourn (Gen_15:13-16), more
          accurately, 430 years (Exo_12:40); but according to the LXX
          (Exo_12:40) this number comprehends the sojourn in Canaan and Egypt,
          so that 215 years come to the pilgrimage in Canaan, and 215 to the
          servitude in Egypt. This kind of calculation is not exclusively
          Hellenistic; it is also found in the oldest Palestinian Midrash. Paul
          stands on this side in Gal_3:17, making, not the immigration into
          Egypt, but the covenant with Abraham the terminus a quo of the 430
          years which end in the Exodus from Egypt and in the legislation”; see
          also Hovey, Com. on Gal_3:17. It was not Paul’s purpose to write
          chronology,—so he may follow the LXX, and call the time between the
          promise to Abraham and the giving of the law to Moses 430 years,
          rather than the actual 600. If he had given the larger number, it
          might have led to perplexity and discussion about a matter which had
          nothing to do with the vital question in hand. Inspiration may have
          employed current though inaccurate statements as to matters of
          history, because they were the best available means of impressing upon
          men’s minds truth of a more important sort. In Gen_15:13 the 430 years
          is called in round numbers 400 years, and so in Act_7:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Diversities of statement in accounts of the same event, so long as
          they touch no substantial truth, may be due to the meagreness of the
          narrative, and might be fully explained if some single fact, now
          unrecorded, were only known. To explain these apparent discrepancies
          would not only be beside the purpose of the record, but would destroy
          one valuable evidence of the independence of the several writers or
          witnesses.

          On the Stokes trial, the judge spoke of two apparently conflicting
          testimonies as neither of them necessarily false. On the difference
          between Matthew and Luke as to the scene of the Sermon on the Mount
          (Mat_5:1; cf. Luk_6:17) see Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, 360. As to
          one blind man or two (Mat_20:30; cf. Luk_18:35) see Bliss, Com. on
          Luke, 275, and Gardiner, in Bib. Sac., July, 1879:513, 514; Jesus may
          have healed the blind men during a day’s excursion from Jericho, and
          it might be described as “when they went out,” or “as they drew nigh
          to Jericho.” Prof. M. B. Riddle: “Luk_18:35 describes the general
          movement towards Jerusalem and not the precise detail preceding the
          miracle; Mat_20:30 intimates that the miracle occurred during an
          excursion from the city,—Luke afterwards telling of the final
          departure”; Calvin holds to two meetings; Godet to two cities; if
          Jesus healed two blind men, he certainly healed one, and Luke did not
          need to mention more than one, even if he knew of both; see Broadus on
          Mat_20:30. In Mat_8:28, where Matthew has two demoniacs at Gadara and
          Luke has only one at Gerasa, Broadus supposes that the village of
          Gerasa belonged to the territory of the city of Gadara, a few miles to
          the Southeast of the lake, and he quotes the case of Lafayette: “In
          the year 1824 Lafayette visited the United States and was welcomed
          with honors and pageants. Some historians will mention only Lafayette,
          but others will relate the same visit as made and the same honors ae
          enjoyed by two persons, namely, Lafayette and his son. Will not both
          be right?” On Christ’s last Passover, see Robinson, Harmony, 212; E.
          H. Sears, Fourth Gospel Appendix A; Edersheim, Life and Times of the
          Messiah, 2:507. Augustine: “Locutiones variæ, sed non contrariæ:
          diversæ, sed non adversæ.”

          Bartlett, in Princeton Rev., Jan. 1880:46, 47, gives the following
          modern illustrations: Window’s Journal (of Plymouth Plantation) speaks
          of a ship sent out “by Master Thomas Weston.” But Bradford in his far
          briefer narrative of the matter, mentions it as sent “by Mr. Weston
          and another.” John Adams, in his letters, tells the story of the
          daughter of Otis about her father’s destruction of his own
          manuscripts. At one time he makes her say: “In one of his unhappy
          moments he committed them all to the flames”; yet, in the second
          letter, she is made to say that “he was several days in doing it.” One
          newspaper says: President Hayes attended the Bennington centennial;
          another newspaper says: the President and Mrs. Hayes; a third: the
          President and his Cabinet; a fourth: the President, Mrs. Hayes and a
          majority of his Cabinet. Archibald Forbes, in his account of Napoleon
          III at Sedan, points out an agreement of narratives as to the salient
          points, combined with “the hopeless and bewildering discrepancies as
          to details,” even as these are reported by eye-witnesses, including
          himself, Bismarck, and General Sheridan who was on the ground, as well
          as others.

        <p>
          Thayer, Change of Attitude, 52, speaks of Luke’s “plump anachronism in
          the matter of Theudas”—Act_5:36—“For before those days rose up
          Theudas.” Josephus, Antiquities, 20:5:1, mentions an insurrectionary
          Theudas, but the date and other incidents do not agree with those of
          Luke. Josephus however may have mistaken the date as easily as Luke,
          or he may refer to another man of the same name. The inscription on
          the Cross is given in Mar_15:26, as “The King of the Jews”; in
          Luk_23:38, as “This is the King of the Jews”; in Mat_27:37, as “This
          is Jesus the King of the Jews”; and in Joh_19:19, as “Jesus of
          Nazareth the King of the Jews.” The entire superscription, in Hebrew,
          Greek and Latin, may have contained every word given by the several
          evangelists combined, and may have read “This is Jesus of Nazareth,
          the King of the Jews,” and each separate report may be entirely
          correct so far as it goes. See, on the general subject, Haley, Alleged
          Discrepancies; Fisher, Beginnings of Christianity, 406–412.

          (d) While historical and archæological discovery in many important
          particulars goes to sustain the general correctness of the Scripture
          narratives, and no statement essential to the moral and religious
          teaching of Scripture has been invalidated, inspiration is still
          consistent with much imperfection in historical detail and its
          narratives “do not seem to be exempted from possibilities of error.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The words last quoted are those of Sanday. In his Bampton Lectures on
          Inspiration, 400, he remarks that “Inspiration belongs to the
          historical books rather as conveying a religious lesson, than as
          histories; rather as interpreting, than as narrating plain matter of
          fact. The crucial issue is that in these last respects they do not
          seem to be exempted from possibilities of error.” R. V. Foster,
          Systematic Theology, (Cumberland Presbyterian): The Scripture writers
          “were not inspired to do otherwise than to take these statements as
          they found them.” Inerrancy is not freedom from misstatements, but
          from error defined as “that which misleads in any serious or important
          sense.” When we compare the accounts of 1 and 2 Chronicles with those
          of 1 and 2 Kings we find in the former an exaggeration of numbers, a
          suppression of material unfavorable to the writer’s purpose, and an
          emphasis upon that which is favorable, that contrasts strongly with
          the method of the latter. These characteristics are so continuous that
          the theory of mistakes in transcription does not seem sufficient to
          account for the facts. The author’s aim was to draw out the religious
          lessons of the story, and historical details are to him of comparative
          unimportance.
        </p>
        <p>
          H. P. Smith, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 108—“Inspiration did
          not correct the Chronicler’s historical point of view, more than it
          corrected his scientific point of view, which no doubt made the earth
          the centre of the solar system. It therefore left him open to receive
          documents, and to use them, which idealized the history of the past,
          and described David and Solomon according to the ideas of later times
          and the priestly class. David’s sins are omitted, and numbers are
          multiplied, to give greater dignity to the earlier kingdom.” As
          Tennyson’s Idylls of the King give a nobler picture of King Arthur,
          and a more definite aspect to his history, than actual records
          justify, yet the picture teaches great moral and religious lessons, so
          the Chronicler seems to have manipulated his material in the interest
          of religion. Matters of arithmetic were minor matters. “Majoribus
          intentus est.”
        </p>
        <p>
          E. G. Robinson: “The numbers of the Bible are characteristic of a
          semi-barbarous age. The writers took care to guess enough. The
          tendency of such an age is always to exaggerate.” Two Formosan savages
          divide five pieces between them by taking two apiece and throwing one
          away. The lowest tribes can count only with the fingers of their
          hands; when they use their toes as well, it marks an advance in
          civilization. To the modern child a hundred is just as great a number
          as a million. So the early Scriptures seem to use numbers with a
          childlike ignorance as to their meaning. Hundreds of thousands can be
          substituted for tens of thousands, and the substitution seems only a
          proper tribute to the dignity of the subject. Gore, in Lux Mundt,
          353—“This was not conscious perversion, but unconscious idealizing of
          history, the reading back into past records of a ritual development
          which was really later. Inspiration excludes conscious deception, but
          it appears to be quite consistent with this sort of idealizing; always
          supposing that the result read back into the earlier history does
          represent the real purpose of God and only anticipates the
          realization.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some who contend that these historical imperfections are due
          to transcription and that they did not belong to the original
          documents. Watts, New Apologetic, 71, 111, when asked what is gained
          by contending for infallible original autographs if they have been
          since corrupted, replies: “Just what we gain by contending for the
          original perfection of human nature, though man has since corrupted
          it. We must believe God’s own testimony about his own work. God may
          permit others to do what, as a holy righteous God, he cannot do
          himself.” When the objector declares it a matter of little consequence
          whether a pair of trousers were or were not originally perfect, so
          long as they are badly rent just now, Watts replies: “The tailor who
          made them would probably prefer to have it understood that the
          trousers did not leave his shop in their present forlorn condition.
          God drops no stitches and sends out no imperfect work.” Watts however
          seems dominated by an a priori theory of inspiration, which blinds him
          to the actual facts of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evans, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 40—“Does the present error
          destroy the inspiration of the Bible as we have it? No. Then why
          should the original error destroy the inspiration of the Bible, as it
          was first given? There are spots on yonder sun; do they stop its being
          the sun? Why, the sun is all the more a sun for the spots. So the
          Bible.” Inspiration seems to have permitted the gathering of such
          material as was at hand, very much as a modern editor might construct
          his account of an army movement from the reports of a number of
          observers; or as a modern historian might combine the records of a
          past age with all their imperfections of detail. In the case of the
          Scripture writers, however, we maintain that inspiration has permitted
          no sacrifice of moral and religious truth in the completed Scripture,
          but has woven its historical material together into an organic whole
          which teaches all the facts essential to the knowledge of Christ and
          of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we come to examine in detail what purport to be historical
          narratives, we must be neither credulous nor sceptical, but simply
          candid and open-minded. With regard for example to the great age of
          the Old Testament patriarchs, we are no more warranted in rejecting
          the Scripture accounts upon the ground that life in later times is so
          much shorter, than we are to reject the testimony of botanists as to
          trees of the Sequoia family between four and five hundred feet high,
          or the testimony of geologists as to Saurians a hundred feet long,
          upon the ground that the trees and reptiles with which we are
          acquainted are so much smaller. Every species at its introduction
          seems to exhibit the maximum of size and vitality. Weismann, Heredity,
          6, 30—“Whales live some hundreds of years; elephants two hundred—their
          gestation taking two years. Giants prove that the plan upon which man
          is constructed can also be carried out on a scale far larger than the
          normal one.” E. Bay Lankester, Adv. of Science, 205–237, 236—agrees
          with Weismann iu his general theory. Sir George Cornewall Lewis long
          denied centenarism, but at last had to admit it.

          Charles Dudley Warner, in Harper’s Magazine, Jan. 1895, gives
          instances of men 137, 140, and 192 years old. The German Haller
          asserts that “the ultimate limit of human life does not exceed two
          centuries: to fix the exact number of years is exceedingly difficult.”
          J. Norman Lockyer, in Nature, regards the years of the patriarchs as
          lunar years. In Egypt, the sun being used, the unit of time was a
          year; but in Chaldea, the unit of time was a month, for the reason
          that the standard of time was the moon. Divide the numbers by twelve,
          and the lives of the patriarchs come out very much the same length
          with lives at the present day. We may ask, however, how this theory
          would work in shortening the lives between Noah and Moses. On the

          (a) What are charged as such are sometimes evil acts and words of good

          Instances of this sort are Noah’s drunkenness (Gen_9:20-27); Lot’s
          incest (Gen_19:30-38); Jacob’s falsehood (Gen_27:19-24); David’s
          adultery (2Sa_11:1-4); Peter’s denial (Mat_26:69-75). See Lee,
          Inspiration, 265, note. Esther’s vindictiveness is not commended, nor
          are the characters of the Book of Esther said to have acted in
          obedience to a divine command. Crane, Religion of To-morrow, 241—“In
          law and psalm and prophecy we behold the influence of Jehovah working
          as leaven among a primitive and barbarous people. Contemplating the
          Old Scriptures in this light, they become luminous with divinity, and
          we are furnished with the principle by which to discriminate between
          the divine and the human in the book. Particularly in David do we see
          a rugged, half-civilized, kingly man, full of gross errors, fleshly
          and impetuous, yet permeated with a divine Spirit that lifts him,
          struggling, weeping, and warring, up to some of the loftiest
          conceptions of Deity which the mind of man has conceived. As an
          angelic being, David is a caricature; as a man of God, as an example
          of God moving upon and raising up a most human man, he is a splendid
          example. The proof that the church is of God, is not its
          impeccability, but its progress.”

          (b) Where evil acts appear at first sight to be sanctioned, it is
          frequently some right intent or accompanying virtue, rather than the
          act itself, upon which commendation is bestowed.

          As Rahab’s faith, not her duplicity (Jos_2:1-24 : cf. Heb_11:31 and
          Jam_2:25); Jael’s patriotism, not her treachery (Jdg_4:17-22; cf.
          Jdg_5:24), Or did they cast in their lot with Israel and use the
          common stratagems of war (see next paragraph)? Herder: “The
          limitations of the pupil are also limitations of the teacher.” While
          Dean Stanley praises Solomon for tolerating idolatry, James Martineau,
          Study, 2:137, remarks: “It would be a ridiculous pedantry to apply the
          Protestant pleas of private judgment to such communities as ancient
          Egypt and Assyria.…It is the survival of coercion, after conscience
          has been born to supersede it, that shocks and revolts us in
          persecution.”

          (c) Certain commands and deeds are sanctioned as relatively
          just—expressions of justice such as the age could comprehend, and are
          to be judged as parts of a progressively unfolding system of morality
          whose key and culmination we have in Jesus Christ.
        </p>

          Exo_20:25—“I gave them statutes that were not good“—as Moses’
          permission of divorce and retaliation (Deu_24:1; cf. Mat_5:31-32;
          Mat_19:7-9. Exo_21:24; cf. Mat_5:38-39). Compare Elijah’s calling down
          fire from heaven (2Ki_1:10-12) with Jesus’ refusal to do the same, and
          his intimation that the spirit of Elijah was not the spirit of Christ
          (Luk_9:52-56); cf. Mattheson, Moments on the Mount, 253–255, on
          Mat_17:8—“Jesus only”: “The strength of Elias paled before him. To
          shed the blood of enemies requires less strength than to shed one’s
          own blood, and to conquer by fire is easier than to conquer by love.”
          Hovey: “In divine revelation, it is first starlight, then dawn,
          finally day.” George Washington once gave directions for the
          transportation to the West Indies and the sale there of a refractory
          negro who had given him trouble. This was not at variance with the
          best morality of his time, but it would not suit the improved ethical
          standards of today. The use of force rather than moral suasion is
          sometimes needed by children and by barbarians. We may illustrate by
          the Sunday School scholar’s unruliness which was cured by his
          classmates during the week. “What did you say to him?” asked the
          teacher. “We did n’t say nothing; we just punched his head for him.”
          This was Old Testament righteousness. The appeal in the O. T. to the
          hope of earthly rewards was suitable to a stage of development not yet
          instructed as to heaven and hell by the coming and work of Christ;
          compare Exo_20:12 with Mat_5:10; Mat_25:46. The Old Testament aimed to
          fix in the mind of a selected people the idea of the unity and
          holiness of God; in order to exterminate idolatry, much other teaching
          was postponed. See Peabody, Religion of Nature, 45; Mozley, Ruling
          Ideas of Early Ages; Green, in Presb., Quar., April, 1877:221–252;
          McIivaine, Wisdom of Holy Scripture, 328–368; Brit, and For. Evang.

          When therefore we find in the inspired song of Deborah, the prophetess
          (Jdg_5:30), an allusion to the common spoils of war—“a damsel, two
          damsels to every man” or in Pro_31:6-7—“Give strong drink unto him
          that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul. Let him
          drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more”—we do
          not need to maintain that these passages furnish standards for our
          modern conduct. Dr. Fisher calls the latter “the worst advice to a
          person in affliction, or dispirited by the loss of property.” They
          mark past stages in God’s providential leading of mankind. A higher
          stage indeed is already intimated in Pro_31:4—“it is not for kings to
          drink wine, Nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?” We see
          that God could use very imperfect instruments and could inspire very
          imperfect men. Many things were permitted for men’s “hardness of
          heart” (Mat_19:8). The Sermon on the Mount is a great advance on the
          law of Moses (Mat_5:21—“Ye hare heard that it was said to them of old
          time”; cf. Mat_5:22—“But I say unto you”).

          Robert G. Ingersoll would have lost his stock in trade if Christians
          had generally recognized that revelation is gradual, and is completed
          only in Christ. This gradualness of revelation is conceded in the
          common phrase: “the new dispensation.” Abraham Lincoln showed his
          wisdom by never going far ahead of the common sense of the people. God
          similarly adapted his legislation to the capacities of each successive
          age. The command to Abraham to sacrifice his son (Gen_22:1-19) was a
          proper test of Abraham’s faith in a day when human sacrifice violated
          no common ethical standard because the Hebrew, like the Roman, “patria
          potestas” did not regard the child as having a separate individuality,
          but included the child in the parent and made the child equally
          responsible for the parent’s sin. But that very command was given only
          as a test of faith, and with the intent to make the intended obedience
          the occasion of revealing God’s provision of a substitute and so of
          doing away with human sacrifice for all future time. We may well
          imitate the gradualness of divine revelation in our treatment of
          dancing and of the liquor traffic.

          (d) God’s righteous sovereignty affords the key to other events. He
          has the right to do what he will with his own, and to punish the
          transgressor when and where he will; and he may justly make men the
          foretellers or executors of his purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foretellers, as in the imprecatory Psalms (Psa_137:9; cf. Isa_13:16-18
          and Jer_50:16; Jer_50:29); executors, as in the destruction of the
          Canaanites (Deu_7:2; Deu_7:16). In the former case the Psalm was not
          the ebullition of personal anger, but the expression of judicial
          indignation against the enemies of God. We must distinguish the
          substance from the form. The substance was the denunciation of God’s
          righteous judgments; the form was taken from the ordinary customs of
          war in the Psalmist’s time. See Park, in Bib. Sac., 1862:165; Cowles,
          Com. on Psa_137:1-9; Perowne on Psalms, Introd., 61; Presb. and Ref.
          Rev., 1897:490–505; cf. 2Ti_4:14—“the Lord will render to him
          according to his works” = a prophecy, not a curse, ἀποδώσει, not
          ἀποδὠη, as in A. V. In the latter case, an exterminating war was only
          the benevolent surgery that amputated the putrid limb, and so saved
          the religious life of the Hebrew nation and of the after-world. See
          Dr. Thomas Arnold, Essay on the Right Interpretation of Scripture;
          Fisher, Beginnings of Christianity, 11–24.

          Another interpretation of these events has been proposed, which would
          make them illustrations of the principle indicated in (c) above: E. G.
          Robinson, Christian Theology, 45—“It was not the imprecations of the
          Psalm that were inspired of God, but his purposes and ideas of which
          these were by the times the necessary vehicle; just as the adultery of
          David was not by divine command, though through it the purpose of God
          as to Christ’s descent was accomplished.” John Watson (Ian Maclaren),
          Cure of Souls, 143—“When the massacre of the Canaanites and certain
          proceedings of David are flung in the face of Christians, it is no
          longer necessary to fall back on evasious or special pleading. It can
          now be frankly admitted that, from our standpoint in this year of
          grace, such deeds were atrocious, and that they never could have been
          according to the mind of God, but that they must be judged by their
          date, and considered the defects of elementary moral processes. The
          Bible is vindicated, because it is, on the whole, a steady ascent, and
          because it culminates in Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lyman Abbott, Theology of an Evolutionist, 56—“Abraham mistook the
          voice of conscience, calling on him to consecrate his only son to God,
          and interpreted it as a command to slay his son as a burnt offering.
          Israel misinterpreted his righteous indignation at the cruel and
          lustful rites of the Canaanitish religion as a divine summons to
          destroy the worship by putting the worshipers to death; a people
          undeveloped in moral judgment could not distinguish between formal
          regulations respecting camp-life and eternal principles of
          righteousness, such as, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, but
          embodied them in the same code, and seemed to regard them as of equal
          authority.” Wilkinson, Epic of Paul, 281—“If so be such man, so placed
          … did in some part That utterance make his own, profaning it, To be
          his vehicle for sense not meant By the august supreme inspiring
          Will”—i. e., putting some of his own sinful anger into God’s calm
          predictions of judgment. Compare the stern last words of “Zechariah,
          the son of Jehoiada, the priest” when stoned to death in the temple
          court: “Jehovah look upon it and require it” (2Ch_24:20-22), with the
          last words of Jesus: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what
          they do” (Luk_23:34) and of Stephen: “Lord, lay not this sin to their
          charge” (Act_7:60).
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) Other apparent immoralities are due to unwarranted
          interpretations. Symbol is sometimes taken for literal fact; the
          language of irony is understood as sober affirmation; the glow and
          freedom of Oriental description are judged by the unimpassioncd style
          of Western literature; appeal to lower motives is taken to exclude,
          instead of preparing for, the higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Hos_1:2-3, the command to the prophet to marry a harlot was
          probably received and executed in vision, and was intended only as
          symbolic: compare Jer_25:15-18—“Take this cup.…and cause all the
          nations.…to drink.” Literal obedience would have made the prophet
          contemptible to those whom he would instruct, and would require so
          long a time as to weaken, if not destroy, the designed effect; see
          Ann. Par. Bible, in loco. In 2Ki_6:19, Elisha’s deception, so called,
          was probably only ironical and benevolent; the enemy dared not resist,
          because they were completely in his power. In the Song of Solomon, we
          have, as Jewish writers have always held, a highly-wrought dramatic
          description of the union between Jehovah and his people, which we must
          judge by Eastern and not by Western literary standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Francis W. Newman, in his Phases of Faith, accused even the New
          Testament of presenting low motives for human obedience. It is true
          that all right motives are appealed to, and some of these motives are
          of a higher sort than are others. Hope of heaven and fear of hell are
          not the highest motives, but they may be employed as preliminary
          incitements to action, even though only love for God and for holiness
          will ensure salvation. Such motives are urged both by Christ and by
          his apostles: Mat_6:20—“lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven”;
          Mat_10:28—“fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
          hell”; Jud_1:23—“some save with fear, snatching them out of the fire.”
          In this respect the N. T. does not differ from the O. T. George Adam
          Smith has pointed out that the royalists got their texts, “the powers
          that be” (Rom_13:1) and “the king as supreme” (1Pe_2:13), from the N.
          T., while the O. T. furnished texts for the defenders of liberty.
          While the O. T. deals with national life, and the discharge of social
          and political functions, the N. T. deals in the main with individuals
          and with their relations to God. On the whole subject, see Hessey,
          Moral Difficulties of the Bible; Jellett, Moral Difficulties of the O.
          T.; Faith and Free Thought (Lect. by Christ. Ev. Soc), 2:173; Rogers,
          Eclipse of Faith; Butler, Analogy, part ii, chap, iii; Orr, Problem of
          the O. T., 465–483.

        <p>4. Errors of Reasoning.</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are generally to be explained as valid
          argument expressed in highly condensed form. The appearance of error
          may be due to the suppression of one or more links in the reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Mat_22:32, Christ’s argument for the resurrection, drawn from the
          fact that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is perfectly
          and obviously valid, the moment we put in the suppressed premise that
          the living relation to God which is here implied cannot properly be
          conceived as something merely spiritual, but necessarily requires a
          new and restored life of the body. If God is the God of the living,
          then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob shall rise from the dead. See more full
          exposition, under Eschatology. Some of the Scripture arguments are
          enthymemes, and an enthymeme, according to Arbuthnot and Pope, is “a
          syllogism in which the major is married to the minor, and the marriage
          is kept secret.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Where we cannot see the propriety of the conclusions drawn from
          given premises, there is greater reason to attribute our failure to
          ignorance of divine logic on our part, than to accommodation or ad
          hominem arguments on the part of the Scripture writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By divine logic we mean simply a logic whose elements and processes
          are correct, though not understood by us. In Heb_7:9-10 (Levi’s paying
          tithes in Abraham), there is probably a recognition of the organic
          unity of the family, which in miniature illustrates the organic unity
          of the race. In Gal_3:20—“a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God
          is one”—the law, with its two contracting parties, is contrasted with
          the promise, which proceeds from the sole flat of God and is therefore
          unchangeable. Paul’s argument here rests on Christ’s divinity as its
          foundation—otherwise Christ would have been a mediator in the same
          sense in which Moses was a mediator (see Lightfoot, in loco). In
          Gal_4:21-31, Hagar and Ishmael on the one hand, and Sarah and Isaac on
          the other, illustrate the exclusion of the bondmen of the law from the
          privileges of the spiritual seed of Abraham. Abraham’s two wives, and
          the two classes of people in the two sons, represent the two covenants
          (so Calvin). In Joh_10:34—“I said, Ye are gods,” the implication is
          that Judaism was not a system of mere monotheism, but of theism
          tending to theanthropism, a real union of God and man (Westcott, Bib.
          Com., in loco). Godet well remarks that he who doubts Paul’s logic
          will do well first to suspect his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The adoption of Jewish methods of reasoning, where it could be
          proved, would not indicate error on the part of the Scripture writers,
          but rather an inspired sanction of the method as applied to that
          particular case.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Gal_3:16—“He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one,
          And to thy seed, which is Christ.” Here it is intimated that the very
          form of the expression in Gen_22:18, which denotes unity, was selected
          by the Holy Spirit as significant of that one person, Christ, who was
          the true seed of Abraham and in whom all nations were to be blessed.
          Argument from the form of a single word is in this case correct,
          although the Rabbins often made more of single words than the Holy
          Spirit ever intended. Watts, New Apologetic, 69—“F. W. Farrar asserts
          that the plural of the Hebrew or Greek terms for ‘seed’ is never used
          by Hebrew or Greek writers as a designation of human offspring. But
          see Sophocles, Œdipus at Colonus, 599, 600—γῆς ἐμῆς ἀπηλάθην πρὸς τῶν
          ἐμαυτοῦ σπερμάτων—‘I was driven away from my own country by my own
          offspring.’ ” In 1Co_10:1-6—“and the rock was Christ”—the Rabbinic
          tradition that the smitten rock followed the Israelites in their
          wanderings is declared to be only the absurd literalizing of a
          spiritual fact—the continual presence of Christ, as preëxistent Logos,
          with his ancient people. Per contra, see Row, Rev. and Mod. Theories,
          98–128.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) If it should appear however upon further investigation that
          Rabbinical methods have been wrongly employed by the apostles in their
          argumentation, we might still distinguish between the truth they are
          seeking to convey and the arguments by which they support it.
          Inspiration may conceivably make known the truth, yet leave the
          expression of the truth to human dialectic as well as to human
          rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnson, Quotations of the N. T. from the O. T., 137, 138—“In the
          utter absence of all evidence to the contrary, we ought to suppose
          that the allegories of the N. T. are like the allegories of literature
          in general, merely luminous embodiments of the truth..…If these
          allegories are not presented by their writers as evidences, they are
          none the less precious, since they illuminate the truth otherwise
          evinced, and thus render it at once clear to the apprehension and
          attractive to the taste.” If however the purpose of the writers was to
          use these allegories for proof, we may still see shining through the
          rifts of their traditional logic the truth which they were striving to
          set forth. Inspiration may have put them in possession of this truth
          without altering their ordinary scholastic methods of demonstration
          and expression. Horton, Inspiration, 108—“Discrepancies and illogical
          reasonings were but inequalities or cracks in the mirrors, which did
          not materially distort or hide the Person” whose glory they sought to
          reflect. Luther went even further than this when he said that a
          certain argument in the epistle was “good enough for the Galatians.”

        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are commonly interpretations of the

          In Eph_5:14, “arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee”

          is come.” Psa_68:18—“Thou hast received gifts among men“—is quoted in
          Eph_4:8 as “gave gifts to men.” The words in Hebrew are probably a
          concise expression for “thou hast taken spoil which thou mayest
          distribute as gifts to men.” Eph_4:8 agrees exactly with the sense,
          though not with the words, of the Psalm. In Heb_11:21,
          “Jacob.…worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff” (LXX); Gen_47:31
          has “bowed himself upon the bed’s head.” The meaning is the same, for
          the staff of the chief and the spear of the warrior were set at the
          bed’s head. Jacob, too feeble to rise, prayed in his bed. Here Calvin
          says that “the apostle does not hesitate to accommodate to his own
          purpose what was commonly received,—they were not so scrupulous” as to
          details. Even Gordon, Ministry of the Spirit, 177, speaks of “a
          reshaping of his own words by the Author of them.” We prefer, with
          Calvin, to see in these quotations evidence that the sacred writers
          were insistent upon the substance of the truth rather than upon the
          form, the spirit rather than the letter.

          (b) Where an apparently false translation is quoted from the
          Septuagint, the sanction of inspiration is given to it, as expressing
          a part at least of the fulness of meaning contained in the divine
          original—a fulness of meaning which two varying translations do not in
          some cases exhaust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psa_4:4—Heb.: “Tremble, and sin not” (= no longer); LXX: “Be ye angry,
          and sin not.” Eph_4:26 quotes the LXX. The words may originally have
          been addressed to David’s comrades, exhorting them to keep their anger
          within bounds. Both translations together are needed to bring out the
          meaning of the original. Psa_40:6-8—“Mine ears hast thou opened” is
          translated in Heb_10:5-7—“a body didst thou prepare for me.” Here the
          Epistle quotes from the LXX. But the Hebrew means literally: “Mine
          ears hast thou bored”—an allusion to the custom of pinning a slave to
          the doorpost of his master by an awl driven through his ear, in token
          of his complete subjection. The sense of the verse is therefore given
          in the Epistle: “Thou hast made me thine in body and soul—lo, I come
          to do thy will” A. C. Kendrick: “David, just entering upon his kingdom
          after persecution, is a type of Christ entering on his earthly
          mission. Hence David’s words are put into the mouth of Christ. For
          ‘ears,’ the organs with which we hear and obey and which David
          conceived to be hollowed out for him by God, the author of the Hebrews
          substitutes the word ‘body,’ as the general instrument of doing God’s
          will” (Com. on Heb_10:5-7).
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The freedom of these inspired interpretations, however, does not
          warrant us in like freedom of interpretation in the case of other
          passages whose meaning has not been authoritatively made known.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no reason to believe that the scarlet thread of Rahab
          (Jos_2:18) was a designed prefiguration of the blood of Christ, nor
          that the three measures of meal in which the woman hid her leaven
          (Mat_13:33) symbolized Shem, Ham and Japheth, the three divisions of
          the human race. C. H. M., in his notes on the tabernacle in Exodus,
          tells us that “the loops of blue = heavenly grace; the taches of gold
          = the divine energy of Christ; the rams’ skins dyed red—Christ’s
          consecration and devotedness; the badgers’ skins—his holy vigilance
          against temptation”! The tabernacle was indeed a type of Christ
          (Joh_1:14—ἐσκήνωσεν. Joh_2:19; Joh_2:21—“in three days I will raise it
          up.…but he spake of the temple of his body”); yet it does not follow
          that every detail of the structure was significant. So each parable
          teaches some one main lesson,—the particulars may be mere drapery; and
          while we may use the parables for illustration, we should never
          ascribe divine authority to our private impressions of their meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mat_25:1-13—the parable of the five wise and the five foolish
          virgins—has been made to teach that the number of the saved precisely
          equals the number of the lost. Augustine defended persecution from the
          words in Luk_14:23—“constrain them to come in.” The Inquisition was
          justified by Mat_13:30—“bind them in bundles to burn them.” Innocent
          III denied the Scriptures to the laity, quoting Heb_12:20—“If even a
          beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.” A Plymouth Brother held
          that he would be safe on an evangelizing journey because he read in
          Joh_19:36—“A bone of him shall not be broken.” Mat_17:8—“they saw no
          one, save Jeses only”—has been held to mean that we should trust only
          Jesus. The Epistle of Barnabas discovered in Abraham’s 318 servants a
          prediction of the crucified Jesus, and others have seen in Abraham’s
          three days’ journey to Mount Moriah the three stages in the
          development of the soul. Clement of Alexandria finds the four natural
          elements in the four colors of the Jewish Tabernacle. All this is to
          make a parable “run on all fours.” While we call a hero a lion, we do
          not need to find in the man something’ to correspond to the lion’s
          mane and claws. See Toy, Quotations in the N. T.; Franklin Johnson,
          Quotations of the N. T. from the O. T.; Crooker, The New Bible and its
          New Uses, 126–136.

          (d) While we do not grant that the New Testament writers in any proper
          sense misquoted or misinterpreted the Old Testament, we do not regard
          absolute correctness in these respects as essential to their
          inspiration. The inspiring Spirit may have communicated truth, and may
          have secured in the Scriptures as a whole a record of that truth
          sufficient for men’s moral and religious needs, without imparting
          perfect gifts of scholarship or exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          In answer to Toy, Quotations in the N. T., who takes a generally
          unfavorable view of the correctness of the N. T. writers, Johnson,
          Quotations of the N. T. from the O. T., maintains their correctness.
          On pages x, xi, of his Introduction, Johnson remarks: “I think it just
          to regard the writers of the Bible as the creators of a great
          literature, and to judge and interpret them by the laws of literature.
          They have produced all the chief forms of literature, as history,
          biography, anecdote, proverb, oratory, allegory, poetry, fiction. They
          have needed therefore all the resources of human speech, its sobriety
          and scientific precision on one page, its rainbow hues of fancy and
          imagination on another, its fires of passion on yet another. They
          could not have moved and guided men in the best manner had they denied
          themselves the utmost force and freedom of language; had they refused
          to employ its wide range of expressions, whether exact or poetic; had
          they not borrowed without stint its many forms of reason, of terror,
          of rapture, of hope, of joy, of peace. So also, they have needed the
          usual freedom of literary allusion and citation, in order to commend
          the gospel to the judgment, the tastes, and the feelings of their
          readers.”

        <p>6. Errors in Prophecy.</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such may frequently be explained by
          remembering that much of prophecy is yet unfulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sometimes taken for granted that the book of Revelation, for
          example, refers entirely to events already past. Moses Stuart, in his
          Commentary, and Warren’s Parousia, represent this preterist
          interpretation. Thus judged, however, many of the predictions of the
          book might seem to have failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The personal surmises of the prophets as to the meaning of the
          prophecies they recorded may have been incorrect, while yet the
          prophecies themselves are inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1Pe_1:10-11, the apostle declares that the prophets searched “what
          time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
          point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
          the glories that should follow them.” So Paul, although he does not
          announce it as certain, seems to have had some hope that he might live
          to witness Christ’s second coming. See 2Co_5:4—“not for that we would
          be unclothed, but that we would be olothed upon” (ἐπενδύσασθαι—put on
          the spiritual body, as over the present one, without the intervention
          of death); 1Th_4:15; 1Th_4:17—“we that are alive, that are left unto
          the coming of the Lord.” So Mat_2:15 quotes from Hos_11:1—“Out of
          Egypt did I call my son,” and applies the prophecy to Christ, although
          Hosea was doubtless thinking only of the exodus of the people of
          Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The prophet’s earlier utterances are not to be severed from the
          later utterances which elucidate them, nor from the whole revelation
          of which they form a part. It is unjust to forbid the prophet to
          explain his own meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Thessalonians was written expressly to correct wrong inferences as
          to the apostle’s teaching drawn from his peculiar mode of speaking in
          the first epistle. In 2Th_2:2-5 he removes the impression “that the
          day of the Lord is now present” or “just at hand”; declares that “it
          will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be
          revealed”; reminds the Thessalonians: “when I was yet with you, I told
          you these things.” Yet still, in verse 1, he speaks of “the coming of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These passages, taken together, show: (1) that the two epistles are
          one in their teaching; (2) that in neither epistle is there any
          prediction of the immediate coming of the Lord; (3) that in the second
          epistle great events are foretold as intervening before that coming;
          (4) that while Paul never taught that Christ would come during his own
          lifetime, he hoped at least during the earlier part of his life that
          it might be so—a hope that seems to have been dissipated in his later
          years. (See 2Ti_4:6—“I am already being offered, and the time of my
          departure is come.”) We must remember, however, that there was a
          “coming of the Lord” in the destruction of Jerusalem within three or
          four years of Paul’s death. Henry Van Dyke: “The point of Paul’s
          teaching in 1 and 2 Thess. is not that Christ is coming to-morrow, but
          that he is surely coming.” The absence of perspective in prophecy may
          explain Paul’s not at first defining the precise time of the end, and
          so leaving it to be misunderstood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second Epistle to the Thessalonians, therefore, only makes more
          plain the meaning of the first, and adds new items of prediction. It
          is important to recognize in Paul’s epistles a progress in prophecy,
          in doctrine, in church polity. The full statement of the truth was
          gradually drawn out, under the influence of the Spirit, upon occasion
          of successive outward demands and inward experiences. Much is to be
          learned by studying the chronological order of Paul’s epistles, as
          well as of the other N. T. books. For evidence of similar progress in
          the epistles of Peter, compare 1Pe_4:7 with 2Pe_3:4 sq.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The character of prophecy as a rough general sketch of the future,
          in highly figurative language, and without historical perspective,
          renders it peculiarly probable that what at first sight seem to be
          errors are due to a misinterpretation on our part, which confounds the
          drapery with the substance, or applies its language to events to which
          it had no reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jam_5:9 and Php_4:5 are instances of that large prophetic speech which
          regards the distant future as near at hand, because so certain to the
          faith and hope of the church. Sanday, Inspiration, 376–378—“No doubt
          the Christians of the Apostolic age did live in immediate expectation
          of the Second Coming, and that expectation culminated at the crisis in
          which the Apocalypse was written. In the Apocalypse, as in every
          predictive prophecy, there is a double element, one part derived from
          the circumstances of the present and another pointing forwards to the
          future.…All these things, in an exact and literal sense have fallen
          through with the postponement of that great event in which they
          centre. From the first they were but meant as the imaginative
          pictorial and symbolical clothing of that event. What measure of real
          fulfilment the Apocalypse may yet be destined to receive we cannot
          tell. But in predictive prophecy, even when most closely verified, the
          essence lies less in the prediction than in the eternal laws of moral
          and religious truth which the fact predicted reveals or exemplifies.”
          Thus we recognize both the divinity and the freedom of prophecy, and
          reject the rationalistic theory which would relate the fall of the
          Beaconsfield government in Matthew’s way: “That it might be fulfilled
          which was spoken by Cromwell, saying: ‘Get you gone, and make room for
          honest men!’ ” See the more full statement of the nature of prophecy,
          on pages 132–141. Also Bernard, Progress of Doctrine in the N. T.
        </p>
        <p>7. Certain books unworthy of a place in inspired Scripture.</p>
        <p>
          (a) This charge may be shown, in each single case, to rest upon a
          misapprehension of the aim and method of the book, and its connection
          with the remainder of the Bible, together with a narrowness of nature
          or of doctrinal view, which prevents the critic from appreciating the
          wants of the peculiar class of men to which the book is especially
          serviceable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luther called James “a right strawy epistle.” His constant pondering
          of the doctrine of justification by faith alone made it difficult for
          him to grasp the complementary truth that we are justified only by
          such faith as brings forth good works, or to perceive the essential
          agreement of James and Paul. Prof. R. E. Thompson, in S. S. Times,
          Dec. 3, 1898:803, 804—“Luther refused canonical authority to books not
          actually written by apostles or composed (as Mark and Luke) under
          their direction. So he rejected from the rank of canonical authority
          Hebrews, James, Jude, 2 Peter, Revelation. Even Calvin doubted the
          Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, excluded the book of Revelation from
          the Scripture on which he wrote Commentaries, and also thus ignored 2
          and 3 John.” G. P. Fisher in S. S. Times, Aug. 29, 1891—“Luther, in
          his preface to the N. T. (Edition of 1522), gives a list of what he
          considers as the principal books of the N. T. These are John’s Gospel
          and First Epistle, Paul’s Epistles, especially Romans and Galatians,
          and Peter’s First Epistle. Then he adds that ‘St. James’ Epistle is a
          right strawy Epistle compared with them’—‘ein recht strohern Epistel
          gegen sie,’ thus characterizing it not absolutely but only
          relatively.” Zwingle even said of the Apocalypse: “It is not a
          Biblical book.” So Thomas Arnold, with his exaggerated love for
          historical accuracy and definite outline, found the Oriental imagery
          and sweeping visions of the book of Revelation so bizarre and
          distasteful that he doubted their divine authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The testimony of church history and general Christian experience
          to the profitableness and divinity of the disputed books is of greater
          weight than the personal impressions of the few who criticize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instance the testimonies of the ages of persecution to the worth of
          the prophecies, which assure God’s people that his cause shall surely
          triumph. Denney, Studies in Theology, 226—“It is at least as likely
          that the individual should be insensible to the divine message in a
          book, as that the church should have judged it to contain such a
          message if it did not do so.” Milton, Areopagitica: “The Bible brings
          in holiest men passionately murmering against Providence through all
          the arguments of Epicurus.” Bruce, Apologetics, 329—“O. T. religion
          was querulous, vindictive, philolevitical, hostile toward foreigners,
          morbidly self-conscious, and tending to self-righteousness.
          Ecclesiastes shows us how we ought not to feel. To go about crying
          Vanitas! is to miss the lesson it was meant to teach, namely, that the
          Old Covenant was vanity—proved to be vanity by allowing a son of the
          Covenant to get into so despairing a mood.” Chadwick says that
          Ecclesiastes got into the Canon only after it had received an orthodox
          postscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:193—“Slavish fear and self-righteous
          reckoning with God are the unlovely features of this Jewish religion
          of law to which the ethical idealism of the prophets had degenerated,
          and these traits strike us most visibly in Pharsiaism.…It was this
          side of the O. T. religion to which Christianity took a critical and
          destroying attitude, while it revealed a new and higher knowledge of
          God. For, says Paul, ‘ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto
          fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption’ (Rom_8:15). In unity
          with God man does not lose his soul but preserves it. God not only
          commands but gives.” Ian Maclaren (John Watson), Cure of Souls,
          144—“When the book of Ecclesiastes is referred to the days of the
          third century b.c., then its note is caught, and any man who has been
          wronged and embittered by political tyranny and social corruption has
          his bitter cry included in the book of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Such testimony can be adduced in favor of the value of each one of
          the books to which exception is taken, such as Esther, Job, Song of
          Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Jonah, James, Revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Esther is the book, next to the Pentateuch, held in highest reverence
          by the Jews. “Job was the discoverer of infinity, and the first to see
          the bearing of infinity on righteousness. It was the return of
          religion to nature. Job heard the voice beyond the Sinai-voice”
          (Shadow-Cross, 89). Inge, Christian Mysticism, 43—“As to the Song of
          Solomon, its influence upon Christian Mysticism has been simply
          deplorable. A graceful romance in honor of true love has been
          distorted into a precedent and sanction for giving way to hysterical
          emotions in which sexual imagery has been freely used to symbolize the
          relation between the soul and its Lord.” Chadwick says that the Song
          of Solomon got into the Canon only after it had received an
          allegorical interpretation. Gladden, Seven Puzzling Bible Books, 165,
          thinks it impossible that “the addition of one more inmate to the
          harem of that royal rake, King Solomon, should have been made the type
          of the spiritual affection between Christ and his church. Instead of
          this, the book is a glorification of pure love. The Shulamite,
          transported to the court of Solomon, remains faithful to her shepherd
          lover, and is restored to him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bruce, Apologetics, 321—“The Song of Solomon, literally interpreted as
          a story of true love, proof against the blandishments of the royal
          harem, is rightfully in the Canon as a buttress to the true religion;
          for whatever made for purity in the relations of the sexes made for
          the worship of Jehovah—Baal worship and impurity being closely
          associated.” Rutherford, McCheyne, and Spurgeon have taken more texts
          from the Song of Solomon than from any other portion of Scripture of
          like extent. Charles G. Finney, Autobiography, 378—“At this time it
          seemed as if my soul was wedded to Christ in a sense which I never had
          any thought or conception of before. The language of the Song of
          Solomon was as natural to me as my breath. I thought I could
          understand well the state he was in when he wrote that Song, and
          concluded then, as I have ever thought since, that that Song was
          written by him after he had been reclaimed from his great backsliding.
          I not only had all the fulness of my first love, but a vast accession
          to it. Indeed, the Lord lifted me up so much above anything that I had
          experienced before, and taught me so much of the meaning of the Bible,
          of Christ’s relations and power and willingness, that I found myself
          saying to him: I had not known or conceived that any such thing was
          true.” On Jonah, see R. W. Dale, in Expositor, July, 1892, advocating
          the non-historical and allegorical character of the book. Bib. Sac.,
          10:737–764—“Jonah represents the nation of Israel as emerging through
          a miracle from the exile, in order to carry out its mission to the
          world at large. It teaches that God is the God of the whole earth;
          that the Ninevites as well as the Israelites are dear to him; that his
          threatenings of penalty are conditional.”

          (a) In the case of books made up from preëxisting documents,
          inspiration simply preserved the compilers of them from selecting
          inadequate or improper material. The fact of such compilation does not
          impugn their value as records of a divine revelation, since these
          books supplement each other’s deficiencies and together are sufficient
          for man’s religious needs.

          Luke distinctly informs us that he secured the materials for his
          gospel from the reports of others who were eye-witnesses of the events
          he recorded (Luk_1:1-4). The book of Genesis bears marks of having
          incorporated documents of earlier times. The account of creation which
          begins with Gen_2:4 is evidently written by a different hand from that
          which penned 1:1–31 and 2:1–30. Instances of the same sort may be
          found in the books of Chronicles. In like manner, Marshall’s Life of
          Washington incorporates documents by other writers. By thus
          incorporating them, Marshall vouches for their truth. See Bible Com.,

          Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theology, 1:243—“Luther ascribes to faith critical
          authority with reference to the Canon. He denies the canonicity of
          James, without regarding it as spurious. So of Hebrews and Revelation,
          though later, in 1545, he passed a more favorable judgment upon the
          latter. He even says of a proof adduced by Paul in Galatians that it
          is too weak to hold. He allows that in external matters not only
          Stephen but even the sacred authors contain inaccuracies. The
          authority of the O. T. does not seem to him invalidated by the
          admission that several of its writings have passed through revising
          hands. What would it matter, he asks, if Moses did not write the
          Pentateuch? The prophets studied Moses and one another. If they built
          in much wood, hay and stubble along with the rest, still the
          foundation abides; the fire of the great day shall consume the former;
          for in this manner do we treat the writings of Augustine and others.
          Kings is far more to be believed than Chronicles. Ecclesiastes is
          forged and cannot come from Solomon. Esther is not canonical. The
          church may have erred in adopting a book into the Canon. Faith first
          requires proof. Hence he ejects the Apocryphal books of the O. T. from
          the Canon. So some parts of the N. T. receive only a secondary,
          deuterocanonical position. There is a difference between the word of
          God and the holy Scriptures, not merely in reference to the form, but
          also in reference to the subject matter.”

          (b) In the case of additions to Scripture books by later writers, it
          is reasonable to suppose that the additions, as well as the originals,
          were made by inspiration, and no essential truth is sacrificed by
          allowing the whole to go under the name of the chief author.

          Mar_16:9-20 appears to have been added by a later hand (see English
          Revised Version). The Eng. Rev. Vers. also brackets or segregates a
          part of verse 3 and the whole of verse 4 in Joh_5:1-47 (the moving of
          the water by the angel), and the whole passage Joh_7:53; Joh_8:1-11
          (the woman taken in adultery). Westcott and Hort regard the latter
          passage as an interpolation, probably “Western” in its origin (so also
          Mar_16:9-20). Others regard it as authentic, though not written by
          John. The closing chapter of Deuteronomy was apparently added after
          Moses’ death—perhaps by Joshua. If criticism should prove other
          portions of the Pentateuch to have been composed after Moses’ time,
          the inspiration of the Pentateuch would not be invalidated, so long as
          Moses was its chief author or even the original source and founder of
          its legislation (Joh_5:46—“he wrote of me”). Gore, in Lux Mundi,
          355—“Deuteronomy may be a republication of the law, in the spirit and
          power of Moses, and put dramatically into his mouth.”

          At a spot near the Pool of Siloam, Manasseh is said to have ordered
          that Isaiah should be sawn asunder with a wooden saw. The prophet is
          again sawn asunder by the recent criticism. But his prophecy opens
          (Isa_1:1) with the statement that it was composed during a period
          which covered the reigns of four kings—Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and
          Hezekiah—nearly forty years. In so long a time the style of a writer
          greatly changes. Chapters 40–66 may have been written in Isaiah’s
          later age, after he had retired from public life. Compare the change
          in the style of Zechariah, John and Paul, with that in Thomas Carlyle
          and George William Curtis. On Isaiah, see Smyth, Prophecy a
          Preparation for Christ; Bib. Sac., Apr. 1881:230–253; also July, 1881;

          For the view that there were two Isaiahs, see George Adam Smith, Com.
          on Isa_2:1-22 : Isaiah flourished b.c. 740–700. The last 27 chapters
          deal with the captivity (598–538) and with Cyrus (550), whom they
          name. The book is not one continuous prophecy, but a number of
          separate orations. Some of these claim to be Isaiah’s own, and have
          titles, such as “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz” (1:1); “The
          word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw” (2:1). But such titles describe
          only the individual prophecies they head. Other portions of the book,
          on other subjects and in different styles, have no titles at all.
          Chapters 40–66 do not claim to be his. There are nine citations in the
          N. T. from the disputed chapters, but none by our Lord. None of these
          citations were given in answer to the question: Did Isaiah write
          chapters 44–66? Isaiah’s name is mentioned only for the sake of
          reference. Chapters 44–66 set forth the exile and captivity as already
          having taken place. Israel is addressed as ready for deliverance.
          Cyrus is named as deliverer. There is no grammar of the future like
          Jeremiah’s. Cyrus is pointed out as proof that former prophecies of
          deliverance are at last coming to pass. He is not presented as a
          prediction, but as a proof that prediction is being fulfilled. The
          prophet could not have referred the heathen to Cyrus as proof that
          prophecy had been fulfilled, had he not been visible to them in all
          his weight of war. Babylon has still to fall before the exiles can go
          free. But chapters 40–66 speak of the coining of Cyrus as past, and of
          the fall of Babylon as yet to come. Why not use the prophetic perfect
          of both, if both were yet future? Local color, language and thought
          are all consistent with exilic authorship. All suits the exile, but
          all is foreign to the subjects and methods of Isaiah, for example, the
          use of the terms righteous and righteousness. Calvin admits exilic
          authorship (on Isa_55:3). The passage Isa_56:9-12, however, is an
          exception and is preëxilic. Isa_40:1-31; Isa_41:1-29; Isa_42:1-25;
          Isa_43:1-28; Isa_44:1-28; Isa_45:1-25; Isa_46:1-13; Isa_47:1-15;
          Isa_48:1-22 are certainly by one hand, and may be dated 555–538. 2nd
          Isaiah is not a unity, but consists of a number of pieces written
          before, during, and after the exile, to comfort the people of God.

          (c) It is unjust to deny to inspired Scripture the right exercised by
          all historians of introducing certain documents and sayings as simply
          historical, while their complete truthfulness is neither vouched for
          nor denied.

        <p>
          An instance in point is the letter of Claudius Lysias in
          Act_23:26-30—a letter which represents his conduct in a more favorable
          light than the facts would justify—for he had not learned that Paul
          was a Roman when he rescued him in the temple (Act_21:31-33;
          Act_22:26-29). An incorrect statement may be correctly reported. A set
          of pamphlets printed in the time of the French Revolution might be
          made an appendix to some history of France without implying that the
          historian vouched for their truth. The sacred historians may similarly
          have been inspired to use only the material within their reach,
          leaving their readers by comparison with other Scriptures to judge of
          its truthfulness and value. This seems to have been the method adopted
          by the compiler of 1 and 2 Chronicles. The moral and religious lessons
          of the history are patent, even though there is inaccuracy in
          reporting some of the facts. So the assertions of the authors of the
          Psalms cannot be taken for absolute truth. The authors were not
          sinless models for the Christian,—only Christ is that. But the Psalms
          present us with a record of the actual experience of believers in the
          past. It has its human weakness, but we can profit by it, even though
          it expresses itself at times in imprecations. Jer_20:7—“O Lord, thou
          hast deceived me”—may possibly be thus explained.

        <p>
          (a) Descriptions of human experience may be embraced in Scripture, not
          as models for imitation, but as illustrations of the doubts,
          struggles, and needs of the soul. In these cases inspiration may
          vouch, not for the correctness of the views expressed by those who
          thus describe their mental history, but only for the correspondence of
          the description with actual fact, and for its usefulness as indirectly
          teaching important moral lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book of Ecclesiastes, for example, is the record of the mental
          struggles of a soul seeking satisfaction without God. If written by
          Solomon during the time of his religious declension, or near the close
          of it, it would constitute a most valuable commentary upon the
          inspired history. Yet it might be equally valuable, though composed by
          some later writer under divine dlirection and inspiration. H. P.
          Smith, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 97—“To suppose Solomon the
          author of Ecclesiastes is like supposing Spenser to have written In
          Memoriam.” Luther, Keil, Delitzsch, Ginsburg, Hengstenberg all declare
          it to be a production of later times (330 b.c.). The book shows
          experience of misgovernment. An earlier writer cannot write in the
          style of a later one, though the later can imitate the earlier. The
          early Latin and Greek Fathers quoted the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon
          as by Solomon; see Plumptre, Introd. to Ecclesiastes, in Cambridge
          Bible. Gore, in Lux Mundi, 355—“Ecclesiastes, though like the book of
          Wisdom purporting to be by Solomon, may be by another author.…‘A pious
          fraud’ cannot be inspired; an idealizing personification, as a normal
          type of literature, can be inspired.” Yet Bernhard Schäfer, Das Buch
          Koheleth, ably maintains the Solomonic authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Moral truth may be put by Scripture writers into parabolic or
          dramatic form, and the sayings of Satan and of perverse men may form
          parts of such production. In such cases, inspiration may vouch, not
          for the historical truth, much less for the moral truth of each
          seperate statement, but only for the correspondence of the whole with
          ideal fact; in other words, inspiration may guarantee that the story
          is true to nature, and is valuable as conveying divine instruction.

          It is not necessary to suppose that the poetical speeches of Job’s
          friends were actually delivered in the words that have come down to
          us. Though Job never had a historical existance, the book would still
          be of the utmost value, and would convey to us a vast amount of true
          teaching with regard to the dealings of God and the problem of evil.
          Fact is local; truth is universal. Some novels contain more truth can
          be found in some histories. Other books of Scripture, however, assure
          us that Job was an actual historical character (Exo_14:14; Jam_5:11).
          Nor is it necessary to suppose that our Lord, in telling the parable
          of the Prodigal Son (Luk_15:11-32) or that of the Unjust Steward
          (Luk_16:1-8), had in mind actual persons of whom each parable was an
          exact description.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fiction is not an unworthy vehicle of spiritual truth. Parable, and
          even fable, may convey valuable lessons. In Jdg_9:14-15, the trees,
          the vine, the bramble, all talk. If truth can be transmitted in myth
          and legend, surely God may make use of these methods of communicating
          it, and even though Gen_1:1-31; Gen_2:1-25; Gen_3:1-24 were mythical
          it might still be inspired. Aristotle said that poetry is truer than
          history. The latter only tells us that certain things happened. Poetry
          presents to us the permanent passions, aspirations and deeds of men
          which are behind all history and which make it what it is; see Dewey,
          Psychology, 197. Though Job were a drama and Jonah an apologue, both
          might be inspired. David Copperfleld, the Apology of Socrates, Fra
          Lippo Lippi, were not the authors of the productions which bear their
          names, but Dickens, Plato and Browning, rather. Impersonation is a
          proper method in literature. The speeches of Herodotus and Thucydides
          might be analogues to those in Deuteronomy and in the Acts, and yet
          these last might be inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book of Job could not have been written in patriarchal times.
          Walled cities, kings, courts, lawsuits, prisons, stocks, mining
          enterprises, are found in it. Judges are bribed by the rich to decide
          against the poor. All this belongs to the latter years of the Jewish
          Kingdom. Is then the book of Job all a lie? No more than Bunyan’s
          Pilgrim’s Progress and the parable of the Good Samaritan are all a
          lie. The book of Job is a dramatic poem. Like Macbeth or the Ring and
          the Book, it is founded in fact. H. P. Smith, Biblical Scholarship and
          Inspiration, 101—“The value of the book of Job lies in the spectacle
          of a human soul in its direst affliction working through its doubts,
          and at last humbly confessing its weakness and sinfulness in the
          presence of its Maker. The inerrancy is not in Job’s words or in those
          of his friends, but in the truth of the picture presented. If
          Jehovah’s words at the end of the book are true, then the first
          thirty-five chapters are not infallible teaching.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Gore, in Lux Mundi, 355, suggests in a similar manner that the books
          of Jonah and of Daniel may be dramatic compositions worked up upon a
          basis of history. George Adam Smith, in the Expositors’ Bible, tells
          us that Jonah flourished 780 b.c., in the reign of Jeroboam II.
          Nineveh fell in 606. The book implies that it was written after this
          (3:3—“Nineveh was an exceeding great city”). The book does not claim
          to be written by Jonah, by an eye-witness, or by a contemporary. The
          language has Aramaic forms. The date is probably 300 b.c., There is an
          absence of precise data, such as the sin of Nineveh, the journey of
          the prophet thither, the place where he was cast out on land, the name
          of the Assyrian king. The book illustrates God’s mission of prophecy
          to the Gentiles, his care for them, their susceptibility to his word.
          Israel flies from duty, but is delivered to carry salvation to the
          heathen. Jeremiah had represented Israel as swallowed up and cast out
          (Jer_51:34; Jer_51:44 sq.—“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath
          devoured me..…he hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled
          his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out..…I will bring forth
          out of his month that which he hath swallowed up.” Some tradition of
          Jonah’s proclaiming doom to Nineveh may have furnished the basis of
          the apologue. Our Lord uses the story as a mere illustration, like the
          homiletic use of Shakespeare’s dramas. “As Macbeth did,” “As Hamlet
          said,” do not commit us to the historical reality of Macbeth or of
          Hamlet. Jesus may say as to questions of criticism: “Man, who made me
          a judge or a divider over you?” “I came not to judge the world, but to
          save the world” (Luk_12:14; Joh_12:47). He had no thought of
          confirming, or of not confirming, the historic character of the story.
          It is hard to conceive the compilation of a psalm by a man in Jonah’s
          position. It is not the prayer of one inside the fish, but of one
          already saved. More than forty years ago President Woolsey of Yale
          conceded that the book of Jonah was probably an apologue.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) In none of these cases ought the difficulty of distinguishing
          man’s words from God’s words, or ideal truth from actual truth, to
          prevent our acceptance of the fact of inspiration; for in this very
          variety of the Bible, combined with the stimulus it gives to inquiry
          and the general plainness of its lessons, we have the very
          characteristics we should expect in a book whose authorship was
          divine.

          The Scripture is a stream in which “the lamb may wade and the elephant
          may swim.” There is need both of literary sense and of spiritual
          insight to interpret it. This sense and this insight can be given only
          by the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, who inspired the various
          writings to witness of him in various ways, and who is present in the
          world to take of the things of Christ and show them to us (Mat_28:20;
          Joh_16:13-14). In a subordinate sense the Holy Spirit inspires us to
          recognize inspiration in the Bible. In the sense here suggested we may
          assent to the words of Dr. Charles H. Parkburst at the inauguration of
          William Adams Brown as Professor of Systematic Theology in the Union
          Theological Seminary, November 1,1898—“Unfortunately we have condemned
          the word ‘inspiration’ to a particular and isolated field of divine
          operation, and it is a trespass upon current usage to employ it in the
          full urgency of its Scriptural intent in connection with work like
          your own or mine. But the word voices a reality that lies so close to
          the heart of the entire Christian matter that we can ill afford to
          relegate it to any single or technical function. Just as much to-day
          as back at the first beginnings of Christianity, those who would
          declare the truths of God must be inspired to behold the truths of
          God.…The only irresistible persuasiveness is that which is born of
          vision, and it is not vision to be able merely to describe what some
          seer has seen, though it were Moses or Paul that was the seer.”

          10. Acknowledgment of the non-inspiration of Scripture teachers and
          their writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charge rests mainly upon the misinterpretation of two particular
          passages:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Act_23:5 (“I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest”) may
          be explained either as the language of indignant irony: “I would not
          recognize such a man as high priest”; or, more naturally, an actual
          confession of personal ignorance and fallibility, which does not
          affect the inspiration of any of Paul’s final teachings or writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of a more reprehensible sort was Peter’s dissimulation at Antioch, or
          practical disavowal of his convictions by separating or withdrawing
          himself from the Gentile Christians (Gal_2:11-13). Here was no public
          teaching, but the Influence of private example. But neither in this
          case, nor in that mentioned above, did God suffer the error to be a
          final one. Through the agency of Paul, the Holy Spirit set the matter
          right.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) 1Co_7:12; 1Co_7:10 (“I, not the Lord”; “not I, but the Lord”).
          Here the contrast is not between the apostle inspired and the apostle
          uninspired, but between the apostle’s words and an actual saying of
          our Lord, as in Mat_5:32; Mat_19:3-10; Mat_19:3-10; Luk_16:18 (Stanley
          on Corinthians). The expressions may be paraphrased:—“With regard to
          this matter no express command was given by Christ before his
          ascension. As one inspired by Christ, however, I give you my command.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Meyer on 1Co_7:10—“Paul distinguishes, therefore, here and in verses
          1Co_7:12; 1Co_7:25, not between his own and inspired commands, but
          between those which proceeded from his own (God-inspired) subjectivity
          and those which Christ himself supplied by his objective word.” “Paul
          knew from the living voice of tradition what commands Christ had given
          concerning divorce.” Or if it should be maintained that Paul here
          disclaims inspiration,—a supposition contradicted by the following
          δοκῶ—“I think that I also have the Spirit of God” (verse 1Co_7:40),—it
          only proves a single exception to his inspiration, and since it is
          expressly mentioned, and mentioned only once, it implies the
          inspiration of all the rest of his writings. We might illustrate
          Paul’s method, if this were the case, by the course of the New York
          Herald when it was first published. Other journals had stood by their
          own mistakes and had never been willing to acknowledge error. The
          Herald gained the confidence of the public by correcting every mistake
          of its reporters. The result was that, when there was no confession of
          error, the paper was regarded as absolutely trustworthy. So Paul’s one
          acknowledgment of non-inspiration might imply that in all other cases
          his words had divine authority. On Authority in Religion, see Wilfred
          Ward, in Hibbert Journal, July, 1903:677–692.
