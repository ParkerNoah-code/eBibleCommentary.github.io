        <h2>The Necessity of Verbal Revelation</h2>
        <p>FIRST QUESTION</p>
        <p><em>Was revelation by the word necessary? Affirmative.</em></p>
        <p>
          I. Since the word of God is the unique foundation (principium) of
          theology, its necessity is properly investigated at the very
          beginning: was it necessary for God to reveal himself to us by the
          word? or, was the word of God necessary? There have been in the past,
          and are also today, some who maintain that sufficient capacity for
          living well and happily resides in human nature, so that they regard
          any revelation from heaven as not only superfluous, but even as
          absurd. Since nature takes care of the needs of people just as it does
          those of other living creatures, so, they believe, reason, or the
          light of nature, is fully sufficient for the guidance of life and the
          pursuit of happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But the orthodox church has always believed very differently,
          declaring that the revelation of God's word is absolutely and simply
          necessary to humanity for salvation because [the word] is the seed
          which causes rebirth (I Peter 1:23), the lamp by which we are guided
          (Ps. 119:105), the food by which we are nourished (Heb. 5:13 -14), and
          the foundation upon which we depend (Eph.2:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The following evidence proves the above: (1) the supreme goodness
          of God, communicative of itself; since he has created mankind for
          himself, that is, for a supernatural end, and for a condition far
          happier than this earthly existence, he cannot be conceived as willing
          that they should lack in this respect, but he made clear to them by
          means of the word this very happiness and the way for obtaining it,
          which ["natural"] reason did not know. (2) The extreme blindness and
          corruption of people, who, although after sin still have some residual
          light for guidance in earthly and mundane affairs, yet in divine and
          heavenly matters which concern blessedness (felicitas) are so blind
          and depraved that they can neither know anything of the truth, nor
          perform anything of the good, except through the initiative of God (I
          Cor. 2:14; Eph.5:8). (3) Right reason, which teaches that God can be
          known and worshiped for salvation only through the light of God, just
          as the sun can be seen by us only through its own light (Ps. 36:10).
          Nor would impostors who have devised new religions have invented their
          conversations with divine beings or with angels, as Numa Pompilius did
          with the nymph Aegeria, or Mohammed with Gabriel, unless everybody was
          convinced that the correct form of worship of the divine being
          depended on his own revelation. Thus the common opinion of all
          nations, even of barbarians, is that for the welfare of humanity there
          is needed, besides that reason that they call the guide of life, some
          heavenly wisdom. This [conviction] gave rise to the various religions
          that are scattered about the globe. In this connection those who
          maintain that these religions are merely ingenious human schemes for
          uniting people in civic responsibilities are not to be believed. It
          will be granted that it is certain that many clever men have
          manipulated religion in order to instill reverence into the common
          people, as a means of keeping their spirits submissive, but they could
          never have accomplished this unless there was already inborn
          (ingenitus) in the human mind a sense of its own ignorance and
          helplessness, by which the more readily people were led astray by
          those vagabonds and quacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. A double appetite which is implanted in mankind by nature--the
          longing both for truth and for immortality--confirms this. The one
          desire is to know the truth; the other, to enjoy the highest good. As
          the intellect is brought to perfection by the contemplation of truth,
          the will is brought to perfection by the enjoyment of the good, of
          which the blessed life consists. Since it is impossible that these two
          appetites should be in vain, revelation, which makes evident, as
          nature cannot, both the primal truth and the highest good, and the
          path to both of them, was necessary. Finally, the glory of God and the
          salvation of mankind demand revelation, because the school of nature
          cannot lead us to the true God and to legitimate worship of him, nor
          can it disclose the plan (ratio) of salvation, by which people may
          escape from the wretchedness of sin to the state of perfect bliss
          which exists in union with God. The higher school of grace was
          therefore necessary, in which God teaches us true religion by his
          word, to establish us in the knowledge and worship of himself, and to
          lead us to the enjoyment of eternal salvation in communion with him,
          to which neither philosophy nor any human effort (ratio) can attain.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Granted that in the works of creation and providence God manifests
          himself clearly, so that "what can be known about God is plain to them
          [men]" and his invisible nature has been clearly perceived from the
          creation of the world (Rom. 1:19 - 20), this real revelation cannot
          suffice for salvation after sin, not only in the subjective sense,
          because it has not, as an accompaniment, the power of the Spirit, by
          which human blindness and evil are corrected; but also in the
          objective sense, because it contains nothing concerning the mysteries
          of salvation, and God's mercy in Christ, without whom there is no
          salvation (Acts 4:12). What can be known about God is indeed
          presented, but not what is to be believed. God is known from the work
          of creation as creator, but not as redeemer; his power and divinity,
          that is, the existence of the divine being (numen) and his unlimited
          power (virtus) [are known], but not his grace and saving mercy. It was
          therefore necessary to make up the deficiency of the prior revelation,
          which, because of the sin that had been committed, was useless and
          inadequate, by another one, more splendid not only in degree but also
          in kind, that God might use not only a silent teacher, but also open
          his sacred mouth, that he could not only make known his more wonderful
          power, but also disclose the mystery of his will for our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Although natural theology deals with various matters concerning
          God and his properties, his will and his works, it does not, without
          the supernatural revelation of the word, teach us that understanding
          of God which can serve for salvation. It shows that God is and what he
          is like, both in unity of essence and in the nature of some
          attributes, but it does not show who he is, either in his personal
          unity (in individua) or with regard to the persons [of the Trinity].
          ["Natural revelation"] shows God's will with regard to the law,
          imperfectly and obscurely (Rom. 2:14-15), but the mystery of the
          gospel is entirely lacking in it. It proclaims the works of creation
          and providence (Ps.19; Acts 14:17; Rom. 1:19 - 20). But it does not
          rise to the works of redemption and grace, which can become known to
          us only by the word (Rom. 10:17; 16:25 - 26).
