        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          Although substantial unanimity as to the doctrine of inspiration has
          prevailed among the great historical Churches of Christendom, yet
          there has been no little diversity of opinion among theologians and
          philosophical writers. The theories are too numerous to be examined in
          detail. They may, perhaps, be advantageously referred to the following
          classes.
        </p>
        <p>A. Naturalistic Doctrine</p>
        <p>
          There is a large class of writers who deny any supernatural agency in
          the affairs of men. This general class includes writers who differ
          essentially in their views.
        </p>
        <p>
          First. There are those who, although Theists, hold the mechanical
          theory of the universe. That is, they hold that God having created the
          world, including all that it contains, organic and inorganic, rational
          and irrational, and having endowed matter with its properties and
          minds with their attributes, leaves it to itself. Just as a ship, when
          launched and equipped, is left to the winds and to its crew. This
          theory precludes the possibility not only of all miracles, prophecy,
          and supernatural revelation, but even of all providential government,
          whether general or special. Those who adopt this view of the relation
          of God to the world, must regard the Bible from beginning to end as a
          purely human production. They may rank it as the highest, or as among
          the lowest of the literary works of men; there is no possibility of
          its being inspired in any authorized sense of that word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. There are those who do not so entirely banish God from his
          works. They admit that He is everywhere present, and everywhere
          active; that his providential efficiency and control are exercised in
          the occurrence of all events. But they maintain that He always acts
          according to fixed laws; and always in connection and coöperation with
          second causes. According to this theory, also, all miracles and all
          prophecy, properly speaking, are excluded. A revelation is admitted,
          or at least, is possible. But it is merely providential. It consists
          in such an ordering of circumstances, and such a combination of
          influences as to secure the elevation of certain men to a higher level
          of religious knowledge than that attained by others. They may also, in
          a sense, be said to be inspired in so far as that inward, subjective
          state is purer, and more devout, as well as more intelligent than that
          of ordinary men. There is no specific difference, however, according
          to this theory, between inspired and uninspired men. It is only a
          matter of degrees. One is more and another less purified and
          enlightened. This theory also makes the Bible a purely human
          production. It confines revelation to the sphere of human knowledge.
          No possible degree of culture or development can get anything more
          than human out of man. According to the Scriptures, and to the faith
          of the Church, the Bible is a revelation of the things of God; of his
          thoughts and purposes. But who knoweth the things of God, asks the
          Apostle, but the Spirit of God? The things which the Bible purports to
          make known, are precisely those things which lie beyond the ken of the
          human mind. This theory, therefore, for bread gives us a stone; for
          the thoughts of God, the thoughts of man.
        </p>
        <p>Schleiermacher's Theory</p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. There is a theory far more pretentious and philosophical, and
          which of late years has widely prevailed, which in reality differs
          very little from the preceding. It agrees with it in the main point in
          that it denies anything supernatural in the origin or composition of
          the Bible. Schleiermacher, the author of this theory, was addicted to
          a philosophy which precluded all intervention of the immediate
          efficiency of God in the world. He admits, however, of two exceptions:
          the creation of man, and the constitution of the person of Christ.
          There was a supernatural intervention in the origin of our race, and
          in the manifestation of Christ. All else in the history of the world
          is natural. Of course there is nothing supernatural in the Bible;
          nothing in the Old Testament which the Adamic nature was not adequate
          to produce; and nothing in the New Testament, which Christianity, the
          life of the Church, a life common to all believers, is not sufficient
          to account for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Religion consists in feeling, and specifically in a feeling of
          absolute dependence (or an absolute feeling of dependence) i.e., the
          consciousness that the finite is nothing in the presence of the
          Infinite,—the individual in the presence of the universal. This
          consciousness involves the unity of the one and all, of God and man.
          "This system," says Dr. Ullmann, one of its more moderate and
          effective advocates, "is not absolutely new. We find it in another
          form in ancient Mysticism, especially in the German Mystics of the
          Middle Ages. With them, too, the ground and central point of
          Christianity is the oneness of Deity and humanity effected through the
          incarnation of God, and deification of man." Christianity, therefore,
          is not a system of doctrine; it is not, subjectively considered, a
          form of knowledge. It is a life. It is the life of Christ. Ullmann
          again says explicitly: "The life of Christ is Christianity." God in
          becoming man did not take upon himself, "a true body and a reasonable
          soul," but generic humanity; i.e., humanity as a generic life. The
          effect of the incarnation was to unite the human and divine as one
          life. And this life passes over to the Church precisely as the life of
          Adam passed over to his descendants, by a process of natural
          development. And this life is Christianity. Participation of this
          divine-human life makes a man a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian revelation consists in the providential dispensations
          connected with the appearance of Christ on the earth. The effect of
          these dispensations and events was the elevation of the religious
          consciousness of the men of that generation, and specially of those
          who came most directly under the influence of Christ. This subjective
          state, this excitement and elevation of their religious life, gave
          them intuitions of religious truths, "eternal verities." These
          intuitions were by the logical understanding clothed in the form of
          doctrines. This, however, was a gradual process as it was effected
          only by the Churchlife, i.e., by the working of the new divine-human
          life in the body of believers. Mr. Morell in expounding this theory,
          says:4 "The essential germ of the religious life is concentrated in
          the absolute feeling of dependence,—a feeling which implies nothing
          abject, but, on the contrary, a high and hallowed sense of our being
          inseparably related to Deity." On the preceding page he had said, "Let
          the subject become as nothing—not, indeed, from its intrinsic
          insignificance or incapacity of moral action, but by virtue of the
          infinity of the object to which it stands consciously opposed; and the
          feeling of dependence must become absolute; for all finite power is as
          nothing in relation to the Infinite."
        </p>
        <p>
          Christianity, as just stated, is the life of Christ, his human life,
          which is also divine, and is communicated to us as the life of Adam
          was communicated to his descendants. Morell, rather more in accordance
          with English modes of thought, says, "Christianity, like every other
          religion, consists essentially in a state of man's inner
          consciousness, which develops itself into a system of thought and
          activity only in a community of awakened minds; and it was inevitable,
          therefore, that such a state of consciousness should require time, and
          intercourse, and mutual sympathy, before it could become moulded into
          a decided and distinctive form." He represents the Apostles as often
          meeting together and deliberating on essential points, correcting each
          other's views; and, after years of such fellowship, Christianity was
          at last brought into form. Revelation is declared to be a
          communication of truth to our intuitional consciousness. The outward
          world is a revelation to our sense-intuitions; beauty is a revelation
          to our esthetic intuitions; and "eternal verities," when intuitively
          perceived, are said to be revealed; and this intuition is brought
          about by whatever purifies and exalts our religious feelings.
          "Revelation," says Morell, "is a process of the intuitional
          consciousness, gazing upon eternal verities; while theology is the
          reflection of the understanding upon those vital intuitions, so as to
          reduce them to a logical and scientific expression."
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspiration is the inward state of mind which enables us to apprehend
          the truth. "Revelation and inspiration," says Morell, "indicate one
          united process, the result of which upon the human mind is, to produce
          a state of spiritual intuition, whose phenomena are so extraordinary,
          that we at once separate the agency by which they are produced from
          any of the ordinary principles of human development. And yet this
          agency is applied in perfect consistency with the laws and natural
          operations of our spiritual nature. Inspiration does not imply
          anything generically new in the actual processes of the human mind; it
          does not involve any form of intelligence essentially different from
          what we already possess; it indicates rather the elevation of the
          religious consciousness, and with it, of course, the power of
          spiritual vision, to a degree of intensity peculiar to the individuals
          thus highly favoured of God." The only difference, therefore, between
          the Apostles and ordinary Christians is as to their relative holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this theory there is no specific difference between
          genius and inspiration. The difference is simply in the objects
          apprehended and the causes of the inward excitement to which the
          apprehension is due. "Genius," says Morell, "consists in the
          possession of a remarkable power of intuition with reference to some
          particular object, a power which arises from the inward nature of a
          man being brought into unusual harmony with that object in its reality
          and its operations." This is precisely his account of inspiration.
          "Let," he says, "there be a due purification of the moral nature,—a
          perfect harmony of the spiritual being with the mind of God,—a removal
          of all inward disturbances from the heart, and what is to prevent or
          disturb this immediate intuition of divine things."
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory of inspiration, while retaining its essential elements, is
          variously modified. With those who believe with Schleiermacher, that
          man "is the form in which God comes to conscious existence on our
          earth," it has one form. With Realists who define man to be "the
          manifestation of generic humanity in connection with a given corporeal
          organization;" and who believe that it was generic humanity which
          Christ took and united in one life with his divine nature, which life
          is communicated to the Church as his body, and thereby to all its
          members; it takes a somewhat different form. With those again who do
          not adopt either of these anthropological theories, but take the
          common view as to the constitution of man; it takes still a different,
          and in some respects, a lower, form. In all, however, inspiration is
          the intuition of divine truths due to the excitement of the religious
          nature, whatever that nature may be.
        </p>
        <p>Objections to Schleiermacher's Theory</p>
        <p>To this theory in all its forms it may be objected,—</p>
        <p>
          1. That it proceeds upon a wrong view of religion in general and of
          Christianity in particular. It assumes that religion is a feeling, a
          life. It denies that it is a form of knowledge, or involves the
          reception of any particular system of doctrine. In the subjective
          sense of the word, all religions (i.e., all religious doctrines) are
          true, as Twesten says, but all are not equally pure, or equally
          adequate expressions of the inward religious principle. According to
          the Scriptures, however, and the common conviction of Christians,
          religion (subjectively considered) is the reception of certain
          doctrines as true, and a state of heart and course of action in
          accordance with those doctrines. The Apostles propounded a certain
          system of doctrines; they pronounced those to be Christians who
          received those doctrines so as to determine their character and life.
          They pronounced those who rejected those doctrines, who refused to
          receive their testimony, as antichristian; as having no part or lot
          with the people of God. Christ's command was to teach; to convert the
          world by teaching. On this principle the Apostles acted and the Church
          has ever acted from that day to this. Those who deny Theism as a
          doctrine, are atheists. Those who reject Christianity as a system of
          doctrine, are unbelievers. They are not Christians. The Bible
          everywhere assumes that without truth there can be no holiness; that
          all conscious exercises of spiritual life are in view of truth
          objectively revealed in the Scriptures. And hence the importance
          everywhere attributed to knowledge, to truth, to sound doctrine, in
          the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This theory is inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine of
          revelation. According to the Bible, God presents truth objectively to
          the mind, whether by audible words, by visions, or by the immediate
          operations of his Spirit. According to this theory, revelation is
          merely the providential ordering of circumstances which awaken and
          exalt the religious feelings, and which thus enable the mind
          intuitively to apprehend the things of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It avowedly confines these intuitions, and of course revealed
          truth, to what are called "eternal verities." But the great body of
          truths revealed in Scripture are not "eternal verities." The fall of
          man; that all men are sinners; that the Redeemer from sin was to be of
          the seed of Abraham, and of the house of David; that He was to be born
          of a virgin, to be a man of sorrows; that He was crucified and buried;
          that He rose again the third day; that He ascended to heaven; that He
          is to come again without sin to salvation, although truths on which
          our salvation depends, are not intuitive truths; they are not truths
          which any exaltation of the religious consciousness would enable any
          man to discover of himself. 4. According to this theory the Bible has
          no normal authority as a rule of faith. It contains no doctrines
          revealed by God, and to be received as true on his testimony. It
          contains only the thoughts of holy men; the forms in which their
          understandings, without supernatural aid, clothed the "intuitions" due
          to their religious feelings. "The Bible," says Morell, "cannot in
          strict accuracy of language be termed a revelation, since a revelation
          always implies an actual process of intelligence in a living mind; but
          it contains the records in which those minds who enjoyed the
          preliminary training or the first brighter revelation of Christianity,
          have described the scenes which awakened their own religious nature to
          new life, and the high ideas and aspirations to which that new life
          gave origin." The Old Testament is the product of "the religious
          consciousness" of men who lived under a rude state of culture; and is
          of no authority for us. The New Testament is the product of "the
          religious consciousness" of men who had experienced the sanctifying
          influence of Christ's presence among them. But those men were Jews,
          they had Jewish modes of thinking. They were familiar with the
          services of the old dispensation; were accustomed to think of God as
          approachable only through a priesthood; as demanding expiation for
          sin, and regeneration of heart; and promising certain rewards and
          forms of blessedness in a future state of existence. It was natural
          for them, therefore, to clothe their "intuitions" in these Jewish
          modes of thought. We, in this nineteenth century, may clothe ours in
          very different forms, i.e., in very different doctrines, and yet "the
          eternal verities" be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different men carry this theory to very different lengths. Some have
          such an inward experience that they can find no form for expressing
          what they feel, so suitable as that given in the Bible, and therefore
          they believe all its great doctrines. But the ground of their faith is
          purely subjective. It is not the testimony of God given in his Word,
          but their own experience. They take what suits that, and reject the
          rest. Others with less Christian experience, or with no experience
          distinctively Christian, reject all the distinctive doctrines of
          Christianity, and adopt a form of religious philosophy which they are
          willing to call Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. That this theory is antiscriptural has already been said. The Bible
          makes revelation as therein contained to be the communication of
          doctrines to the understanding by the Spirit of God. It makes those
          truths or doctrines the immediate source of all right feeling. The
          feelings come from spiritual apprehension of the truth, and not the
          knowledge of truth from the feelings. Knowledge is necessary to all
          conscious holy exercises. Hence the Bible makes truth of the greatest
          importance. It pronounces those blessed who receive the doctrines
          which it teaches, and those accursed who reject them. It makes the
          salvation of men to depend upon their faith. This theory makes the
          creed of a man or of a people of comparatively little consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Church, therefore, Christianity has always been regarded as a
          system of doctrine. Those who believe these doctrines are Christians;
          those who reject them, are, in the judgment of the Church, infidels or
          heretics. If our faith be formal or speculative, so is our
          Christianity; if it be spiritual and living, so is our religion. But
          no mistake can be greater than to divorce religion from truth, and
          make Christianity a spirit or life distinct from the doctrines which
          the Scriptures present as the objects of faith.
        </p>
        <p>B. Gracious Inspiration</p>
        <p>
          This theory belongs to the category of natural or supernatural,
          according to the meaning assigned to those terms. By natural effects
          are commonly understood those brought about by natural causes under
          the providential control of God. Then the effects produced by the
          gracious operations of the Spirit, such as repentance, faith, love,
          and all other fruits of the Spirit, are supernatural. And consequently
          the theory which refers inspiration to the gracious influence of the
          Spirit, belongs to the class of the supernatural. But this word is
          often used in a more limited sense, to designate events which are
          produced by the immediate agency or volition of God without the
          intervention of any second cause. In this limited sense, creation,
          miracles, immediate revelation, regeneration (in the limited sense of
          that word), are supernatural. As the sanctification of men is carried
          on by the Spirit by the use of the means of grace, it is not a
          supernatural work, in the restricted sense of the term.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many theologians who do not adopt either of the
          philosophical theories of the nature of man and of his relation to
          God, above mentioned; and who receive the Scriptural doctrine as held
          by the Church universal, that the Holy Spirit renews, sanctifies,
          illuminates, guides, and teaches all the people of God; and yet who
          regard inspiration to be one of the ordinary fruits of the Spirit.
          Inspired and uninspired men are not distinguished by any specific
          difference. The sacred writers were merely holy men under the guidance
          of the ordinary influence of the Spirit. Some of those who adopt this
          theory extend it to revelation as well as to inspiration. Others admit
          a strictly supernatural revelation, but deny that the sacred writers
          in communicating the truths revealed were under any influence not
          common to ordinary believers. And as to those parts of the Bible (as
          the Hagiographa and Gospels), which contain no special revelations,
          they are to be regarded as the devotional writings or historical
          narratives of devout but fallible men. Thus Coleridge, who refers
          inspiration to that "grace and communion with the Spirit which the
          Church, under all circumstances, and every regenerate member of the
          Church, is permitted to hope and instructed to pray for;" makes an
          exception in favour of "the law and the prophets, no jot or tittle of
          which can pass unfulfilled." The remainder of the Bible, he holds, was
          written under the impulse and guidance of the gracious influence of
          the Spirit given to all Christian men. And his friends and followers,
          Dr. Arnold, Archdeacon Hare, and specially Maurice, ignore this
          distinction and refer the whole Bible "to an inspiration the same as
          what every believer enjoys."2 Thus Maurice says, "We must forego the
          demand which we make on the conscience of young men, when we compel
          them to declare that they regard the inspiration of the Bible as
          generically unlike that which God bestows on His children in this
          day."

        <p>
          Objections to the Doctrine that Inspiration is common to all Believers
        </p>
        <p>
          That this theory is anti-scriptural is obvious. 1. Because the Bible
          makes a marked distinction between those whom God chose to be his
          messengers, his prophets, his spokesmen, and other men. This theory
          ignores that distinction, so far as the people of God is concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is inconsistent with the authority claimed by these special
          messengers of God. They spoke in his name. God spoke through them.
          They said, "Thus saith the Lord," in a sense and way in which no
          ordinary believer dare use those words. It is inconsistent with the
          authority not only claimed by the sacred writers, but attributed to
          them by our Lord himself. He declared that the Scripture could not be
          broken; that it was infallible in all its teachings. The Apostles
          declare those anathema who did not receive their doctrines. This claim
          to divine authority in teaching was confirmed by God himself in signs,
          and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is inconsistent with the whole nature of the Bible, which is and
          professes to be a revelation of truths not only undiscoverable by
          human reason, but which no amount of holiness could enable the mind of
          man to perceive. This is true not only of the strictly prophetic
          revelations relating to the future, but also of all things concerning
          the mind and will of God. The doctrines of the Bible are called
          μυστήρια, things concealed, unknown and unknowable, except as revealed
          to the holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit. (Eph. 3:5.)
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is inconsistent with the faith of the Church universal, which
          has always made the broadest distinction between the writings of the
          inspired men and those of ordinary believers. Even Romanists, with all
          their reverence for the fathers, never presumed to place their
          writings on a level with the Scriptures. They do not attribute to them
          any authority but as witnesses of what the Apostles taught. If the
          Bible has no more authority than is due to the writings of pious men,
          then our faith is vain and we are yet in our sins. We have no sure
          foundation for our hopes of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>C. Partial Inspiration</p>
        <p>Under this head are included several different doctrines.</p>
        <p>
          1. Many hold that only some parts of Scripture are inspired, i.e.,
          that the writers of some books were supernaturally guided by the
          Spirit, and the writers of others were not. This, as mentioned above,
          was the doctrine of Coleridge, who admitted the inspiration of the Law
          and the Prophets, but denied that of the rest of the Bible. Others
          admit the New Testament to be inspired to an extent to which the Old
          was not. Others again hold the discourses of Christ to be infallible,
          but no other part of the sacred volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Others limit the inspiration of the sacred writers to their
          doctrinal teaching. The great object of their commission was to give a
          faithful record of the revealed will and purpose of God, to be a rule
          of faith and practice to the Church. In this they were under an
          influence which rendered them infallible as religious and moral
          teachers. But beyond these limits they were as liable to error as
          other men. That there should be scientific, historical, geographical
          mistakes; errors in the citation of passages, or in other unessential
          matters; or discrepancies as to matters of fact between the sacred
          writers, leaves their inspiration as religious teachers untouched.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Another form of the doctrine of partial, as opposed to plenary
          inspiration, limits it to the thoughts, as distinguished from the
          words of Scripture. Verbal inspiration is denied. It is assumed that
          the sacred writers selected the words they used without any guidance
          of the Spirit, to prevent their adopting improper or inadequate terms
          in which to express their thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A fourth form of the doctrine of partial inspiration was early
          introduced and has been widely adopted. Maimonides, the greatest of
          the Jewish doctors since the time of Christ, taught as early as the
          twelfth century that the sacred writers of the Old Testament enjoyed
          different degrees of divine guidance. He placed the inspiration of the
          Law much above that of the Prophets; and that of the Prophets higher
          than that of the Hagiographa. This idea of different degrees of
          inspiration was adopted by many theologians, and in England for a long
          time it was the common mode of representation. The idea was that the
          writers of Kings and Chronicles needed less, and that they received
          less of the divine assistance than Isaiah or St. John.
        </p>
        <p>
          In attempting to prove the doctrine of plenary inspiration the
          arguments which bear against all these forms of partial inspiration
          were given or suggested. The question is not an open one. It is not
          what theory is in itself most reasonable or plausible, but simply,
          What does the Bible teach on the subject? If our Lord and his Apostles
          declare the Old Testament to be the Word of God; that its authors
          spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; that what they said, the
          Spirit said; if they refer to the facts and to the very words of
          Scripture as of divine authority; and if the same infallible divine
          guidance was promised to the writers of the New Testament, and claimed
          by themselves; and if their claim was authenticated by God himself;
          then there is no room for, as there is no need of, these theories of
          partial inspiration. The whole Bible was written under such an
          influence as preserved its human authors from all error, and makes it
          for the Church the infallible rule of faith and practice.
