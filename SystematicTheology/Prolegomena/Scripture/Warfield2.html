          THE subject of the Inspiration of the Bible is one which has been much
          confused in recent discussion. He who, seeking to learn the truth,
          should gather about him the latest treatises, hearing such titles as,
          "Inspiration, and other Lectures," "Inspiration and the Bible," "What
          is Inspiration?" "How did God inspire the Bible?" "The Oracles of
          God?"<a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2"

          - would find himself led by them in every conceivable direction at
          once. No wonder if he should stand stockstill in the midst of his
          would-be guides, confounded by the Babel of voices. The old formula,
          quot homines tot sententiæ, seems no longer adequate. Wherever five
          "advanced thinkers" assemble, at least six theories as to inspiration
          are likely to be ventilated. They differ in every conceivable point,
          or in every conceivable point save one. They agree that inspiration is
          less pervasive and less determinative than has heretofore been
          thought, or than is still thought in less enlightened circles. They
          agree that there is less of the truth of God and more of the error of
          man in the Bible than Christians have been wont to believe. They agree
          accordingly that the teaching of the Bible may be, in this, that, or
          the other, - here, there, or elsewhere, - safely neglected or openly
          repudiated. So soon as we turn to the constructive side, however, and
          ask wherein the inspiration of the Bible consists; how far it
          guarantees the trustworthiness of the Bible's teaching; in what of its
          elements is the Bible a divinely safeguarded guide to truth: the
          concurrence ends and hopeless dissension sets in. They agree only in
          their common destructive attitude towards some higher view of the
          inspiration of the Bible, of the presence of which each one seems
          supremely conscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is upon this fact that we need first of all to fix our attention.
          It is not of the variegated hypotheses of his fellow-theorizers, but
          of some high doctrine of inspiration, the common object of attack of
          them all, that each new theorizer on the subject of inspiration is
          especially conscious, as standing over against him, with reference to
          which he is to orient himself, and against the claims of which he is
          to defend his new hypothesis. Thus they themselves introduce us to the
          fact that over against the numberless discordant theories of
          inspiration which vex our time, there stands a well-defined
          churchdoctrine of inspiration. This church-doctrine of inspiration
          differs from the theories that would fain supplant it, in that it is
          not the invention nor the property of an individual, but the settled
          faith of the universal church of God; in that it is not the growth of
          yesterday, but the assured persuasion of the people of God from the
          first planting of the church until today; in that it is not a protean
          shape, varying its affirmations to fit every new change in the
          evershifting thought of men, but from the beginning has been the
          church's constant and abiding conviction as to the divinity of the
          Scriptures committed to her keeping. It is certainly a most impressive
          fact, - this well-defined, aboriginal, stable doctrine of the church
          as to the nature and trustworthiness of the Scriptures of God, which
          confronts with its gentle but steady persistence of affirmation all
          the theories of inspiration which the restless energy of unbelieving
          and half-believing speculation has been able to invent in this
          agitated nineteenth century of ours. Surely the seeker after the truth
          in the matter of the inspiration of the Bible may well take this
          church-doctrine as his starting-point.
        </p>
        <p>
          What this church-doctrine is, it is scarcely necessary minutely to
          describe. It will suffice to remind ourselves that it looks upon the
          Bible as an oracular book, - as the Word of God in such a sense that
          whatever it says God says, - not a book, then, in which one may, by
          searching, find some word of God, but a book which may be frankly
          appealed to at any point with the assurance that whatever it may be
          found to say, that is the Word of God. We are all of us members in
          particular of the body of Christ which we call the church: and the
          life of the church, and the faith of the church, and the thought of
          the church are our natural heritage. We know how, as Christian men, we
          approach this Holy Book, - how unquestioningly we receive its
          statements of fact, bow before its enunciations of duty, tremble
          before its threatenings, and rest upon its promises. Or, if the subtle
          spirit of modern doubt has seeped somewhat into our hearts, our memory
          will easily recall those happier days when we stood a child at our
          Christian mother's knee, with lisping lips following the words which
          her slow finger traced upon this open page, - words which were her
          support in every trial and, as she fondly trusted, were to be our
          guide throughout life. Mother church was speaking to us in that
          maternal voice, commending to us her vital faith in the Word of God.
          How often since then has it been our own lot, in our turn, to speak to
          others all the words of this life! As we sit in the midst of our
          pupils in the Sabbath-school, or in the centre of our circle at home,
          or perchance at some bedside of sickness or of death; or as we meet
          our fellow-man amid the busy work of the world, hemmed in by
          temptation or weighed down with care, and would fain put beneath him
          some firm support and stay: in what spirit do we turn to this Bible
          then? with what confidence do we commend its every word to those whom
          we would make partakers of its comfort or of its strength? In such
          scenes as these is revealed the vital faith of the people of God in
          the surety and trustworthiness of the Word of God. Nor do we need to
          do more than remind ourselves that this attitude of entire trust in
          every word of the Scriptures has been characteristic of the people of
          God from the very foundation of the church. Christendom has always
          reposed upon the belief that the utterances of this book are properly
          oracles of God. The whole body of Christian literature bears witness
          to this fact. We may trace its stream to its source, and everywhere it
          is vocal with a living faith in the divine trustworthiness of the
          Scriptures of God in every one of their affirmations. This is the
          murmur of the little rills of Christian speech which find their
          tenuous way through the parched heathen land of the early second
          century. And this is the mighty voice of the great river of Christian
          thought which sweeps through the ages, freighted with blessings for
          men. Dr. Sanday, in his recent Bampton Lectures on "Inspiration" - in
          which, unfortunately, he does not teach the church-doctrine - is
          driven to admit that not only may "testimonies to the general doctrine
          of inspiration" from the earliest Fathers, "be multiplied to almost
          any extent; but [that] there are some which go further and point to an
          inspiration which might be described as 'verbal"'; "nor does this
          idea," he adds, "come in tentatively and by degrees, but almost from
          the very first."<a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3"
            ><span><sup>3</sup></span></a
          >
          He might have spared the adverb "almost." The earliest writers know no
          other doctrine. If Origen asserts that the Holy Spirit was co-worker
          with the Evangelists in the composition of the Gospel, and that,
          therefore, lapse of memory, error or falsehood was impossible to
          them,<a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4"
            ><span><sup>4</sup></span></a
          >
          and if Irenaeus, the pupil of Polycarp, claims for Christians a clear
          knowledge that " he Scriptures are perfect, seeing that they are
          spoken by God's Word and his Spirit";<a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5"
            ><span><sup>5</sup></span></a
          >
          no less does Polycarp, the pupil of John, consider the Scriptures the
          very voice of the Most High, and pronounce him the first-born of
          Satan, "whosoever perverts these oracles of the Lord."<a
            id="fnref-6"
            href="#fn-6"
            ><span><sup>6</sup></span></a
          >
          Nor do the later Fathers know a different doctrine. Augustine, for
          example, affirms that he defers to the canonical Scriptures alone
          among books with such reverence and honor that he most "firmly
          believes that no one of their authors has erred in anything, in
          writing."<a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7"
            ><span><sup>7</sup></span></a
          >
          To precisely the same effect did the Reformers believe and teach.
          Luther adopts these words of Augustine's as his own, and declares that
          the whole of the Scriptures are to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost, and
          therefore cannot err.<a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8"
            ><span><sup>8</sup></span></a
          >
          Calvin demands that whatever is propounded in Scripture, “without
          exception," shall be humbly received by us, - that the Scriptures as a
          whole shall be received by us with the same reverence which we give to
          God, "because they have emanated from him alone, and are mixed with
          nothing human."<a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9"

          and Baxter, who affirms that "all that the holy writers have recorded

          our own Charles Hodge and Henry B. Smith, the one of whom asserts that
          the Bible "gives us truth without error,"<a

          age of the constant faith of Christians throughout all ages.

        <p>
          If we would estimate at its full meaning the depth of this trust in
          the Scripture word, we should observe Christian men at work upon the
          text of Scripture. There is but one view-point which will account for
          or justify the minute and loving pains which have been expended upon
          the text of Scripture, by the long line of commentators that has
          extended unbrokenly from the first Christian ages to our own. The
          allegorical interpretation which rioted in the early days of the
          church was the daughter of reverence for the biblical word; a spurious
          daughter you may think, but none the less undeniably a direct
          offspring of the awe with which the sacred text was regarded as the
          utterances of God, and, as such, pregnant with inexhaustible
          significance. The patient and anxious care with which the Bible text
          is scrutinized today by scholars, of a different spirit no doubt from
          those old allegorizers, but of equal reverence for the text of
          Scripture, betrays the same fundamental viewpoint, - to which the
          Bible is the Word of God, every detail of the meaning of which is of
          inestimable preciousness. No doubt there have been men who have busied
          themselves with the interpretation of Scripture, who have not
          approached it in such a spirit or with such expectations. But it is
          not the Jowetts, with their supercilious doubts whether Paul meant
          very much by what he said, who represent the spirit of Christian
          exposition. This is represented rather by the Bengels, who count no
          labor wasted, in their efforts to distill from the very words of Holy
          Writ the honey which the Spirit has hidden in them for the comfort and
          the delight of the saints. It is represented rather by the Westcotts,
          who bear witness to their own experience of the "sense of rest and
          confidence which grows firmer with increasing knowledge," as their
          patient investigation has dug deeper and deeper for the treasures hid
          in the words and clauses and sentences of the Epistles of John,<a
            id="fnref-14"
            href="#fn-14"
            ><span><sup>14</sup></span></a
          >
          - to the sure conviction which forty years of study of the Epistle to
          the Hebrews has brought them that "we come nearer to the meaning of
          Scripture by the closest attention to the subtleties and minute
          variations of words and order." It was a just remark of one of the
          wisest men I ever knew, Dr. Wistar Hodge, that this is "a high
          testimony to verbal inspiration."<a id="fnref-15" href="#fn-15"
            ><span><sup>15</sup></span></a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course the church has not failed to bring this, her vital faith in
          the divine trustworthiness of the Scripture word, to formal expression
          in her solemn creeds. The simple faith of the Christian people is also
          the confessional doctrine of the Christian churches. The assumption of
          the divine authority of the scriptural teaching underlies all the
          credal statements of the church; all of which are formally based upon
          the Scriptures. And from the beginning, it finds more or less full
          expression in them. Already, in some of the formulas of faith which
          underlie the Apostles' Creed itself, we meet with the phrase
          "according to the Scriptures" as validating the items of belief; while
          in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, amid the meagre clauses
          outlining only what is essential to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit,
          place is given to the declaration that He is to be found speaking in
          the prophets - "who spake by the prophets." It was in conscious
          dependence upon the immemorial teaching of the church that the Council
          of Trent defined it as of faith in the Church of Rome, that God is the
          author of Scripture, - a declaration which has been repeated in our
          own day by the Vatican Council, with such full explanations as are
          included in these rich words: "The church holds" the books of the Old
          and New Testaments, "to be sacred and canonical, not because, having
          been carefully composed by mere human industry, they were afterwards
          approved by her authority; nor merely because they contain revelation
          with no admixture of error; but because, having been written by the
          inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they have God for their author."
          Needless to say that a no less firm conviction of the absolute
          authority of Scripture underlies all the Protestant creeds. Before all
          else, Protestantism is, in its very essence, an appeal from all other
          authority to the divine authority of Holy Scripture. The Augsburg
          Confession, the first Protestant creed, is, therefore, commended to
          consideration, only on the ground that it is "drawn from the Holy
          Scriptures and the pure word of God." The later Lutheran creeds, and
          especially the Reformed creeds, grow progressively more explicit. It
          is our special felicity, that; is Reformed Christians, and heirs of
          the richest and fullest formulation of Reformed thought, we possess in
          that precious heritage, the Westminster Confession, the most complete,
          the most admirable, the most perfect statement of the essential
          Christian doctrine of Holy Scripture which has ever been formed by
          man. Here the vital faith of the church is brought to full expression;
          the Scriptures are declared to be the word of God in such a sense that
          God is their author, and they, because immediately inspired by God,
          are of infallible truth and divine authority, and are to be believed
          to be true by the Christian man, in whatsoever is revealed in them,
          for the authority of God himself speaking therein. Thus, in every way
          possible, the church has borne her testimony from the beginning, and
          still in our day, to her faith in the divine trustworthiness of her
          Scriptures, in all their affirmations of whatever kind. At no age has
          it been possible for men to express without rebuke the faintest doubt
          as to the absolute trustworthiness of their least declaration.
          Tertullian, writing at the opening of the third century, suggests,
          with evident hesitation and timidity, that Paul's language in the
          seventh chapter of First Corinthians may be intended to distinguish,
          in his remarks on marriage and divorce, between matters of divine
          commandment and of human arrangement. Dr. Sanday is obliged to comment
          on his language: "Any seeming depreciation of Scripture was as
          unpopular even then as it is now."<a id="fnref-16" href="#fn-16"
            ><span><sup>16</sup></span></a
          >
          The church has always believed her Scriptures to be the book of God,
          of which God was in such a sense the author that every one of its
          affirmations of whatever kind is to be esteemed as the utterance of
          God, of infallible truth and authority. In the whole history of the
          church there have been but two movements of thought, tending to a
          lower conception of the inspiration and authority of Scripture, which
          have attained sufficient proportions to bring them into view in an
          historical sketch.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The first of these may be called the Rationalistic view. Its
          characteristic feature is an effort to distinguish between inspired
          and uninspired elements within the Scriptures. With forerunners among
          the Humanists, this mode of thought was introduced by the Socinians,
          and taken up by the Syncretists in Germany, the Remonstrants in
          Holland, and the Jesuits in the Church of Rome. In the great
          life-and-death struggle of the eighteenth century it obtained great
          vogue among the defenders of supernatural religion, in their desperate
          efforts to save what was of even more importance, - just as a
          hardpressed army may yield to the foe many an outpost which justly
          belongs to it, in the effort to save the citadel. In the nineteenth
          century it has retained a strong hold, especially upon apologetical
          writers, chiefly in the three forms which affirm respectively that
          only the mysteries of the faith are inspired, i. e. things
          undiscoverable by unaided reason, - that the Bible is inspired only in
          matters of faith and practice, - and that the Bible is inspired only
          in its thoughts or concepts, not in its words. But although this
          legacy from the rationalism of an evil time still makes its appearance
          in the pages of many theological writers, and has no doubt affected
          the faith of a considerable number of Christians, it has failed to
          supplant in either the creeds of the church or the hearts of the
          people the church doctrine of the plenary inspiration of the Bible, i.
          e. the doctrine that the Bible is inspired not in part but fully, in
          all its elements alike, - things discoverable by reason as well as
          mysteries, matters of history and science as well as of faith and
          practice, words as well as thoughts. (2) The second of the lowered
          views of inspiration may be called the Mystical view. Its
          characteristic conception is that the Christian man has something
          within himself, - call it enlightened reason, spiritual insight, the
          Christian consciousness, the witness of the Spirit, or call it what
          you will, - to the test of which every "external revelation" is to be
          subjected, and according to the decision of which are the contents of
          the Bible to be valued. Very varied forms have been taken by this
          conception; and more or less expression has been given to it, in one
          form or another, in every age. In its extremer manifestations, it has
          formerly tended to sever itself from the main stream of Christian
          thought and even to form separated sects. But in our own century,
          through the great genius of Schleiermacher it has broken in upon the
          church like a flood, and washed into every corner of the Protestant
          world. As a consequence, we find men everywhere who desire to
          acknowledge as from God only such Scripture as "finds them," - who
          cast the clear objective enunciation of God's will to the mercy of the
          currents of thought and feeling which sweep up and down in their own
          souls, - who "persist" sometimes, to use a sharp but sadly true phrase
          of Robert Alfred Vaughan's, "in their conceited rejection of the light
          without until they have turned into darkness their light within." We
          grieve over the inroads which this essentially naturalistic mode of
          thought has made in the Christian thinking of the day. But great and
          deplorable as they have been, they have not been so extensive as to
          supplant the church-doctrine of the absolute authority of the
          objective revelation of God in his Word, in either the creeds of the
          church, or the hearts of the people. Despite these attempts to
          introduce lowered conceptions, the doctrine of the plenary inspiration
          of the Scriptures, which looks upon them as an oracular book, in all
          its parts and elements, alike, of God, trustworthy in all its
          affirmations of every kind, remains to-day, as it has always been, the
          vital faith of the people of God, and the formal teaching of the
          organized church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more we contemplate this church-doctrine, the more pressing
          becomes the question of what account we are to give of it, - its
          origin and persistence. How shall we account for the immediate
          adoption of so developed a doctrine of inspiration in the very infancy
          of the church, and for the tenacious hold which the church has kept
          upon it through so many ages? The account is simple enough, and
          capable of inclusion in a single sentence: this is the doctrine of
          inspiration which was held by the writers of the New Testament and by
          Jesus as reported in the Gospels. It is this simple fact that has
          commended it to the church of all ages as the true doctrine; and in it
          we may surely recognize an even more impressive fact than that of the
          existence of a stable, abiding church-doctrine standing over against
          the many theories of the day, - the fact, namely, that this
          church-doctrine of inspiration was the Bible doctrine before it was
          the church-doctrine, and is the church doctrine only because it is the
          Bible doctrine. It is upon this fact that we should now fix our
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the limited space at our disposal we need not attempt anything like
          a detailed proof that the church-doctrine of the plenary inspiration
          of the Bible is the Bible's own doctrine of inspiration. And this
          especially for three very obvious reasons: First, because it cannot be
          necessary to prove this to ourselves. We have the Bible in our hands,
          and we are accustomed to read it. It is enough for us to ask ourselves
          how the apostles and our Lord, as represented in its pages, conceived
          of what they called "the Scriptures," for the answer to come at once
          to our minds. As readers of the New Testament, we know that to the men
          of the New Testament "the Scriptures" were the Word of God which could
          not be broken, i. e. whose every word was trustworthy; and that a
          simple "It is written" was therefore to them the end of all strife.
          The proof of this is pervasive and level to the apprehension of every
          reader. It would be an insult to our intelligence were we to presume
          that we had not observed it, or could not apprehend its meaning.
          Secondly, it is not necessary to prove that the New Testament regards
          "Scripture" as the mere Word of God, in the highest and most rigid
          sense, to modern biblical scholarship. Among untrammelled students of
          the Bible, it is practically a matter of common consent that the
          writers of the New Testament books looked upon what they called
          "Scripture" as divinely safeguarded in even its verbal expression, and
          as divinely trustworthy in all its parts, in all its elements, and in
          all its affirmations of whatever kind. This is, of course, the
          judgment of all those who have adopted this doctrine as their own,
          because they apprehend it to be the biblical doctrine. It is also the
          judgment of all those who can bring themselves to refuse a doctrine
          which they yet perceive to be a biblical doctrine. Whether we appeal,
          among men of this class, to such students of a more evangelical
          tendency, as Tholuck, Rothe, Farrar, Sanday, or to such extremer
          writers as Riehm, Reuss, Pfleiderer, Keunen, they will agree in
          telling us that the high doctrine of inspiration which we have called
          the church-doctrine, was held by the writers of the New Testament.
          This is common ground between believing and unbelieving students of
          the Bible, and needs, therefore, no new demonstration in the forum of
          scholarship. Let us pause here, therefore, only long enough to allow
          Hermann Schultz, surely a fair example of the "advanced" school, to
          tell us what is the conclusion in this matter of the strictest and
          coldest exegetical science. "The Book of the Law," he tells us,
          "seemed already to the later poets of the Old Testament, the 'Word of
          God.' The post-canonical books of Israel regard the Law and the
          Prophets in this manner. And for the men of the New Testament, the
          Holy Scriptures of their people are already God's word in which God
          himself speaks." This view, which looked upon the scriptural books as
          verbally inspired, he adds, was the ruling one in the time of Christ,
          was shared by all the New Testament men, and by Christ himself, as a
          pious conception, and was expressly taught by the more scholastic
          writers among them.<a id="fnref-17" href="#fn-17"
            ><span><sup>17</sup></span></a
          >
          It is hardly necessary to prove what is so frankly confessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third reason why it is not necessary to occupy our time with a
          formal proof that the Bible does teach this doctrine, arises from the
          circumstance that even those who seek to rid themselves of the
          pressure of this fact upon them, are observed to be unable to
          prosecute their argument without an implied admission of it as a fact.
          This is true, for example, of Dr. Sanday's endeavors to meet the
          appeal of the church to our Lord's authority in defence of the
          doctrine of plenary inspiration.<a id="fnref-18" href="#fn-18"
            ><span><sup>18</sup></span></a
          >
          He admits that the one support which has been sought by the church of
          all ages for its high doctrine has been the "extent to which it was
          recognized in the sayings of Christ himself." As over against this he
          begins by suggesting "that, whatever view our Lord himself entertained
          as to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, the record of his words has
          certainly come down to us through the medium of persons who shared the
          current view on the subject." This surely amounts to a full admission
          that the writers of the New Testament at least, held and taught the
          obnoxious doctrine. He ends with the remark that "when deductions have
          been made . . . there still remains evidence enough that our Lord,
          while on earth did use the common language of his contemporaries in
          regard to the Old Testament." This surely amounts to a full admission
          that Christ as well as his reporters taught the obnoxious doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be found to be a typical case. Every attempt to escape from
          the authority of the New Testament enunciation of the doctrine of
          plenary inspiration, in the nature of the case begins by admitting
          that this is, in very fact, the New Testament doctrine. Shall we
          follow Dr. Sanday, and appeal from the apostles to Christ, and then
          call in the idea of kenosis, and affirm that in the days of his flesh,
          Christ did not speak out of the fulness and purity of his divine
          knowledge, but on becoming man had shrunk to man's capacity, and in
          such matters as this was limited in his conceptions by the knowledge
          and opinions current in his day and generation? In so saying, we
          admit, as has already been pointed out, not only that the apostles
          taught this high doctrine of inspiration, but also that Christ too, in
          whatever humiliation he did it, yet actually taught the same. Shall we
          then take refuge in the idea of accommodation, and explain that, in so
          speaking of the Scriptures, Christ and his apostles did not intend to
          teach the doctrine of inspiration implicated, but merely adopted, as a
          matter of convenience, the current language, as to Scripture, of the
          time? In so speaking, also, we admit that the actual language of
          Christ and his apostles expresses that high view of inspiration which
          was confessedly the current view of the day - whether as a matter of
          convenience or as a matter of truth, the Christian consciousness may
          be safely left to decide. Shall we then remind ourselves that Jesus
          himself committed nothing to writing, and appeal to the uncertainties
          which are accustomed to attend the record of teaching at second-hand?
          Thus, too, we allow that the words of Christ as transmitted to us do
          teach the obnoxious doctrine. Are we, then, to fall back upon the
          observation that the doctrine of plenary inspiration is not taught
          with equal plainness in every part of the Bible, but becomes clear
          only in the later Old Testament books, and is not explicitly
          enunciated except in the more scholastic of the New Testament books?
          In this, too, we admit that it is taught in the Scriptures; while the
          fact that it is taught not all at once, but with progressive clearness
          and fulness, is accordant with the nature of the Bible as a book
          written in the process of the ages and progressively developing the
          truth. Then, shall we affirm that our doctrine of inspiration is not
          to be derived solely from the teachings of the Bible, but from its
          teachings and phenomena in conjunction; and so call in what we deem
          the phenomena of the Bible to modify its teaching? Do we not see that
          the very suggestion of this process admits that the teaching of the
          Bible, when taken alone, i. e., in its purity and just as it is, gives
          us the unwelcome doctrine? Shall we, then, take counsel of desperation
          and assert that all appeal to the teaching of the Scriptures
          themselves in testimony to their own inspiration is an argument in a
          circle, appealing to their inspiration to validate their inspiration?
          Even this desperately illogical shift to be rid of the scriptural
          doctrine of inspiration, obviously involves the confession that this
          is the scriptural doctrine. No, the issue is not, What does the Bible
          teach? but, Is what the Bible teaches true? And it is amazing that any
          or all of such expedients can blind the eyes of any one to the
          stringency of this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even a detailed attempt to explain away the texts which teach the
          doctrine of the plenary inspiration and unvarying truth of Scripture,
          involves the admission that in their obvious meaning such texts teach
          the doctrine which it is sought to explain away. And think of
          explaining away the texts which inculcate the doctrine of the plenary
          inspiration of the Scriptures! The effort to do so is founded upon an
          inexplicably odd misapprehension - the misapprehension that the Bible
          witnesses to its plenary inspiration only in a text here and there:
          texts of exceptional clearness alone probably being in mind, - such as
          our Saviour's declaration that the Scriptures cannot be broken; or
          Paul's, that every scripture is inspired of God; or Peter's, that the
          men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Such texts, no
          doubt, do teach the doctrine of plenary inspiration, and are sadly in
          need of explaining away at the hands of those who will not believe
          this doctrine. As, indeed, we may learn from Dr. Sanday's treatment of
          one of them, that in which our Lord declares that the Scriptures
          cannot be broken. Dr. Sanday can only speak of this as "a passage of
          peculiar strangeness and difficulty "; "because," he tells us, "it
          seems to mean that the dicta of Scripture, even where we should
          naturally take them as figurative, must be true." Needless to say that
          the only "strangeness and difficulty" in the text arises from the
          unwillingness of the commentator to approach the Scriptures with the
          simple trust in their detailed divine trustworthiness and authority
          which characterized all our Lord's dealings with them. But no grosser
          misconception could be conceived than that the Scriptures bear witness
          to their own plenary inspiration in those outstanding texts alone.
          These are but the culminating passages of a pervasive testimony to the
          divine character of scripture, which fills the whole New Testament;
          and which includes not only such direct assertions of divinity and
          infallibility for Scripture as these, but, along with them, an endless
          variety of expressions of confidence in, and phenomena of use of,
          Scripture which are irresistible in their teaching when it is once
          fairly apprehended. The induction must be broad enough to embrace, and
          give their full weight to, a great variety of such facts as these: the
          lofty titles which are given to Scripture, and by which it is cited,
          such as "Scripture," "the Scriptures," even that almost awful title,
          "the Oracles of God"; the significant formulæ by which it is quoted,
          "It is written," "It is spoken," "It says," "God says"; such modes of
          adducing it as betray that to the writer "Scripture says" is
          equivalent to "God says," and even its narrative parts are conceived
          as direct utterances of God; the attribution to Scripture, as such, of
          divine qualities and acts, as in such phrases as "the Scriptures
          foresaw"; the ascription of the Scriptures, in whole or in their
          several parts as occasionally adduced, to the Holy Spirit, as their
          author, while the human writers are treated as merely his media of
          expression; the reverence and trust shown, and the significance and
          authority ascribed, to the very words of Scripture; and the general
          attitude of entire subjection to every declaration of Scripture of
          whatever kind, which characterizes every line of the New Testament.
          The effort to explain away the Bible's witness to its plenary
          inspiration reminds one of a man standing safely in his laboratory and
          elaborately expounding - possibly by the aid of diagrams and
          mathematical formulæ - how every stone in an avalanche has a defined
          pathway and may easily be dodged by one of some presence of mind. We
          may fancy such an elaborate trifler's triumph as he would analyze the
          avalanche into its constituent stones, and demonstrate of stone after
          stone that its pathway is definite, limited, and may easily be
          avoided. But avalanches, unfortunately, do not come upon us, stone by
          stone, one at a time, courteously leaving us opportunity to withdraw
          from the pathway of each in turn: but all at once, in a roaring mass
          of destruction. Just so we may explain away a text or two which teach
          plenary inspiration, to our own closet satisfaction, dealing with them
          each without reference to its relation to the others: but these texts
          of ours, again, unfortunately do not come upon us in this artificial
          isolation; neither are they few in number. There are scores, hundreds,
          of them: and they come bursting upon us in one solid mass. Explain
          them away? We should have to explain away the whole New Testament.
          What a pity it is that we cannot see and feel the avalanche of texts
          beneath which we may lie hopelessly buried, as clearly as we may see
          and feel an avalanche of stones! Let us, however, but open our eyes to
          the variety and pervasiveness of the New Testament witness to its high
          estimate of Scripture, and we shall no longer wonder that modern
          scholarship finds itself compelled to allow that the Christian church
          has read her records correctly, and that the church-doctrine of
          inspiration is simply a transcript of the biblical doctrine; nor shall
          we any longer wonder that the church, receiving these Scriptures as
          her authoritative teacher of doctrine, adopted in the very beginnings
          of her life, the doctrine of plenary inspiration, and has held it with
          a tenacity that knows no wavering, until the present hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, we may be reminded, the church has not held with such tenacity to
          all doctrines taught in the Bible. How are we to account, then, for
          the singular constancy of its confession of the Bible's doctrine of
          inspiration? The account to be given is again simple, and capable of
          being expressed in a single sentence. It is due to an instinctive
          feeling in the church, that the trustworthiness of the Scriptures lies
          at the foundation of trust in the Christian system of doctrine, and is
          therefore fundamental to the Christian hope and life. It is due to the
          church's instinct that the validity of her teaching of doctrine as the
          truth of God, - to the Christian's instinct that the validity of his
          hope in the several promises of the gospel, - rests on the
          trustworthiness of the Bible as a record of God's dealings and
          purposes with men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals may call in question the soundness of these instinctive
          judgments. And, indeed, there is a sense in which it would not be true
          to say that the truth of Christian teaching and the foundations of
          faith are suspended upon the doctrine of plenary inspiration, or upon
          any doctrine of inspiration whatever. They rest rather upon the
          previous fact of revelation: and it is important to keep ourselves
          reminded that the supernatural origin and contents of Christianity,
          not only may be vindicated apart from any question of the inspiration
          of the record, but, in point of fact, always are vindicated prior to
          any question of the inspiration of the record. We cannot raise the
          question whether God has given us an absolutely trustworthy record of
          the supernatural facts and teachings of Christianity, before we are
          assured that there are supernatural facts and teachings to be
          recorded. The fact that Christianity is a supernatural religion and
          the nature of Christianity as a supernatural religion, are matters of
          history; and are independent of any, and of every, theory of
          inspiration. But this line of remark is of more importance to the
          Christian apologist than to the Christian believer, as such; and the
          instinct of the church that the validity of her teaching, and the
          instinct of the Christian that the validity of his hope, are bound up
          with the trustworthiness of the Bible, is a perfectly sound one. This
          for three reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because the average Christian man is not and cannot be a fully
          furnished historical scholar. If faith in Christ is to be always and
          only the product of a thorough historical investigation into the
          origins of Christianity, there would certainly be few who could
          venture to preach Christ and him crucified with entire confidence;
          there would certainly be few who would be able to trust their all to
          him with entire security. The Christian scholar desires, and, thank
          God, is able to supply, a thoroughly trustworthy historical
          vindication of supernatural Christianity. But the Christian teacher
          desires, and, thank God, is able to lay his hands upon, a thoroughly
          trustworthy record of supernatural Christianity; and the Christian man
          requires, and, thank God, has, a thoroughly trustworthy Bible to which
          he can go directly and at once in every time of need. Though, then, in
          the abstract, we may say that the condition of the validity of the
          Christian teaching and of the Christian hope, is no more than the fact
          of the supernaturalism of Christianity, historically vindicated;
          practically we must say that the condition of the persistence of
          Christianity as a religion for the people, is the entire
          trustworthiness of the Scriptures as the record of the supernatural
          revelation which Christianity is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the merely historical vindication of the supernatural origin
          and contents of Christianity, while thorough and complete for
          Christianity as a whole, and for all the main facts and doctrines
          which enter into it, does not by itself supply a firm basis of trust
          for all the details of teaching and all the items of promise upon
          which the Christian man would fain lean. Christianity would be given
          to us; but it would be given to us, not in the exact form or in all
          the fulness with which God gave it to his needy children through his
          servants, the prophets, and through his Son and his apostles; but with
          the marks of human misapprehension, exaggeration, and minimizing upon
          it, and of whatever attrition may have been wrought upon it by its
          passage to us through the ages. That the church may have unsullied
          assurance in the details of its teaching, - that the Christian man may
          have unshaken confidence in the details of the promises to which he
          trusts, - they need, and they know that they need, a thoroughly
          trustworthy Word of God in which God himself speaks directly to them
          all the words of this life. Thirdly, in the circumstances of the
          present case, we cannot fall back from trust in the Bible upon trust
          in the historical vindication of Christianity as a revelation from
          God, inasmuch as, since Christ and his apostles are historically shown
          to have taught the plenary inspiration of the Bible, the credit of the
          previous fact of revelation - even of the supreme revelation in Christ
          Jesus - is implicated in the truth of the doctrine of plenary
          inspiration. The historical vindication of Christianity as a
          revelation from God, vindicates as the truth of God all the contents
          of that revelation; and, among these contents, vindicates, as divinely
          true, the teaching of Christ and his apostles, that the Scriptures are
          the very Word of God, to be trusted as such in all the details of
          their teaching and promises. The instinct of the church is perfectly
          sound, therefore, when she clings to the trustworthiness of the Bible,
          as lying at the foundation of her teaching and her faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much less can she be shaken from this instinctive conviction by the
          representations of individual thinkers who go yet a step further, and,
          refusing to pin their faith either to the Bible or to history, affirm
          that "the essence of Christianity" is securely intrenched in the
          subjective feelings of man, either as such, or as Christian man taught
          by the Holy Ghost; and therefore that there is by no means needed an
          infallible objective rule of faith in order to propagate or preserve
          Christian truth in the world. It is unnecessary to say that "the
          essence of Christianity" as conceived by these individuals, includes
          little that is characteristic of Christian doctrine, life, or hope, as
          distinct from what is taught by other religions or philosophies. And
          it is perhaps equally unnecessary to remind ourselves that such
          individuals, having gone so far, tend to take a further step still,
          and to discard the records which they thus judge to be unnecessary.
          Thus, there may be found even men a ill professing historical
          Christianity, who reason themselves into the conclusion that "in the
          nature of the case, no external authority can possibly be absolute in
          regard to spiritual truth";<a id="fnref-19" href="#fn-19"
            ><span><sup>19</sup></span></a
          >
          just as men have been known to reason themselves into the conclusion
          that the external world has no objective reality and is naught but the
          projection of their own faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as in the one case, so in the other, the common sense of men
          recoils from such subtleties; and it remains the profound persuasion
          of the Christian heart that without such an "external authority" as a
          thoroughly trustworthy Bible, the soul is left without sure ground for
          a proper knowledge of itself, its condition, and its need, or for a
          proper knowledge of God's provisions of mercy for it and his promises
          of grace to it, - without sure ground, in a word, for its faith and
          hope. Adolphe Monod gives voice to no more than the common Christian
          conviction, when he declares that, "If faith has not for its basis a
          testimony of God to which we must submit, as to an authority exterior
          to our personal judgment, and independent of it, then faith is no
          faith."<a id="fnref-20" href="#fn-20"
            ><span><sup>20</sup></span></a
          >
          "The more I study the Scriptures, the example of Christ, and of the
          apostles, and the history of my own heart," he adds, "the more I am
          convinced, that a testimony of God, placed without us and above us,
          exempt from all intermixture of sin and error which belong to a fallen
          race, and received with submission on the sole authority of God, is
          the true basis of faith."<a id="fnref-21" href="#fn-21"
            ><span><sup>21</sup></span></a
          >
          It is doubtless the profound and ineradicable conviction, so
          expressed, of the need of an infallible Bible, if men are to seek and
          find salvation in God's announced purpose of grace, and peace and
          comfort in his past dealings with his people, that has operated to
          keep the formulas of the churches and the hearts of the people of God,
          through so many ages, true to the Bible doctrine of plenary
          inspiration. In that doctrine men have found what their hearts have
          told them was the indispensable safeguard of a sure word of God to
          them, - a word of God to which they could resort with confidence in
          every time of need, to which they could appeal for guidance in every
          difficulty, for comfort in every sorrow, for instruction in every
          perplexity; on whose "Thus saith the Lord" they could safely rest all
          their aspirations and all their hopes. Such a Word of God, each one of
          us knows he needs, - not a Word of God that speaks to us only through
          the medium of our fellow-men, men of like passions and weaknesses with
          ourselves, so that we have to feel our way back to God's word through
          the church, through tradition, or through the apostles, standing
          between us and God; but a Word of God in which God speaks directly to
          each of our souls. Such a Word of God, Christ and his apostles offer
          us, when they give us the Scriptures, not as man's report to us of
          what God says, but as the very Word of God itself, spoken by God
          himself through human lips and pens. Of such a precious possession,
          given to her by such hands, the church will not lightly permit herself
          to be deprived. Thus the church's sense of her need of an absolutely
          infallible Bible, has co-operated with her reverence for the teaching
          of the Bible to keep her true, in all ages, to the Bible doctrine of
          plenary inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          What, indeed, would the church be - what would we, as Christian men,
          be - without our inspired Bible? Many of us have, no doubt, read Jean
          Paul Richter's vision of a dead Christ, and have shuddered at his
          pictures of the woe of a world from which its Christ has been stolen
          away. It would be a theme worthy of some like genius to portray for us
          the vision of a dead Bible, - the vision of what this world of ours
          would be, had there been no living Word of God cast into its troubled
          waters with its voice of power, crying, "Peace! Be still!" What does
          this Christian world of ours not owe to this Bible! And to this Bible
          conceived, not as a part of the world's literature, - the literary
          product of the earliest years of the church; not as a book in which,
          by searching, we may find God and perchance somewhat of God's will:
          but as the very Word of God, instinct with divine life from the "In
          the beginning" of Genesis to the "Amen" of the Apocalypse, - breathed
          into by God, and breathing out God to every devout reader. It is
          because men have so thought of it that it has proved a leaven to
          leaven the whole lump of the world. We do not half realize what we owe
          to this book, thus trusted by men. We can never fully realize it. For
          we can never even in thought unravel from this complex web of modern
          civilization, all the threads from the Bible which have been woven
          into it, throughout the whole past, and now enter into its very
          fabric. And, thank God, much less can we ever untwine them in fact,
          and separate our modern life from all those Bible influences by which
          alone it is blessed, and sweetened, and made a life which men may
          live. Dr. Gardiner Spring published, years ago, a series of lectures
          in which he sought to take some account of the world's obligations to
          the Bible, - tracing in turn the services it has rendered to religion,
          to morals, to social institutions, to civil and religious liberty, to
          the freedom of slaves, to the emancipation of woman and the sweetening
          of domestic life, to public and private beneficence, to literary and
          scientific progress, and the like.<a id="fnref-22" href="#fn-22"
            ><span><sup>22</sup></span></a
          >
          And Adolphe Monod, in his own inimitable style, has done something to
          awaken us as individuals to what we owe to a fully trusted Bible, in
          the development of our character and religious life.<a
            id="fnref-23"
            href="#fn-23"
            ><span><sup>23</sup></span></a
          >
          In such matters, however, we can trust our imaginations better than
          our words, to remind us of the immensity of our debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it suffice to say that to a plenarily inspired Bible, humbly
          trusted as such, we actually, and as a matter of fact, owe all that
          has blessed our lives with hopes of an immortality of bliss, and with
          the present fruition of the love of God in Christ. This is not an
          exaggeration. We may say that without a Bible we might have had Christ
          and all that he stands for to our souls. Let us not say that this
          might not have been possible. But neither let us forget that, in point
          of fact, it is to the Bible that we owe it that we know Christ and are
          found in him. And may it not be fairly doubted whether you and I, -
          however it may have been with others, - would have had Christ had
          there been no Bible? We must not at any rate forget those nineteen
          Christian centuries which stretch between us and Christ, whose
          Christian light we would do much to blot out and sink in a dreadful
          darkness if we could blot out the Bible. Even with the Bible, and all
          that had come from the Bible to form Christian lives and inform a
          Christian literature, after a millennium and a half the darkness had
          grown so deep that a Reformation was necessary if Christian truth was
          to persist, - a Luther was necessary, raised up by God to rediscover
          the Bible and give it back to man. Suppose there had been no Bible for
          Luther to rediscover, and on the lines of which to refound the church,
          - and no Bible in the hearts of God's saints and in the pages of
          Christian literature, persisting through those darker ages to prepare
          a Luther to rediscover it? Though Christ had come into the world and
          had lived and died for us, might it not be to us, - you and me, I
          mean, who are not learned historians but simple men and women, - might
          it not be to us as though he had not been? Or, if some faint echo of a
          Son of God offering salvation to men could still be faintly heard even
          by such dull ears as ours, sounding down the ages, who would have ears
          to catch the fulness of the message of free grace which he brought
          into the world? who could assure our doubting souls that it was not
          all a pleasant dream? who could cleanse the message from the
          ever-gathering corruptions of the multiplying years? No: whatever
          might possibly have been had there been no Bible, it is actually to
          the Bible that you and I owe it that we have a Christ, - a Christ to
          love, to trust and to follow, a Christ without us the ground of our
          salvation, a Christ within us the hope of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our effort has been to bring clearly out what seem to be three very
          impressive facts regarding the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures,
          - the facts, namely, that this doctrine has always been, and is still,
          the church-doctrine of inspiration, as well the vital faith of the
          people of God as the formulated teaching of the official creeds; that
          it is undeniably the doctrine of inspiration held by Christ and his
          apostles, and commended to us as true by all the authority which we
          will allow to attach to their teaching; and that it is the foundation
          of our Christian thought and life, without which we could not, or
          could only with difficulty, maintain the confidence of our faith and
          the surety of our hope. On such grounds as these is not this doctrine
          commended to us as true?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, it may be said, there are difficulties in the way. Of course
          there are. There are difficulties in the way of believing anything.
          There are difficulties in the way of believing that God is, or that
          Jesus Christ is God's Son who came into the world to save sinners.
          There are difficulties in the way of believing that we ourselves
          really exist, or that anything has real existence besides ourselves.
          When men give their undivided attention to these difficulties, they
          may become, and they have become, so perplexed in mind, that they have
          felt unable to believe that God is, or that they themselves exist, or
          that there is any external world without themselves. It would be a
          strange thing if it might not so fare with plenary inspiration also.
          Difficulties? Of course there are difficulties. It is nothing to the
          purpose to point out this fact. Dr. J. Oswald Dykes says with
          admirable truth: "If men must have a reconciliation for all
          conflicting truths before they will believe any; if they must see how
          the promises of God are to be fulfilled before they will obey his
          commands; if duty is to hang upon the satisfying of the understanding,
          instead of the submission of the will, - then the greater number of us
          will find the road of faith and the road of duty blocked at the
          outset."<a id="fnref-24" href="#fn-24"
            ><span><sup>24</sup></span></a
          >
          These wise words have their application also to our present subject.
          The question is not, whether the doctrine of plenary inspiration has
          difficulties to face. The question is, whether these difficulties are
          greater than the difficulty of believing that the whole church of God
          from the beginning has been deceived in her estimate of the Scriptures
          committed to her charge - are greater than the difficulty of believing
          that the whole college of the apostles, yes and Christ himself at
          their head, were themselves deceived as to the nature of those
          Scriptures which they gave the church as its precious possession, and
          have deceived with them twenty Christian centuries, and are likely to
          deceive twenty more before our boasted advancing light has corrected
          their error, - are greater than the difficulty of believing that we
          have no sure foundation for our faith and no certain warrant for our
          trust in Christ for salvation. We believe this doctrine of the plenary
          inspiration of the Scriptures primarily because it is the doctrine
          which Christ and his apostles believed, and which they have taught us.
          It may sometimes seem difficult to take our stand frankly by the side
          of Christ and his apostles. It will always be found safe.
