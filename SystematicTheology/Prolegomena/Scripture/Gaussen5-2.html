        <h2>II. Should we except from Inspiration the Historical Books</h2>
        <p>
          "One will admit," we are told, "that the inspiration of the Scriptures
          might have been extended to the choice of expressions, wherever this
          miraculous operation was necessary: in the laying down of doctrines,
          for example, in announcing the history of a past more ancient than the
          birth of the mountains, or in unveiling a future which God only can
          know. But would you proceed to maintain that men who lived at the time
          of the events they relate, had any need of the Holy Ghost in order to
          tell us facts of which they themselves were either agents or
          witnesses, or which they had heard related by others; the humble
          marriage of Ruth in the small town of Bethlehem, for example, or the
          emotions felt by Esther in the palace of Shusan, or the nomenclatures
          of the kings of Israel and Judah, their reigns, their lives, their
          deaths, their genealogies?—Luke, who, from Troas, accompanied the
          apostle to Jerusalem, to Cesarea, to the isle of Malta, and as far as
          Rome, had he not enough of recollections of what had passed in order
          to tell us how Paul had been laid hold of under the porches of the
          temple; how his nephew revealed to him, in the castle, the conspiracy
          of the forty Jews; how the centurion took the young man to the chief
          captain, and how the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with
          him aside privately, and asked of him all that he knew? Did he then
          absolutely require for facts so simple and so well-known, a continual
          intervention of power from on high?" Some do not think so, and
          maintain, on the contrary, that it is neither necessary nor rational
          to believe that all the historical chapters of the two Testaments are
          divinely inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          To such objections our first answer will always be very simple. "All
          Scripture," we say, "is divinely inspired."—Thou hast known the holy
          letters, O Timothy: well then, "all the holy letters, all the
          Scriptures are given by the breath of God."—We have not heard the Holy
          Ghost make an exception anywhere to these declarations; accordingly,
          neither in man, nor in angel, do we acknowledge any right to hazard
          any.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we will say more. Were it allowable to place one book of God
          before another—if we must distinguish in the firmament of the
          Scriptures the more glorious constellations and stars of the first
          magnitude, we should certainly give the preference to the historical
          books.—In fact:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is to the historical books that the most striking and most
          respectful TESTIMONIES are rendered by the prophets in the Old
          Testament, and by the apostles in the New.—What is there more holy in
          the Old than the Pentateuch? what is there greater in the New than the
          four Gospels?—Is it not solely of the historical books of the Bible
          that it is written: "The law of the Lord is perfect; his testimonies
          are wonderful; they are sure; they make wise the simple; they are
          pure; they are more to be desired than gold; the words of the Lord are
          pure words; they are like silver seven times refined. Blessed is the
          man who meditates on his law day and night."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Besides, mark with what respect our LORD HIMSELF QUOTES THEM, and
          how in doing so he takes a pleasure in pointing to the smallest
          details in the divine decrees, and sometimes to the use of a single
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The histories in the Bible have not been given us solely for the
          transmission to future ages of the memorials of past events: they are
          presented to the Church of all ages, for the purpose of making her
          know by facts THE CHARACTER OF HER GOD; they are there as a mirror of
          providence and grace; they are destined to reveal to us God's
          thoughts, God's designs, the invisible things of God, his heaven, his
          glory, his angels, and those mysteries which the angels desire to look
          into.—For all this the most entire inspiration is requisite.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Remark further, that the historical Scriptures are given to us for
          the purpose of revealing to us THE DEEP THINGS OF MAN. It has been
          said of the Word of God, "that it pierces like a sword, to the
          division of the soul and spirit: that all is naked and open to it, and
          that it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." This
          holds true of the written Word as well as of the personal Word of God,
          for the one is the language of the other; but it is especially true of
          the historical word. Do you not see that that word, in its narratives,
          is a two-edged sword, and that it tries men's consciences? And in like
          manner as it describes to you what took place on our globe in the days
          of chaos, when the Spirit of God moved on the face of the abyss, it
          equally tells you of what takes place in the abyss of the human heart,
          the mysteries of the invisible world, the secret motives, the hidden
          faults, and many a thought which, but for it, would only have been
          known in the great day when the Lord will bring to light things hid in
          darkness, and will make manifest the purposes of men's hearts. Is it
          thus, then, that men write history?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The historical Scriptures behoved on another account to have the
          most entire inspiration, namely, in order that they might relate to us
          without any error the mysterious interventions of the ANGELS in this
          world's affairs, in those of the Church, and in those of Heaven. Is
          there a subject more delicate, more novel, more difficult? Do not
          those ardent and pure, humble and sublime creatures, whose existence
          we know of only from the Bible, differ as much from man as the heavens
          differ from the earth? Was any thing similar to the angels ever
          conceived by the imaginations of the peoples, by their poets, or by
          their sages? No, they never even show the slightest approach to it.
          One will perceive, then, how impossible it was, without a constant
          operation on the part of God, that the biblical narratives, in
          treating of such a subject, should not have constantly borne the all
          too human impression of our narrow conceptions; and that the sacred
          writers should not have often let slip from their pen imprudent
          touches, investing the angels by turns with attributes too divine, or
          affections too human. All nations have taken a fancy for figuring to
          themselves invisible beings, as the inhabitants of the celestial
          regions, whom they have tricked out with all those marks of
          superiority that charm the heart of man. But how have all their
          conceptions been creeping, childish, and vulgar, compared with what
          the angels are! How have all those creations of our fancy been
          comparatively earthly, passionate, selfish, impure, and often odious!
          See the gods, the demigods, and the whole Olympus of the ancients; see
          the fairies, the genii, and the sylphs of the moderns: see even
          farther, the angels of Scripture speedily disfigured in the books of
          man, in the Apocrypha of Enoch, for example, in several of the
          Fathers, in the legends of Rome, and even in the more recent creations
          of several of the French poets. Winged passions, devout puerilities,
          sacrilegious idols, immortal egotisms, celestial wickednesses, deified
          impurities! But study the angels of Scripture; there not only is every
          thing great, holy, and worthy of God; not only is that character at
          once ardent and sublime, compassionate and majestic, constantly
          recalled to us by their names, their attributes, their employments,
          their dwellings, their hymns, their contemplations of the depths of
          redemption, and the ineffable joys of their love; but that which above
          all ought to strike us, is the perfect harmony of all this as a whole;
          it is that all these features accord together; it is that all these
          attributes correspond to each other, and maintain themselves in the
          justest proportions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a word, this whole doctrine, sustained from one end to the other of
          the Scriptures, throughout a course of fifteen hundred years, presents
          to us a unity which of itself alone will be found to attest the
          inimitable reality of its object, but which bears the most striking
          testimony to their entire inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          While all the mythologies speak to us of the inhabitants of the moon
          and of the planets, the Bible says not a word of them: it says nothing
          to us about the second heaven; but it pictures to us, with no less
          fulness than precision, the sublime inhabitants of the third heaven,
          or of the heaven of heavens. This subject recurs constantly there, and
          under the most varied forms. Descriptions of the angels are often
          found in the Bible; descriptions unembarrassed, full of details,
          independent of each other. They are exhibited to us in all situations
          in heaven and on earth, before God and with men, ministers employed in
          executing acts of mercy and sometimes also acts of vengeance, bathed
          in the radiance of the divine glory, standing before God and
          worshipping him night and day; but also engaged in ministering to the
          humblest believers, helping them in their distresses, in their
          travels, in their imprisonments, on their deathbeds; and finally
          coming, at the last day, on the clouds of heaven, with the Son of man,
          to remove all the wicked from his kingdom, and to gather in his elect
          from the four winds.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what were the historians of the angels? Let us not forget this:
          some were shepherds; others were kings, or soldiers, or priests, or
          fishermen, or tax-gatherers; some writing in the days of Hercules, of
          Jason and the Argonauts, three hundred years before the war of Troy;
          others in the age of Seneca, of Tacitus, and of Juvenal. And yet we
          see that the relater has the same beings throughout before his eyes.
          Unlike men, they are always like themselves. We are defiled, they are
          perfect; we are selfish, they glow with love; we are haughty, they are
          gentle and meek. We are vain and proud in a body which will be gnawed
          by the worms, they are humble in their glory and immortality. We would
          sometimes fain worship them; "See thou do it not," they say to us, "I
          am but thy fellow-servant!" We are disquieted with lusts, they are
          fervent in spirit, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, for
          they cannot die.2 We are hard-hearted, they are compassionate; we
          leave the poor Lazarus to groan as he lies famished at our gate and
          our dogs lick his sores, but they come to take him when he is dead,
          and convey him away to Abraham's bosom; they utter shouts of joy at
          the conversion of a sinner; and yet, Jesus said, "the angel of one of
          these little ones continually beholds in the heavens the face of my
          Father."4 Such is the angel of the whole of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let each ask himself, how, without a constant inspiration of all
          the historical books, it could have happened, that over a course of so
          many ages, not one of the authors who had occasion to bring such
          beings before us, has let slip, with regard to them, either words
          fraught with excessive respect, after the manner of the liturgies of
          Rome, or other words bearing too much of the impress of our humanity,
          after the manner of many of the Fathers? and, how not a single
          discordant trait falling from their pen, spoils the perfect harmony of
          that inimitable character, or derogates from the ever amiable dignity
          of that sublime creation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, this unity, this purity, this perfection, comes not from
          man: it is from God! and we ought to own that here, as well as
          elsewhere, it was necessary that the Holy Ghost should himself
          superintend all that is written by his historians, and make himself
          the guarantee of their slightest expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But this is not all. See farther how, even without the knowledge of
          the authors, the histories in the Bible are full of the future. Even
          in relating the events of the past, "they are types," says Paul, "for
          us upon whom the ends of the world are come." They relate, it is true,
          national scenes or domestic scenes; but while they relate, Jesus
          Christ is incessantly and prophetically portrayed under all his
          aspects, and in all his characters. See the history of Adam, of Noah,
          of Abraham, of Isaac, of Joseph, of Moses, of the sacrificial lamb, of
          the deliverance from Egypt, of the pillar of fire, of the manna, of
          the rock which was Christ (1 Cor. 10:4), of the goat Azazel, of all
          the sacrifices, of Joshua, of David, of Solomon, of Jonah, of
          Zorobabel. One would need to write a commentary on the whole history,
          in order to do justice to this truth. Read over, in order that you may
          appreciate it, the pages of Paul on Agar, on Sarah, on Aaron, on
          Melchisedec.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, then, one would reflect upon this, he would soon acknowledge, with
          wonder, the constant forth-putting of the power of inspiration in all
          parts of these Scriptures; and one would feel assured, that if there
          be pages in the Bible that have need to be inspired in every line and
          in every word, these are the historical books: they preach, they
          reveal, they set forth doctrine, they legislate, they prophesy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare them not, therefore, with other histories: they have quite
          another scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          They behoved to have this full inspiration, in order to recite,
          without any error, facts inaccessible to man's knowledge, the creation
          of the universe, the extrication of chaos, the birth of light, the
          rise of the mountains, the intervention of angels, God's secret
          counsels, the thoughts of man's heart and his secret faults; but they
          specially behoved to have it in order that they might prefigure Christ
          by a thousand types unperceived by the writer himself, and thus
          exhibit even in their naratives of the past, the character of the
          Messiah, his sufferings, his death, and the glories that were to
          follow. It was necessary for them, in order that they might speak in a
          suitable manner of those events even that were known to them, to pass
          some over in silence, to relate others, to characterize them, to judge
          them, and thus to show in them the thought of God; but it was above
          all necessary for enabling them to describe in the just measure
          prescribed by that thought of God, and by the needs of the future
          Church, the scenes, whether national or domestic, which behoved to
          carry along with them the types of the work of redemption, to
          prefigure the last times, and to take in a vast sweep of thousands of
          years posterior to them. They required it for the purpose of
          determining the measure of what they might confide to their readers,
          and what they should withhold, for the discreet use of their
          expressions, and for that admirable restraint upon themselves which
          they have uniformly preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. We could wish we had time to speak here of their dramatic power (if
          such an expression may be permitted), that divine and indefinable
          charm, that mysterious and ever-recurring attraction, which we find
          attached to all their narratives, which captivates man's soul under
          all climates, which makes us find in them, throughout all our lives,
          as in the scenes of nature, an ever fresh charm; and after being
          delighted and moved by these incomparable narratives in our early
          childhood, affects our tender feelings even in hoary age. Certainly,
          there must needs be something superhuman in the very humanity of these
          forms, so familiar and so simple.—Men are incapable of telling a story
          thus.—Who shall tell us the secret of this attractiveness? In what
          does it consist? We should find it not easy to say, perhaps: it seems
          to lie in an ineffable mixture of simplicity and depth, of the natural
          and the unlooked for, of local colouring and spirituality; it further
          lies in this, that the narratives are marked by rapidity and
          simplicity, that they are at once minute in detail and concise; it
          lies, finally, in the harmony and the truth of the sentiments; it
          presents man, it presents nature, in their inmost reality.—In a word,
          you cannot fail to feel (even without being able to account for it)
          that He who speaks in this book, has immediately before him all the
          most hidden strings of man's heart, so as to be able to touch them at
          will, with a hand light or powerful, in the precise measure that his
          Spirit has proposed to itself. Read over the scenes in which Ruth and
          Boaz appear on the plains of Bethlehem, those where Abraham and Isaac
          meet on mount Moriah, those of David and Jonathan, those of Elijah and
          Elisha, those of Naaman the Syrian, of the widow of Zarephath, or of
          the Shunamite, and, above all, those of the life and death of the Son
          of man; and, after that, search every where else in the books of men,
          and see if you can find any thing similar. Read, if you like, the four
          Vedahs, and the voluminous collection of Pauthier, the sacred books of
          the East, Confucius, Manon, Mahomet; and see if there are to be met
          with there eight lines that can be compared to these incomparable
          narratives of Scripture.—But that we dreaded enlarging too far, we
          could have wished to make some comparisons here, and to take in turns
          the relations of the same facts in the Old Testament and in the Koran,
          in the New Testament and in the spurious Gospels, in the patriarchal
          scenes of Genesis, and in what has been made of them by men every time
          they have related them. Read over, for instance, in Moses, the life of
          Joseph, his infancy, his misfortunes, his temptations, and as far as
          that inimitable scene in which Jacob's eleven sons appear before their
          brother; as far as that "God be gracious unto thee, my son!" (43:29),
          and as far as "I am Joseph (יוסף אני)!"which at no time of life can
          one peruse without fresh emotion; and, then, go and take up that
          history again in Mahomet; go read his 12 chapter, intitled Joseph,
          written at Mecca in a hundred and eleven verses, and beginning with
          these words: "We have made this book come down from heaven in the
          Arabic tongue, in order that people may understand it, and we proceed
          to relate the most beautiful story that we have revealed to thee in
          this Koran."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let, then," says the celebrated Duplessis Mornay, "the hardest
          hearts, and the most squeamish palates in the world, come and read
          over these histories of our Bible; … they will feel their whole bodies
          thrill, their hearts move, and a tenderness of affection come over
          them in a moment, more than had all the orators of Greece and Rome
          preached to them the same matters for whole days. Let them go and read
          the same histories in Flavius Josephus, to whom the emperor Titus
          ordered a statue to be erected on account of the elegance of his
          history, he will leave them colder and less moved than he found them.
          What, then, if this Scripture has in its humility more elevation, in
          its simplicity more depth, in its absence of all effort more charms,
          in its grossness more vigour and point, than we know to find any where
          else of these qualities?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh no! we must say of the historical Scriptures, even in this respect,
          that never have men related events as they have done, neither before

          8. People have not perhaps sufficiently remarked, they have not
          sufficiently admired their divine brevity. If you would, in this
          respect, appreciate the Scriptures, compare them with the biographies
          that men have written, or with the systems of doctrine which they have
          given, when left to do so. See, for example, the modern Church of the
          Jews, and see that of the Latins. While the former has joined to the
          Scripture its two Talmuds, by attributing to them the same authority,
          one of which (that of Jerusalem) forms a large folio volume; and the
          other (that of Babylon), which is most followed, and which must be
          studied by all its doctors, is a work of twelve folio volumes; and
          while the Roman Church in its Council of Trent declares, "that it
          receives, with the same affection and reverence as the Holy Scripture,
          its traditions respecting faith and morals;" that is to say, the vast
          repertory of its synodal acts, of its decretals, of its bulls, of its
          canons, and of the writings of the holy fathers;2 behold what the
          Spirit hath done in the Bible, and there admire the celestial prudence
          of its inimitable brevity.

          Who among us could have been, for three years and a half, the constant
          witness, the passionately attached friend, of a man like Jesus Christ,
          and could have been able to write in sixteen or seventeen short
          chapters, or in eight hundred lines, the history of the whole of that
          life—of his birth, of his ministry, of his miracles, of his
          preachings, of his sufferings, of his death, of his resurrection, and
          of his ascension into the heavens? Who among us would have found it
          possible to avoid saying a word of the first thirty years of such a
          life? Who among us could have related so many acts of kindness without
          an exclamation; so many miracles without reflections on them; so many
          sublime thoughts without any emphasis; so many sufferings without
          complaint; so many acts of injustice without bitterness; so many
          sinless infirmities in their Master, and so many sinful infirmities in
          his disciples, without any suppression; so much ingratitude in their
          cowardly abandonment of him; so many instances of resistance, so much
          ignorance, so much hardness of heart, without the slightest excuse or
          comment? Is it thus that man relates a history? Who among us, further,
          could have known how to distinguish what behoved to be said cursorily
          from what required to be told in detail? Who among us, for example,
          could have thought that the whole creation of the world behoved to be
          related in a chapter of thirty-one verses; then the probation, the
          fall, and the condemnation of our race, in another chapter of
          twenty-four verses; while he consecrated so very many chapters and
          pages to the construction of the tabernacle and of its utensils,
          because these presented to future ages a continual and typical view of
          Jesus Christ and of his redemption? Who among us, for the same reason,
          would have devoted the fifth part of the book of Genesis to relating
          the history of one alone of the twelve children of Jacob, while two
          chapters only had seemed to suffice for seventeen hundred years of the
          history of the human race, from Adam's fall to the deluge? Who among
          us would have thought, like Matthew, of mentioning only four women
          (and such women!) in the forty-two generations of the ancestors of
          Jesus Christ, and of their recording there the names of the incestuous
          Tamar, the impure Rahab, Ruth the Moabitess, and the adulterous spouse
          of Uriah, without tempering the scandal by a single reflection? Who
          among us would have consecrated but a single verse to the conversion
          of a Roman proconsul (Acts 13:12)? Who among us, after having shared,
          during ten years, in the labours of Paul, his perils, his
          imprisonments, his preachings, and his prophetical gifts, could have
          related twenty-two years of such a life without saying a word about
          himself, and without making known, except by the mere change of the
          personal pronoun (at chap. 16. ver. 10), that from Troas to Jerusalem
          and Cesarea, and from Jerusalem and Cesarea to Malta and thence to
          Rome, he had been his suffering, faithful, indefatigable companion? It
          is necessary, in order to our being aware of this, that it should be
          Paul himself who, during his last imprisonment, should write to
          Timothy: "At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
          me; Luke only is with me."— (2 Tim. 4:16, 11; Philem. 24; Coloss.
          4:14.) Holy and heavenly reserve, humble and noble silence, such as
          the Holy Ghost alone could have taught!
        </p>
        <p>
          Where will you find, among all uninspired narrators, a man who could
          have written, like Luke, the Acts of the Apostles? Who could have
          contrived to relate within thirty pages the church history of the
          thirty noblest years of Christianity—from the ascension of the Son of
          man above the clouds of heaven, to the imprisonment of St Paul in the
          capital of the Roman world? Incomparable history! See, at once, how
          short it is, and yet how full! What do we not find in it? Addresses
          delivered to the Jews, to the Greeks, before the tribunals, before the
          Areopagus, and before the Sanhedrim, in places of public resort and
          before a proconsul, in synagogues and before kings; admirable
          descriptions of the primitive Church; miraculous and dramatic scenes
          witnessed in the midst of her; the interventions of angels, to
          deliver, to warn, or to punish; controversies and divisions in
          Christian congregations; new institutions in the Church; the history
          of a first council and its synodic epistle; commentaries on the
          Scripture; accounts of heresy; judgments from God, solemn and
          terrible; appearances of the Lord in the highway, in the temple, and
          in prison; details of conversions, often miraculous and singularly
          varied—that of Eneas, that of the eunuch, that of Cornelius the
          centurion, that of the Roman jailer, that of the proconsul, that of
          Lydia, that of Apollos, that of a numerous body at Jerusalem—not to
          mention such as were only commenced, as in the emotion felt by king
          Agrippa, in the troubled state of Felix's mind, in the kind acts of
          the centurion Julius; missionary excursions; different solutions of
          sundry cases of conscience; permanent divisions with respect to
          external matters among different classes of Christians; mutual
          prejudices; disputes among the brethren and among the apostles; warm
          expressions, explanations, and yet triumphs of the spirit of charity
          over these obstacles; communications from one military officer to
          another, from one proconsul to another; resurrections from the dead;
          revelations made to the Church, in order to hasten the calling of the
          Gentiles; collections for the poor by one Church for another;
          prophecies; national scenes; punishments consummated or prepared;
          appearances before Jewish tribunals or Roman municipalities, before
          governors and kings; meetings of Christians from house to house; their
          emotions, their prayers, their charity, their doubts; a persecuting
          king struck by an angel and eaten by worms, just as when, in order to
          gratify the populace, he had actually slain one apostle and was
          meditating the death of another; persecutions under every form—by
          synagogues, by princes, by municipalities, by the Jews, or by popular
          tumults; deliverances experienced by men of God, through the
          instrumentality sometimes of a child, sometimes of an angel, sometimes
          of a Roman tribune or ship-captain, of pagan magistrates or idolatrous
          soldiers; storms and shipwrecks described with a nautical exactness of
          detail which, as we ourselves have witnessed, continues to charm the
          sailors of our own day;—and all this in thirty pages, or twenty-eight
          short chapters. Admirable brevity! Was God's Holy Spirit not necessary
          for this conciseness, for this choice of details, for this manner at
          once pious, varied, brief, richly significative, so sparing in the
          employment of words, and yet teaching so many things?—Fulness,
          conciseness, clearness, unction, simplicity, elevation, practical
          richness; such is the book of Church history that was needed for God's
          people. True; but, once more, it is not thus that men compose
          histories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could you find upon the earth a man capable of relating the murder of
          his mother with the calmness, the moderation, the sobriety, the
          apparent impassibility of that quadruple narrative of the evangelists,
          telling of the crucifixion of Jesus, of that Jesus whom they loved
          more than one loves his mother, more than one loves his life? of that
          Jesus whom they had seen on his knees in Gethsemane; then betrayed,
          forsaken, dragged with his hands bound to Jerusalem, and finally
          nailed naked to a cross, while the sun hid his light, and the earth
          quaked and opened, and when He who had raised the dead to life again,
          was himself reduced to the state of the dead! Was not God's Spirit
          then required at every line, at every word of such a narrative, in
          order to make a suitable choice of details, amid an age and a world of
          recollections?
        </p>
        <p>
          9. There was a necessity, moreover, for an entire guidance by the Holy
          Ghost, in order to the maintenance of that prophetical reserve which
          the sacred historians were enabled in so many respects to observe; and
          of that altogether divine prudence, which reveals itself not only in
          what they teach, but also in what they withhold; not only in the terms
          which they employ, but also in those they avoid.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here, to enable one to form some estimate of this, observe them,
          for example, when they speak of the mother of Jesus. What divine
          foresight, and what prophetical wisdom, both in their narratives and
          in their expressions! How readily might they have been led, in their
          ardent adoration of the Son, to express themselves, when speaking of
          the mother, in terms of too much respect! Would not a single word,
          suffered to escape from the want of circumspection so natural to their
          first emotions, have for ever sanctioned the idolatries of future ages
          towards Mary, and the crime of the worship which is paid to her? But
          they have never allowed themselves to drop any such word. Had they so
          much as merely called her the mother of God? No, not even that;
          although he was in their eyes Emmanuel, the God-Man, the Word which
          was in the beginning, which was with God, which was God, and which was
          made flesh. Listen to them. What do we find them say of her after the
          death and the resurrection of their Saviour? One single sentence,
          after which they say not a word more about her. "These all continued
          with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary
          the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren." (Acts 1:14.) ("Hi omnes
          erant perseverantes unanimiter in oratione cum mulieribus, et Mariâ et
          matre Jesu et fratribus ejus.") Here they name her neither first nor
          last; here she appears, as the mother of Jesus, among the brethren of
          Jesus, and the women of Galilee. And what do we find them say of her
          before the Lord's death? Note this carefully. Ah, it is not thus that
          men relate events! Of all that Jesus Christ may have said to his
          mother after the opening of his mission, they have selected but three
          sayings to be handed down to us. The first is as follows: "Woman (when
          she interfered with his commencing ministry, and asked of him a
          miracle), woman (woman!) what have I to do with thee?" Then, when a
          woman from among the people, in the warmth of her enthusiasm, cried
          out from amid the crowd: "Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the
          paps which thou hast sucked!" "Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear
          the word of God and keep it!"2 Such is the second. Hear now the third:
          His mother and his brethren were shaken in their faith, and some of
          them had been heard to say, "He is beside himself (dicebant enim,
          quoniam in furorem versus est); and one said unto him, 'Behold thy
          mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee.' "
          "Who is my mother?" was his reply; and stretching forth his hand
          towards his disciples he said: "Behold my mother … every woman that
          shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
          mother." "Ecce mater mea." And when, in his last agony, he beholds her
          from the cross, he no longer calls her by the name of mother; but he
          bequeaths her to the disciple whom he loved, saying, "Woman, behold
          thy son; John, behold thy mother;" and from that hour that disciple
          took her to his own home, not to worship her but to protect her, as a
          weak and suffering creature whose soul had been pierced through with a
          sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it thus, then, we again ask, that men relate events, and must not
          the prophetic Spirit alone have been the relater of these facts?
        </p>
        <p>
          We could wish to give other examples: they at this moment crowd upon
          our mind, and it costs us a sacrifice to omit mentioning them; for the
          more narrowly we study these historical books, the more does the
          prophetical wisdom of God's Spirit who dictated them reveal itself
          there in details, at first sight far from obvious. We could wish to
          point out among others the altogether prophetic wisdom with which the
          Holy Spirit often, on coming to relate some one important fact more
          than once, is careful to vary his expressions, in order to prevent the
          false interpretations that might be put upon it, and to condemn
          beforehand the errors which were in a distant future to be attached to
          it. We would cite, for example, the manner, so remarkable and so
          unexpected, in which the tenth law of the Decalogue is repeated in
          Deuteronomy, with a remarkable transposition of its first terms; the
          Holy Ghost thus desiring to confound prophetically the artifice
          whereby the doctors of Rome were to endeavour, fifteen centuries
          afterwards, to divide that commandment into two, in order to veil over
          the criminal omission they have dared to make of the second:
        </p>
        <p>
          "And thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image, nor any
          likeness … thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them." We could
          wish to point farther to the variety of expression with which the Holy
          Ghost has related to us the divine institution of the holy Supper, and
          has paraphrased it several times, for the purpose of enabling us
          better to comprehend what was the meaning of Jesus Christ, and to
          condemn beforehand the carnal sense which people were to give to these
          words: "THIS IS MY BLOOD; this CUP is the New TESTAMENT in my blood,"
          he also said: "This cup is the COMMUNICATION of the blood of the New
          Testament." We would desire to call attention to the prophetic wisdom
          with which the Holy Ghost, in order to confound those who in the
          sequel were to allege that Judas did not participate in the last
          Supper, and that he went out before, or did not come in till after it,
          has taken care to let us know, by Mark and Matthew, that Jesus gave
          notice of the treachery of Judas before the communion, Judas being
          present; and by Luke, that he gave notice of it also afterwards, Judas
          being present.2 We could wish to show in the case of all the New
          Testament writers, the constant sobriety of their words, when the
          subject in hand bears on the relations of pastors to the churches; and
          that admirable prudence with which they have always abstained from
          applying, even in a single instance, to the ministers of the Christian
          Church, the name sacerdotes, or sacrificers; reserving to them that
          title of elders or presbyters which was given to laymen in Israel, and
          distinguishing them always from the sacerdotal race (which represented
          Jesus Christ, and which behoved to cease when the sole true priest had
          appeared). We could wish to point out, also, that prudence with which
          never do we find a soul conducted to any other pastor, any other
          director (καθηγητής) than Jesus Christ, and with which, in
          recommending deference towards spiritual guides, the Scripture is
          careful to name them always in the plural, in order that none might
          ever have its authority to appeal to in support of that idea, so
          natural to pastors and to the members of flocks, that every soul ought
          to have its pastor among men. "Call no man on earth your father; and
          do not make yourself be called DIRECTOR, for Christ alone is your
          director." What precaution, what reserve in the narratives, in order
          that too much might never be attributed to man, and to recount "the
          great things that God did by means of the apostles," in such a manner
          that self in all might be abased, that all glory might redound to God,
          and that all the Lord's servants may learn to say with the last
          prophet of the Old Testament and the first prophet of the New, "He
          must increase, and I must decrease."
        </p>
        <p>
          We repeat it, one must do violence to his own feelings, with the
          volume of the Bible before him, not to cite more such examples from
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From all these traits taken together, it behoves us then to conclude,
          that, though the whole Scripture is divinely inspired, the historical
          books, more than all the rest, make this divine intervention most
          manifest; they show it to be most indispensable; they attest, that for
          such pages it was necessary that the invisible and almighty hand of
          the Holy Ghost should be placed over that of the sacred writer, and
          guide it from the first line to the last. Here something more was
          necessary than learned men, than saints, than enlightened minds, than
          angels or archangels—here God was necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will say, then, with Origen, that the sacred volumes breathe the
          plenitude of the Spirit, and that there is nothing either in Prophets,
          or in Law, or in Gospel, or in Apostle, which does not come down from
          the fulness of the majesty of God; and with St Ambrose,3 —"drink both
          the cup of the Old and that of the New Testament, for, in both, it is
          Christ that thou drinkest. Drink Jesus Christ, that thou mayest drink
          the blood by which thou hast been redeemed. Drink Jesus Christ, in
          order that thou mayest drink in all his sayings. We drink holy
          Scripture, we devour holy Scripture, when the juice of the everlasting
          Word descends into the veins of our mind, and penetrates the energies
          of our soul." And with Augustine: "Wonderful are the depths of thine
          oracles! Behold how their surface charms little ones; but wonderful
          depth, O my God, what wonderful depth! One shudders at the
          contemplation of it—a thrill of reverence and trembling of love!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But, how now (it has been sometimes said further), must we believe
          that the letter of the Pagan Lysias, or the harangue of the Jew
          Gamaliel,3 or the discourses of Job's harsh friends, were all
          inspired? No, without doubt. No more than those of Cain, or of Lamech,
          or of Rabshakeh, or of Satan. But the sacred writers were as really
          guided by God, in order that they might transmit them to us, as they
          were to tell us the song of Mary in the hill country, or that of the
          seraphim in the year that king Uzziah died, or that of the celestial
          army at Bethlehem. The Holy Ghost is not always the author of the
          words which he reports, but he is always the historian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile another evasion is made in order to except a part of the
          Scriptures from the Theopneustia. If this is not the most serious
          objection, it is, at least, one of those that are most frequently
          advanced.
