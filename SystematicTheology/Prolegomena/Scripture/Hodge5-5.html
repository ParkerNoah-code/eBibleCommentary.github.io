        <p>V. Roman Catholic Doctrine Concerning the Rule of Faith:</p>
        <p>
          <b>ยง 5. Examination of the Romish Doctrine</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Hundreds of volumes have been written in the discussion of the various
          points included in the theory above stated. Only a most cursory view
          of the controversy can be given in such a work as this. So far as
          Romanists differ from us on the canon of Scripture, the examination of
          their views belongs to the department of Biblical literature. What
          concerns their doctrine of the incompleteness and obscurity of the
          written word, and the consequent necessity of an infallible, visible
          interpreter, can better be said under the head of the Protestant
          doctrine of the Rule of Faith. The two points to be now considered are
          Tradition, and the office of the Church as a teacher. These subjects
          are so related that it is difficult to keep them distinct. Tradition
          is the teaching of the Church, and the teaching of the Church is
          tradition. These subjects are not only thus intimately related, but
          they are generally included under the same head in the Catholic
          Symbols. Nevertheless, they are distinct, and involve very different
          principles. They should, therefore, be considered separately.
