        </p>

        <p>
          A. The Romish Doctrine on this subject Romanists teach that the
          Church, as an external, visible society, consisting of those who
          profess the Christian religion, united in communion of the same
          sacraments and subjection to lawful pastors, and especially to the
          Pope of Rome, is divinely appointed to be the infallible teacher of
          men in all things pertaining to faith and practice. It is qualified
          for this office by the plenary revelation of the truth in the written
          and unwritten word of God, and by the supernatural guidance of the
          Holy Spirit vouchsafed to the bishops as official successors of the
          Apostles, or, to the Pope as the successor of Peter in his supremacy
          over the whole Church, and as vicar of Christ on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is something simple and grand in this theory. It is wonderfully
          adapted to the tastes and wants of men. It relieves them of personal
          responsibility. Everything is decided for them. Their salvation is
          secured by merely submitting to be saved by an infallible,
          sinpardoning, and grace-imparting Church. Many may be inclined to
          think that it would have been a great blessing had Christ left on
          earth a visible representative of himself clothed with his authority
          to teach and govern, and an order of men dispersed through the world
          endowed with the gifts of the original Apostles,—men everywhere
          accessible, to whom we could resort in all times of difficulty and
          doubt, and whose decisions could be safely received as the decisions
          of Christ himself. God's thoughts, however, are not as our thoughts.
          We know that when Christ was on earth, men did not believe or obey
          Him. We know that when the Apostles were still living, and their
          authority was still confirmed by signs, and wonders, and divers
          miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, the Church was nevertheless
          distracted by heretics and schisms. If any in their sluggishness are
          disposed to think that a perpetual body of infallible teachers would
          be a blessing, all must admit that the assumption of infallibility by
          the ignorant, the erring, and the wicked, must be an evil
          inconceivably great. The Romish theory if true might be a blessing; if
          false it must be an awful curse. That it is false may be demonstrated
          to the satisfaction of all who do not wish it to be true, and who,
          unlike the Oxford Tractarian, are not determined to believe it because
          they love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. The Romish definition of the Church is derived from what the Church
          of Rome now is
        </p>
        <p>
          Before presenting a brief outline of the argument against this theory,
          it may be well to remark that the Romish definition of the Church is
          purely empirical. It is not derived from the signification or usage of
          the word ἐκκλησία in the New Testament; nor from what is there taught
          concerning the Church. It is merely a statement of what the Church of
          Rome now is. It is a body professing the same faith, united in the
          communion of the same sacraments, subject to pastors (i.e., bishops)
          assumed to be lawful, and to the Pope as the vicar of Christ. Now in
          this definition it is gratuitously assumed,—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the Church to which the promise of divine guidance is given,
          is an external, visible organization; and not the people of God as
          such in their personal and individual relation to Christ. In other
          words, it is assumed that the Church is a visible society, and not a
          collective term for the people of God; as when it is said of Paul that
          he persecuted the Church; and of Christ that He loved the Church and
          gave himself for it. Christ certainly did not die for any external,
          visible, organized Society.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Romish theory assumes, not only that the Church is an external
          organization, but that it must be organized in one definite,
          prescribed form. But this assumption is not only unreasonable, it is
          unscriptural, because no one form is prescribed in Scripture as
          essential to the being of the Church; and because it is contrary to
          the whole spirit and character of the gospel, that forms of government
          should be necessary to the spiritual life and salvation of men.
          Moreover, this assumption is inconsistent with historical facts. The
          Church in all its parts has never been organized according to one
          plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But conceding that the Church is an external society, and that it
          must be organized according to one plan, it is a gratuitous and
          untenable presumption, that that plan must be the episcopal. It is a
          notorious fact that diocesan episcopacy did not exist during the
          apostolic age. It is equally notorious that that plan of government
          was gradually introduced. And it is no less notorious that a large
          part of the Church in which Christ dwells by his presence, and which
          He in every way acknowledges and honours, has no bishops until the
          present day. The government of the Church by bishops, Romanists admit
          is one of the institutions which rest not on Scripture, but on
          tradition for their authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But should everything else be conceded, the assumption that
          subjection to the Pope, as the vicar of Christ, is necessary to the
          existence of the Church, is utterly unreasonable. This is the climax.
          There is not the slightest evidence in the New Testament or in the
          apostolic age, that Peter had any such primacy among the Apostles as
          Romanists claim. There is not only the absence of all evidence that he
          exercised any jurisdiction over them, but there is abundant evidence
          to the contrary. This is clear from Peter, James, and John, being
          mentioned together as those who appeared to be pillars (Gal. 2:9), and
          this distinction was due not to office, but to character. It is
          moreover clear from the full equality in gifts and authority which
          Paul asserted for himself, and proved to the satisfaction of the whole
          Church that he possessed. It is clear from the subordinate position
          occupied by Peter in the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15), and from the
          severe reproof he received from Paul at Antioch (Gal. 2:11–21). It is
          a plain historical fact, that Paul and John were the master-spirits of
          the Apostolic Church. But admitting the primacy of Peter in the
          college of Apostles, there is no evidence that such primacy was
          intended to be perpetual. There is no command to elect a successor to
          him in that office; no rules given as to the mode of such election, or
          the persons by whom the choice was to be made; and no record of such
          election having actually been made. Everything is made out of the air.
          But admitting that Peter was constituted the head of the whole Church
          on earth, and that such headship was intended to be continued, what
          evidence is there that the Bishop of Rome was to all time entitled to
          that office? It is very doubtful whether Peter ever was in Rome. The
          sphere of his labors was in Palestine and the East. It is certain he
          never was Bishop of the Church in that city. And even if he were, he
          was Primate, not as Bishop of Rome, but by appointment of Christ.
          According to the theory, he was Primate before he went to Rome, and
          not because he went there. The simple historical fact is, that as Rome
          was the seat of the Roman empire, the Bishop of Rome aspired to be the
          head of the Church, which claim after a long struggle came to be
          acknowledged, at least in the West. It is on the four gratuitous and
          unreasonable assumptions above mentioned, namely, that the Church to
          which the promise of the Spirit was made is an external, visible
          organization; that a particular mode of organization is essential to
          its existence; that that mode is the episcopal; and that it must be
          papal, i.e., the whole episcopacy be subject to the Bishop of Rome;—it
          is on these untenable assumptions that the whole stupendous system of
          Romanism rests. If any one of them fail, the whole falls to the
          ground. These assumptions are so entirely destitute of any adequate
          historical proof, that no reasonable man can accept them on their own
          evidence. It is only those who have been taught or induced to believe
          the extant Church to be infallible, who can believe them. And they
          believe not because these points can be proved, but on the assertion
          of the Church. The Romish Church says that Christ constituted the
          Church on the papal system, and therefore, it is to be believed. The
          thing to be proved is taken for granted. It is a petitio principii
          from beginning to end.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. The Romish Doctrine of Infallibility founded on a Wrong Theory of
          the Church
        </p>
        <p>
          The first great argument of Protestants against Romanism concerns the
          theory of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          God entered into a covenant with Abraham. In that covenant there were
          certain promises which concerned his natural descendants through
          Isaac, which promises were suspended on the national obedience of the
          people. That covenant, however, contained the promise of redemption
          through Christ. He was the seed in whom all the nations of the earth
          were to be blessed. The Jews came to believe that this promise of
          redemption, i.e., of the blessings of the Messiah's reign, was made to
          them as a nation; and that it was conditioned on membership in that
          nation. All who were Jews either by descent or proselytism, and who
          were circumcised, and adhered to the Law, were saved. All others would
          certainly perish forever. This is the doctrine which our Lord so
          pointedly condemned, and against which St. Paul so strenuously argued.
          When the Jews claimed that they were the children of God, because they
          were the children of Abraham, Christ told them that they might be the
          children of Abraham, and yet the children of the devil (John 8:33–44);
          as John, his forerunner, had before said, say not "We have Abraham to
          our father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to
          raise up children unto Abraham." (Matt. 3:9.) It is against this
          doctrine the epistles to the Romans and Galatians are principally
          directed. The Apostle shows, (1.) That the promise of salvation was
          not confined to the Jews, or to the members of any external
          organization. (2.) And therefore that it was not conditioned on
          descent from Abraham, nor on circumcision, nor on adherence to the Old
          Testament theocracy. (3.) That all believers (οἱ ἐκ πίστεως) are the
          sons, and, therefore, the heirs of Abraham. (Gal. 3:7.) (4.) That a
          man might be a Jew, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, circumcised on the eighth
          day, and touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless, and
          yet it avail him nothing. (Phil. 3:4–6.) (5.) Because he is not a Jew
          who is one outwardly; and circumcision is of the heart. (Romans
          2:28–29.) (6.) And consequently that God could cast off the Jews as a
          nation, without acting inconsistently with his covenant with Abraham,
          because the promise was not made to the Israel κατὰ σάρκα, but to the
          Israel κατὰ πνεῦμα. (Rom. 9:6–8.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Romanists have transferred the whole Jewish theory to the Christian
          Church; while Protestants adhere to the doctrine of Christ and his
          Apostles. Romanists teach, (1.) That the Church is essentially an
          external, organized community, as the commonwealth of Israel. (2.)
          That to this external society, all the attributes, prerogatives, and
          promises of the true Church belong. (3.) That membership in that
          society is the indispensable condition of salvation; as it is only by
          union with the Church that men are united to Christ, and, through its
          ministrations, become partakers of his redemption. (4.) That all who
          die in communion with this external society, although they may, if not
          perfect at death, suffer for a longer or shorter period in purgatory,
          shall ultimately be saved. (5.) All outside of this external
          organization perish eternally. There is, therefore, not a single
          element of the Jewish theory which is not reproduced in the Romish.
          Protestant Doctrine of the Nature of the Church Protestants, on the
          other hand, teach on this subject, in exact accordance with the
          doctrine of Christ and the Apostles: (1.) That the Church as such, or
          in its essential nature, is not an external organization. (2.) All
          true believers, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, are members of that
          Church which is the body of Christ, no matter with what ecclesiastical
          organization they may be connected, and even although they have no
          such connection. The thief on the cross was saved, though he was not a
          member of any external Church. (3.) Therefore, that the attributes,
          prerogatives, and promises of the Church do not belong to any external
          society as such, but to the true people of God collectively
          considered; and to external societies only so far as they consist of
          true believers, and are controlled by them. This is only saying what
          every man admits to be true, that the attributes, prerogatives, and
          promises pertaining to Christians belong exclusively to true
          Christians, and not to wicked or worldly men who call themselves
          Christians. (4.) That the condition of membership in the true Church
          is not union with any organized society, but faith in Jesus Christ.
          They are the children of God by faith; they are the sons of Abraham,
          heirs of the promise of redemption made to him by faith; whether they
          be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free; whether Protestants or Romanists,
          Presbyterians or Episcopalians; or whether they be so widely
          scattered, that no two or three of them are able to meet together for
          worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protestants do not deny that there is a visible Church Catholic on
          earth, consisting of all those who profess the true religion, together
          with their children. But they are not all included in any one external
          society. They also admit that it is the duty of Christians to unite
          for the purpose of worship and mutual watch and care. They admit that
          to such associations and societies certain prerogatives and promises
          belong; that they have, or ought to have the officers whose
          qualifications and duties are prescribed in the Scriptures; that there
          always have been, and probably always will be, such Christian
          organizations, or visible churches. But they deny that any one of
          these societies, or all of them collectively, constitute the Church
          for which Christ died; in which He dwells by his Spirit; to which He
          has promised perpetuity, catholicity, unity, and divine guidance into
          the knowledge of the truth. Any one of them, or all of them, one after
          another, may apostatize from the faith, and all the promises of God to
          his Church be fulfilled. The Church did not fail, when God reserved to
          himself only seven thousand in all Israel who had not bowed the knee
          unto Baal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost all the points of difference between Protestants and Romanists
          depend on the decision of the question, "What is the Church?" If their
          theory be correct; if the Church is the external society of professing
          Christians, subject to apostle-bishops (i.e., to bishops who are
          apostles), and to the Pope as Christ's vicar on earth; then we are
          bound to submit to it; and then too beyond the pale of that communion
          there is no salvation. But if every true believer is, in virtue of his
          faith, a member of that Church to which Christ promises guidance and
          salvation, then Romanism falls to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>The Opposing Theories of the Church</p>
        <p>
          That the two opposing theories of the Church, the Romish and
          Protestant, are what has been stated above is so generally known and
          so unquestioned, that it is unnecessary to cite authorities on either
          side. It is enough, so far as the doctrine of Romanists is concerned,
          to quote the language of Bellarmin, that the marks of the Church are
          three: "Professio veræ fidei, sacramentorum communio, et subjectio ad
          legitimum pastorem, Romanum Pontificem.—Atque hoc interest inter
          sententiam nostram et alias omnes, quod omnes aliæ requirunt internas
          virtutes ad constituendum aliquem in Ecclesia, et propterea Ecclesiam
          veram invisibilem faciunt; nos autem credimus in Ecclesia inveniri
          omnes virtutes,—tamen ut aliquis aliquo modo dici possit pars veræ
          Ecclesiæ,—non putamus requiri ullam internam virtutem, sed tantum
          externam professionem fidei, et sacramentorum communionem, quæ sensu
          ipso percipitur. Ecclesia enim est cœtus hominum ita visibilis et
          palpabilis, ut est cœtus Populi Romani, vel regnum Galliæ aut
          respublica Venetorum." The Lutheran Symbols define the Church as,
          "Congregatio sanctorum." "Congregatio sanctorum et vere credentium."2
          "Societas fidei et Spiritus Sancti in cordibus." "Congregatio
          sanctorum, qui habent inter se societatem ejusdem evangelii seu
          doctrinæ, et ejusdem Spiritus Sancti, qui corda eorum renovat,
          sanctificat et gubernat;" and4 "Populus spiritualis, non civilibus
          ritibus distinctus a gentibus, sed verus populus Dei renatus per
          Spiritum Sanctum."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Symbols of the Reformed Churches present the same doctrine. The
          Confessio Helvetica says, "Oportet semper fuisse, nunc esse et ad
          finem usque seculi futuram esse Ecclesiam, i.e., e mundo evocatum vel
          collectum cœtum fidelium, sanctorum inquam omnium communionem, eorum
          videlicet, qui Deum verum in Christo servatore per verbum et Spiritum
          Sanctum vere cognoscunt et rite colunt, denique omnibus bonis per
          Christum gratuito oblatis fide participant." Confessio Gallicana:
          "Affirmamus ex Dei verbo, Ecclesiam esse fidelium cœtum, qui in verbo
          Dei sequendo et pura religione colenda consentiunt, in qua etiam
          quotidie proficiunt."8 Confessio Belgica: "Credimus et confitemur
          unicam Ecclesiam catholicam seu universalem, quæ est sancta
          congregatio seu cœtus omnium fidelium Christianorum, qui totam suam
          salutem ab uno Jesu Christo exspectant, abluti ipsius sanguine et per
          Spiritum ejus sanctificati atque obsignati. Hæc Ecclesia sancta nullo
          est aut certo loco sita et circumscripta, aut ullis certis personis
          astricta aut alligata: sed per omnem orbem terrarum sparsa atque
          diffusa est." The same doctrine is found in the answer to the
          fifty-fourth question in the Heidelberg Catechism. In the Geneva
          Catechism to the question, "Quid est Ecclesia?" the answer is, "Corpus
          ac societas fidelium, quos Deus ad vitam æternam prædestinavit."10
          Winer in his "Comparative Darstellung," thus briefly states the two
          theories concerning the Church. Romanists, he says, "define the Church
          on earth, as the community of those baptized in the name of Christ,
          united under his Vicar, the Pope, its visible head. Protestants, on
          the other hand, as the communion of saints, that is, of those who
          truly believe on Christ, in which the gospel is purely preached and
          the sacraments properly administered."
        </p>
        <p>Proof of the Protestant Doctrine of the Church</p>
        <p>
          This is not the place to enter upon a formal vindication of the
          Protestant doctrine of the nature of the Church. That belongs to the
          department of ecclesiology. What follows may suffice for the present
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question is not whether the word Church is not properly used, and
          in accordance with the Scriptures, for visible, organized bodies of
          professing Christians, or for all such Christians collectively
          considered. Nor is it the question, whether we are to regard as
          Christians those who, being free from scandal, profess their faith in
          Christ, or societies of such professors organized for the worship of
          Christ and the administration of his discipline, as being true
          churches. But the question is, whether the Church to which the
          attributes, prerogatives, and promises pertaining to the body of
          Christ belong, is in its nature a visible, organized community; and
          specially, whether it is a community organized in some one exclusive
          form, and most specially on the papal form; or, whether it is a
          spiritual body consisting of true believers. Whether when the Bible
          addresses a body of men as "the called of Jesus Christ," "beloved of
          God," "partakers of the heavenly calling;" as "the children of God,
          joint heirs with Christ of a heavenly inheritance;" as "elect
          according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
          sanctification and sprinkling of the blood of Christ;" as "partakers
          of the like precious faith with the Apostles;" as "those who are
          washed, and sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
          and by the Spirit of our God;" as those who being dead in sin, had
          been "quickened and raised up and made to sit together in heavenly
          places with Christ Jesus;" it means the members of an external society
          as such, and because such, or, the true people of God? The question
          is, whether when to the men thus designated and described, Christ
          promised to be with them to the end of the world, to give them his
          Spirit, to guide them unto the knowledge of the truth, to keep them
          through the power of the Spirit, so that the gates of hell should not
          prevail against them—he means his sincere or his nominal
          disciples,—believers or unbelievers? These questions admit of but one
          answer. The attributes ascribed to the Church in Scripture belong to
          true believers alone. The promises made to the Church are fulfilled
          only to believers. The relation in which the Church stands to God and
          Christ is sustained alone by true believers. They only are the
          children and heirs of God; they only are the body of Christ in which
          He dwells by his Spirit; they only are the temple of God, the bride of
          Christ, the partakers of his glory. The doctrine that a man becomes a
          child of God and an heir of eternal life by membership in any external
          society, overturns the very foundations of the gospel, and introduces
          a new method of salvation. Yet this is the doctrine on which the whole
          system of Romanism rests. As, therefore, the Apostle shows that the
          promises made to Israel under the Old Testament, the promise of
          perpetuity, of extension over the whole earth, of the favour and
          fellowship of God, and all the blessings of the Messiah's reign, were
          not made to the external Israel as such, but to the true people of
          God; so Protestants contend that the promises made to the Church as
          the body and bride of Christ are not made to the external body of
          professed Christians, but to those who truly believe on him and obey
          his gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The absurdities which flow from the substitution of the visible Church
          for the invisible, from transferring the attributes, prerogatives, and
          promises which belong to true believers, to an organized body of
          nominal or professed believers, are so great that Romanists cannot be
          consistent. They cannot adhere to their own theory. They are forced to
          admit that the wicked are not really members of the Church. They are
          "in it" but not "of it." Their connection with it is merely external,
          as that of the chaff with the wheat. This, however, is the Protestant
          doctrine. The Romish doctrine is precisely the reverse. Romanists
          teach that the chaff is the wheat; that the chaff becomes wheat by
          external connection with the precious grain. Just so certain,
          therefore, as that chaff is not wheat; that nominal Christians, as
          such, are not true Christians; just so certain is it that no external
          society consisting of good and bad, is that Church to which the
          promise of Christ's presence and salvation is made. It is as Turrettin
          says, "πρῶτον ψεῦδος pontificiorum in tota controversia est, ecclesiam
          metiri velle ex societatis civilis modulo, ut ejus essentia in
          externis tantum et in sensus incurrentibus consistat, et sola
          professio fidei sufficiat ad membrum ecclesiæ constituendum, nec ipsa
          fides et pietas interna ad id necessario requirantur."

          D. The Doctrine of Infallibility founded on the False Assumption of
          the Perpetuity of the Apostleship
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first argument against the doctrine of Romanists as to the
          infallibility of the Church is, that it makes the Church of Rome to be
          the body to which the attributes, prerogatives, and promises of Christ
          to true believers belong; the second is that it limits the promise of
          the teaching of the Spirit, to the bishops as successors of the
          Apostles. In other words, Romanists falsely assume the perpetuity of
          the Apostleship. If it be true that the prelates of the Church of
          Rome, or of any other church, are apostles, invested with the same
          authority to teach and to rule as the original messengers of Christ,
          then we must be bound to yield the same faith to their teaching, and
          the same obedience to their commands, as are due to the inspired
          writings of the New Testament. And such is the doctrine of the Church
          of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>Modern Prelates are not Apostles</p>
        <p>
          To determine whether modern bishops are apostles, it is necessary in
          the first place to determine the nature of the Apostleship, and
          ascertain whether modern prelates have the gifts, qualifications, and
          credentials of the office. Who then were the Apostles? They were a
          definite number of men selected by Christ to be his witnesses, to
          testify to his doctrines, to the facts of his life, to his death, and
          specially to his resurrection. To qualify them for this office of
          authoritative witnesses, it was necessary, (1.) That they should have
          independent and plenary knowledge of the gospel. (2.) That they should
          have seen Christ after his resurrection. (3.) That they should be
          inspired, i.e., that they should be individually and severally so
          guided by the Spirit as to be infallible in all their instructions.
          (4.) That they should be authenticated as the messengers of Christ, by
          adherence to the true gospel, by success in preaching (Paul said to
          the Corinthians that they were the seal of his apostleship, 1 Cor.
          9:2); and by signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the
          Holy Ghost. Such were the gifts and qualifications and credentials of
          the original Apostles; and those who claimed the office without
          possessing these gifts and credentials, were pronounced false apostles
          and messengers of Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Paul claimed to be an apostle, he felt it necessary to prove,
          (1.) That he had been appointed not by man nor through men, but
          immediately by Jesus Christ. (Gal. 1:1.) (2.) That he had not been
          taught the gospel by others, but received his knowledge by immediate
          revelation. (Gal. 1:12.) (3.) That he had seen Christ after his
          resurrection. (1 Cor. 9:1 and 15:8.) (4.) That he was inspired, or
          infallible as a teacher, so that men were bound to recognize his
          teachings as the teaching of Christ. (1 Cor. 14:37.) (5.) That the
          Lord had authenticated his apostolic mission as fully as he had done
          that of Peter. (Gal. 2:8.) (6.) "The signs of an apostle," he tells
          the Corinthians, "were wrought among you in all patience, in signs,
          and wonders, and mighty deeds." (2 Cor. 12:12.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern prelates do not claim to possess any one of these gifts. Nor do
          they pretend to the credentials which authenticated the mission of the
          Apostles of Christ. They claim no immediate commission; no independent
          knowledge derived from immediate revelation; no personal
          infallibility; no vision of Christ; and no gift of miracles. That is,
          they claim the authority of the office, but not its reality. It is
          very plain, therefore, that they are not apostles. They cannot have
          the authority of the office without having the gifts on which that
          authority was founded, and from which it emanated. If a man cannot be
          a prophet without the gift of prophecy; or a miracle-worker without
          the gift of miracles; or have the gift of tongues without the ability
          to speak other languages than his own; no man can rightfully claim to
          be an apostle without possessing the gifts which made the original
          Apostles what they were. The deaf and dumb might as reasonably claim
          to have the gift of tongues. The world has never seen or suffered a
          greater imposture than that weak, ignorant, and often immoral men,
          should claim the same authority to teach and rule that belonged to men
          to whom the truth was supernaturally revealed, who were confessedly
          infallible in its communication, and to whose divine mission God
          himself bore witness in signs and wonders, and divers miracles and
          gifts of the Holy Ghost. The office of the Apostles as described in
          the New Testament, was, therefore, from its nature incapable of being
          transmitted, and has not in fact been perpetuated.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no command given in the New Testament to keep up the
          succession of the Apostles. When Judas had apostatized, Peter said his
          place must be filled, but the selection was to be confined to those,
          as he said, "which have companied with us all the time that the Lord
          Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John
          unto that same day that He was taken up from us." (Acts 1:21, 22.) The
          reason assigned for this appointment was not that the Apostleship
          might be continued, but that the man selected might be "a witness with
          us of his resurrection." "And they gave forth their lots; and the lot
          fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles." And
          that was the end. We never hear of Matthias afterward. It is very
          doubtful whether this appointment of Matthias had any validity. What
          is here recorded (Acts, 1:15–26), took place before the Apostles had
          been endued with power from on high (Acts 1:8), and, therefore, before
          they had any authority to act in the premises. Christ in his own time
          and way completed the number of his witnesses by calling Paul to be an
          Apostle. But, however this may be, here if ever exceptio probat
          regulam. It proves that the ranks of the Apostles could be filled, and
          the succession continued only from the number of those who could bear
          independent witness of the resurrection and doctrines of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the fact that there is no command to appoint apostles, there
          is clear evidence that the office was not designed to be perpetuated.
          With regard to all the permanent officers of the Church, there is,
          (1.) Not only a promise to continue the gifts which pertained to the
          office, and the command to appoint suitable persons to fill it, but
          also a specification of the qualifications to be sought and demanded;
          and (2.) a record of the actual appointment of incumbents; and (3.)
          historical evidence of their continuance in the Church from that day
          to this. With regard to the Apostleship, all this is wanting. As we
          have seen, the gifts of the office have not been continued, there is
          no command to perpetuate the office, no directions to guide the Church
          in the selection of proper persons to be apostles, no record of their
          appointment, and no historical evidence of their continuance; on the
          contrary, they disappear entirely after the death of the original
          twelve. It might as well be asserted that the Pharaohs of Egypt, or
          the twelve Cæsars of Rome have been continued, as that the race of
          apostles has been perpetuated.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that there are a few passages in which persons other than
          the original twelve seem to be designated as apostles. But from the
          beginning of the Church until of late, no one has ventured on that
          account to regard Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, and Titus, as apostles, in
          the official sense of the word. All the designations given to the
          officers of the Church in the New Testament, are used in different
          senses. Thus, "presbyter" or "elder," means, an old man, a Jewish
          officer, an officer of the Church. The word "deacon," means, a
          domestic, sometimes a secular officer, sometimes any minister of the
          Church; sometimes the lowest order of church officers. Because Paul
          and Peter call themselves "deacons," it does not prove that their
          office was to serve tables. In like manner the word "apostle" is
          sometimes used in its etymological sense "a messenger," sometimes in a
          religious sense, as we use the word "missionary;" and sometimes in its
          strict official sense, in which it is confined to the immediate
          messengers of Christ. Nothing can be plainer from the New Testament
          than that neither Silas nor Timothy, nor any other person, is ever
          spoken of as the official equal of the twelve Apostles. These
          constitute a class by themselves. They stand out in the New Testament
          as they do in all Church history, as the authoritative founders of the
          Christian Church, without peers or colleagues. If, then, the
          Apostleship, from its nature and design, was incapable of
          transmission; if there be this decisive evidence from Scripture and
          history, that it has not been perpetuated, then the whole theory of
          the Romanists concerning the Church falls to the ground. That theory
          is founded on the assumption that prelates are apostles, invested with
          the same authority to teach and rule, as the original messengers of
          Christ. If this assumption is unfounded, then all claim to the
          infallibility of the Church must be given up; for it is not pretended
          that the mass of the people is infallible nor the priesthood, but
          simply the episcopate. And bishops are infallible only on the
          assumption that they are apostles, in the official sense of the term.
          This they certainly are not. The Church may make priests, and bishops,
          and even popes; but Christ alone can make an Apostle. For an Apostle
          was a man endowed with supernatural knowledge, and with supernatural
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. Infallibility founded on a False Interpretation of the Promise of
          Christ The third decisive argument against the infallibility of the
          Church is, that Christ never promised to preserve it from all error.
          What is here meant is that Christ never promised the true Church, that
          is, "the company of true believers," that they should not err in
          doctrine. He did promise that they should not fatally apostatize from
          the truth. He did promise that He would grant his true disciples such
          a measure of divine guidance by his Spirit, that they should know
          enough to be saved. He, moreover, promised that He would call men into
          the ministry, and give them the qualifications of faithful teachers,
          such as were the presbyters whom the Apostles ordained in every city.
          But there is no promise of infallibility either to the Church as a
          whole, or to any class of men in the Church. Christ promised to
          sanctify his people; but this was not a promise to make them perfectly
          holy in this life. He promised to give them joy and peace in
          believing; but this is not a promise to make them perfectly happy in
          this life,—that they should have no trials or sorrows. Then, why
          should the promise to teach be a promise to render infallible. As the
          Church has gone through the world bathed in tears and blood, so has
          she gone soiled with sin and error. It is just as manifest that she
          has never been infallible, as that she has never been perfectly holy.
          Christ no more promised the one than the other.
        </p>
        <p>F. The Doctrine contradicted by Facts</p>
        <p>
          The fourth argument is that the Romish doctrine of the infallibility
          of the Church is contradicted by undeniable historical facts. It
          therefore cannot be true. The Church has often erred, and therefore it
          is not infallible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protestants believe that the Church, under all dispensations, has been
          the same. It has always had the same God; the same Redeemer; the same
          rule of faith and practice (the written Word of God, at least from the
          time of Moses), the same promise of the presence and guidance of the
          Spirit, the same pledge of perpetuity and triumph. To them, therefore,
          the fact that the whole visible Church repeatedly apostatized during
          the old economy—and that, not the people only, but all the
          representatives of the Church, the priests, the Levites, and the
          elders—is a decisive proof that the external, visible Church may
          fatally err in matters of faith. No less decisive is the fact that the
          whole Jewish Church and people, as a church and nation, rejected
          Christ. He came to his own, and his own received him not. The vast
          majority of the people, the chief priests, the scribes and the elders,
          refused to recognize him as the Messiah. The Sanhedrim, the great
          representative body of the Church at that time, pronounced him worthy
          of death, and demanded his crucifixion. This, to Protestants, is
          overwhelming proof that the Church may err.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romanists, however, make such a difference between the Church before
          and after the advent of Christ, that they do not admit the force of
          this argument. That the Jewish Church erred, they say, is no proof
          that the Christian Church can err. It will be necessary, therefore, to
          show that according to the principles and admissions of Romanists
          themselves, the Church has erred. It taught at one time what it
          condemned at another, and what the Church of Rome now condemns. To
          prove this, it will suffice to refer to two undeniable examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be borne in mind that by the Church, in this connection,
          Romanists do not mean the true people of God; nor the body of
          professing Christians; nor the majority of priests, or doctors of
          divinity, but the episcopate. What the body of bishops of any age
          teach, all Christians are bound to believe, because these bishops are
          so guided by the Spirit as to be infallible in their teaching.
        </p>
        <p>The Arian Apostasy</p>
        <p>
          The first great historical fact inconsistent with this theory is, that
          the great majority of the bishops, both of the Eastern and Western
          Church, including the Pope of Rome, taught Arianism, which the whole
          Church, both before and afterwards, condemned. The decision of three
          hundred and eighty bishops at the Council of Nice, ratified by the
          assent of the great majority of those who did not attend that Council,
          is fairly taken as proof that the visible Church at that time taught,
          as Rome now teaches, that the Son is consubstantial with the Father.
          The fact that some dissented at the time, or that more soon joined in
          that dissent; or, that in a few years, in the East, the dissentients
          were in the majority, is not considered as invalidating the decision
          of that Council as the decision of the Church; because a majority of
          the bishops, as a body, were still in favor of the Nicene doctrine.
          Then, by parity of reasoning, the decisions of the two contemporary
          councils, one at Seleucia in the East, the other at Ariminum in the
          West, including nearly eight hundred bishops, ratified as those
          decisions were by the great majority of the bishops of the whole
          Church (including Liberius, the bishop of Rome), must be accepted as
          the teaching of the visible Church of that age. But those decisions,
          according to the previous and subsequent judgment of the Church, were
          heretical. It has been urged that the language adopted by the Council
          of Ariminum admits of an orthodox interpretation. In answer to this,
          it is enough to say, (1.) That it was drawn up, proposed, and urged by
          the avowed opponents of the Nicene Creed. (2.) That it was strenuously
          resisted by the advocates of that creed, and renounced as soon as they
          gained the ascendency. (3.) That Mr. Palmer himself admits that the
          Council repudiated the word "consubstantial" as expressing the
          relation of the Son to the Father. But this was the precise point in
          dispute between the Orthodox and semi-Arians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ancients and moderns unite in testifying to the general prevalence of
          Arianism at that time. Gregory Nazianzen says, "Nam si perpaucos
          exceperis, … omnes (pastores) tempori obsecuti sunt: hoc tantum inter
          eos discriminis fuit, quod alii citius, alii serius in eam fraudem
          inciderunt, atque, alii impietatis duces antistitesque se præbuerunt."
          Jerome says: "Ingemuit totus orbis terrarum, et Arianum se esse
          miratus est." He also says:2 "Ecclesia non parietibus consistit, sed
          in dogmatum veritate, Ecclesia ibi est ubi fides vera est. Ceterum
          ante annos quindecim aut viginti parietes omnes hic ecclesiarum
          hæretici (Ariani) possidebant, Ecclesia autem vera illic erat, ubi
          vera fides erat." It is here asserted that the whole world had become
          Arian; and that all the churches were in the possession of heretics.
          These statements must be taken with due allowance. They nevertheless
          prove that the great majority of the bishops had adopted the Arian, or
          semi-Arian Creed. To the same effect Athanasius says: "Quæ nunc
          ecclesia libere Christum adorat? Si quidem ea, si pia est, periculo
          subjacet?… Nam si alicubi pii et Christi studiosi (sunt autem ubique
          tales permulti) illi itidem, ut Prophetæ et magnus ille Elias,
          absconduntur, … et in speluncas et cavernas terræ sese abstrudunt, aut
          in solitudine aberrantes commorantur." Vincent of Lerins4 says:
          "Arianorum venenum non jam portiunculam quamdam, sed pene orbem totum
          contaminaverat, adeo ut prope cunctis Latini sermonis episcopis partim
          vi partim fraude deceptis caligo quædam mentibus effunderetur." To
          these ancient testimonies any number of authorities from modern
          theologians might be added. We give only the testimony of Dr. Jackson,
          one of the most distinguished theologians of the Church of England:
          "After this defection of the Romish Church in the bishop Liberius, the
          whole Roman empire was overspread with Arianism."
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever doubt may exist as to details, the general fact of this
          apostasy cannot be doubted. Through defection from the truth, through
          the arts of the dominant party, through the influence of the emperor,
          the great majority of the bishops did join in condemnation of
          Athanasius, and in subscribing a formula of doctrine drawn up in
          opposition to the Nicene Creed; a formula afterwards renounced and
          condemned; a formula which the Bishop of Rome was banished for two
          years for refusing to sign, and restored to his see when he consented
          to subscribe. If, then, we apply to this case the same rules which are
          applied to the decisions of the Nicene Council, it must be admitted
          that the external Church apostatized as truly under Constantius, as it
          professed the true faith under Constantine. If many signed the
          Eusebian or Arian formula insincerely, so did many hypocritically
          assent to the decrees of Nice. If many were overborne by authority and
          fear in the one case, so they were in the other. If many revoked their
          assent to Arianism, quite as many withdrew their consent to the
          Athanasian doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>The Romish Evasion of this Argument</p>
        <p>
          In dealing with this undeniable fact, Romanists and Romanizers are
          forced to abandon their principle. Their doctrine is that the external
          Church cannot err, that the majority of the bishops living at any one
          time cannot fail to teach the truth. But under the reign of the
          Emperor Constantius, it is undeniable that the vast majority,
          including the Bishop of Rome, did renounce the truth. But, says
          Bellarmin, the Church continued and was conspicuous in Athanasius,
          Hilary, Eusebius, and others. And Mr. Palmer, of Oxford says,2 "The
          truth was preserved under even Arian bishops." But the question is
          not, whether the truth shall be preserved and confessed by the true
          children of God? but, whether any external, organized body, and
          specially the Church of Rome, can err in its teaching? Romanists
          cannot be allowed, merely to meet an emergency, to avail themselves of
          the Protestant doctrine that the Church may consist of scattered
          believers. It is true as Jerome teaches in the passage above quoted,
          "Ubi fides vera est, ibi Ecclesia est." But that is our doctrine, and
          not the doctrine of Rome. Protestants say with full confidence,
          "Ecclesia manet et manebit." But whether in conspicuous glory as in
          the time of David, or in scattered believers as in the days of Elias,
          is not essential.
        </p>
        <p>The Church of Rome rejects the Doctrines of Augustine</p>
        <p>
          A second case in which the external church (and specially the Church
          of Rome) has departed from what it had itself declared to be true, is
          in the rejection of the doctrines known in history as Augustinian.
          That the peculiar doctrines of Augustine, including the doctrine of
          sinful corruption of nature derived from Adam, which is spiritual
          death, and involves entire inability on the part of the sinner to
          convert himself or to coöperate in his own regeneration; the necessity
          of the certainly efficacious operation of divine grace; the
          sovereignty of God in election and reprobation, and the certain
          perseverance of the saints; were sanctioned by the whole Church, and
          specially by the Church of Rome, cannot be disputed. The eighteenth
          chapter of Wiggers' "Augustinianism and Pelagianism," is headed, "The
          final adoption of the Augustinian system for all Christendom by the
          third ecumenical council of Ephesus, A.D. 431." It is not denied that
          many of the eastern bishops, perhaps the majority of them, were
          secretly opposed to that system in its essential features. All that is
          insisted upon is that the whole Church, through what Romanists
          recognize as its official organs, gave its sanction to Augustine's
          peculiar doctrines; and that so far as the Latin Church is concerned
          this assent was not only for the time general but cordial. It is no
          less certain that the Council of Trent, while it condemned
          Pelagianism, and even the peculiar doctrine of semi-Pelagians, who
          said that man began the work of conversion, thus denying the necessity
          of preventing grace (gratia preveniens), nevertheless repudiated the
          distinguishing doctrines of Augustine and anathematized all who held
          them.
        </p>
        <p>G. The Church of Rome now teaches Error</p>
        <p>
          A fifth argument against the infallibility of the Church of Rome, is
          that, that Church now teaches error. Of this there can be no
          reasonable doubt, if the Scriptures be admitted as the standard of
          judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a monstrous error, contrary to the Bible, to its letter and
          spirit, and shocking to the common sense of mankind, that the
          salvation of men should be suspended on their acknowledging the Pope
          to be the head of the Church in the world, or the vicar of Christ.
          This makes salvation independent of faith and character. A man may be
          sincere and intelligent in his faith in God and Christ, and perfectly
          exemplary in his Christian life, yet if he does not acknowledge the
          Pope, he must perish forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is a grievous error, contrary to the express teachings of the
          Bible, that the sacraments are the only channels of communicating to
          men the benefits of redemption. In consequence of this false
          assumption, Romanists teach that all who die unbaptized, even infants,
          are lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is a great error to teach as the Church of Rome does teach, that
          the ministers of the gospel are priests; that the people have no
          access to God or Christ, and cannot obtain the remission of sins or
          other saving blessings, except through their intervention and by their
          ministrations; that the priests have the power not only of
          declarative, but of judicial and effective absolution, so that those
          and those only whom they absolve stand acquitted at the bar of God.
          This was the grand reason for the Reformation, which was a rebellion
          against this priestly domination; a demand on the part of the people
          for the liberty wherewith Christ had made them free,—the liberty to go
          immediately to him with their sins and sorrows, and find relief
          without the intervention or permission of any man who has no better
          right of access than themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The doctrine of the merit of good works as taught by Romanists is
          another most prolific error. They hold that works done after
          regeneration have real merit (meritum condigni), and that they are the
          ground of the sinner's justification before God. They hold that a man
          may do more than the law requires of him, and perform works of
          supererogation, and thus obtain more merit than is necessary for his
          own salvation and beatification. That this superfluous merit goes into
          the treasury of the Church, and may be dispensed for the benefit of
          others. On this ground indulgences are granted or sold, to take effect
          not only in this life but in the life to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. With this is connected the further error concerning Purgatory. The
          Church of Rome teaches that those dying in the communion of the
          Church, who have not in this life made full satisfaction for their
          sins, or acquired sufficient merit to entitle them to admission into
          heaven, do at death pass into a state of suffering, there to remain
          until due satisfaction is made and proper purification is effected.
          There is no necessary termination to this state of purgatory but the
          day of judgment or the end of the world. It may last for a thousand or
          many thousands of years. But Purgatory is under the power of the keys.
          The sufferings of souls in that state may be alleviated or shortened
          by the authorized ministers of the Church. There is no limit to the
          power of men who are believed to hold the keys of heaven in their
          hand, to shut and no man opens, and open and no man shuts. Of all
          incredibilities the most incredible is that God would commit such
          power as this, to weak, ignorant, and often wicked men.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The Romish Church teaches grievous error concerning the Lord's
          Supper. It teaches, (1.) That when consecrated by the priest the whole
          substance of the bread and the whole substance of the wine are
          transmuted into the substance of the body and blood of Christ. (2.)
          That as his body is inseparable from his soul and divinity, where the
          one is there the other must be. The whole Christ, therefore, body,
          soul, and divinity, is present in the consecrated wafer, which is to
          be worshipped as Christ himself is worshipped. This is the reason why
          the Church of England in her Homilies pronounces the service of the
          Mass in the Romish Church idolatrous. (3.) That Church further teaches
          that the body and blood of Christ thus locally and substantially
          present in the Eucharist are offered as a true propitiatory sacrifice
          for the forgiveness of sin, the application of which is determined by
          the intention of the officiating priests.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Idolatry consists not only in the worship of false gods, but in the
          worship of the true God by images. The second Commandment of the
          Decalogue expressly forbids the bowing down to, or serving the
          likeness of anything in heaven above or in the earth beneath. In the
          Hebrew the words used are, והָחֲתַּשְׁהִ and בדַצָ. In the Septuagint
          the words are, οὐ προσκυνήσεις αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ μὴ λατρεύσεις αὐτοῖς. In
          the Vulgate it reads, "Non adorabis ea neque coles." The precise
          thing, therefore, that is forbidden is that which the Church of Rome
          permits and enjoins, namely, the use of images in religious worship,
          prostration before them, and doing them reverence.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Another great error of the Church of Rome is the worship of saints
          and angels, and especially of the Virgin Mary. It is not merely that
          they are regarded as objects of reverence, but that the service
          rendered them involves the ascription of divine attributes. They are
          assumed to be everywhere present, able to hear and answer prayer, to
          help and to save. They become the ground of confidence to the people,
          and the objects of their religious affections. They are to them
          precisely what the gods of the heathen were to the Greeks and Romans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are some of the errors taught by the Church of Rome, and they
          prove that that Church instead of being infallible, is so corrupt that
          it is the duty of the people of God to come out of it and to renounce
          its fellowship.
        </p>
        <p>
          H. The Recognition of an Infallible Church incompatible with either
          Religious or Civil Liberty
        </p>
        <p>
          A church which claims to be infallible, ipso facto, claims to be the
          mistress of the world; and those who admit its infallibility, thereby
          admit their entire subjection to its authority. It avails nothing to
          say that this infallibility is limited to matters of faith and morals,
          for under those heads is included the whole life of man, religious,
          moral, domestic, social, and political.
        </p>
        <p>
          A church which claims the right to decide what is true in doctrine and
          obligatory in morals, and asserts the power to enforce submission to
          its decisions on the pain of eternal perdition, leaves no room for any
          other authority upon earth. In the presence of the authority of God,
          every other disappears.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the claim to infallibility is inseparably connected the claim to
          pardon sin. The Church does not assume merely the right to declare the
          conditions on which sin will be forgiven at the bar of God, but it
          asserts that it has the prerogative to grant, or to withhold that
          forgiveness. "Ego te absolvo," is the formula the Church puts into the
          mouth of its priesthood. Those who receive that absolution are saved;
          those whom the Church refuses to absolve must bear the penalty of
          their offenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          An infallible church is thus the only institute of salvation. All
          within its pale are saved; all without it perish. Those only are in
          the Church who believe what it teaches, who do what it commands, and
          are subject to its officers, and especially its head, the Roman
          pontiff. Any man, therefore, whom the Church excommunicates is thereby
          shut out of the kingdom of heaven; any nation placed under its ban is
          not only deprived of the consolations of religious services, but of
          the necessary means of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Church be infallible, its authority is no less absolute in the
          sphere of social and political life. It is immoral to contract or to
          continue an unlawful marriage, to keep an unlawful oath, to enact
          unjust laws, to obey a sovereign hostile to the Church. The Church,
          therefore, has the right to dissolve marriages, to free men from the
          obligations of their oaths, and citizens from their allegiance, to
          abrogate civil laws, and to depose sovereigns. These prerogatives have
          not only been claimed, but time and again exercised by the Church of
          Rome. They all of right belong to that Church, if it be infallible. As
          these claims are enforced by penalties involving the loss of the soul,
          they cannot be resisted by those who admit the Church to be
          infallible. It is obvious, therefore, that where this doctrine is held
          there can be no liberty of opinion, no freedom of conscience, no civil
          or political freedom. As the recent ecumenical Council of the Vatican
          has decided that this infallibility is vested in the Pope, it is
          henceforth a matter of faith with Romanists, that the Roman pontiff is
          the absolute sovereign of the world. All men are bound, on the penalty
          of eternal death, to believe what he declares to be true, and to do
          whatever he decides is obligatory.
