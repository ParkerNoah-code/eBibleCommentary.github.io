        <h2>I. Genuineness of the Christian Documents</h2>
        <p>
          I. The Genuineness of the Christian Documents,—or proof that the books
          of the Old and New Testaments were written at the age to which they
          are assigned and by the men or class of men to whom they are ascribed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our present discussion comprises the first part, and only the first
          part, of the doctrine of the Canon (κανών a measuring-reed; hence, a
          rule, a standard). It is important to observe that the determination
          of the Canon, or list of the books of sacred Scripture, is not the
          work of the church as an organized body. We do not receive these books
          upon the authority of Fathers or Councils. We receive them, only as
          the Fathers and Councils received them, because we have evidence that
          they are the writings of the men, or class of men, whose names they
          bear, and that they are also credible and inspired. If the previous
          epistle alluded to in 1Co_5:9 should be discovered and be universally
          judged authentic, it could be placed with Paul’s other letters and
          could form part of the Canon, even though it has been lost for 1800
          years. Bruce, Apologetics, 321—“Abstractly the Canon is an open
          question. It can never be anything else on the principles of
          Protestantism which forbid us to accept the decisions of church
          councils, whether ancient or modern, as final. But practically the
          question of the Canon is closed.” The Westminster Confession says that
          the authority of the word of God “does not rest upon historic
          evidence; it does not rest upon the authority of Councils; it does not
          rest upon the consent of the past or the excellence of the matter; but
          it rests upon the Spirit of God bearing witness to our hearts
          concerning its divine authority.” Clarke, Christian Theology, 24—“The
          value of the Scriptures to us does not depend upon our knowing who
          wrote them. In the O. T. half its pages are of uncertain authorship.
          New dates mean new authorship. Criticism is a duty, for dates of
          authorship give means of interpretation. The Scriptures have power
          because God is in them, and because they describe the entrance of God
          into the life of man.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Saintine, Picciola, 782—“Has not a feeble reed provided man with his
          first arrow, his first pen, his first instrument of music?” Hugh
          Macmillan: “The idea of stringed instruments was first derived from
          the twang of the well strung bow, as the archer shot his arrows; the
          lyre and the harp which discourse the sweetest music of peace were
          invented by those who first heard this inspiring sound in the
          excitement of battle. And so there is no music so delightful amid the
          jarring discord of the world, turning everything to music and
          harmonizing earth and heaven, as when the heart rises out of the gloom
          of anger and revenge, and converts its bow into a harp, and sings to
          it the Lord’s song of infinite forgiveness.” George Adam Smith, Mod,
          Criticism and Preaching of O. T., 5—“The church has never renounced
          her liberty to revise the Canon. The liberty at the beginning cannot
          be more than the liberty thereafter. The Holy Spirit has not forsaken
          the leaders of the church. Apostolic writers nowhere define the limits
          of the Canon, any more than Jesus did. Indeed, they employed
          extra-canonical writings. Christ and the apostles nowhere bound the
          church to believe all the teachings of the O. T. Christ discriminates,
          and forbids the literal interpretation of its contents. Many of the
          apostolic interpretations challenge our sense of truth. Much of their
          exegesis was temporary and false. Their judgment was that much in the
          O. T. was rudimentary. This opens the question of development in
          revelation, and justifies the attempt to fix the historic order. The
          N. T. criticism of the O. T. gives the liberty of criticism, and the
          need, and the obligation of it. O. T. criticism is not, like Baur’s of
          the N. T., the result of a priori Hegelian reasoning. From the time of
          Samuel we have real history. The prophets do not appeal to miracles.
          There is more gospel in the book of Jonah, when it is treated as a
          parable. The O. T. is a gradual ethical revelation of God. Few realize
          that the church of Christ has a higher warrant for her Canon of the O.
          T. than she has for her Canon of the N. T. The O. T. was the result of
          criticism in the widest sense of that word. But what the church thus
          once achieved, the church may at any time revise.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve to a point somewhat later the proof of the credibility and
          the inspiration of the Scriptures. We now show their genuineness, as
          we would show the genuineness of other religious books, like the
          Koran, or of secular documents, like Cicero’s Orations against
          Catiline. Genuineness, in the sense in which we use the term, does not
          necessarily imply authenticity (i. e., truthfulness and authority);
          see Blunt, Diet. Doct. and Hist. Theol., art.: Authenticity. Documents
          may be genuine which are written in whole or in part by persons other
          than they whose names they bear, provided these persons belong to the
          same class. The Epistle to the Hebrews, though not written by Paul, is
          genuine, because it proceeds from one of the apostolic class. The
          addition of Deu_34:1-12, after Moses’ death, does not invalidate the
          genuineness of the Pentateuch; nor would the theory of a later Isaiah,
          even if it were established, disprove the genuineness of that
          prophecy; provided, in both cases, that the additions were made by men
          of the prophetic class. On the general subject of the genuineness of
          the Scripture documents, see Alexander, McDvaine, Chalmers, Dodge, and
          Peabody, on the Evidences of Christianity; also Archibald, The Bible
          Verified.
        </p>
        <p>1. Genuineness of the Books of the New Testament.</p>
        <p>
          We do not need to adduce proof of the existence of the books of the
          New Testament as far back as the third century, for we possess
          manuscripts of them which are at least fourteen hundred years old,
          and, since the third century, references to them have been inwoven
          into all history and literature. We begin our proof, therefore, by
          showing that these documents not only existed, but were generally
          accepted as genuine, before the close of the second century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen was born as early as 186 a.d.; yet Tregelles tells us that
          Origen’s works contain citations embracing two-thirds of the New
          Testament. Hatch, Hibbert Lectures, 12—“The early years of
          Christianity were in some respects like the early years of our
          lives.…Those early years are the most important in our education. We
          learn then, we hardly know how, through effort and struggle and
          innocent mistakes, to use our eyes and ears, to measure distance and
          direction, by a process which ascends by unconscious steps to the
          certainty which we feel in our maturity.…It was in some such
          unconscious way that the Christian thought of the early centuries
          gradually acquired the form which we find when it emerges as it were
          into the developed manhood of the fourth century.”
        </p>
        <p>
          A. All the books of the New Testament, with the single exception of 2
          Peter, were not only received as genuine, but were used in more or
          less collected form, in the latter half of the second century. These
          collections of writings, so slowly transcribed and distributed, imply
          the long continued previous existence of the separate books, and
          forbid us to fix their origin later than the first half of the second
          century.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Tertullian (160–230) appeals to the ‘New Testament’ as made up of
          the ‘Gospels’ and ‘Apostles.’ He vouches for the genuineness of the
          four gospels, the Acts, 1 Peter, 1 John, thirteen epistles of Paul,
          and the Apocalypse; in short, to twenty-one of the twenty-seven books
          of our Canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanday, Bampton Lectures for 1893, is confident that the first three
          gospels took their present shape before the destruction of Jerusalem.
          Yet he thinks the first and third gospels of composite origin, and
          probably the second. Not later than 125 a.d. the four gospels of our
          Canon had gained a recognized and exceptional authority. Andover
          Professors, Divinity of Jesus Christ, 40—“The oldest of our gospels
          was written about the year 70. The earlier one, now lost, a great part
          of which is preserved in Luke and Matthew, was probably written a few
          years earlier.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The Muratorian Canon in the West and the Peshito Version in the
          East (having a common date of about 160) in their catalogues of the
          New Testament writings mutually complement each other’s slight
          deficiencies, and together witness to the fact that at that time every
          book of our present New Testament, with the exception of 2 Peter, was
          received as genuine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hovey, Manual of Christian Theology, 50—“The fragment on the Canon,
          discovered by Muratori in 1738, was probably written about 170 a.d.,
          in Greek. It begins with the last words of a sentence which must have
          referred to the Gospel of Mark, and proceeds to speak of the Third
          Gospel as written by Luke the physician, who did not see the Lord, and
          then of the Fourth Gospel as written by John, a disciple of the Lord,
          at the request of his fellow disciples and his elders.” Bacon, N. T.
          Introduction, 50, gives the Muratorian Canon in full; 30—“Theophilus
          of Antioch (181–190) is the first to cite a gospel by name, quoting
          Joh_1:1 as from ‘John, one of those who were vessels of the Spirit.”
          On the Muratorian Canon, see Tregelles, Muratorian Canon. On the
          Peshito Version, see Schaff, Introd. to Rev. Gk.-Eng. N.T., xxxvii;
          Smith’s Bible Dict., pp. 3388, 3389.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The Canon of Marcion (140), though rejecting all the gospels but
          that of Luke, and all the epistles but ten of Paul’s, shows,
          nevertheless, that at that early day “apostolic writings were regarded
          as a complete original rule of doctrine.” Even Marcion, moreover, does
          not deny the genuineness of those writings which for doctrinal reasons
          he rejects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcion, the Gnostic, was the enemy of all Judaism, and regarded the
          God of the O. T. as a restricted divinity, entirely different from the
          God of the N. T. Marcion was “ipso Paulo paulinior”—“plus loyal que le
          roi.” He held that Christianity was something entirely new, and that
          it stood in opposition to all that went before it. His Canon consisted
          of two parts: the “Gospel” (Luke, with its text curtailed by omission
          of the Hebraistic elements) and the Apostolicon (the epistles of
          Paul). The epistle to Diognetus by an unknown author, and the epistle
          of Barnabas, shared the view of Marcion. The name of the Deity was
          changed from Jehovah to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. If Marcion’s view
          had prevailed, the Old Testament would have been lost to the Christian
          Church. God’s revelation would have been deprived of its proof from
          prophecy. Development from the past, and divine conduct of Jewish
          history, would have been denied. But without the Old Testament, as H.
          W. Beecher maintained, the New Testament would lack background; our
          chief source of knowledge with regard to God’s natural attributes of
          power, wisdom, and truth would be removed: the love and mercy revealed
          in the New Testament would seem characteristics of a weak being, who
          could not enforce law or inspire respect. A tree has as much breadth
          below ground as there is above; so the O. T. roots of God’s revelation
          are as extensive and necessary as are its N. T. trunk and branches and
          leaves. See Allen, Religious Progress, 81; Westcott, Hist. N. T.
          Canon, and art.: Canon, in Smith’s Bible Dictionary. Also Reuss,
          History of Canon; Mitchell, Critical Handbook, part I.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. The Christian and Apostolic Fathers who lived in the first half of
          the second century not only quote from these books and allude to them,
          but testify that they were written by the apostles themselves. We are
          therefore compelled to refer their origin still further back, namely,
          to the first century, when the apostles lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Irenæus (120–200) mentions and quotes the four gospels by name,
          and among them the gospel according to John: “Afterwards John, the
          disciple of the Lord, who also leaned upon his breast, he likewise
          published a gospel, while he dwelt in Ephesus in Asia.” And Irenæus
          was the disciple and friend of Polycarp (80–166), who was himself a
          personal acquaintance of the Apostle John. The testimony of Irenæus is
          virtually the evidence of Polycarp, the contemporary and friend of the
          Apostle, that each of the gospels was written by the person whose name
          it bears.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this testimony it is objected that Irenæus says there are four
          gospels because there are four quarters of the world and four living
          creatures in the cherubim. But we reply that Irenæus is here stating,
          not his own reason for accepting four and only four gospels, but what
          he conceives to be God’s reason for ordaining that there should be
          four. We are not warranted in supposing that he accepted the four
          gospels on any other ground than that of testimony that they were the
          productions of apostolic men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chrysostom, in a similar manner, compares the four gospels to a
          chariot and four: When the King of Glory rides forth in it, he shall
          receive the triumphal acclamations of all peoples. So Jerome: God
          rides upon the cherubim, and since there are four cherubim, there must
          be four gospels. All this however is an early attempt at the
          philosophy of religion, and not an attempt to demonstrate historical
          fact. L. L. Paine, Evolution of Trinitarianism, 319–367, presents the
          radical view of the authorship of the fourth gospel. He holds that
          John the apostle died a.d. 70, or soon after, and that Irenæus
          confounded the two Johns whom Papias so clearly distinguished—John the
          Apostle and John the Elder. With Harnack, Paine supposes the gospel to
          have been written by John the Elder, a contemporary of Papias. But we
          reply that the testimony of Irenæus implies a long continued previous
          tradition. R. W. Dale, Living Christ and Four Gospels, 145—“Religious
          veneration such as that with which Irenæus regarded these books is of
          slow growth. They must have held a great place in the Church as far
          back as the memory of living men extended.” See Hastings’ Bible
          Dictionary, 2:695.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Justin Martyr (died 148) speaks of ‘memoirs (ἀπομνημονεύματα) of
          Jesus Christ,’ and his quotations, though sometimes made from memory,
          are evidently cited from our gospels.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this testimony it is objected: (1) That Justin Martyr uses the term
          ‘memoirs’ instead of ‘gospels.’ We reply that he elsewhere uses the
          term ‘gospels’ and identifies the ‘memoirs’ with them: Apol.,
          1:66—“The apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called
          gospels,” i. e., not memoirs, but gospels, was the proper title of his
          written records. In writing his Apology to the heathen Emperors,
          Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Antoninus, he chooses the term ‘memoirs’,
          or ‘memorabilia’, which Xenophon had used as the title of his account
          of Socrates, simply in order that he may avoid ecclesiastical
          expressions unfamiliar to his readers and may commend his writing to
          lovers of classical literature. Notice that Matthew must be added to
          John, to justify Justin’s repeated statement that there were “memoirs”
          of our Lord “written by apostles,” and that Mark and Luke must be
          added to justify his further statement that these memoirs were
          compiled by “his apostles and those who followed them.” Analogous to
          Justin’s use of the word ‘memoirs’ is his use of the term ‘Sunday’,
          instead of Sabbath: Apol. 1:67—“On the day called Sunday, all who live
          in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the
          memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read.”
          Here is the use of our gospels in public worship, as of equal
          authority with the O. T. Scriptures; in fact, Justin constantly quotes
          the words and acts of Jesus’ life from a written source, using the
          word γέγραπται. See Morison, Com. on Mat., ix; Hemphill, Literature of
          Second Century, 234.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Justin’s testimony it is objected: (2) That in quoting the words
          spoken from heaven at the Savior’s baptism, he makes them to be: “My
          son, this day have I begotten thee,” so quoting Psa_2:7, and showing
          that he was ignorant of our present gospel. Mat_3:17. We reply that
          this was probably a slip of the memory, quite natural in a day when
          the gospels existed only in the cumbrous form of manuscript rolls.
          Justin also refers to the Pentateuch for two facts which it does not
          contain; but we should not argue from this that he did not possess our
          present Pentateuch. The plays of Terence are quoted by Cicero and
          Horace, and we require neither more nor earlier witnesses to their
          genuineness,—yet Cicero and Horace wrote a hundred years after
          Terence. It is unfair to refuse similar evidence to the gospels.
          Justin had a way of combining into one the sayings of the different
          evangelists—a hint which Tatian, his pupil, probably followed out in
          composing his Diatessaron. On Justin Martyr’s testimony, see Ezra
          Abbot, Genuineness of the Fourth Gospel, 49, note. B. W. Bacon,
          Introd. to N. T., speaks of Justin as “writing circa 155 a.d.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Papias (80–164), whom Irenæus calls a ‘hearer of John,’ testifies
          that Matthew “wrote in the Hebrew dialect the sacred oracles (τὰ
          λόγια),” and that “Mark, the interpreter of Peter, wrote after Peter,
          ὔστερον Πέτρῳ [or under Peter’s direction], an unsystematic account
          (οὐ τάξει)” of the same events and discourses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this testimony it is objected: (1) That Papias could not have had
          our gospel of Matthew, for the reason that this is Greek. We reply,
          either with Bleek, that Papias erroneously supposed a Hebrew
          translation of Matthew, which he possessed, to be the original; or
          with Weiss, that the original Matthew was in Hebrew, while our present
          Matthew is an enlarged version of the same. Palestine, like modern
          Wales, was bilingual; Matthew, like James, might write both Hebrew and
          Greek. While B. W. Bacon gives to the writing of Papias a date so late
          as 145–160 a.d., Lightfoot gives that of 130 a.d.. At this latter date
          Papias could easily remember stories told him so far back as 80 a.d.,
          by men who were youths at the time when our Lord lived, died, rose and
          ascended. The work of Papias had for its title Λογίων κυριακῶν
          ἐξήγησις—“Exposition of Oracles relating to the Lord” = Commentaries
          on the Gospels. Two of these gospels were Matthew and Mark. The view
          of Weiss mentioned above has been criticized upon the ground that the
          quotations from the O. T. in Jesus’ discourses in Matthew are all
          taken from the Septuagint and not from the Hebrew. Westcott answers
          this criticism by suggesting that, in translating his Hebrew gospel
          into Greek, Matthew substituted for his own oral version of Christ’s
          discourses the version of these already existing in the oral common
          gospel. There was a common oral basis of true teaching, the
          “deposit”—τὴν παραθήκην—committed to Timothy (1Ti_6:20; 2Ti_1:12;
          2Ti_1:14), the same story told many times and getting to be told in
          the same way. The narratives of Matthew, Mark and Luke are independent
          versions of this apostolic testimony. First came belief; secondly,
          oral teaching; thirdly, written gospels. That the original gospel was
          in Aramaic seems probable from the fact that the Oriental name for
          “tares,” zawān, (Mat_13:25) has been transliterated into Greek,
          ζιζάνια. Morison, Com. on Mat., thinks that Matthew originally wrote
          in Hebrew a collection of Sayings of Jesus Christ, which the Nazarenes
          and Ebionites added to, partly from tradition, and partly from
          translating his full gospel, till the result was the so-called Gospel
          of the Hebrews; but that Matthew wrote his own gospel in Greek after
          he had written the Sayings in Hebrew. Professor W. A. Stevens thinks
          that Papias probably alluded to the original autograph which Matthew
          wrote in Aramaic, but which he afterwards enlarged and translated into
          Greek. See Hemphill, Literature of the Second Century, 267.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the testimony of Papias it is also objected: (2) That Mark is the
          most systematic of all evangelists, presenting events as a true
          annalist, in chronological order. We reply that while, so far as
          chronological order is concerned, Mark is systematic, so far as
          logical order is concerned he is the most unsystematic of the
          evangelists, showing little of the power of historical grouping which
          is so discernible in Matthew. Matthew aimed to portray a life, rather
          than to record a chronology. He groups Jesus’ teachings in chapters 5,
          6, and 7; his miracles in chapters 8 and 9; his directions to the
          apostles in chapter 10; chapters 11 and 12 describe the growing
          opposition; chapter 13 meets this opposition with his parables; the
          remainder of the gospel describes our Lord’s preparation for his
          death, his progress to Jerusalem, the consummation of his work in the
          Cross and in the resurrection. Here is true system, a philosophical
          arrangement of material, compared with which the method of Mark is
          eminently unsystematic. Mark is a Froissart, while Matthew has the
          spirit of J. R. Green. See Bleek, Introd. to N. T., 1:108, 1:126;
          Weiss, Life of Jesus, 1:27–39.

          (d) The Apostolic Fathers,—Clement of Rome (died 101), Ignatius of
          Antioch (martyred 115), and Polycarp (80–166),—companions and friends
          of the apostles, have left us in their writings over one hundred
          quotations from or allusions to the New Testament writings, and among
          these every book, except four minor epistles (2 Peter, Jud_1:2 and 3
          John) is represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although these are single testimonies, we must remember that they are
          the testimonies of the chief men of the churches of their day, and
          that they express the opinion of the churches themselves. “Like
          banners of a hidden army, or peaks of a distant mountain range, they
          represent and are sustained by compact, continuous bodies below.” In
          an article by P. W. Calkins, McClintock and Strong’s Encyclopædia,
          1:315–317, quotations from the Apostolic Fathers in great numbers are
          put side by side with the New Testament passages from which they quote
          or to which they allude. An examination of these quotations and
          allusions convinces us that these Fathers were in possession of all
          the principal books of our New Testament. See Ante-Nicene Library of
          T. and T. Clark; Thayer, in Boston Lectures for 1871:324; Nash, Ethics
          and Rev_11:1-19—“Ignatius says to Polycarp: ‘The times call for thee,
          as the winds call for the pilot.’ So do the times call for reverent,
          fearless scholarship in the church.” Such scholarship, we are
          persuaded, has already demonstrated the genuineness of the N. T.
          documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) In the synoptic gospels, the omission of all mention of the
          fulfilment of Christ’s prophecies with regard to the destruction of
          Jerusalem is evidence that these gospels were written before the
          occurrence of that event. In the Acts of the Apostles, universally
          attributed to Luke, we have an allusion to ‘the former treatise’, or
          the gospel by the same author, which must, therefore, have been
          written before the end of Paul’s first imprisonment at Rome, and
          probably with the help and sanction of that apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Act_1:1—“The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that
          Jesus began both to do and to teach.” If the Acts was written a.d. 63,
          two years after Paul’s arrival at Rome, then “the former treatise,”
          the gospel according to Luke, can hardly be dated later than 60; and
          since the destruction of Jerusalem took place in 70, Matthew and Mark
          must have published their gospels at least as early as the year 68,
          when multitudes of men were still living who had been eye-witnesses of
          the events of Jesus’ life. Fisher, Nature and Method of Revelation,
          180—“At any considerably later date [than the capture of Jerusalem]
          the apparent conjunction of the fall of the city and the temple with
          the Parousia would have been avoided or explained.…Matthew, in its
          present form, appeared after the beginning of the mortal struggle of
          the Romans with the Jews, or between 65 and 70. Mark’s gospel was
          still earlier. The language of the passages relative to the Parousia,
          in Luke, is consistent with the supposition that he wrote after the
          fall of Jerusalem, but not with the supposition that it was long
          after.” See Norton, Genuineness of the Gospels; Alford, Greek
          Testament, Prolegomena, 30, 31, 36, 45–47.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. It is to be presumed that this acceptance of the New Testament
          documents as genuine, on the part of the Fathers of the churches, was
          for good and sufficient reasons, both internal and external, and this
          presumption is corroborated by the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) There is evidence that the early churches took every care to
          assure themselves of the genuineness of these writings before they
          accepted them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidences of care are the following:—Paul, in 2Th_2:2, urged the
          churches to use care, “to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from
          your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by
          epistle as from us”; 1Co_5:9—“I wrote unto you in my epistle to have
          no company with fornicators”; Col_4:16—“when this epistle hath been
          read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the
          Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.” Melito
          (169), Bishop of Sardis, who wrote a treatise on the Revelation of
          John, went as far as Palestine to ascertain on the spot the facts
          relating to the Canon of the O. T., and as a result of bis
          investigations excluded the Apocrypha. Ryle, Canon of O. T.,
          203—“Melito, the Bishop of Sardis, sent to a friend a list of the O.
          T. Scriptures which he professed to have obtained from accurate
          inquiry, while traveling in the East, in Syria. Its contents agree
          with those of the Hebrew Canon, save in the omission of Esther.”
          Serapion, Bishop of Antioch (191–213, Abbot), says: “We receive Peter
          and other apostles as Christ, but as skilful men we reject those
          writings which are falsely ascribed to them.” Geo. H. Ferris, Baptist
          Congress, 1899:94—“Serapion, after permitting the reading of the
          Gospel of Peter in public services, finally decided against it, not
          because he thought there could be no fifth gospel, but because he
          thought it was not written by Peter.” Tertullian (160–230) gives an
          example of the deposition of a presbyter in Asia Minor for publishing
          a pretended work of Paul; see Tertullian, De Baptismo, referred to by
          Godet on John, Introduction; Lardner, Works, 2:304, 305; McIlvaine,
          Evidences, 92.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The style of the New Testament writings, and their complete
          correspondence with all we know of the lands and times in which they
          profess to have been written, affords convincing proof that they
          belong to the apostolic age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the mingling of Latin and Greek, as in σπεκουλάτωρ (Mar_6:27)
          and κεντυρίων (Mar_15:39); of Greek and Aramæan, as in πρασιαὶ πρασιαί
          (Mar_6:40) and βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως (Mat_24:15); this could hardly
          have occurred after the first century. Compare the anachronisms of
          style and description in Thackeray’s “Henry Esmond,” which, in spite
          of the author’s special studies and his determination to exclude all
          words and phrases that had originated in his own century, was marred
          by historical errors that Macaulay in his most remiss moments would
          hardly have made. James Russell Lowell told Thackeray that “different
          to” was not a century old. “Hang it, no!” replied Thackeray. In view
          of this failure, on the part of an author of great literary skill, to
          construct a story purporting to be written a century before his time
          and that could stand the test of historical criticism, we may well
          regard the success of our gospels in standing such tests as a
          practical demonstration that they were written in, and not after, the
          apostolic age. See Alexander, Christ and Christianity, 27–37; Blunt,
          Scriptural Coincidences, 244–354.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The genuineness of the fourth gospel is confirmed by the fact that
          Tatian (155–170), the Assyrian, a disciple of Justin, repeatedly
          quoted it without naming the author, and composed a Harmony of our
          four gospels which he named the Diatessaron; while Basilides (130) and
          Valentinus (150), the Gnostics, both quote from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sceptical work entitled “Supernatural Religion” said in 1874; “No
          one seems to have seen Tatian’s Harmony, probably for the very simple
          reason that there was no such work”; and "There is no evidence
          whatever connecting Tatian’s Gospel with those of our Canon.” In 1876,
          however, there was published in a Latin form in Venice the Commentary
          of Ephraem Syrus on Tatian, and the commencement of it was: “In the
          beginning was the Word” (Joh_1:1). In 1888, the Diatessaron itself was
          published in Rome in the form of an Arabic translation made in the
          eleventh century from the Syriac. J. Rendel Harris, in Contemp. Rev.,
          1893:800 sq., says that the recovery of Tatian’s Diates-saron has
          indefinitely postponed the literary funeral of St. John. Advanced
          critics, he intimates, are so called, because they run ahead of the
          facts they discuss. The gospels must have been well established in the
          Christian church when Tatian undertook to combine them. Mrs. A. S.
          Lewis, in S. S. Times, Jan. 23, 1904—“The gospels were translated into
          Syriac before a.d. 160. It follows that the Greek document from which
          they were translated was older still, and since the one includes the
          gospel of St. John, so did the other.” Hemphill, Literature of the
          Second Century, 183–231, gives the birth of Tatian about 120, and the
          date of his Diatessaron as 172 a.d..
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference in style between the Revelation and the gospel of John
          is due to the fact that the Revelation was written during John’s exile
          in Patmos, under Nero, in 67 or 68, soon after John had left Palestine
          and had taken up his residence at Ephesus. He had hitherto spoken
          Aramæan, and Greek was comparatively unfamiliar to him. The gospel was
          written thirty years after, probably about 97, when Greek had become
          to him like a mother tongue. See Lightfoot on Galatians, 343, 347; per
          contra, see Milligan, Revelation of St. John. Phrases and ideas which
          indicate a common authorship of the Revelation and the gospel are the
          following: “the Lamb of God,” “the Word of God,” “the True” as an
          epithet applied to Christ, “the Jews” as enemies of God, “manna,” “him
          whom they pierced”; see Elliott, Horæ Apocalypticæ, 1:4, 5. In the
          fourth gospel we have ἀμνός in Apoc. ἀρνίον, perhaps better to
          distinguish “the Lamb” from the diminutive τὸ θηρίον, “the beast.”
          Common to both Gospel and Rev. are ποιεῖν, “to do” [the truth];
          περιπατεῖν, of moral conduct; ἀληθινός, “genuine”; διψᾷ, πεινᾷν, of
          the higher wants of the soul; σκηνοῦν ἐν, ποιμαίνειν, ὁδηγεῖν; also
          ‘overcome,’ ‘testimony,’ ‘Bridegooom,’ ‘Shepherd,’ ‘Water of life.’ In
          the Revelation there are grammatical solecisms: nominative
          forgenitive, 1:4—ἀπὸ ὁ ὤν; nominative for accusative, 7:9—εἶδον.…ὄχλος
          πολύς; accusative for nominative, 20:2—τὸν δράκοντα ὁ ὄφις. Similarly
          we have in Rom_12:5—τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ εἶς instead of τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ ἕνα, where
          κατὰ has lost its regimen—a frequent solecism in later Greek writers;
          see Godet on John, 1:269, 270. Emerson reminded Jones Very that the
          Holy Ghost surely writes good grammar. The Apocalypse seems to show
          that Emerson was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author of the fourth gospel speaks of John in the third person,
          “and scorned to blot it with a name.” But so does Cæsar speak of
          himself in his Commentaries. Harnack regards both the fourth gospel
          and the Revelation as the work of John the Presbyter or Elder, the
          former written not later than about 110 a.d.;.; the latter from 93 to
          96, but being a revision of one or more underlying Jewish apocalypses.
          Vischer has expounded this view of the Revelation; and Porter holds
          substantially the same, in his article on the Book of Revelation in
          Hastings’ Bible Dictionary, 4:239–266. “It is the obvious advantage of
          the Vischer-Harnack hypothesis that it places the original work under
          Nero and its revised and Christianized edition under Domitian.”
          (Sanday, Inspiration, 371, 372, nevertheless dismisses this hypothesis
          as raising worse difficulties than it removes. He dates the Apocalypse
          between the death of Nero and the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.)
          Martineau, Seat of Authority, 227, presents the moral objections to
          the apostolic authorship, and regards the Revelation, from chapter 4:1
          to 22:5, as a purely Jewish document of the date 66–70, supplemented
          and revised by a Christian, and issued not earlier than 136: “How
          strange that we should ever have thought it possible for a personal
          attendant upon the ministry of Jesus to write or edit a book mixing up
          fierce Messianic conflicts, in which, with the sword, the gory
          garment, the blasting flame, the rod of iron, as his emblems, he leads
          the war-march, and treads the winepress of the wrath of God until the
          deluge of blood rises to the horses bits, with the speculative
          Christology of the second century, without a memory of his life, a
          feature of his look, a word from his voice, or a glance back at the
          hillsides of Galilee, the courts of Jerusalem, the road to Bethany, on
          which his image must be forever seen!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The force of this statement, however, is greatly broken if we consider
          that the apostle John, in his earlier days, was one of the “Boanerges,
          which is, Sons of thunder” (Mar_3:17), but became in his later years
          the apostle of love: 1Jn_4:7—“Beloved, let us love one another: for
          love is of God.” The likeness of the fourth gospel to the epistle,
          which latter was undoubtedly the work of John the apostle, indicates
          the same authorship for the gospel. Thayer remarks that “the discovery
          of the gospel according to Peter sweeps away half a century of
          discussion. Brief as is the recovered fragment, it attests indubitably
          all four of our canonical books.” Riddle, in Popular Com., 1:25—“If a
          forger wrote the fourth gospel, then Beelzebub has been casting out
          devils for these eighteen hundred years.” On the genuineness of the
          fourth gospel, see Bleek, Introd. to N. T., 1:250; Fisher, Essays on
          Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 33, also Beginnings of Christianity,

          (d) The epistle to the Hebrews appears to have been accepted during
          the first century after it was written (so Clement of Rome, Justin
          Martyr, and the Peshito Version witness). Then for two centuries,
          especially in the Roman and North African churches, and probably
          because its internal characteristics were inconsistent with the
          tradition of a Pauline authorship, its genuineness was doubted (so
          Tertullian, Cyprian, Irenæus, Muratorian Canon). At the end of the
          fourth century, Jerome examined the evidence and decided in its favor;
          Augustine did the same; the third Council of Carthage formally
          recognized it (397); from that time the Latin churches united with the
          East in receiving it, and thus the doubt was finally and forever
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle to the Hebrews, the style of which is so unlike that of
          the Apostle Paul, was possibly written by Apollos, who was an
          Alexandrian Jew, “a learned man” and “mighty in the Scriptures”
          (Act_18:24); but it may notwithstanding have been written at the
          suggestion and under the direction of Paul, and so be essentially
          Pauline. A. C. Kendrick, in American Commentary on Hebrews, points out
          that while the style of Paul is prevailingly dialectic, and only in
          rapt moments becomes rhetorical or poetic, the style of the Epistle to
          the Hebrews is prevailingly rhetorical, is free from anacoloutha, and
          is always dominated by emotion. He holds that these characteristics
          point to Apollos as its author. Contrast also Paul’s method of quoting
          the O. T.: “it is written” (Rom_11:8; 1Co_1:31; Gal_3:10) with that of
          the Hebrews: “he saith” (8:5, 13), “he hath said” (4:4). Paul quotes
          the O. T. fifty or sixty times, but never in this latter way.
          Heb_2:3—“which having at the first been spoken by the Lord, was
          confirmed unto us by them that heard”—shows that the writer did not
          receive the gospel at first hand. Luther and Calvin rightly saw in
          this a decisive proof that Paul was not the author, for he always
          insisted on the primary and independent character of his gospel.
          Harnack formerly thought the epistle written by Barnabas to Christians
          at Rome, a.d.; 81–96. More recently however he attributes it to
          Priscilla, the wife of Aquila, or to their joint authorship. The
          majesty of its diction, however, seems unfavorable to this view.
          William T. C. Hanna: “The words of the author … are marshalled
          grandly, and move with the tread of an army, or with the swell of a
          tidal wave”; see Franklin Johnson, Quotations in N. T. from O. T.,
          xii. Plumptre, Introd. to N. T., 37, and in Expositor, Vol. I, regards
          the author of this epistle as the same with that of the Apocryphal
          Wisdom of Solomon, the latter being composed before, the former after,
          the writer’s conversion to Christianity. Perhaps our safest conclusion
          is that of Origen: “God only knows who wrote it.” Harnack however
          remarks: “The time in which our ancient Christian literature, the N.
          T. included, was considered as a web of delusions and falsifications,
          is past. The oldest literature of the church is, in its main points,
          and in most of its details, true and trustworthy.” See articles on
          Hebrews, in Smith’s and in Hastings’ Bible Dictionaries.

          (e) As to 2 Peter, Jud_1:2 and 3 John, the epistles most frequently
          held to be spurious, we may say that, although we have no conclusive
          external evidence earlier than a.d. 160, and in the case of 2 Peter
          none earlier than a.d. 230–250, we may fairly urge in favor of their
          genuineness not only their internal characteristics of literary style
          and moral value, but also the general acceptance of them all since the
          third century as the actual productions of the men or class of men
          whose names they bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firmilianus (250), Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, is the first clear
          witness to 2 Peter. Origen (230) names it, but, in naming it, admits
          that its genuineness is questioned. The Council of Laodicea (372)
          first received it into the Canon. With this very gradual recognition
          and acceptance of 2 Peter, compare the loss of the later works of
          Aristotle for a hundred and fifty years after his death, and their
          recognition as genuine so soon as they were recovered from the cellar
          of the family of Neleus in Asia; DeWette’s first publication of
          certain letters of Luther after the lapse of three hundred years, yet
          without occasioning doubt as to their genuineness; or the concealment
          of Milton’s Treatise on Christian Doctrine, among the lumber of the
          State Paper Office in London, from 1677 to 1823; see Mair, Christian
          Evidences, 95. Sir William Hamilton complained that there were
          treatises of Cudworth, Berkeley and Collier, still lying unpublished
          and even unknown to their editors, biographers and fellow
          metaphysicians, but yet of the highest interest and importance; see
          Mansel, Letters, Lectures and Reviews, 381; Archibald, The Bible
          Verified, 27. 2 Peter was probably sent from the East shortly before
          Peter’s martyrdom; distance and persecution may have prevented its
          rapid circulation in other countries. Sagebeer, The Bible in Court,
          114—“A ledger may have been lost, or its authenticity for a long time
          doubted, but when once it is discovered and proved, it is as
          trustworthy as any other part of the res gestæ” See Plumptre, Epistles
          of Peter, Introd., 73–81; Alford on 2 Peter 4: Prolegomena, 157;
          Westcott, on Canon, in Smith’s Bib. Dict., 1:370, 373; Blunt, Diet.

        </p>
        <p>
          It is urged by those who doubt the genuineness of 2 Peter that the
          epistle speaks of “your apostles” (3:2), just as Jud_1:17 speaks of
          “the apostles,” as if the writer did not number himself among them.
          But 2 Peter begins with “Simon Peter, a servent and apostle of Jesus
          Christ,” and Jude, “brother of James” (verse 1) was a brother of our
          Lord, but not an apostle. Hovey, Introd. to N. T., xxxi—“The earliest
          passage manifestly based upon 2 Peter appears to be in the so-called
          Second Epistle of the Roman Clement, 16:3, which however is now
          understood to be a Christian homily from the middle of the second
          century.” Origen (born 186) testifies that Peter left one epistle,
          “and perhaps a second, for that is disputed.” He also says: “John
          wrote the Apocalypse, and an epistle of very few lines; and, it may
          be, a second and a third; since all do not admit them to be genuine.”
          He quotes also from James and from Jude, adding that their canonidty
          was doubted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harnack regards 1 Peter, 2 Peter, James, and Jude, as written
          respectively about 160, 170, 130, and 130, but not by the men to whom
          they are ascribed—the ascriptions to these authors being later
          additions. Hort remarks: “If I were asked, I should say that the
          balance of the argument was against 2 Peter, but the moment I had done
          so I should begin to think I might be in the wrong.” Sanday, Oracles
          of God, 73 note, considers the arguments in favor of 2 Peter
          unconvincing, but also the arguments against. He cannot get beyond a
          non liquet. He refers to Salmon, Introd. to N. T., 529–559, ed. 4, as
          expressing his own view. But the later conclusions of Sanday are more
          radical. In his Bampton Lectures on Inspiration, 348, 399, he says: 2
          Peter “is probably at least to this extent a counterfeit, that it
          appears under a name which is not that of its true author.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Chase, in Hastings’ Bib. Dict., 3:806–817, says that “the first piece
          of certain evidence as to 2 Peter is the passage from Origen quoted by
          Eusebius, though it hardly admits of doubt that the Epistle was known
          to Clement of Alexandria.…We find no trace of the epistle in the
          period when the tradition of apostolic days was still living.…It was
          not the work of the apostle but of the second century … put forward
          without any sinister motive … the personation of the apostle an
          obvious literary device rather than a religious or controversial
          fraud. The adoption of such a verdict can cause perplexity only when
          the Lord’s promise of guidance to his Church is regarded as a charter
          of infallibility.” Against this verdict we would urge the dignity and
          spiritual value of 2 Peter—internal evidence which in our judgment
          causes the balance to incline in favor of its apostolic authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) Upon no other hypothesis than that of their genuineness can the
          general acceptance of these four minor epistles since the third
          century, and of all the other books of the New Testament since the
          middle of the second century, be satisfactorily accounted for. If they
          had been mere collections of floating legends, they could not have
          secured wide circulation as sacred books for which Christians must
          answer with their blood. If they had been forgeries, the churches at
          large could neither have been deceived as to their previous
          non-existence, nor have been induced unanimously to pretend that they
          were ancient and genuine. Inasmuch, however, as other accounts of
          their origin, inconsistent with their genuineness, are now current, we
          proceed to examine more at length the most important of these opposing
          views.
        </p>
        <p>
          The genuineness of the New Testament as a whole would still be
          demonstrable, even if doubt should still attach to one or two of its
          books. It does not matter that 2nd Alcibiades was not written by
          Plato, or Pericles by Shakespeare. The Council of Carthage in 397 gave
          a place in the Canon to the O. T. Apocrypha, but the Reformers tore it
          out. Zwingli said of the Revelation: “It is not a Biblical book,” and
          Luther spoke slightingly of the Epistle of James. The judgment of
          Christendom at large is more trustworthy than the private impressions
          of any single Christian scholar. To hold the books of the N. T. to be
          written in the second century by other than those whose names they
          bear is to hold, not simply to forgery, but to a conspiracy of
          forgery. There must have been several forgers at work, and, since
          their writings wonderfully agree, there must have been collusion among
          them. Yet these able men have been forgotten, while the names of far
          feebler writers of the second century have been preserved.

          G. F. Wright, Scientific Aspects of Christian Evidences, 343—“In civil
          law there are ‘statutes of limitations’ which provide that the general
          acknowledgment of a purported fact for a certain period shall be
          considered as conclusive evidence of it. If, for example, a man has
          remained in undisturbed possession of land for a certain number of
          years, it is presumed that he has a valid claim to it, and no one is
          allowed to dispute his claim.” Mair, Evidences, 99—“We probably have
          not a tenth part of the evidence upon which the early churches
          accepted the N. T. books as the genuine productions of their authors.
          We have only their verdict.” Wynne, in Literature of the Second
          Century, 58—“Those who gave up the Scriptures were looked on by their
          fellow Christians as ‘traditores’, traitors, who had basely yielded up
          what they ought to have treasured as dearer than life. But all their
          books were not equally sacred. Some were essential, and some were
          non-essential to the faith. Hence arose the distinction between
          canonical and non-canonical. The general consciousness of Christians
          grew into a distinct registration.” Such registration is entitled to
          the highest respect, and lays the burden of proof upon the objector.

          D. Rationalistic Theories as to the origin of the gospels. These are
          attempts to eliminate the miraculous element from the New Testament
          records, and to reconstruct the sacred history upon principles of
          naturalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Against them we urge the general objection that they are unscientific
          in their principle and method. To set out in an examination of the New
          Testament documents with the assumption that all history is a mere
          natural development, and that miracles are therefore impossible, is to
          make history a matter, not of testimony, but of a priori speculation.
          It indeed renders any history of Christ and his apostles impossible,
          since the witnesses whose testimony with regard to miracles is
          discredited can no longer be considered worthy of credence in their
          account of Christ’s life or doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Germany, half a century ago, “a man was famous according as he had
          lifted up axes upon the thick trees” (Psa_74:5, A. V.), just as among
          the American Indians he was not counted a man who could not show his
          scalps. The critics fortunately scalped each other; see Tyler,
          Theology of Greek Poets, 79—on Homer. Nicoll, The Church’s One
          Foundation, 15—“Like the mummers of old, sceptical critics send one
          before them with a broom to sweep the stage clear of everything for
          their drama. If we assume at the threshold of the gospel study that
          everything of the nature of miracle is impossible, then the specific
          questions are decided before the criticism begins to operate in
          earnest.” Matthew Arnold: “Our popular religion at present conceives
          the birth, ministry and death of Christ as altogether steeped in
          prodigy, brimful of miracle,—and miracles do not happen.” This
          presupposition influences the investigations of Kuenen, and of A. E.
          Abbott, in his article on the Gospels in the Encyc. Britannica. We
          give special attention to four of the theories based upon this
          assumption.
        </p>
        <p>1st. The Myth-theory of Strauss (1808–1874).</p>
        <p>
          According to this view, the gospels are crystallizations into story of
          Messianic ideas which had for several generations filled the minds of
          imaginative men in Palestine. The myth is a narrative in which such
          ideas are unconsciously clothed, and from which the element of
          intentional and deliberate deception is absent.
        </p>
        <p>
          This early view of Strauss, which has become identified with his name,
          was exchanged in late years for a more advanced view which extended
          the meaning of the word ‘myths’ so as to include all narratives that
          spring out of a theological idea, and it admitted the existence of
          ‘pious frauds’ in the gospels. Baur, he says, first convinced him that
          the author of the fourth gospel had “not unfrequently composed mere
          fables, knowing them to be mere fictions.” The animating spirit of
          both the old view and the new is the same. Strauss says: “We know with
          certainty what Jesus was not, and what he has not done, namely,
          nothing superhuman and supernatural.” “No gospel can claim that degree
          of historic credibility that would be required in order to make us
          debase our reason to the point of believing miracles.” He calls the
          resurrection of Christ “ein weltgeschichtlicher Humbug.” “If the
          gospels are really historical documents, we cannot exclude miracle
          from the life-story of Jesus;” see Strauss, Life of Jesus, 17; New
          Life of Jesus, 1: preface, xii. Vatke, Einleitung in A, T., 210, 211,
          distinguishes the myth from the saga or legend: The criterion of the
          pure myth is that the experience is impossible, while the saga is a
          tradition of remote antiquity; the myth has in it the element only of
          belief, the saga has in it an element of history. Sabatier, Philos.
          Religion, 37—“A myth is false in appearance only. The divine Spirit
          can avail himself of the fictions of poetry as well as of logical
          reasonings. When the heart was pure, the veils of fable always allowed
          the face of truth to shine through. And does not childhood run on into
          maturity and old age?”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very certain that childlike love of truth was not the animating
          spirit of Strauss. On the contrary, his spirit was that of remorseless
          criticism and of uncompromising hostility to the supernatural. It has
          been well said that he gathered up all the previous objections of
          sceptics to the gospel narrative and hurled them in one mass, just as
          if some Sadducee at the time of Jesus’ trial had put all the taunts
          and gibes, all the buffetings and insults, all the shame and spitting,
          into one blow delivered straight into the face of the Redeemer. An
          octogenarian and saintly German lady said unsuspectingly that “somehow
          she never could get interested” in Strauss’s Leben Jesu, which her
          sceptical son had given her for religious reading. The work was almost
          altogether destructive, only the last chapter suggesting Strauss’s own
          view of what Jesus was.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Luther’s dictum is true that “the heart is the best theologian,”
          Strauss must be regarded as destitute of the main qualification for
          his task. Encyc. Britannica, 22:592—“Strauss’s mind was almost
          exclusively analytical and critical, without depth of religious
          feeling, or philosophical penetration, or historical sympathy. His
          work was rarely constructive, and, save when he was dealing with a
          kindred spirit, he failed as a historian, biographer, and critic,
          strikingly illustrating Goethe’s profoundly true principle that loving
          sympathy is essential for productive criticism.” Pfleiderer, Strauss’s
          Life of Jesus, xix—“Strauss showed that the church formed the mythical
          traditions about Jesus out of its faith in him as the Messiah; but he
          did not show how the church came by the faith that Jesus of Nazareth
          was the Messiah.” See Carpenter, Mental Physiology, 362; Grote, Plato,
          1:249.
        </p>
        <p>We object to the Myth-theory of Strauss, that</p>
        <p>
          (a) The time between the death of Christ and the publication of the
          gospels was far too short for the growth and consolidation of such
          mythical histories. Myths, on the contrary, as the Indian, Greek,
          Roman and Scandinavian instances bear witness, are the slow growth of
          centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The first century was not a century when such formation of myths
          was possible. Instead of being a credulous and imaginative age, it was
          an age of historical inquiry and of Sadduceeism in matters of
          religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horace, in Odes 1:34 and 3:6, denounces the neglect and squalor of the
          heathen temples, and Juvenal, Satire 2:150, says that “Esse aliquid
          manes et subterrantea regna Nee pueri credunt.” Arnold of Rugby: “The
          idea of men writing mythic histories between the times of Livy and of
          Tacitus, and of St. Paul mistaking them for realities!” Pilate’s
          sceptical inquiry, “What is truth?” (Joh_18:38), better represented
          the age. “The mythical age is past when an idea is presented
          abstractly—apart from narrative.” The Jewish sect of the Sadducees
          shows that the rationalistic spirit was not confined to Greeks or
          Romans. The question of John the Baptist, Mat_11:3—“Art thou he that
          cometh, or look we for another?” and our Lord’s answer, Mat_11:4-5—“Go
          and tell John the thing which ye hear and see: the blind receive their
          sight … the dead are raised up,” show that the Jews expected miracles
          to be wrought by the Messiah; yet Joh_10:41—“John indeed did no sign”
          shows also no irresistible inclination to invest popular teachers with
          miraculous powers; see E. G. Robinson, Christian Evidences, 22;
          Westcott, Com. on Joh_10:41; Rogers, Super-human Origin of the Bible,
          61; Cox, Miracles, 50.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The gospels cannot be a mythical outgrowth of Jewish ideas and
          expectations, because, in their main features, they run directly
          counter to these ideas and expectations. The sullen and exclusive
          nationalism of the Jews could not have given rise to a gospel for all
          nations, nor could their expectations of a temporal monarch have led
          to the story of a suffering Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          The O. T. Apocrypha shows how narrow was the outlook of the Jews.
          2Es_6:55-56 says the Almighty has made the world “for our sakes”;
          other peoples, though they “also come from Adam,” to the Eternal “are
          nothing, but be like unto spittle.” The whole multitude of them are
          only, before him, “like a single foul drop that oozes out of a cask”
          (C. Geikie, in S. S. Times). Christ’s kingdom differed from that which
          the Jews expected, both in its spirituality and its universality
          (Bruce, Apologetics, 3). There was no missionary impulse in the
          heathen world; on the other hand, it was blasphemy for an ancient
          tribesman to make known his god to an outsider (Nash, Ethics and
          Revelation, 106). The Apocryphal gospels show what sort of myths the
          N. T. age would have elaborated: Out of a demoniac young woman Satan
          is said to depart in the form of a young man (Bernard, in Literature
          of the Second Century, 99–136).
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The belief and propagation of such myths are inconsistent with
          what we know of the sober characters and self-sacrificing lives of the
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) The mythical theory cannot account for the acceptance of the
          gospels among the Gentiles, who had none of the Jewish ideas and
          expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) It cannot explain Christianity itself, with its belief in Christ’s
          crucifixion and resurrection, and the ordinances which commemorate
          these facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Witness Thomas’s doubting, and Paul’s shipwrecks and scourgings.
          Cf. 2Pe_1:16—οὐ γὰρ σεσοφισμένοις μύθοις ἐξακολουθήσαντες = “we have
          not been on the false track of myths artificially elaborated.” See F.
          W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 49–88. (e) See the two books
          entitled: If the Gospel Narratives are Mythical,—What Then? and, But
          How,—if the Gospels are Historic? (f) As the existence of the American
          Republic is proof that there was once a Revolutionary War, so the
          existence of Christianity is proof of the death of Christ. The change
          from the seventh day to the first, in Sabbath observance, could never
          have come about in a nation so Sabbatarian, had not the first day been
          the celebration of an actual resurrection. Like the Jewish Passover

        <p>2nd. The Tendency-theory of Baur (1792–1860).</p>
        <p>
          This maintains that the gospels originated in the middle of the second
          century, and were written under assumed names as a means of
          reconciling opposing Jewish and Gentile tendencies in the church.
          “These great national tendencies find their satisfaction, not in
          events corresponding to them, but in the elaboration of conscious
          fictions.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur dates the fourth gospel at 160–170 a.d.; Matthew at 130; Luke at
          150; Mark at 150–160. Baur never inquires who Christ was. He turns his
          attention from the facts to the documents. If the documents be proved
          unhistorical, there is no need of examining the facts, for there are
          no facts to examine. He indicates the presupposition of his
          investigations, when he Says: “The principal argument for the later
          origin of the gospels must forever remain this, that separately, and
          still more when taken together, they give an account of the life of
          Jesus which involves impossibilities”—i. e., miracles. He would
          therefore remove their authorship far enough from Jesus’ time to
          permit regarding the miracles as inventions. Baur holds that in Christ
          were united the universalistic spirit of the new religion, and the
          particularistic form of the Jewish Messianic idea; some of his
          disciples laid emphasis on the one, some on the other; hence first
          conflict, but finally reconcilation; see statement of the Tübingen
          theory and of the way in which Baur was led to it, in Bruce.
          Apologetics, 360. E. G. Robinson interprets Baur as follows: “Paul =
          Protestant; Peter = sacramentarian; James = ethical; Paul + Peter +
          James = Christianity. Protestant preaching should dwell more on the
          ethical—cases of conscience—and less on mere doctrine, such as
          regeneration and justification.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur was a stranger to the needs of his own soul, and so to the real
          character of the gospel. One of his friends and advisers wrote, after
          his death, in terms that were meant to be laudatory: “His was a
          completely objective nature. No trace of personal needs or struggles
          is discernible in connection with his investigations of Christianity.”
          The estimate of posterity is probably expressed in the judgment with
          regard to the Tübingen school by Harnack: “The possible picture it
          sketched was not the real, and the key with which it attempted to
          solve all problems did not suffice for the most simple.…The Tübingen
          views have indeed been compelled to undergo very large modifications.
          As regards the development of the church in the second century, it may
          safely be said that the hypotheses of the Tübingen school have proved
          themselves everywhere inadequate, very erroneous, and are to-day held
          by only a very few scholars.” See Baur, Die kanonischen Evangelien;
          Canonical Gospels (Eng. transl.), 530; Supernatural Religion,
          1:213–444 and vol. 2: Pfleiderer, Hibbert Lectures for 1885. For
          accounts of Baur’s position, see Herzog, Encyclopädie, art.: Baur;
          Clarke’s transl. of Hase’s Life of Jesus, 34–36; Farrar, Critical
          History of Free Thought, 227, 228.
        </p>
        <p>We object to the Tendency-theory of Baur, that</p>
        <p>
          (a) The destructive criticism to which it subjects the gospels, if
          applied to secular documents, would deprive us of any certain
          knowledge of the past, and render all history impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assumption of artifice is itself unfavorable to a candid
          examination of the documents. A perverse acuteness can descry
          evidences of a hidden animus in the most simple and ingenuous literary
          productions. Instance the philosophical interpretation of “Jack and
          Jill.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The antagonistic doctrinal tendencies which it professes to find
          in the several gospels are more satisfactorily explained as varied but
          consistent aspects of the one system of truth held by all the
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur exaggerates the doctrinal and official differences between the
          leading apostles. Peter was not simply a Judaizing Christian, but was
          the first preacher to the Gentiles, and his doctrine appears to have
          been subsequently influenced to a considerable extent by Paul’s (see
          Plumptre on 1 Pet., 68–60). Paul was not an exclusively Hellenizing
          Christian, but invariably addressed the gospel to the Jews before he
          turned to the Gentiles, The evangelists give pictures of Jesus from
          different points of view. As the Parisian sculptor constructs his bust
          with the aid of a dozen photographs of his subject, all taken from
          different points of view, so from the four portraits furnished us by
          Matthew, Mark, Luke and John we are to construct the solid and
          symmetrical life of Christ. The deeper reality which makes
          reconciliation of the different views possible is the actual
          historical Christ. Marcus Dods, Expositor’s Greek Testament,
          1:675—“They are not two Christs, but one, which the four Gospels
          depict: diverse as the profile and front face, but one another’s
          complement rather than contradiction.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Godet, Introd. to Gospel Collection, 272—Matthew shows the greatness
          of Jesus—his full-length portrait; Mark his indefatigable activity;
          Luke his beneficent compassion; John his essential divinity. Matthew
          first wrote Aramæan Logia. This was translated into Greek and
          completed by a narrative of the ministry of Jesus for the Greek
          churches founded by Paul. This translation was not made by Matthew and
          did not make use of Mark (217–224). E. D. Burton: Matthew = fulfilment
          of past prophecy; Mark = manifestation of present power. Matthew is
          argument from prophecy; Mark is argument from miracle. Matthew, as
          prophecy, made most impression on Jewish readers; Mark, as power, was
          best adapted to Gentiles. Prof. Burton holds Mark to be based upon
          oral tradition alone; Matthew upon his Logia (his real earlier Gospel)
          and other fragmentary notes; while Luke has a fuller origin in
          manuscripts and in Mark. See Aids to the Study of German Theology,
          148–155; F. W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 61.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It is incredible that productions of such literary power and lofty
          religious teaching as the gospels should have sprung up in the middle
          of the second century, or that, so springing up, they should have been
          published under assumed names and for covert ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general character of the literature of the second century is
          illustrated by Ignatius’s fanatical desire for martyrdom, the value
          ascribed by Hermas to ascetic rigor, the insipid allegories of
          Barnabas, Clement of Rome’s belief in the phoenix, and the absurdities
          of the Apocryphal Gospels. The author of the fourth gospel among the
          writers of the second century would have been a mountain among
          mole-hills. Wynne, Literature of the Second Century, 60—“The apostolic
          and the sub-apostolic writers differ from each other as a nugget of
          pure gold differs from a block of quartz with veins of the precious
          metal gleaming through it.” Dorner, Hist. Doct. Person Christ,
          1:1:92—“Instead of the writers of the second century marking an
          advance on the apostolic age, or developing the germ given them by the
          apostles, the second century shows great retrogression,—its writers
          were not able to retain or comprehend all that had been given them.”
          Martineau, Seat of Authority, 291—“Writers not only barbarous in
          speech and rude in art, but too often puerile in conception,
          passionate in temper, and credulous in belief. The legends of Papias,
          the visions of Hermas, the imbecility of Irenæus, the fury of
          Tertullian, the rancor and indelicacy of Jerome, the stormy
          intolerance of Augustine, cannot fail to startle and repel the
          student; and, if he turns to the milder Hippolytus, he is introduced
          to a brood of thirty heresies which sadly dissipate his dream of the
          unity of the church.” We can apply to the writers of the second
          century the question of R. G. Ingersoll in the Shakespeare-Bacon
          controversy: “Is it possible that Bacon left the best children of his
          brain on Shakespeare’s doorstep, and kept only the deformed ones at
          home?” On the Apocryphal Gospels, see Cowper, in Strivings for the
          Faith, 73–108.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The theory requires us to believe in a moral anomaly, namely, that
          a faithful disciple of Christ in the second century could be guilty of
          fabricating a life of his master, and of claiming authority for it on
          the ground that the author had been a companion of Christ or his
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A genial set of Jesuitical religionists”—with mind and heart enough
          to write the gospel according to John, and who at the same time have
          cold-blooded sagacity enough to keep out of their writings every trace
          of the developments of church authority belonging to the second
          century. The newly discovered “Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,” if
          dating from the early part of that century, shows that such a
          combination is impossible. The critical theories assume that one who
          knew Christ as a man could not possibly also regard him as God.
          Lowrie, Doctrine of St. Joh_12:1-50—“If St. John wrote, it is not
          possible to say that the genius of St. Paul foisted upon the church a
          conception which was strange to the original apostles.” Fairbairn has
          well shown that if Christianity had been simply the ethical teaching
          of the human Jesus, it would have vanished from the earth like the
          sects of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees; if on the other hand, it
          had been simply the Logos-doctrine, the doctrine of a divine Christ,
          it would have passed away like the speculations of Plato or Aristotle;
          because Christianity unites the idea of the eternal Son of God with
          that of the incarnate Son of man, it is fitted to be and it has become
          an universal religion; see Fairbairn, Philosophy of the Christian
          Religion, 4, 15—“Without the personal charm of the historical Jesus,
          the œcumenical creeds would never have been either formulated or
          tolerated, and without the metaphysical conception of Christ the
          Christian religion would long ago have ceased to live.…It is not Jesus
          of Nazareth who has so powerfully entered into history; it is the
          deified Christ who has been believed, loved and obeyed as the Savior
          of the world.…The two parts of Christian doctrine are combined in the
          one name ‘Jesus Christ.’ ”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) This theory cannot account for the universal acceptance of the
          gospels at the end of the second century, among widely separated
          communities where reverence for writings of the apostles was a mark of
          orthodoxy, and where the Gnostic heresies would have made new
          documents instantly liable to suspicion and searching examination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abbot, Genuineness of the Fourth Gospel, 52, 80, 88, 89. The Johannine
          doctrine of the Logos, if first propounded in the middle of the second
          century, would have ensured the instant rejection of that gospel by
          the Gnostics, who ascribed creation, not to the Logos, but to
          successive “Æons.” How did the Gnostics, without “peep or mutter,”
          come to accept as genuine what had only in their own time been first
          sprung upon the churches? While Basilides (130) and Valentinus (150),
          the Gnostics, both quote from the fourth gospel, they do not dispute
          its genuineness or suggest that it was of recent origin. Bruce, in his
          Apologetics, says of Baur “He believed in the all-sufflciency of the
          Hegelian theory of development through antagonism. He saw tendency
          everywhere. Anything additional, putting more contents into the person
          and teaching of Jesus than suits the initial stage of development,
          must be reckoned spurious. If we find Jesus in any of the gospels
          claiming to be a supernatural being, such texts can with the utmost
          confidence be set aside as spurious, for such a thought could not
          belong to the initial stage of Christianity.” But such a conception
          certainly existed in the second century, and it directly antagonized
          the speculations of the Gnostics. F. W. Farrar, on Heb_12:1-29—“The
          word œon was used by the later Gnostics to describe the various
          emanations by which they tried at once to widen and to bridge over the
          gulf between the human and the divine. Over that imaginary chasm John
          threw the arch of the Incarnation, when he wrote: ‘The Word became
          flesh’ (Joh_1:14).” A document which so contradicted the Gnostic
          teachings could not in the second century have been quoted by the
          Gnostics themselves without dispute as to its genuineness, if it had
          not been long recognized in the churches as a work of the apostle
          John.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) The acknowledgment by Baur that the epistles to the Romans,
          Galatians and Corinthians were written by Paul in the first century is
          fatal to his theory, since these epistles testify not only to miracles
          at the period at which they were written, but to the main events of
          Jesus’ life and to the miracle of his resurrection, as facts already
          long acknowledged in the Christian church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur, Paulus der Apostel, 276—“There never has been the slightest
          suspicion of unauthenticity cast on these epistles (Gal_1:1-24 and 2
          Cor., Rom.), and they bear so incontestably the character of Pauline
          originality, that there is no conceivable ground for the assertion of
          critical doubts in their case.” Baur, in discussing the appearance of
          Christ to Paul on the way to Damascus, explains the outward from the
          inward: Paul translated intense and sudden conviction of the truth of
          the Christian religion into an outward scene. But this cannot explain
          the hearing of the outward sound by Paul’s companions. On the
          evidential value of the epistles here mentioned, see Lorimer, in
          Strivings for the Faith, 109–144; Howson, in Present Day Tracts, 4:
          no. 24; Row, Bampton Lectures for 1877:289–356. On Baur and his theory

        <p>3d. The Romance-theory of Renan (1823–1892).</p>
        <p>
          This theory admits a basis of truth in the gospels and holds that they
          all belong to the century following Jesus’ death. “According to”
          Matthew, Mark, etc., however, means only that Matthew, Mark, etc.,
          wrote these gospels in substance. Renan claims that the facts of
          Jesus’ life were so sublimated by enthusiasm, and so overlaid with
          pious fraud, that the gospels in their present form cannot be accepted
          as genuine,—in short, the gospels are to be regarded as historical
          romances which have only a foundation in fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animus of this theory is plainly shown in Renan’s Life of Jesus,
          preface to 13th ed.—“If miracles and the inspiration of certain books
          are realities, my method is detestable. If miracles and the
          inspiration of books are beliefs without reality, my method is a good
          one. But the question of the supernatural is decided for us with
          perfect certainty by the single consideration that there is no room
          for believing in a thing of which the world offers no experimental
          trace.” “On the whole,” says Reuan, “I admit as authentic the four
          canonical gospels. All, in my opinion, date from the first century,
          and the authors are, generally speaking, those to whom they are
          attributed.” He regards Gal_1:1-24 and 2 Cor., and Rom., as
          “indisputable and undisputed.” He speaks of them as “being texts of an
          absolute authenticity, of complete sincerity, and without legends”
          (Les Apôtres, xxix; Les Évangiles, xi). Yet he denies to Jesus
          “sincerity with himself”; attributes to him “innocent artifice” and
          the toleration of pious fraud, as for example in the case of the
          stories of Lazarus and of his own resurrection. “To conceive the good
          is not sufficient: it must be made to succeed; to accomplish this,
          less pure paths must be followed.…Not by any fault of his own, his
          conscience lost somewhat of its original purity,—his mission
          overwhelmed him.…Did he regret his too lofty nature, and, victim of
          his own greatness, mourn that he had not remained a simple artizan?”
          So Renan “pictures Christ’s later life as a misery and a lie, yet he
          requests us to bow before this sinner and before his superior,
          Sakya-Mouni, as demigods” (see Nicoll, The Church’s One Foundation,
          62, 63). Of the highly wrought imagination of Mary Magdalene, he says:
          “O divine power of love! sacred moments, in which the passion of one
          whose senses were deceived gives us a resuscitated God!” See Renan,
          Life of Jesus, 21.
        </p>
        <p>To this Romance-theory of Renan, we object that</p>
        <p>
          (a) It involves an arbitrary and partial treatment of the Christian
          documents. The claim that one writer not only borrowed from others,
          but interpolated ad libitum, is contradicted by the essential
          agreement of the manuscripts as quoted by the Fathers, and as now
          extant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Renan, according to Mair, Christian Evidences, 153, dates Matthew at
          84 a.d.; Mark at 76; Luke at 94; John at 125. These dates mark a
          considerable retreat from the advanced positions taken by Baur. Mair,
          in his chapter on Recent Reverses in Negative Criticism, attributes
          this result to the late discoveries with regard to the Epistle of
          Barnabas, Hippolytus’s Refutation of all Heresies, the Clementine
          Homilies, and Tatian’s Diatessaron: “According to Baur and bis
          immediate followers, we have less than one quarter of the N. T.
          belonging to the first century. According to Hilgenfeld, the present
          head of the Baur school, we have somewhat less than three quarters
          belonging to the first century, while substantially the same thing may
          be said with regard to Holzmann. According to Renan, we have
          distinctly more than three quarters of the N. T. falling within the
          first century, and therefore within the apostolic age. This surely
          indicates a very decided and extraordinary retreat since the time of
          Baur’s grand assault, that is, within the last fifty years.” We may
          add that the concession of authorship within the apostolic age renders
          nugatory Renan’s hypothesis that the N. T. documents have been so
          enlarged by pious fraud that they cannot be accepted as trustworthy
          accounts of such events as miracles. The oral tradition itself had
          attained so fixed a form that the many manuscripts used by the Fathers
          were in substantial agreement in respect to these very events, and
          oral tradition in the East hands down without serious alteration much
          longer narratives than those of our gospels. The Pundita Ramabai can
          repeat after the lapse of twenty years portions of the Hindu sacred
          books exceeding in amount the whole contents of our Old Testament.
          Many cultivated men in Athens knew by heart all the Iliad and the
          Odyssey of Homer. Memory and reverence alike kept the gospel
          narratives free from the corruption which Renan supposes.

          (b) It attributes to Christ and to the apostles an alternate fervor of
          romantic enthusiasm and a false pretense of miraculous power which are
          utterly irreconcilable with the manifest sobriety and holiness of
          their lives and teachings. If Jesus did not work miracles, he was an
          impostor.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Ernest Renan, His Life and the Life of Jesus, see A. H. Strong,
          Christ in Creation, 332–363, especially 356—“Renan attributes the
          origin of Christianity to the predominance in Palestine of a
          constitutional susceptibility to mystic excitements. Christ is to him
          the incarnation of sympathy and tears, a being of tender impulses and
          passionate ardors, whose native genius it was to play upon the hearts
          of men. Truth or falsehood made little difference to him; anything
          that would comfort the poor, or touch the finer feelings of humanity,
          he availed himself of; ecstasies, visions, melting moods, these were
          the secrets of his power. Religion was a beneficent superstition, a
          sweet delusion—excellent as a balm and solace for the ignorant crowd,
          who never could be philosophers if they tried. And so the gospel
          river, as one has said, is traced back to a fountain of weeping men
          and women whose brains had oozed out at their eyes, and the perfection
          of spirituality is made to be a sort of maudlin monastioism.…How
          different from the strong: and holy love of Christ, which would save
          men only by bringing them to the truth, and which claims men’s
          imitation only because, without love for God and for the soul, a man
          is without truth. How inexplicable from this view the fact that a pure
          Christianity has everywhere quickened the intellect of the nations,
          and that every revival of it, as at the Reformation, has been followed
          by mighty forward leaps of civilization. Was Paul a man carried away
          by mystic dreams and irrational enthusiasms? Let the keen dialectic
          skill of his epistles and his profound grasp of the great matters of
          revelation answer. Has the Christian church been a company of puling
          sentimentalists? Let the heroic deaths for the truth suffered by the
          martyrs witness. Nay, he must have a low idea of his kind, and a yet
          lower idea of the God who made them, who can believe that the noblest
          spirits of the race have risen to greatness by abnegating will and
          reason, and have gained influence over all ages by resigning
          themselves to semi-idiocy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It fails to account for the power and progress of the gospel, as a
          system directly opposed to men’s natural tastes and prepossessions—a
          system which substitutes truth for romance and law for impulse.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 358—“And if the later triumphs of
          Christianity are inexplicable upon the theory of Renan, how can we
          explain its founding? The sweet swain of Galilee, beloved by women for
          his beauty, fascinating the unlettered crowd by his gentle speech and
          his poetic ideals, giving comfort to the sorrowing and hope to the
          poor, credited with supernatural power which at first he thinks it not
          worth while to deny and finally gratifies the multitude by pretending
          to exercise, roused by opposition to polemics and invective until the
          delightful young rabbi becomes a gloomy giant, an intractable fanatic,
          a fierce revolutionist, whose denunciation of the powers that be
          brings him to the Cross,—what is there in him to account for the moral
          wonder which we call Christianity and the beginnings of its empire in
          the world? Neither delicious pastorals like those of Jesus’ first
          period, nor apocalyptic fevers like those of his second period,
          according to Renan’s gospel, furnish any rational explanation of that
          mighty movement which has swept through the earth and has
          revolutionized the faith of mankind.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Berdoe, Browning, 47—“If Christ were not God, his life at that stage
          of the world’s history could by no possibility have had the vitalizing
          force and love-compelling power that Kenan’s pages everywhere
          disclose. Renan has strengthened faith in Christ’s deity while
          laboring to destroy it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Renan, in discussing Christ’s appearance to Paul on the way to
          Damascus, explains the inward from the outward, thus precisely
          reversing the conclusion of Baur. A sudden storm, a flash of
          lightning, a sudden attack of ophthalmic fever, Paul took as an
          appearance from heaven. But we reply that so keen an observer and
          reasoner could not have been thus deceived. Nothing could have made
          him the apostle to the Gentiles but a sight of the glorified Christ
          and the accompanying revelation of the holiness of God, his own sin,
          the sacrifice of the Son of God, its universal efficacy, the
          obligation laid upon him to proclaim it to the ends of the earth. For
          reviews of Renan, see Hutton, Essays, 261–281, and Contemp. Thought

        <p>4th. The Development-theory of Harnack (born 1851).</p>
        <p>
          This holds Christianity to be a historical development from germs
          which were devoid of both dogma and miracle. Jesus was a teacher of
          ethics, and the original gospel is most clearly represented by the
          Sermon on the Mount. Greek influence, and especially that of the
          Alexandrian philosophy, added to this gospel a theological and
          supernatural element, and so changed Christianity from a life into a
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harnack dates Matthew at 70–75; Mark at 65–70: Luke at 78–93; the
          fourth gospel at 80–110. He regards both the fourth gospel and the
          book of Revelation as the works, not of John the Apostle, but of John
          the Presbyter. He separates the prologue of the fourth gospel from the
          gospel itself, and considers the prologue as a preface added after its
          original composition in order to enable the Hellenistic reader to
          understand it. “The gospel itself,” says Harnack, “contains no
          Logos-idea; it did not develop out of a Logos-idea, such as flourished
          at Alexandria; it only connects itself with such an idea. The gospel
          itself is based upon the historic Christ; he is the subject of all its
          statements. This historical trait can in no way be dissolved by any
          kind of speculation. The memory of what was actually historical was
          still too powerful to admit at this point any Gnostic influences. The
          Logos-idea of the prologue is the Logos of Alexandrine Judaism, the
          Logos of Philo, and it is derived ultimately from the ‘Son of man’ in
          the book of Daniel.…The fourth gospel, which does not proceed from the
          Apostle John and does not so claim, cannot be used as a historical
          source in the ordinary sense of that word.…The author has managed with
          sovereign freedom; has transposed occurrences and has put them in a
          light that is foreign to them; has of his own accord composed the
          discourses, and has illustrated lofty thoughts by inventing situations
          for them. Difficult as it is to recognize, an actual tradition in his
          work is not wholly lacking. For the history of Jesus, however, it can
          hardly anywhere be taken into account; only little can be taken from
          it, and that with caution.…On the other hand it is a source of the
          first rank for the answer of the question what living views of the
          person of Jesus, what light and what warmth, the gospel has brought
          into being.” See Harnack’s article in Zeitschrift für Theol. u.
          Kirche, 2:189–231, and his Wesen des Christenthums, 13. Kaftan also,
          who belongs to the same Ritschlian school with Harnack, tells us in
          his Truth of the Christian Religion, 1:97, that as the result of the
          Logos-speculation, “the centre of gravity, instead of being placed in
          the historical Christ who founded the kingdom of God, is placed in the
          Christ who as eternal Logos of God was the mediator in the creation of
          the world.” This view is elaborated by Hatch in his Hibbert Lectures
          for 1888, on the Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the
          Christian Church.
        </p>
        <p>We object to the Development-theory of Harnack, that</p>
        <p>
          (a) The Sermon on the Mount is not the sum of the gospel, nor its
          original form. Mark is the most original of the gospels, yet Mark
          omits the Sermon on the Mount, and Mark is preëminently the gospel of
          the miracle-worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) All four gospels lay the emphasis, not on Jesus’ life and ethical
          teaching, but on his death and resurrection. Matthew implies Christ’s
          deity when it asserts his absolute knowledge of the Father (11:27),
          his universal judgeship (25:32), his supreme authority (28:18), and
          his omnipresence (28:20), while the phrase “Son of man” implies that
          he is also “Son of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mat_11:27—“All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no
          one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the
          Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal
          him”: Mat_25:32—“and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and
          he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth
          the sheep from the goats”; Mat_28:18—“All authority hath been given
          unto me in heaven and on earth”; Mat_28:20—“lo, I am with you always,
          even unto the end of the world.” These sayings of Jesus in Matthew’s
          gospel show that the conception of Christ’s greatness was not peculiar
          to John: “I am” transcends time; “with you” transcends space. Jesus
          speaks “sub specie etemitatis”; his utterance is equivalent to that of
          Joh_8:58—“Before Abraham was born, I am,” and to that of
          Heb_13:8—“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day, yea and for
          ever.” He is, as Paul declares in Eph_1:23, one “that filleth all in
          all,” that is, who is omnipresent.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. H. Strong, Philos. and Religion, 206—The phrase “Son of man”
          intimates that Christ was more than man: “Suppose I were to go about
          proclaiming myself ‘Son of man.’ Who does not see that it would be
          mere impertinence, unless I claimed to be something more. ‘Son of Man?
          But what of that? Cannot every human being call himself the same?’
          When one takes the title ‘Son of man’ for his characteristic
          designation, as Jesus did, he implies that there is something strange
          in his being Son of man; that this is not his original condition and
          dignity; that it is condescension on his part to be Son of man. In
          short, when Christ calls himself Son of man, it implies that he has
          come from a higher level of being to inhabit this low earth of ours.
          And so, when we are asked ‘What think ye of the Christ? whose son is
          he?’ we must answer, not simply, He is Son of man, but also, He is Son
          of God.” On Son of man, see Driver; on Son of God, see Sanday; both in
          Hastings’ Dictionary of the Bible. Sanday: “The Son is so called
          primarily as incarnate. But that which is the essence of the
          Incarnation must needs be also larger than the Incarnation. It must
          needs have its roots in the eternity of Godhead.” Gore, Incarnation,
          65, 73—“Christ, the final Judge, of the synoptics, is not dissociable
          from the divine, eternal Being, of the fourth gospel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The preëxistence and atonement of Christ cannot be regarded as
          accretions upon the original gospel, since these find expression in
          Paul who wrote before any of our evangelists, and in his epistles
          anticipated the Logos-doctrine of John.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) We may grant that Greek influence, through the Alexandrian
          philosophy, helped the New Testament writers to discern what was
          already present in the life and work and teaching of Jesus; but, like
          the microscope which discovers but does not create, it added nothing
          to the substance of the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gore, Incarnation, 62—“The divinity, incarnation, resurrection of
          Christ were not an accretion upon the original belief of the apostles
          and their first disciples, for these are all recognized as
          uncontroverted matters of faith in the four great epistles of Paul,
          written at a date when the greater part of those who had seen the
          risen Christ were still alive.” The Alexandrian philosophy was not the
          source of apostolic doctrine, but only the form in which that doctrine
          was cast, the light thrown upon it which brought out its meaning. A.
          H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 146—“When we come to John’s gospel,
          therefore, we find in it the mere unfolding of truth that for
          substance had been in the world for at least sixty years.…If the
          Platonizing philosophy of Alexandria assisted in this genuine
          development of Christian doctrine, then the Alexandrian philosophy was
          a providential help to Inspiration. The microscope does not invent; it
          only discovers. Paul and John did not add to the truth of Christ;
          their philosophical equipment was only a microscope which brought into
          clear view the truth that was there already.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:126—“The metaphysical conception of
          the Logos, as immanent in the world and ordering it according to law,
          was filled with religious and moral contents. In Jesus the cosmical
          principle of nature became a religious principle of salvation.” See
          Kilpatrick’a article on Philosophy, in Hastings’ Bible Dictionary.
          Kilpatrick holds that Harnack ignores the self-consciousness of Jesus;
          does not fairly interpret the Acts in its mention of the early worship
          of Jesus by the church before Greek philosophy had influenced it;
          refers to the intellectual peculiarities of the N. T. writers
          conceptions which Paul insists are simply the faith of all Christian
          people as such; forgets that the Christian idea of union with God
          secured through the atoning and reconciling work of a personal
          Redeemer utterly transcended Greek thought, and furnished the solution
          of the problem after which Greek philosophy was vainly groping. (e)
          Though Mark says nothing of the virgin-birth because his story is
          limited to what the apostles had witnessed of Jesus’ deeds, Matthew
          apparently gives us Joseph’s story and Luke gives Mary’s story—both
          stories naturally published only after Jesus’ resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) The larger understanding of doctrine after Jesus’ death was itself
          predicted by our Lord (Joh_16:12). The Holy Spirit was to bring his
          teachings to remembrance, and to guide into all the truth (16:13), and
          the apostles were to continue the work of teaching which he had begun
          (Act_1:1).
        </p>
        <p>
          Joh_16:12-13—“I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
          bear them now. Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he
          shall guide you into all the truth”; Act_1:1—“The former treatise I
          made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began to do and to
          teach.” A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 146—“That the beloved
          disciple, after a half century of meditation upon what he had seen and
          heard of God manifest in the flesh, should have penetrated more deeply
          into the meaning of that wonderful revelation is not only not
          surprising,—it is precisely what Jesus himself foretold. Our Lord had
          many things to say to his disciples, but then they could not bear
          them. He promised that the Holy Spirit should bring to their
          remembrance both himself and his words, and should lead them into all
          the truth. And this is the whole secret of what are called accretions
          to original Christianity. So far as they are contained in Scripture,
          they are inspired discoveries and unfoldings, not mere speculations
          and inventions. They are not additions, but elucidations, not vain
          imaginings, but correct intepretations.…When the later theology, then,
          throws out the supernatural and dogmatic, as coming not from Jesus but
          from Paul’s epistles and from the fourth gospel, our claim is that
          Paul and John are only inspired and authoritative interpreters of
          Jesus, seeing themselves and making us see the fulness of the Godhead
          that dwelt in him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          While Harnack, in our judgment, errs in his view that Paul contributed
          to the gospel elements which it did not originally possess, he shows
          us very clearly many of the elements in that gospel which he was the
          first to recognize. In his Wesen des Christenthums, 111, he tells us
          that a few years ago a celebrated Protestant theologian declared that
          Paul, with his Rabbinical theology, was the destroyer of the Christian
          religion. Others have regarded him as the founder of that religion.
          But the majority have seen in him the apostle who best understood his
          Lord and did most to continue his work. Paul, as Harnack maintains,
          first comprehended the gospel definitely: (1) as an accomplished
          redemption and a present salvation—the crucified and risen Christ as
          giving access to God and righteousness and peace therewith; (2) as
          something new, which does away with the religion of the law; (3) as
          meant for all, and therefore for Gentiles also, indeed, as superseding
          Judaism; (4) as expressed in terms which are not simply Greek but also
          human,—Paul made the gospel comprehensible to the world. Islam, rising
          in Arabia, is an Arabian religion still. Buddhism remains an Indian
          religion. Christianity is at home in all lands. Paul put new life into
          the Roman empire, and inaugurated the Christian culture of the West.
          He turned a local into a universal religion. His influence however,
          according to Harnack, tended to the undue exaltation of organization
          and dogma and O. T. inspiration—points in which, in our judgment, Paul
          took sober middle ground and saved Christian truth for the world.
        </p>
        <p>2. Genuineness of the Books of the Old Testament.</p>
        <p>
          Since nearly one half of the Old Testament is of anonymous authorship
          and certain of its books may be attributed to definite historic
          characters only by way of convenient classification or of literary
          personification, we here mean by genuineness honesty of purpose and
          freedom from anything counterfeit or intentionally deceptive so far as
          respects the age or the authorship of the documents.
        </p>
        <p>We show the genuineness of the Old Testament books:</p>
        <p>
          (a) From the witness of the New Testament, in which all but six books
          of the Old Testament are either quoted or alluded to as genuine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The N. T. shows coincidences of language with the O. T. Apocryphal
          books, but it contains only one direct quotation from them; while,
          with the exception of Judges, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Esther, Ezra,
          and Nehemiah, every book in the Hebrew canon, is used either for
          illustration or proof. The single Apocryphal quotation is found in
          Jud_1:14 and is in all probability taken from the book of Enoch.
          Although Volkmar puts the date of this book at 132 a.d., and although
          some critics hold that Jude quoted only the same primitive tradition
          of which the author of the book of Enoch afterwards made use, the
          weight of modern scholarship inclines to the opinion that the book
          itself was written as early as 170–70 b.c., and that Jude quoted from
          it; see Hastings’ Bible Dictionary: Book of Enoch; Sanday, Bampton
          Lect. on Inspiration, 95. “If Paul could quote from Gentile poets
          (Act_17:28; Tit_1:12), it is hard to understand why Jude could not
          cite a work which was certainly in high standing among the faithful”;
          see Schodde, Book of Enoch 41 , with the Introd. by Ezra Abbot. While
          Jud_1:14 gives us the only direct and express quotation from an
          Apocryphal book, Jud_1:6; Jud_1:9 contain allusions to the Book of
          Enoch and to the Assumption of Moses; see Charles, Assumption of
          Moses, 62. In Heb_1:3, we have words taken from Wis_7:26; and
          Heb_11:34-38 is a reminiscence of 1 Maccabees.

          Josephus enumerates twenty-two of these books “which are justly
          accredited” (omit θεῖα—Niese, and Hastings’ Dict., 3:607). Our present
          Hebrew Bible makes twenty-four, by separating Ruth from Judges, and
          Lamentations from Jeremiah. See Josephus, Against Apion, 1:8; Smith’s
          Bible Dictionary, article on the Canon, 1:359–360, Philo (born 20
          b.c.) never quotes an Apocryphal book, although he does quote from
          nearly all the books of the O. T.; see Ryle, Philo and Holy Scripture.
          George Adam Smith, Modern Criticism and Preaching, 7—“The theory which
          ascribed the Canon of the O. T. to a single decision of the Jewish
          church in the days of its inspiration is not a theory supported by
          facts. The growth of the O. T. Canon was very gradual. Virtually it
          began in 621 b.c., with the acceptance by all Judah of Deuteronomy,
          and the adoption of the whole Law, or first five books of the O. T.,
          under Nehemiah in 446 b.c. Then came the prophets before 200 b.c., and
          the Hagiographa from a century to two centuries later. The strict
          definition of the last division was not complete by the time of
          Christ. Christ seems to testify to the Law, the Prophets, and the
          Psalms; yet neither Christ nor his apostles make any quotation from
          Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Canticles, or Ecclesiastes, the last of which
          books were not yet recognized by all the Jewish schools. But while
          Christ is the chief authority for the O. T., he was also its first
          critic. He rejected some parts of the Law and was indifferent to many
          others. He enlarged the sixth and seventh commandments, and reversed
          the eye for an eye, and the permission of divorce; touched the leper,
          and reckoned all foods lawful; broke away from literal observance of
          the Sabbath-day; left no commands about sacrifice, temple-worship,
          circumcision, but, by institution of the New Covenant, abrogated these
          sacraments of the Old. The apostles appealed to extra-canonical
          writings.” Gladden, Seven Puzzling Bible Books, 68–96—“Doubts were
          entertained in our Lord’s day as to the canonicity of several parts of
          the O. T., especially Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon,
          Esther.”

          MSS. of the Septuagint contain, indeed, the O. T. Apocrypha, but the
          writers of the latter do not recognize their own work as on a level
          with the canonical Scriptures, which they regard as distinct from all
          other books (Ecclesiasticus, prologue, and 48:24; also 24:23–27;
          1Ma_12:9; 2Ma_6:23; 1Es_1:28; 1Es_6:1; Bar_2:21). So both ancient and
          modern Jews. See Bissell, in Lange’s Commentary on the Apocrypha,
          Introduction, 44. In the prologue to the apocryphal book of
          Ecclesiasticus, we read of “the Law and the Prophets and the rest of
          the books,” which shows that as early as 130 b.c., the probable date
          of Ecclesiasticus, a threefold division of the Jewish sacred books was
          recognized. That the author, however, did not conceive of these books
          as constituting a completed canon seems evident from his assertion in
          this connection that his grandfather Jesus also wrote. 1Ma_12:9 (80–90
          b.c.) speaks of “the sacred books which are now in our hands.”
          Hastings, Bible Dictionary, 3:611—“The O. T. was the result of a
          gradual process which began with the sanction of the Hexateuch by Ezra
          and Nehemiah, and practically closed with the decisions of the Council
          of Jamnia”—Jamnia is the ancient Jabneh, 7 miles south by west of
          Tiberias, where met a council of rabbins at some time between 90 to
          118 a.d.;. This Council decided in favor of Canticles and
          Ecclesiastes, and closed the O. T. Canon.

          The Greek version of the Pentateuch which forms a part of the
          Septuagint is said by Josephus to have been made in the reign and by
          the order of Ptolemy Philadelphus, King of Egypt, about 270 or 280
          b.c. “The legend is that it was made by seventy-two persons in
          seventy-two days. It is supposed, however, by modern critics that this
          version of the several books is the work not only of different hands
          but of separate times. It is probable that at first only the
          Pentateuch was translated, and the remaining books gradually; but the
          translation is believed to have been completed by the second century
          b.c.” (Century Dictionary, in voce). It therefore furnishes an
          important witness to the genuineness of our O. T. documents. Driver,
          Introd. to O. T. Lit., xxxi—“For the opinion, often met with in modern
          books, that the Canon of the O. T. was closed by Ezra, or in Ezra’s
          time, there is no foundation in antiquity whatever.…All that can
          reasonably be treated as historical in the accounts of Ezra’s literary
          labors is limited to the Law.”

          (d) From indications that soon after the exile, and so early as the
          times of Ezra and Nehemiah (500–450 b.c.), the Pentateuch together
          with the book of Joshua was not only in existence but was regarded as
          authoritative.

          2Ma_2:13-15 intimates that Nehemiah founded a library, and there is a
          tradition that a “Great Synagogue” was gathered in his time to
          determine the Canon. But Hastings’ Dictionary, 4:644, asserts that
          “the Great Synagogue was originally a meeting, and not an institution.
          It met once for all, and all that is told about it, except what we
          read in Nehemiah, is pure fable of the later Jews.” In like manner no
          dependence is to be placed upon the tradition that Ezra miraculously
          restored the ancient Scriptures that had been lost during the exile.
          Clement of Alexandria says: “Since the Scriptures perished in the
          Captivity of Nebuchadnezzar, Esdras (the Greek form of Ezra) the
          Levite, the priest, in the time of Artaxerxes, King of the Persians,
          having become inspired in the exercise of prophecy, restored again the
          whole of the ancient Scriptures.” But the work now divided into 1 and
          2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, mentions Darius Codomannus
          (Neh_12:22), whose date is 336 b.c. The utmost the tradition proves is
          that about 300 b.c. the Pentateuch was in some sense attributed to
          Moses; see Bacon, Genesis of Gen_35:1-29; Bib. Sac, 1863:381, 660,
          799; Smith, Bible Dict., art.: Pentateuch; Theological Eclectic,
          6:215; Bissell, Hist. Origin of the Bible, 398–403. On the Men of the

          (e) From the testimony of the Samaritan Pentateuch, dating from the
          time of Ezra and Nehemiah (500–450 b.c.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Samaritans had been brought by the king of Assyria from “Babylon,
          and from Cuthah and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim”
          (2Ki_17:6; 2Ki_17:24; 2Ki_17:26), to take the place of the people of
          Israel whom the king had carried away captive to his own land. The
          colonists had brought their heathen gods with them, and the incursions
          of wild beasts which the intermission of tillage occasioned gave rise
          to the belief that the God of Israel was against them. One of the
          captive Jewish priests was therefore sent to teach them “the law of
          the god of the land” and he “taught them how they should fear Jehovah”
          (2Ki_17:27-28). The result was that they adopted the Jewish ritual,
          but combined the worship of Jehovah with that of their graven images
          (verse 2Ki_17:33). When the Jews returned from Babylon and began to
          rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, the Samaritans offered their aid, but
          this aid was indignantly refused (Ezr_4:1-24 and Neh_4:1-23).
          Hostility arose between Jews and Samaritans—a hostility which
          continued not only to the time of Christ (Joh_4:9), but even to the
          present day. Since the Samaritan Pentateuch substantially coincides
          with the Hebrew Pentateuch, it furnishes us with a definite past date
          at which it certainly existed in nearly its present form. It witnesses
          to the existence of our Pentateuch in essentially its present form as
          far back as the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.

          Green, Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch, 44, 45—“After being
          repulsed by the Jews, the Samaritans, to substantiate their claim of
          being sprung from ancient Israel, eagerly accepted the Pentateuch
          which was brought them by a renegade priest.” W. Robertson Smith, in
          Encyc. Brit., 21:244—“The priestly law, which is throughout based on
          the practice of the priests of Jerusalem before the captivity, was
          reduced to form after the exile, and was first published by Ezra as
          the law of the rebuilt temple of Zion. The Samaritans must therefore
          have derived their Pentateuch from the Jews after Ezra’s reforms, i.
          e., after 444 b.c. Before that time Samaritanism cannot have existed
          in a form at all similar to that which we know; but there must have
          been a community ready to accept the Pentateuch.” See Smith’s Bible

          art.: Samaria; Stanley Leathes, Structure of the O. T., 1–41.

          proclaimed to be the law of the land. Curtis, in Hastings’ Bible
          Dict., 3:596—“The earliest written law or book of divine instruction
          of whose introduction or enactment an authentic account is given, was
          Deuteronomy or its main portion, represented as found in the temple in
          the 18th year of king Josiah (b.c. 621) and proclaimed by the king as
          the law of the land. From that time forward Israel had a written law
          which the pious believer was commanded to ponder day and night
          (Jos_1:8; Psa_1:2); and thus the Torah, as sacred literature, formally
          commenced in Israel. This law aimed at a right application of Mosaic
          principles.” Ryle, in Hastings’ Bible Dict., 1:602—“The law of
          Deuteronomy represents an expansion and development of the ancient
          code contained in Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36; Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33,
          and precedes the final formulation of the priestly ritual, which only

          Andrew Harper, on Deuteronomy, in Expositor’s Bible: “Deuteronomy does
          not claim to have been written by Moses. He is spoken of in the third
          person in the introduction and historical framework, while the
          speeches of Moses are in the first person. In portions where the
          author speaks for himself, the phrase ‘beyond Jordan’ means east of
          Jordan; in the speeches of Moses the phrase ‘beyond Jordan’ means west
          of Jordan; and the only exception is Deu_3:8, which cannot originally
          have been part of the speech of Moses. But the style of both parts is
          the same, and if the 3rd person parts are by a later author, the 1st
          person parts are by a later author also. Both differ from other
          speeches of Moses in the Pentateuch. Can the author be a contemporary
          writer who gives Moses’ words, as John gave the words of Jesus? No,
          for Deuteronomy covers only the book of the Covenant, Exo_20:1-26;
          Exo_21:1-36; Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33. It uses JE but not P, with
          which JE is interwoven. But JE appears in Joshua and contributes to it
          an account of Joshua’s death. JE speaks of kings in Israel
          (Gen_36:31-39). Deuteronomy plainly belongs to the early centuries of
          the Kingdom, or to the middle of it.”

          Gen_47:1-31; Gen_48:1-22; Gen_49:1-33—“The Deuteronomic law was so
          short that Shaphan could read it aloud before the king (2Ki_22:10) and
          the king could read “the whole of it” before the people (2Ki_23:2);
          compare the reading of the Pentateuch for a whole week (Neh_8:2-18).
          It was in the form of a covenant; it was distinguished by curses; it
          was an expansion and modification, fully within the legitimate
          province of the prophet, of a Torah of Moses codified from the
          traditional form of at least a century before. Such a Torah existed,
          was attributed to Moses, and is now incorporated as ‘the book of the
          covenant’ in Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36; Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33;
          Exo_24:1-18. The year 620 is therefore the terminus a quo of
          Deuteronomy. The date of the priestly code is 444 b.c.” Sanday,
          Bampton Lectures for 1893, grants “(1) the presence in the Pentateuch
          of a considerable element which in its present shape is held by many
          to be not earlier than the captivity; (2) the composition of the book
          of Deuteronomy, not long, or at least not very long, before its
          promulgation by king Josiah in the year 621, which thus becomes a
          pivot-date in the history of Hebrew literature.”

          (g) From references in the prophets Hosea (b.c. 743–737) and Amos

          Hos_8:12—“I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law”; here is
          asserted the existence prior to the time of the prophet, not only of a
          law, but of a written law. All critics admit the book of Hosea to be a
          genuine production of the prophet, dating from the eighth century
          b.c.; see Green, in Presb. Rev., 1886:585–608. Amo_2:4—“they have
          rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes”; here is
          proof that, more than a century before the finding of Deuteronomy in
          the temple, Israel was acquainted with God’s law. Fisher, Nature and
          Method of Revelation, 26, 27—“The lofty plane reached by the prophets
          was not reached at a single bound.…There must have been a tap-root
          extending far down into the earth.” Kurtz remarks that “the later
          books of the O. T. would be a tree without roots, if the composition
          of the Pentateuch were transferred to a later period of Hebrew
          history.” If we substitute for the word ‘Pentateuch’ the words ‘Book
          of the covenant,’ we may assent to this dictum of Kurtz. There is
          sufficient evidence that, before the times of Hosea and Amos, Israel
          possessed a written law—the law embraced in Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36;
          Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33; Exo_24:1-18—but the Pentateuch as we now
          have it, including Leviticus, seems to date no further back than the
          time of Jeremiah, 445 b.c.. The Levitical law however was only the
          codification of statutes and customs whose origin lay far back in the
          past and which were believed to be only the natural expansion of the
          principles of Mosaic legislation.

          Leathes, Structure of O. T., 54—“Zeal for the restoration of the
          temple after the exile implied that it had long before been the centre
          of the national polity, that there had been a ritual and a law before
          the exile.” Present Day Tracts, 3:52—Levitical institutions could not
          have been first established by David, It is inconceivable that he
          “could have taken a whole tribe, and no trace remain of so
          revolutionary a measure as the dispossessing them of their property to
          make them ministers of religion.” James Robertson, Early History of
          Israel: “The varied literature of 850–750 b.c. implies the existence
          of reading and writing for some time before. Amos and Hosea hold, for
          the period succeeding Moses, the same scheme of history which modern
          critics pronounce late and unhistorical. The eighth century b.c. was a
          time of broad historic day, when Israel had a definite account to give
          of itself and of its history. The critics appeal to the prophets, but
          they reject the prophets when these tell us that other teachers taught
          the same truth before them, and when they declare that their nation
          had been taught a better religion and had declined from it, in other
          words, that there had been law long before their day. The kings did
          not give law. The priests presupposed it. There must have been a
          formal system of law much earlier than the critics admit, and also an
          earlier reference in their worship to the great events which made them
          a separate people.” And Dillman goes yet further back and declares
          that the entire work of Moses presupposes “a preparatory stage of
          higher religion in Abraham.”

          made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they
          were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of
          the covenant of Jehovah, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it
          by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it
          may be there for a witness against thee.” The law here mentioned may
          possibly be only ‘the book of the covenant” (Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36;
          Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33; Exo_24:1-18), and the speeches of Moses in
          Deuteronomy may have been orally handed down. But the fact that Moses
          was “instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (Act_7:22),
          together with the fact that the art of writing was known in Egypt for
          many hundred years before bis time, make it more probable that a
          larger portion of the Pentateuch was of his own composition.

          inhabitants of Babylonia as early as 4000 b.c. The statutes of
          Hammurabi king of Babylon compare for extent with those of Leviticus,
          yet they date back to the time of Abraham, 2200 b.c.,—indeed Hammurabi
          is now regarded by many as the Amraphel of Gen_14:1. Yet these
          statutes antedate Moses by 700 years. It is interesting to observe
          that Hammurabi professes to have received his statutes directly from
          the Sun-god of Sippar, his capital city. See translation by Winckler,
          in Der alte Orient, 97; Johns, The Oldest Code of Laws; Kelso, in
          Princeton Theol. Rev., July, 1905:399–412—Facts “authenticate the
          traditional date of the Book of the Covenant, overthrow the formula
          Prophets and Law, restore the old order Law and Prophets, and put into
          historical perspective the tradition that Moses was the author of the
          Sinaitic legislation.”

          As the controversy with regard to the genuineness of the Old Testament
          books has turned of late upon the claims of the Higher Criticism in
          general, and upon the claims of the Pentateuch in particular, we
          subjoin separate notes upon these subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Higher Criticism in general. Higher Criticism does not mean
          criticism in any invidious sense, any more than Kant’s Critique of
          Pure Reason was an unfavorable or destructive examination. It is
          merely a dispassionate investigation of the authorship, date and
          purpose of Scripture books, in the light of their composition, style
          and internal characteristics. As the Lower Criticism is a
          text-critique, the Higher Criticism is a structure-critique. A bright
          Frenchman described a literary critic as one who rips open the doll to
          get at the sawdust there is in it. This can be done with a sceptical
          and hostile spirit, and there can be little doubt that some of the
          higher critics of the Old Testament have begun their studies with
          prepossessions against the super-natural, which have vitiated all
          their conclusions. These presuppositions are ofter unconscious, but
          none the less influential. When Bishop Colenso examined the Pentateuch
          and Joshua, he disclaimed any intention of assailing the miraculous
          narratives as such; as if he had said: “My dear little fish, you need
          not fear me; I do not wish to catch you; I only intend to drain the
          pond in which you live.” To many scholars the waters at present seem
          very low in the Hexateuch and indeed throughout the whole Old
          Testament.
        </p>

          Shakespeare made over and incorporated many old Chronicles of Plutarch
          and Holinshed, and many Italian tales and early tragedies of other
          writers; but Pericles and Titus Andronicus still pass current under
          the name of Shakespeare. We speak even now of “Gesenius’ Hebrew
          Grammar,” although of its twenty-seven editions the last fourteen have
          been published since his death, and more of it has been written by
          other editors than Gesenius ever wrote himself. We speak of “Webster’s
          Dictionary,” though there are in the “Unabridged” thousands of words
          and definitions that Webster never saw. Francis Brown: “A modern
          writer masters older records and writes a wholly new book. Not so with
          eastern historians. The latest comer, as Renan says, ‘absorbs his
          predecessors without assimilating them, so that the most recent has in
          its belly the fragments of the previous works in a raw state.’ The
          Diatessaron of Tatian is a parallel to the composite structure of the
          O. T. books. One passage yields the following: Mat_21:12 a; Joh_2:14
          a; Mat_21:12 b; Joh_2:14-15; Mat_21:12-13; Joh_2:16; Mar_11:16;
          Joh_2:17-22; all succeeding each other without a break.” Gore, Lux
          Mundi, 353—“There is nothing materially untruthful, though there is
          something uncritical, in attributing the whole legislation to Moses
          acting under the divine command. It would be only of a piece with the
          attribution of the collection of Psalms to David, and of Proverbs to
          Solomon.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The opponents of the Higher Criticism have much to say in reply.
          Sayce, Early History of the Hebrews, holds that the early chapters of
          Genesis were copied from Babylonian sources, but he insists upon a
          Mosaic or pre-Mosaic date for the copying. Hilprecht however declares
          that the monotheistic faith of Israel could never have proceeded “from
          the Babylonian mountain of gods—that charnel-house full of corruption
          and dead men’s bones.” Bissell, Genesis Printed in Colors, Introd.,
          iv—“It is improbable that so many documentary histories existed so
          early, or if existing that the compiler should have attempted to
          combine them. Strange that the earlier should be J and should use the
          word ‘Jehovah,’ while the later P should use the word ‘Elohim,’ when
          ‘Jehovah’ would have far better suited the Priests’ Code.…xiii—The
          Babylonian tablets contain in a continuous narrative the more
          prominent facts of both the alleged Elohistic and Jehovistic sections
          of Genesis, and present them mainly in the Biblical order. Several
          hundred years before Moses what the critics call two were already one.
          It is absurd to say that the unity was due to a redactor at the period
          of the exile, 444 b.c.. He who believes that God revealed himself to
          primitive man as one God, will see in the Akkadian story a
          polytheistic corruption of the original monotheistic account.” We must
          not estimate the antiquity of a pair of boots by the last patch which
          the cobbler has added; nor must we estimate the antiquity of a
          Scripture book by the glosses and explanations added by later editors.
          As the London Spectator remarks on the Homeric problem: “It is as
          impossible that a first-rate poem or work of art should be produced
          without a great master-mind which first conceives the whole, as that a
          fine living bull should be developed out of beef-sausages.” As we
          shall proceed to show, however, these utterances overestimate the
          unity of the Pentateuch and ignore some striking evidences of its
          gradual growth and composite structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Authorship of the Pentateuch in particular. Recent critics,
          especially Kuenen and Robertson Smith, have maintained that the
          Pentateuch is Mosaic only in the sense of being a gradually growing
          body of traditional law, which was codified as late as the time of
          Ezekiel, and, as the development of the spirit and teachings of the
          great law-giver, was called by a legal fiction after the name of Moses
          and was attributed to him. The actual order of composition is
          therefore: (1) Book of the Covenant (Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36;
          Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33); (2) Deuteronomy; (3) Leviticus. Among the
          reasons assigned for this view are the facts (a) that Deuteronomy ends
          with an account of Moses’ death, and therefore could not have been
          written by Moses; (b) that in Leviticus Levites are mere servants to
          the priests, while in Deuteronomy the priests are officiating Levites,
          or, in other words, all the Levites are priests; (c) that the books of
          Judges and of 1 Samuel, with their record of sacrifices offered in
          many places, give no evidence that either Samuel or the nation of
          Israel had any knowledge of a law confining worship to a local
          sanctuary. See Kuenen, Prophets and Prophecy in Israel; Wellhausen,
          Geschichte Israels, Band 1; and art.: Israel, in Encyc. Brit., 13:398,
          399, 415; W. Robertson Smith, O. T. in Jewish Church, 306, 386, and
          Prophets of Israel; Hastings, Bible Dict, arts.: Deuteronomy,
          Hexateuch, and Canon of the O. T.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been urged in reply, (1) that Moses may have written, not
          autographically, but through a scribe (perhaps Joshua), and that this
          scribe may have completed the history in Deuteronomy with the account
          of Moses’ death; (2) that Ezra or subsequent prophets may have
          subjected the whole Pentateuch to recension, and may have added
          explanatory notes; (3) that documents of previous ages may have been
          incorporated, in course of its composition by Moses, or subsequently
          by his successors; (4) that the apparent lack of distinction between
          the different classes of Levites in Deuteronomy may be explained by
          the fact that, while Leviticus was written with exact detail for the
          priests, Deuteronomy is the record of a brief general and ora summary
          of the law, addressed to the people at large and therefore naturally
          mentioning the clergy as a whole; (5) that the silence of the book of
          Judges as to the Mosaic ritual may be explained by the design of the
          book to describe only general history, and by the probability that at
          the tabernacle a ritual was observed of which the people in general
          were ignorant. Sacrifices in other places only accompanied special
          divine manifestations which made the recipient temporarily a priest.
          Even if it were proved that the law with regard to a central sanctuary
          was not observed, it would not show that the law did not exist, any
          more than violation of the second commandment by Solomon proves his
          ignorance of the decalogue, or the mediaeval neglect of the N. T. by
          the Roman church proves that the N. T. did not then exist. We cannot
          argue that “where there was transgression, there was no law” (Watts,
          New Apologetic, 83, and The Newer Criticism).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the light of recent research, however, we cannot regard these
          replies as satisfactory. Woods, in his article on the Hexateuch,
          Hastings’ Dictionary, 2:365, presents a moderate statement of the
          results of the higher criticism which commends itself to us as more
          trustworthy. He calls it a theory of stratification, and holds that
          “certain more or less independent documents, dealing largely with the
          same series of events, were composed at different periods, or, at any
          rate, under different auspices, and were afterwards combined, so that
          our present Hexateuch, which means our Pentateuch with the addition of
          Joshua, contains these several different literary strata.…The main
          grounds for accepting this hypothesis of stratification are (1) that
          the various literary pieces, with very few exceptions, will be found
          on examination to arrange themselves by common characteristics into
          comparatively few groups; (2) that an original consecution of
          narrative may be frequently traced between what in their present form
          are isolated fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This will be better understood by the following illustration. Let us
          suppose a problem of this kind: Given a patchwork quilt, explain the
          character of the original pieces out of which the bits of stuff
          composing the quilt were cut. First, we notice that, however well the
          colors may blend, however nice and complete the whole may look, many
          of the adjoining pieces do not agree in material, texture, pattern,
          color, or the like. Ergo, they have been made up out of very different
          pieces of stuff.…But suppose we further discover that many of the
          bits, though now separated, are like one another in material, texture,
          etc., we may conjecture that these have been cut out of one piece. But
          we shall prove this beyond reasonable doubt if we find that several
          bits when unpicked fit together, so that the pattern of one is
          continued in the other; and, moreover, that if all of like character
          are sorted out, they form, say, four groups, each of which was
          evidently once a single piece of stuff, though parts of each are found
          missing, because, no doubt, they have not been required to make the
          whole. But we make the analogy of the Hexateuch even closer, if we
          further suppose that in certain parts of the quilt the bits belonging
          to, say, two of these groups are so combined as to form a subsidiary
          pattern within the larger pattern of the whole quilt, and had
          evidently been sewed together before being connected with other parts
          of the quilt; and we may make it even closer still, if we suppose
          that, besides the more important bits of stuff, smaller
          embellishments, borderings, and the like, had been added so as to
          improve the general effect of the whole.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The author of this article goes on to point out three main portions of
          the Hexateuch which essentially differ from each other. There are
          three distinct codes: the Covenant code (C = Exo 20:22-23:33, 24:3–8),
          the Deuteronomic code (D), and the Priestly code (P). These codes have
          peculiar relations to the narrative portions of the Hexateuch. In
          Genesis, for example, “the greater part of the book is divided into
          groups of longer or shorter pieces, generally paragraphs or chapters,
          distinguished respectively by the almost exclusive use of Elohim or
          Jehovah as the name of God.” Let us call these portions J and E. But
          we find such close affinities between C and JE, that we may regard
          them as substantially one. “We shall find that the larger part of the
          narratives, as distinct from the laws, of Exodus and Numbers belong to
          JE; whereas, with special exceptions, the legal portions belong to P.
          In the last chapters of Deuteronomy and in the whole of Joshua we find
          elements of JE. In the latter book we also find elements which connect
          it with D.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It should be observed that not only do we find here and there
          separate pieces in the Hexateuch, shown by their characters to belong
          to these three sources, JE, D, and P, but the pieces will often be
          found connected together by an obvious continuity of subject when
          pieced together, like the bits of patchwork in the illustration with
          which we started. For example, if we read continuously Gen_11:27-32;
          Gen_12:4-5; Gen_13:6; Gen_13:11-12; Gen_16:1; Gen_16:3; Gen_16:15-16;
          Gen_17:1-27; Gen_19:29; Gen_21:1-5; Gen_23:1-20; Gen_25:7-11—passages
          mainly, on other grounds, attributed to P, we get an almost continuous
          and complete, though very concise, account of Abraham’s life.” We may
          concede the substantial correctness of the view thus propounded. It
          simply shows God’s actual method in making up the record of his
          revelation. We may add that any scholar who grants that Moses did not
          himself write the account of his own death and burial in the last
          chapter of Deuteronomy, or who recognizes two differing accounts of
          creation in Gen_1:1-31; Gen_2:1-25, has already begun an analysis of
          the Pentateuch and has accepted the essential principles of the higher
          criticism.
