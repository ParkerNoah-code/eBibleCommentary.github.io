        <p><b>V. Roman Catholic Doctrine Concerning the Rule of Faith:</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>§ 4. The Office of the Church as a Teacher</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          1. Romanists define the Church to be the company of men professing the
          same faith, united in the communion of the same sacraments, subject to
          lawful pastors, and specially to the Pope. By the first clause they
          exclude from the Church all infidels and heretics; by the second, all
          the unbaptized; by the third, all who are not subject to bishops
          having canonical succession; and by the fourth, all who do not
          acknowledge the Bishop of Rome to be the head of the Church on earth.
          It is this external, visible society thus constituted, that God has
          made an authoritative and infallible teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Church is qualified for this office: first, by the
          communication of all the revelations of God, written and unwritten;
          and secondly, by the constant presence and guidance of the Holy Spirit
          preserving it from all error in its instructions. On this point the
          "Roman Catechism," says: "Quemadmodum hæc una Ecclesia errare non
          potest in fidei ac morum disciplina tradenda, cum a Spiritu Sancto
          gubernetur; ita ceteras omnes, quæ sibi ecclesiæ nomen arrogant, ut
          quæ Diaboli spiritu ducantur, in doctrinæ et morum perniciosissimis
          erroribus versari necesse est." And Bellarmin, "Nostra sententia est
          Ecclesiam absolute non posse errare nec in rebus absolute necessariis
          nec in aliis, quæ credenda vel facienda nobis proponit, sive habeantur
          expresse in Scripturis, sive non."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Church, according to these statements, is infallible only as to
          matters of faith and morals. Its infallibility does not extend over
          the domains of history, philosophy, or science. Some theologians would
          even limit the infallibility of the Church, to essential doctrines.
          But the Church of Rome does not make the distinction, recognized by
          all Protestants, between essential and non-essential doctrines. With
          Romanists, that is essential, or necessary, which the Church
          pronounces to be a part of the revelation of God. Bellarmin—than whom
          there is no greater authority among Romish theologians—says that the
          Church can err "nec in rebus absolute necessariis nec in aliis," i.e.,
          neither in things in their own nature necessary, nor in those which
          become necessary when determined and enjoined. It has been disputed
          among Romanists, whether the Church is infallible in matters of fact
          as well as in matters of doctrine. By facts, in this discussion, are
          not meant facts of history or science, but facts involved in doctrinal
          decisions. When the Pope condemned certain propositions taken from the
          works of Jansenius, his disciples had to admit that those propositions
          were erroneous; but they denied that they were contained, in the sense
          condemned, in the writings of their master. To this the Jesuits
          replied, that the infallibility of the Church extended in such cases
          as much to the fact as to the doctrine. This the Jansenists denied.
        </p>
        <p>The Organs of the Church's Infallibility</p>
        <p>
          4. As to the organs of the Church in its infallible teaching, there
          are two theories, the Episcopal and Papal, or, as they are designated
          from their principal advocates, the Gallican and the Transmontane.
          According to the former, the bishops, in their collective capacity, as
          the official successors of the Apostles, are infallible as teachers.
          Individual bishops may err, the body or college of bishops cannot err.
          Whatever the bishops of any age of the Church unite in teaching, is,
          for that age, the rule of faith. This concurrence of judgment need not
          amount to entire unanimity. The greater part, the common judgment of
          the episcopate, is all that is required. To their decision all
          dissentients are bound to submit. This general judgment may be
          pronounced in a council, representing the whole Church, or in any
          other way in which agreement may be satisfactorily indicated.
          Acquiescence in the decisions of even a provincial council, or of the
          Pope, or the several bishops, each in his own diocese, teaching the
          same doctrine, is sufficient proof of consent.
        </p>
        <p>The Transmontane Theory</p>
        <p>
          According to the Papal, or Transmontane theory, the Pope is the organ
          through which the infallible judgment of the Church is pronounced. He
          is the vicar of Christ. He is not subject to a general council. He is
          not required to consult other bishops before he gives his decision.
          This infallibility is not personal, but official. As a man the Pope
          may be immoral, heretical, or infidel; as Pope, when speaking ex
          cathedra, he is the organ of the Holy Ghost. The High Priest among the
          Jews might be erroneous in faith, or immoral in conduct, but when
          consulting God in his official capacity, he was the mere organ of
          divine communication. Such, in few words, is the doctrine of Romanists
          concerning the Rule of Faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the recent Ecumenical Council, held in the Vatican, after a
          protracted struggle, the Transmontane doctrine was sanctioned. It is,
          therefore, now obligatory on all Romanists to believe that the Pope,
          when speaking ex cathedra, is infallible.
