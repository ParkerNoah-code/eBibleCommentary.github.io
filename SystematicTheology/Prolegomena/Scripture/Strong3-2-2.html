        <h2>I. Genuineness of the Christian Documents</h2>
        <p>
          We shall attempt to prove this only of the writers of the gospels; for
          if they are credible witnesses, the credibility of the Old Testament,
          to which they bore testimony, follows as a matter of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are capable or competent witnesses,—that is, they possessed
          actual knowledge with regard to the facts they professed to relate.
          (a) They had opportunities of observation and inquiry. (b) They were
          men of sobriety and discernment, and could not have been themselves
          deceived. (c) Their circumstances were such as to impress deeply upon
          their minds the events of which they were witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They are honest witnesses. This is evident when we consider that:
          (a) Their testimony imperiled all their worldly interests. (b) The
          moral elevation of their writings, and their manifest reverence for
          truth and constant inculcation of it, show that they were not wilful
          deceivers, but good men. (c) There are minor indications of the
          honesty of these writers in the circumstantiality of their story, in
          the absence of any expectation that their narratives would be
          questioned, in their freedom from all disposition to screen themselves
          or the apostles from censure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lessing says that Homer never calls Helen beautiful, but he gives the
          reader an impression of her surpassing loveliness by portraying the
          effect produced by her presence. So the evangelists do not describe
          Jesus’ appearance or character, but lead us to conceive the cause that
          could produce such effects. Gore, Incarnation, 77—“Pilate, Caiaphas,
          Herod, Judas, are not abused,—they are photographed. The sin of a
          Judas and a Peter is told with equal simplicity. Such fairness,
          wherever you find it, belongs to a trustworthy witness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The writings of the evangelists mutually support each other. We
          argue their credibility upon the ground of their number and of the
          consistency of their testimony. While there is enough of discrepancy
          to show that there has been no collusion between them, there is
          concurrence enough to make the falsehood of them all infinitely
          improbable. Four points under this head deserve mention: (a) The
          evangelists are independent witnesses. This is sufficiently shown by
          the futility of the attempts to prove that any one of them has
          abridged or transcribed another. (b) The discrepancies between them
          are none of them irreconcilable with the truth of the recorded facts,
          but only present those facts in new lights or with additional detail.
          (c) That these witnesses were friends of Christ does not lessen the
          value of their united testimony, since they followed Christ only
          because they were convinced that these facts were true. (d) While one
          witness to the facts of Christianity might establish its truth, the
          combined evidence of four witnesses gives us a warrant for faith in
          the facts of the gospel such as we possess for no other facts in
          ancient history whatsoever. The same rule which would refuse belief in
          the events recorded in the gospels “would throw doubt on any event in
          history.”
        </p>
        <p>
          No man does or can write his own signature twice precisely alike. When
          two signatures, therefore, purporting to be written by the same
          person, are precisely alike, it is safe to conclude that one of them
          is a forgery. Compare the combined testimony of the evangelists with
          the combined testimony of our five senses. “Let us assume,” says Dr.
          C. E. Rider, “that the chances of deception are as one to ten when we
          use our eyes alone, one to twenty when we use our ears alone, and one
          to forty when we use our sense of touch alone; what are the chances of
          mistake when we use all these senses simultaneously? The true result
          is obtained by multiplying these proportions together. This gives one
          to eight thousand.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The conformity of the gospel testimony with experience. We have
          already shown that, granting the fact of sin and the need of an
          attested revelation from God, miracles can furnish no presumption
          against the testimony of those who record such a revelation, but, as
          essentially belonging to such a revelation, miracles may be proved by
          the same kind and degree of evidence as is required in proof of any
          other extraordinary facts. We may assert, then, that in the New
          Testament histories there is no record of facts contrary to
          experience, but only a record of facts not witnessed in ordinary
          experience—of facts, therefore, in which we may believe, if the
          evidence in other respects is sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Coincidence of this testimony with collateral facts and
          circumstances. Under this head we may refer to (a) the numberless
          correspondences between the narratives of the evangelists and
          contemporary history; (b) the failure of every attempt thus far to
          show that the sacred history is contradicted by any single fact
          derived from other trustworthy sources; (c) the infinite improbability
          that this minute and complete harmory should ever have been secured in
          fictitious narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Conclusion from the argument for the credibility of the writers of
          the gospels. These writers having been proved to be credible
          witnesses, their narratives, including the accounts of the miracles
          and prophecies of Christ and his apostles, must be accepted as true.
          But God would not work miracles or reveal the future to attest the
          claims of false teachers. Christ and his apostles must, therefore,
          have been what they claimed to be, teachers sent from God, and their
          doctrine must be what they claimed it to be, a revelation from God to
          men.
        </p>

          On the whole subject, see Ebrard, Wissensch. Kritik der evang.
          Geschichte; Green-leaf, Testimony of the Evangelists, 30, 31; Starkie
          on Evidence, 734; Whately, Historic Doubts as to Napoleon Buonaparte;
          Haley, Examination of Alleged Discrepancies; Smith’s Voyage and
          Shipwreck of St. Paul; Paley, Horæ Paulinæ; Birks, in Strivings for
          the Faith, 37–72—“Discrepancies are like the slight diversities of the
          different pictures of the stereoscope.” Renan calls the land of
          Palestine a fifth gospel. Weiss contrasts the Apocryphal Gospels,
          where there is no historical setting and all is in the air, with the
          evangelists, where time and place are always stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          No modern apologist has stated the argument for the credibility of the
          New Testament with greater clearness and force than Paley,—Evidences,
          chapters 8 and 10—“No historical fact is more certain than that the
          original propagators of the gospel voluntarily subjected themselves to
          lives of fatigue, danger, and suffering, in the prosecution of their
          undertaking. The nature of the undertaking, the character of the
          persons employed in it, the opposition of their tenets to the fixed
          expectations of the country in which they at first advanced them,
          their undissembled condemnation of the religion of all other
          countries, their total want of power, authority, or force, render it
          in the highest degree probable that this must have been the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The probability is increased by what we know of the fate of the
          Founder of the institution, who was put to death for his attempt, and
          by what we also know of the cruel treatment of the converts to the
          institution within thirty years after its commencement—both which
          points are attested by heathen writers, and, being once admitted,
          leave it very incredible that the primitive emissaries of the religion
          who exercised their ministry first amongst the people who had
          destroyed their Master, and afterwards amongst those who persecuted
          their converts, should themselves escape with impunity or pursue their
          purpose in ease and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This probability, thus sustained by foreign testimony, is advanced, I
          think, to historical certainty by the evidence of our own books, by
          the accounts of a writer who was the companion of the persons whose
          sufferings he relates, by the letters of the persons themselves, by
          predictions of persecutions, ascribed to the Founder of the religion,
          which predictions would not have been inserted in this history, much
          less, studiously dwelt upon, if they had not accorded with the event,
          and which, even if falsely ascribed to him, could only have been so
          ascribed because the event suggested them; lastly, by incessant
          exhortations to fortitude and patience, and by an earnestness,
          repetition and urgency upon the subject which were unlikely to have
          appeared, if there had not been, at the time, some extraordinary call
          for the exercise of such virtues. It is also made out, I think, with
          sufficient evidence, that both the teachers and converts of the
          religion, in consequence of their new profession, took up a new course
          of life and conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The next great question is, what they did this for. It was for a
          miraculous story of some kind, since for the proof that Jesus of
          Nazareth ought to be received as the Messiah, or as a messenger for
          God, they neither had nor could have anything but miracles to stand
          upon.…If this be so, the religion must be true. These men could not be
          deceivers. By only not bearing testimony, they might have avoided all
          these sufferings and lived quietly. Would men in such circumstances
          pretend to have seen what they never saw, assert facts which they had
          no knowledge of, go about lying to teach virtue, and though not only
          convinced of Christ’s being an impostor, but having seen the success
          of his imposture in his crucifixion, yet persist in carrying it on,
          and so persist as to bring upon themselves, for nothing, and with a
          full knowledge of the consequences, enmity and hatred, danger and
          death?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who maintain this, moreover, require us to believe that the
          Scripture writers were “villains for no end but to teach honesty, and
          martyrs without the least prospect of honor or advantage.” Imposture
          must have a motive. The self-devotion of the apostles is the strongest
          evidence of their truth, for even Hume declares that “we cannot make
          use of a more convincing argument in proof of honesty than to prove
          that the actions ascribed to any persons are contrary to the course of
          nature, and that no human motives, in such circumstances, could ever
          induce them to such conduct.”
