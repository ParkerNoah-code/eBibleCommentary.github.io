      <section>
        <h2>Necessary Presuppositions:</h2>
        <h2>
          1. What are the necessary presuppositions, as to principles, and
          matters of fact, which must be admitted before the possibility of
          inspiration, or the inspiration of any particular book can be
          affirmed?
        </h2>
        <p>
          1st. The existence of a personal God, possessing the attributes of
          power, intelligence, and moral excellence in absolute perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. That in his relation to the universe he is at once immanent and
          transcendent. Above all, and freely acting upon all from without.
          Within all, and acting through the whole and every part from within in
          the exercise of all his perfections, and according to the laws and
          modes of action he has established for his creatures, sustaining and
          governing them, and all their actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. His moral government over mankind and other intelligent
          creatures, whereby he governs them by truth and motives addressed to
          their reason and will, rewards and punishes them according to their
          moral characters and actions, and benevolently educates them for their
          high destiny in his communion and service.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The fact that mankind instead of advancing along a line of
          natural development from a lower to a higher moral condition, have
          fallen from their original state and relation, and are now lost in a
          condition involving corruption and guilt, and incapable of recovery
          without supernatural intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. The historical integrity of the Christian Scriptures, their
          veracity as history, and the genuineness and authenticity of the
          several books.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. The truth of Christianity in the sense in which it is set forth
          in the sacred record.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these necessary presuppositions, the truth of which is involved
          in the doctrine that the Scriptures are inspired, fall under one of
          two classes—
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Those which rest upon intuition and the moral spiritual evidences
          of divine truth, such as the being and attributes of God, and his
          relations to world and to mankind, such as the testimony of conscience
          and the moral consciousness of men as sinners justly condemned, and
          impotent.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Those which rest upon matters of fact, depending upon historical
          and critical evidence as to the true origin and contents of the sacred
          books.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of these principles or facts is doubted, the evidence
          substantiating them should be sought in their appropriate sources,
          e.g., the department of Apologetics—the Theistic argument and Natural
          Theology, the evidences of Christianity, the Historic Origin of the
          Scriptures, the Canon, and Criticism and Exegesis of the Sacred Text.

        <h2>Statement of the Doctrine of Inspiration:</h2>
        <h2>
          2. In what sense and to what extent has the Church universally held
          the Bible to be inspired?
        </h2>
        <p>
          That the sacred writers were so influenced by the Holy spirit that
          their writings are, as a whole and in every part, God’s word to us—an
          authoritative revelation to us from God, endorsed by him, and sent to
          us as a rule of faith and practice, the original autographs of which
          are absolutely infallible when interpreted in the sense intended, and
          hence are clothed with absolute divine authority.
        </p>
        <h2>3. What is meant by "plenary inspiration"?</h2>
        <p>
          A divine influence full and sufficient to secure its end. The end in
          this case secured is the perfect infallibility of the Scriptures in
          every part, as a record of fact and doctrine both in thought and
          verbal expression. So that although they come to us through the
          instrumentality of the minds, hearts, imaginations, consciences, and
          wills of men, they are nevertheless in the strictest sense the word of
          God.
        </p>
        <h2>
          4. What is meant by the phrase "verbal inspiration," and how can it be
          proved that the words of the Bible were inspired?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is meant that the divine influence, of whatever kind it may have
          been, which accompanied the sacred writers in what they wrote, extends
          to their expression of their thoughts in language, as well as to the
          thoughts themselves. The effect being that in the original autograph
          copies the language expresses the thought God intended to convey with
          infallible accuracy, so that the words as well as the thoughts are
          God’s revelation to us.
        </p>
        <p>That this influence did extend to the words appears—</p>
        <p>
          1st. From the very design of inspiration, which is, not to secure the
          infallible correctness of the opinions of the inspired men themselves
          (Paul and Peter differed, Galatians 2:11, and sometimes the prophet
          knew not what he wrote), but to secure an infallible record of the
          truth. But a record consists of language.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Men think in words, and the more definitely they think the more
          are their thoughts immediately associated with an exactly appropriate
          verbal expression. Infallibility of thought cannot be secured or
          preserved independently of an infallible verbal rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The Scriptures affirm this fact, 1 Corinthians 2:13; 1
          Thessalonians 2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The New Testament writers, while quoting from the Old Testament
          for purposes of argument, often base their argument upon the very
          words used, thus ascribing authority to the word as well as the
          thought.—Matthew 22: 32, and Exodus 3: 6,16; Matthew 22: 45, and
          Psalms 110: l ; Galatians 3:16, and Genesis 17: 7.
        </p>
        <h2>
          5. By what means does the Church hold that God has effected the result
          above defined?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Church doctrine recognizes the fact that every part of Scripture
          is at once a product of God’s and of man’s agency. The human writers
          have produced each his part in the free and natural exercise of his
          personal faculties under his historical conditions. God has also so
          acted concurrently in and through them that the whole organism of
          Scripture and every part thereof is his word to us, infallibly true in
          the sense intended and absolutely authoritative.
        </p>
        <p>God’s agency includes the three following elements:</p>
        <p>
          1st. His PROVIDENTIAL agency in producing the Scriptures. The whole
          course of redemption, of which revelation and inspiration are special
          functions, was a special providence directing the evolution of a
          specially providential history. Here the natural and the supernatural
          continually interpenetrate. But as is of necessity the case, the
          natural was always the rule and the supernatural the exception; yet as
          little subject to accident, and as much the subject of rational design
          as the natural itself. Thus God providentially produced the very man
          for the precise occasion, with the faculties, qualities, education,
          and gracious experience needed for the production of the intended
          writing, Moses, David, Isaiah, Paul, or John, genius and character,
          nature and grace, peasant, philosopher, or prince, the man, and with
          him each subtle personal accident, was providentially prepared at the
          proper moment as the necessary instrumental precondition of the work
          to be done.
        </p>
        <p>2nd. REVELATION of truth not otherwise attainable.</p>
        <p>
          Whenever the writer was not possessed, or could not naturally become
          possessed, of the knowledge God intended to communicate, it was
          supernaturally revealed to him by vision or language. This revelation
          was supernatural, objective to the recipient, and assured to him to be
          truth of divine origin by appropriate evidence. This direct revelation
          applies to a large element of the sacred Scriptures, such as
          prophecies of future events, the peculiar doctrines of Christianity,
          the promises and threatenings of God’s word, etc., but it applies by
          no means to all the contents of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. INSPIRATION. The writers were the subjects of a plenary divine
          influence called inspiration, which acted upon and through their
          natural faculties in all they wrote directing them in the choice of
          subject and the whole course of thought and verbal expression, so as
          while not interfering with the natural exercise of their faculties,
          they freely and spontaneously, produced the very writing which God
          designed, and which thus possesses the attributes of infallibility and
          authority as above defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          This inspiration differs, therefore, from revelation—(1) In that it
          was a constant experience of the sacred writers in all they wrote and
          it affects the equal infallibility of all the elements of the writings
          they produced, while, as before said, revelation was supernaturally
          vouchsafed only when it was needed. (2) In that revelation
          communicated objectively to the mind of the writer truth otherwise
          unknown. While inspiration was a divine influence flowing into the
          sacred writer subjectively, communicating nothing, but guiding their
          faculties in their natural exercise to the producing an infallible
          record of the matters of history, doctrine, prophecy, etc., which God
          designed to send through them to his Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          It differs from spiritual illumination, in that spiritual illumination
          is an essential element in the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit
          common to all true Christians. It never leads to the knowledge of new
          truth, but only to the personal discernment of the spiritual beauty
          and power of truth already revealed in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspiration is a special influence of the Holy Spirit peculiar to the
          prophets and apostles, and attending them only in the exercise of
          their functions as accredited teachers. Most of them were the subjects
          both of inspiration and spiritual illumination. Some, as Balaam, being
          unregenerate were inspired, though destitute of spiritual
          illumination.

        <h2>The Proof of the Church Doctrine of Inspiration:</h2>
        <h2>
          6. From what sources of evidence is the question as to the nature and
          extent of the Inspiration of the Scriptures to be determined?
        </h2>
        <p>1st. From the statements of the Scriptures themselves.</p>
        <p>2nd. From the phenomena of Scripture when critically examined.</p>
        <h2>
          The Statements of the Scriptures as to the Nature of their Own
          Inspiration
        </h2>
        <h2>
          7. How can the propriety of proving the Inspiration of the Scriptures
          from their own assertions be vindicated?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We do not reason in a circle when we rest the truth of the inspiration
          of the Scriptures on their own assertions. We come to this question
          already believing in their credibility as histories, and in that of
          their writers as witnesses of facts, and in the truth of Christianity
          and in the divinity of Christ. Whatever Christ affirms of the Old
          Testament, and whatever he promises to the Apostles, and whatever they
          assert as to the divine influence acting in and through themselves, or
          as to the infallibility and authority of their writings, must be true.
          Especially as all their claims were endorsed by God working with them
          by signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost. It is evident that
          if their claims to inspiration and to the infallibility and authority
          of their writings are denied, they are consequently charged with
          fanatical presumption and gross misrepresentation, and the validity of
          their testimony on all points is denied.
        </p>
        <p>
          When plenary inspiration is denied all Christian faith is undermined.
        </p>
        <h2>
          8. How may the inspiration of the apostles be fairly inferred from the
          fact that they wrought miracles?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A miracle is a divine sign (σημεῖον) accrediting the person to whom
          the power is delegated as a divinely commissioned agent, Matt. 16:1,
          4; Acts 14:3; Heb. 2:4. , Matthew 16:1,4; Acts 14:3; Hebrews 2:4. This
          divine testimony not only encourages, but absolutely renders belief
          obligatory. Where the sign is, God commands us to believe. But he
          could not unconditionally command us to believe any other than unmixed
          truth infallibly conveyed.
        </p>
        <h2>
          9. How may it be shown that the gift of Inspiration was promised to
          the apostles?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Matthew 10:19; Luke 12:12; John 14:26; 15:26,27; 16:13; Matthew
          28:19,20; John 13:20.
        </p>
        <h2>
          10. In what several ways did they claim to have possession of the
          Spirit?
        </h2>
        <p>They claimed—</p>
        <p>
          1st. To have the Spirit in fulfillment of the promise of Christ. Acts
          2:33; 4:8; 13:2–4; 15:28; 21:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. To speak as the prophets of God.—1 Corinthians 4:1; 9:17; 2
          Corinthians 5:19; 1 Thessalonians 4:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. To speak with plenary authority.—1 Corinthians 2:13; 1
          Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 4:6; Galatians1:8,9; 2 Corinthians
          13:2,3,4. They class their writings on a level with the Old Testament
          Scriptures.—2 Peter 3:16;1 Thessalonians 5:27; Colossians 4:16;
          Revelation 2:7.—Dr. Hodge.
        </p>
        <h2>11. How was their claim confirmed?</h2>
        <p>1st. By their holy, simple, temperate, yet heroic lives.</p>
        <p>
          2nd. By the holiness of the doctrine they taught, and its spiritual
          power, as attested by its effect upon communities and individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. By the miracles they wrought.—Hebrews 2:4; Acts 14:3; Mark 16:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. All these testimonies are accredited to us not only by their own
          writings, but also by the uniform testimony of the early Christians,
          their contemporaries, and their immediate successors.
        </p>
        <h2>
          12. Show that the writers of the Old Testament claim to be inspired.
        </h2>
        <p>
          1st. Moses claimed that he wrote a part at least of the Pentateuch by
          divine command.—Deuteronomy 31:19–22; 34:10; Numbers 16:28,29. David
          claimed it.—2 Samuel 23:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. As a characteristic fact, the Old Testament writers speak not in
          their own name, but preface their messages with, "Thus saith the
          Lord," The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it," etc.—Jeremiah 9:12;
          13:13; 30:4; Isaiah 8:l; 33:10; Micah 4:4; Amos 3:1; Deuteronomy
          18:21,22; 1 Kings 21:28; 1 Chronicles 17:3.—Dr. Hodge.
        </p>
        <h2>13. How was their claim confirmed?</h2>
        <p>
          1st. Their claim was confirmed to their contemporaries by the miracles
          they wrought by the fulfillment of many of their predictions (Numbers
          16:28,29), by the holiness of their lives. the moral and spiritual
          perfection of their doctrine, and the practical adaptation of the
          religious system they revealed to the urgent wants of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Their claim is confirmed to us principally— (1) By the remarkable
          fulfillment, in far subsequent ages, of many of their prophecies. (2)
          By the evident relation of the symbolical religion which they
          promulgated to the facts and doctrines of Christianity, proving a
          divine preadjustment of the type to the antitype. (3) By the
          endorsement of Christ and his apostles.
        </p>
        <h2>
          14. What are the formulas by which quotations from the Old Testament
          are introduced into the New, and how do these forms of expression
          prove the inspiration of the ancient Scriptures?
        </h2>
        <p>
          "The Holy Ghost saith," Hebrews 3:7. "The Holy Ghost this signifying,"
          Hebrews 9:8. "God saith," Acts 2:17, and Isaiah 44:3; 1 Corinthians
          9:9,10, and Deuteronomy 25:4. "The Scriptures saith.," Romans 4:3;
          Galatians 4:30. "It is written," Luke 18:31; 21:22; John 2:17; 20:31.
          "The Lord by the mouth of his servant David says," Acts 4:25, and
          Psalm 2:1,2. "The Lord limiteth in David a certain day, saying,"
          Hebrews 4:7; Psalm 95:7. "David in spirit says," Matthew 22:43, and
          Psalm 110:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus these Old Testament writings are what God saith, what God saith
          by David, etc., and are quoted as the authoritative basis for
          conclusive argumentation; therefore they must have been inspired.
        </p>
        <h2>
          15. How may the Inspiration of the Old Testament writers be proved by
          the express declarations of the New Testament?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Luke 1:70; Hebrews 1:1; 2 Timothy 3:16;1 Peter 1:10–12; 2 Peter 1:21.
        </p>
        <h2>
          16. What is the argument on this subject drawn from the manner in
          which Christ and his apostles argue from the Old Testament as of final
          authority?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Christ constantly quotes the Old Testament, Matthew 21:13; 22:43. He
          declares that it cannot be falsified, John 7:23; 10:35; that the whole
          law must be fulfilled, Matthew 5:18; and all things also foretold
          concerning himself "in Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms," Luke
          24:44. The apostles habitually quote the Old Testament in the same
          manner, "That it might be fulfilled which was written," is with them a
          characteristic formula, Matthew 1:22; 2:15,17,23; John 12:38; 15:25;
          etc. They all appeal to the words of Scripture as of final authority.
          This certainly proves infallibility.

          The Phenomena of Scripture Considered as Evidence of the Nature and
          Extent of its Inspiration

        <h2>
          17. What evidence do the Phenomena of the Scriptures afford as to
          nature and extent of the human causes conspiring to produce them?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Every part of Scripture alike bears evidence of a human origin. the
          writers of all the books were men, and the process of composition
          through which they originated was characteristically human. The
          personal characteristics of thought and feeling of these writers have
          acted spontaneously in their literary activity, and have given
          character to their writings in a manner precisely similar to the
          effect of character upon writing in the case of other men. They wrote
          from human impulses, on special occasions, with definite design. Each
          views his subject from an individual standpoint. They gather their
          material from all sources— personal experience and observation,
          ancient documents, and contemporary testimony. They arrange their
          material with reference to their special purpose, and draw inferences
          from principles and facts according to the more or less logical habits
          of their own minds. Their emotions and imaginations are spontaneously
          exercised, and follow as co–factors with their reasoning into their
          compositions. The limitations of their personal knowledge and general
          mental condition, and the defects of their habits of thought and
          style, are as obvious in their writings as any other personal
          characteristics. They use the language and idiom proper to their
          nation and class. They adopt the usus loquendi of terms current among
          their people, without committing themselves to the philosophical ideas
          in which the usage originated. Their mental habits and methods were
          those of their nation and generation. They were for the most part
          Orientals, and hence their writings abound with metaphor and symbol;
          and although always reliable in statement as far as required for their
          purpose they never aimed at the definiteness of enumeration, or
          chronological or circumstantial narration, which characterizes the
          statistics of modern western nations. Like all purely literary men of
          every age, they describe the order and the facts of nature according
          to their appearances, and not as related to their abstract law or
          cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these facts have, by many careless thinkers, been supposed to
          be inconsistent with the asserted fact of divine guidance. But it is
          evident, upon reflection, that if God is to reveal himself at all, it
          must be under all the limits of human modes of thought and speech. And
          if he inspires human agents to communicate his revelation in writing,
          he must use them in a manner consistent with their nature as rational
          and spontaneous agents. And it is evident that all the distinctions
          between the different degrees of perfection in human knowledge, and
          elegance in human dialect and style, are nothing when viewed in the
          light of the common relations of man to God. He obviously could as
          well reveal himself through a peasant as through a philosopher; and
          all the better when the personal characteristics of the peasant were
          providentially and graciously preadjusted to the special end designed.

        <h2>
          18. What evidence do the Phenomena of the Scriptures afford as to the
          nature and extent of the divine agency exercised in their production?
        </h2>
        <p>
          1st. Every part of Scripture affords moral and spiritual evidence of
          its divine origin. This is, of course, more conspicuous in some
          portions than in others. There are transcendent truths revealed, a
          perfect morality, an unveiling of the absolute perfections of the
          Godhead, a foresight of future events, a heart searching and
          rein–trying knowledge of the secrets of the human soul, a light
          informing the reason and an authority binding the conscience, a
          practical grasp of all the springs of human experience and life, all
          of which can only have originated in a divine source. These are
          characteristics of a large portion of the Scriptures, and of the
          Scriptures alone in all literature, and together with the accompanying
          witness of the Holy Ghost, these are practically the evidences upon
          which the faith of a majority of believers rests.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. But another characteristic of the Scriptures, taken in connection
          with the foregoing, proves incontestably their divine origin as a
          whole and in every part. The sacred Scriptures are an organism, that
          is a whole composed of many parts, the parts all differing in matter,
          form, and structure from each other, like the several members of the
          human body, yet each adjusted to each other and to the whole, through
          the most intricate and delicate correlations mediating a common end.
          Scripture is the record and interpretation of redemption. Redemption
          is a work which God has prepared and wrought out by many actions in
          succession through an historical process occupying centuries. A
          supernatural providence has flowed forward evolving a system of divine
          interventions, accompanied and interpreted by a supernaturally
          informed and guided order of prophets. Each writer has his own special
          and temporary occasion, theme, and audience. And yet each contributed
          to build up the common organism, as the providential history has
          advanced, each special writing beyond its temporary purpose taking
          permanent place as a member of the whole, the gospel fulfilling the
          law, antitype has answered to type and fulfillment to prophecy,
          history has been interpreted by doctrine, and doctrine has given law
          to duty and to life. The more minutely the contents of each book are
          studied in the light of its special purpose, the more wonderfully
          various and exact will its articulations in the general system and
          ordered structure of the whole be discovered to be. This is the
          highest conceivable evidence of design, which in the present case is
          the proof of a divine supernatural influence comprehending the whole,
          and reaching to every part, through sixteen centuries, sixty–six
          distinct writings, and about forty cooperating human agents. Thus the
          divine agency in the genesis of every part of Scripture is as clearly
          and certainly determined as it is in the older genesis of the heavens
          and the earth.
        </p>
        <h2>
          19. What is the objection to this doctrine drawn from the free manner
          in which the New Testament writers quote those of the Old Testament,
          and the answer to that objection?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In a majority of instances the New Testament writers quote those of
          the Old Testament with perfect verbal accuracy. Sometimes they quote
          the Septuagint version, when it conforms to the Hebrew; at others they
          substitute a new version; and at other times again they adhere to the
          Septuagint, when it differs from the Hebrew. In a number of instances,
          which however are comparatively few, their quotations from the Old
          Testament are made very freely, and in apparent accommodation of the
          literal sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rationalistic interpreters have argued from this last class of
          quotations that it is impossible that both the Old Testament writer
          quoted from, and the New Testament writer quoting, could have been the
          subjects of plenary inspiration, because, say they, if the ipsissima
          verba were infallible in the first instance, an infallible writer
          would have transferred them unchanged. But surely if a human author
          may quote himself freely, changing the expression, and giving a new
          turn to his thought in order to adapt it the more perspicuously to his
          present purpose, the Holy Spirit may take the same liberty with his
          own. The same Spirit that rendered the Old Testament writers
          infallible in writing only pure truth, in the very form that suited
          his purpose then, has rendered the New Testament writers infallible in
          so using the old materials, that while they elicit a new sense, they
          teach only the truth, the very truth moreover contemplated in the mind
          of God from the beginning, and they teach it with divine
          authority.—See Fairbairn’s "Herm. Manual," Part 3. Each instance of
          such quotation should be examined in detail, as Dr. Fairbairn has
          done.

        <h2>
          20. What objection to the doctrine of Plenary Inspiration is drawn
          from the alleged fact that "Discrepancies" exist in the Scriptural
          Text? and how is this objection to be answered?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is objected that the sacred text contains numerous statements which
          are inconsistent with other statements made in some part of Scripture
          itself, or with some certainly ascertained facts of history or of
          science.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is obvious that such a state of facts, even if it could be proved
          to exist, would not, in opposition to the abundant positive evidence
          above adduced, avail to disprove the claim that the Scriptures are to
          some extent and in some degree the product of divine inspiration. The
          force of the objection would depend essentially upon the number and
          character of the instances of discrepancy actually proved to exist,
          and would bear not upon the fact of Inspiration, but upon its nature
          and degree and extent. The fact of the actual existence of any such
          "discrepancies," it is evident, can be determined only by the careful
          examination of each alleged case separately. This examination belongs
          to the departments of Biblical Criticism and Exegesis. The following
          considerations, however, are evidently well–grounded, and sufficient
          to allay all apprehension on the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The Church has never held the verbal infallibility of our
          translations, nor the perfect accuracy of the copies of the original
          Hebrew and Greek Scriptures now possessed by us. These copies
          confessedly contain many "discrepancies" resulting from frequent
          transcription. It is, nevertheless, the unanimous testimony of
          Christian scholars, that while these variations embarrass the
          interpretation of many details, they neither involve the loss nor
          abate the evidence of a single essential fact or doctrine of
          Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is moreover reassuring to know that believing criticism, by the
          discovery and collation of more ancient and accurate copies, is
          constantly advancing the Church to the possession of a more perfect
          text of the original Scriptures than she has enjoyed since the
          apostolic age.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The Church has asserted absolute infallibility only of the
          original autograph copies of the Scriptures as they came from the
          hands of their inspired writers. And even of these she has not
          asserted infinite knowledge, but only absolute infallibility in
          stating the matters designed to be asserted. A "discrepancy,"
          therefore, in the sense in which the new critics affirm and the Church
          denies its existence, is a form of statement existing in the original
          text of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures evidently designed to assert
          as true that which is in plain irreconcilable contradiction to other
          statements existing in some other portions of the same original text
          of Scripture, or to some other certainly ascertained element of human
          knowledge. A "discrepancy" fulfilling in every particular this
          definition must be proved to exist, or the Church’s doctrine of
          plenary verbal inspiration remains unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. It is beyond question, that, in the light of all that the
          Scriptures themselves assert or disclose as to the nature and the
          extent of the divine influence controlling their genesis, and as to
          their authority over man’s conscience and life as the voice of God,
          the existence of any such "discrepancies" as above defined is a
          violent improbability. Those who assert the existence of one or more
          of them must bring them out, and prove to the community of competent
          judges, that all the elements of the above definition meet in each
          alleged instance, not merely probably, but beyond the possibility of
          doubt. The onusprobandi rests exclusively on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. But observe that this is for them a very difficult task to
          perform, one in any instance indeed hardly possible. For to make good
          their point against the vast presumptions opposed to it, they must
          prove over and over again in the case of each alleged discrepancy each
          of the following points:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) That the alleged discrepant statement certainly occurred in the
          veritable autograph copy of the inspired writing containing it. (2)
          That their interpretation of the statement, which occasions the
          discrepancy, is the only possible one, the one it was certainly
          intended to bear. The difficulty of this will be apprehended when we
          estimate the inherent obscurity of ancient narratives,
          unchronological, and fragmentary, with a background and surroundings
          of almost unrelieved darkness. This condition of things which so often
          puzzles the interpreter, and prevents the apologist from proving the
          harmony of the narrative, with equal force baffles all the ingenious
          efforts of the rationalistic critic to demonstrate the "discrepancy."
          Yet this he must do, or the presumption will remain that it does not
          exist. (3) He must also prove that the facts of science or of history,
          or the Scriptural statements, with which the statement in question is
          asserted to be inconsistent, are real fact or real parts of the
          autograph text of canonical Scripture, and that the sense in which
          they are found to be inconsistent with the statement in question is
          the only sense they can rationally bear. (4) When the reality of the
          opposing facts or statements is determined, and their true
          interpretation is ascertained, then it must, in conclusion, be shown
          not only that they appear inconsistent, nor merely that their
          reconciliation is impossible in our present state of knowledge, but
          that they are in themselves essentially incapable of being reconciled.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Finally it is sufficient for the present purpose, to point to the
          fact that no single case of "discrepancy," as above defined, has been
          so proved to exist as to secure the recognition of the community of
          believing scholars. Difficulties in interpretation and apparently
          irreconcilable statements exist, but no "discrepancy" has been proved.
          Advancing knowledge removes some difficulties and discovers others. It
          is in the highest degree probable that perfect knowledge would remove
          all.

          "I speak as a man," is a phrase occurring frequently, and its sense is
          determined by the context. In Romans 3:5, it signifies that Paul was,
          for argument’s sake, using the language common to men; it was the
          Jews’ opinion, not his own. In Romans 6:19, it signifies "in a manner
          adapted to human comprehension," and in Galatians 3:15, it signifies,
          "I use an illustration drawn from human affairs," etc. "I speak this
          by permission, not of commandment."—1 Corinthians 7:6, refers to verse
          2. Marriage was always permitted, but under certain circumstances
          inexpedient. "And unto the married I command, yet not I but the Lord."
          But to the rest speak: I, not the Lord."—1 Corinthians 7:10and 12.
          Reference is here made to what the "Lord," that is Christ, taught in
          person while on earth. The distinction is made between what Christ
          taught while on earth, and what Paul teaches. As Paul puts his word
          here on an equal basis of authority with Christ’s word, it of course
          implies that Paul claims an inspiration which makes his word equal to
          that of Christ in infallibility and authority.

          22. State what is meant by theological writers by the inspiration "of
          superintendence," of relevation," of direction," and "of suggestion."
        </h2>
        <p>
          Certain writers on this subject, confounding the distinction between
          inspiration and revelation, and using the former term to express the
          whole divine influence of which the sacred writers were the subjects,
          first, in knowing the truth, second, in writing it, necessarily
          distinguish between different degrees of inspiration in order to
          accommodate their theory to the facts of the case. Because, first,
          some of the contents of Scripture evidently might be known without
          supernatural aid, while much more as evidently could not; second, the
          different writers exercised their natural faculties, and carried their
          individual peculiarities of thought, feeling, and manner into their
          writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the "inspiration of superintendence," these writers meant precisely
          what we have above given as the definition of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the "inspiration of elevation," they meant that divine influence
          which exalted their natural faculties to a degree of energy otherwise
          unattainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the "inspiration of direction," they meant that divine influence
          which guided the writers in the selection and disposition of their
          material.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the "inspiration of suggestion," they meant that divine influence
          which directly suggested to their minds new and otherwise unattainable
          truth.
        </p>
        <h2>23. What objections may be fairly made to these distinctions?</h2>
        <p>
          1st. These distinctions spring from a prior failure to distinguish
          between revelation the frequent, and inspiration the constant,
          phenomenon presented by Scripture; the one furnishing the material
          when not otherwise attainable, the other guiding the writer at every
          point, (1) in securing the infallible truth of all he writes; and (2)
          in the selection and distribution of his material.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. It is injurious to distinguish between different degrees of
          inspiration, as if the several portions of the Scriptures were in
          different degrees God’s word, while in truth the whole is equally and
          absolutely so.
        </p>
        <h2>False Doctrines of Inspiration</h2>
        <h2>
          24. What Principles necessarily lead to the denial of any supernatural
          Inspiration?
        </h2>
        <p>
          All philosophical principles or tendencies of thought which exclude
          the distinction between the natural and the supernatural necessarily
          lead to the denial of Inspiration in the sense affirmed by the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are, for example, all Pantheistic, Materialistic, and

        <p>
          1st. It has been maintained that certain books were the subjects of
          plenary inspiration, while others were produced with only a natural
          providential and gracious assistance of God. S. T. Coleridge admitted
          the plenary inspiration of "the law and the prophets, no jot or tittle
          of which can pass unfulfilled," while he denied it of the rest of the
          canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Many have admitted that the moral and spiritual elements of the
          Scriptures, and their doctrines as far as these relate to the nature
          and purposes of God not otherwise ascertainable, are products of
          inspiration, but deny it of the historical and biographical elements,
          and of all its allusions to scientific facts or laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Others admit that the inspiration of the writers controlled their
          thoughts, but deny that it extended to its verbal expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one, or in all of these senses, different men have held that the
          Scriptures are only "partially" inspired.

          All such deny that they "ARE the word of God," as affirmed by the
          Scriptures themselves and by all the historical Churches, and admit
          merely that they " contain the word of God."

        <h2>26. State the doctrine of Gracious Inspiration.</h2>
        <p>
          Coleridge, in his "Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit," Letter 7.,
          holds that the Scriptures, except the Law and the Prophets, were
          produced by their writers assisted by "the highest degree of that
          grace and communion with the Spirit which the Church under all
          circumstances, and every regenerate member of the Church of Christ, is
          permitted to hope and instructed to pray for." This is the doctrine of
          Maurice ("Theological Essays," p. 339) and virtually that of Morell
          ("Philosophy of Religion," p. 186) and of the Quakers. These admit an
          objective supernatural revelation, and that this is contained in the
          Scriptures, which are highly useful, and in such a sense an
          authoritative standard of faith and practice; that no pretended
          revelation which is inconsistent with Scripture can be true, and that
          they are a judge in all controversies between Christians. Nevertheless
          they hold that the Scriptures are only "a secondary rule, subordinate
          to the Spirit from whom they have all their excellency," which Spirit
          illumines every man in the world, and reveals to him either with, or
          without the Scriptures, if they are unknown, all the knowledge of God
          and of his will which are necessary for his salvation and guidance, on
          condition of his rendering a constant obedience to that light as thus
          graciously communicated to him and to all men. "Barclay’s Apology,

          traditions which have come down to us, having been received by the

          These the Church holds to be sacred and canonical, not because having
          been carefully composed by mere human industry, they were afterwards
          approved by her authority, nor merely because they contain revelation
          with no admixture of error, but because, having been written by the
          inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they have God for their author, and
          have been delivered as such to the Church herself."

          the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the
          Church against the Corruption of the flesh and the malice of Satan and

          of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed,
          dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon
          God (who is truth itself) the Author thereof; and therefore it is to
          be received because it is the word of God."
