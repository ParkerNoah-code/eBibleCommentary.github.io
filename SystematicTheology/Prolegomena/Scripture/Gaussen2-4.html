        <h2>III. All the Scriptures of the Old Testament are Prophetic</h2>
        <p>
          The whole tenor of Scripture places the writers of the New Testament
          in the same rank with the prophets of the Old; and even when it
          establishes any difference between them, it is always in putting the
          last in date above the first, in so far as one of God's sayings is
          superior (not doubtless in divinity, not in dignity, but in authority)
          to the saying that preceded it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the reader be so good as attend to the following passage of the
          apostle St Peter. It is very important, inasmuch as it lets us see
          that, in the lifetime of the apostles, the book of the New Testament
          was already almost entirely formed, in order to make one whole
          together with that of the Old. It was twenty or thirty years after the
          day of Pentecost that St Peter felt gratified in referring to ALL THE
          EPISTLES OF PAUL, his beloved brother, and spoke of them as sacred
          writings which, even so early as his time, formed part of the Holy
          Letters (ἱερῶν γραμμάτων), and behoved to be classed with THE OTHER
          SCRIPTURES (ὡς καὶτὰς λοιπὰς, γραφὰς). He assigns them the same rank,
          and declares that "unlearned men can wrest them but to their own
          destruction." Mark this important passage: "Our beloved brother Paul
          also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as
          also IN ALL HIS EPISTLES, speaking in them of these things; in which
          are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned
          and unstable wrest, as they do also the OTHER SCRIPTURES, unto their
          own destruction."
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle, at the second verse of the same chapter, had already
          placed himself, along with the other apostles, on the same rank, and
          assumed the same authority, as the sacred writers of the Old
          Testament, when he said: "That ye may be mindful of the words which
          were spoken BEFORE by the holy PROPHETS, and of the commandment OF US
          the APOSTLES of the Lord and Saviour."
        </p>
        <p>
          The writings of the apostles, then, were that which those of the Old
          Testament were; and these being a WRITTEN PROPHECY—that is to say,
          something spoken altogether by God—the latter are no less so.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we have said the Scripture goes much farther in the rank it
          assigns to the writers of the New Covenant. It teaches us to consider
          them as even superior to those of the Old, whether as respects the
          importance of their mission, or the glory of the promises made to
          them, or the greatness of the gifts conferred on them—or, in fine, the
          eminence of the rank assigned to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, let us distinctly perceive what their mission was, compared
          with that of the ancient prophets; and it will at once be seen, from
          passages bearing on this point, that their inspiration could not be
          inferior to that of their predecessors.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Jesus sent the apostles whom he had chosen, it is written, he
          said to them: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations; teaching them
          to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I AM
          WITH YOU alway, even unto the end of the world, Amen." "But ye shall
          receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye
          shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in
          Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."2 "Peace be unto
          you: as my Father HATH SENT ME, even so SEND I YOU."
        </p>
        <p>
          Such was their mission. They were the immediate envoys (ἀποστόλοι) of
          the Son of God; they went to all nations; they had the assurance that
          their Master would be present with the testimony they were to bear to
          him in the holy Scriptures. Did they require, then, less inspiration
          for their going to the ends of the earth, and to make disciples of all
          nations, than the prophets required for going to Israel and teaching
          that one people, the Jews? Had they not to promulgate all the
          doctrines, all the ordinances, all the mysteries of the kingdom of
          God? Had they not to bear "the keys of the kingdom of heaven" in such
          sort, that whatsoever they should bind or loose on earth should be
          bound or loosed in heaven? Had not Jesus Christ expressly conferred
          the Holy Ghost upon them for this end, that sins might be remitted or
          retained with regard to those to whom they should remit or retain
          them? Had he not breathed upon them, saying, "Receive the Holy Ghost?"
          Had he not to reveal to them the wondrous character of the Word made
          flesh, and of the Creator so abased as to take upon him the form of a
          creature, and even to die upon the cross? Had they not to report his
          inimitable words? Had they not to perform on earth the miraculous
          intransmissible functions of his representatives and of his
          ambassadors, as if it had been Christ that spoke by them?2 Were they
          not called to such a glory, "that, in the great final regeneration,
          when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, they also
          should sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel?"
          If, then, the prophetic Spirit was necessary for the former men of
          God, in order to show the Messiah under the shadows, was it not much
          more necessary for them, in order to their bringing him out into the
          light, and to their evidently setting him forth as crucified amongst
          us,4 in such a manner that he that despiseth them despiseth him, and
          he that heareth them heareth him? Let one judge by all these traits
          what the inspiration of the New Testament behoved to have been,
          compared with that of the Old; and let one say whether, while the
          latter was wholly and entirely prophetic, that of the New could be any
          thing less.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But this is not all; listen further to the promises that were made
          to them for the performance of such a work. No human language can
          express with greater force the most absolute inspiration. These
          promises were for the most part addressed to them on three great
          occasions: first, when sent out for the first time to preach the
          kingdom of God; next, when Jesus himself delivered public discourses
          on the gospel before an immense multitude, gathered by tens of
          thousands around him;2 third, when he uttered his last denunciation
          against Jerusalem and the Jewish nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But when they deliver you up, take no thought HOW or WHAT ye shall
          speak (πῶς ἢ τί), for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye
          shall speak. For it is not YE that speak, but the SPIRIT OF YOUR
          FATHER WHICH SPEAKETH IN YOU."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates and
          powers, TAKE YE NO THOUGHT HOW or WHAT thing ye shall answer, or WHAT
          ye shall say; for the Holy Ghost shall teach you IN THE SAME HOUR what
          ye ought to say." "Take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak,
          NEITHER DO YE PREMEDITATE, but WHATSOEVER shall be GIVEN you in that
          hour, that speak ye; for it is NOT YE THAT SPEAK, but the Holy Ghost."
        </p>
        <p>
          On these different occasions, the Lord assured his disciples that the
          fullest inspiration would regulate their language in the most
          difficult and important moments of their ministry. When they should
          have to speak to princes, they were to feel no disquietude; they were
          not even to premeditate, they were not even to take thought about it,
          because there would then be immediately given to them by God, not only
          the things they were to say, but the words also in which those things
          were to be expressed; not only τί, but πῶς λαλήσονται.—(Matt. 10:19,
          20.) They behoved to cast themselves entirely on him; it would be
          given them entirely; it would be given them by Jesus; it would be
          given them in that same hour; it would be given them in such a manner,
          and in such plenitude, that they should be able then to say that it
          was no more they, but the Holy Ghost, the SPIRIT OF THEIR FATHER,
          which spoke IN THEM; and that then also it was not only an
          irresistible wisdom that was given them, it was a mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye
          shall answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your
          adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (as with the ancient prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel) it
          shall be the Holy Ghost that will speak by them, as God spoke by his
          holy prophets since the world began. In one sense, indeed, it was they
          that were to speak; but it shall be the Holy Ghost who will teach them
          (Luke 12:12) in that same hour what they are to say; so that, in
          another sense, it was to be the Holy Ghost himself that was to speak
          by their lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask if it were possible, in any language, to express more
          absolutely the most entire inspiration, and to declare with more
          precision, that the very words were then vouched by God and given to
          the apostles?
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt, in these promises there is no direct reference to the
          support which the apostles were to receive as writers; and that they
          bear rather on what they were to expect, when they had to appear
          before priests, before governors, and before kings. But is it not
          evident enough, that if the most entire inspiration were assured to
          them for passing exigencies, to shut the mouths of some wicked men, to
          conjure the perils of a day, and to subserve interests of the
          narrowest range; if it were promised them, notwithstanding that the
          very words of their answers should then be given to them by means of a
          calm, mighty, but inexplicable operation of the Holy Ghost,—is it not
          evident enough that the same assistance could not be refused to those
          same men, when, like the ancient prophets, they had to continue the
          book of God's oracles; and so to hand down to all succeeding ages the
          laws of the kingdom of heaven, and describe the glories of Jesus
          Christ and the scenes of eternity? Can any one suppose that the men
          who, before Ananias, or Festus, or Nero, were in such sort "the mouth
          of the Holy Spirit," that then it was no longer they that spoke, but
          that Spirit, should, when writing the everlasting Gospel, have
          returned to the condition of ordinary beings merely enlightened,
          denuded of their previous inspiration, no longer speaking by the Holy
          Ghost, and thenceforward employing only words dictated by human
          wisdom, (θελὴματι ἀνθρώπου καὶ ἐν διδακτοῖς ἀνθρωπίνης σοφίας λόγοις)?
          This is quite inadmissible.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. See them, further, commencing their apostolic ministry on the day
          of Pentecost: see what gifts they received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tongues of fire descend on their heads; they are filled with the Holy
          Ghost; they leave their upper chamber, and a vast multitude hears them
          proclaim, in fifteen different languages, the wonderful works of God;
          they speak AS THE SPIRIT GIVES THEM UTTERANCE; they speak (it is said)
          THE WORD OF GOD (ἐλάλουν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ.) Assuredly, the words of
          those foreign languages must have been then supplied to them as well
          as the things, the expression as well as the thoughts, the πῶς as well
          as the τί.—(Matt. 10:19.; Luke 12:11.) Now then will it be believed,
          that the Spirit could have taken care to dictate all that they behoved
          to say, for preachings at the corners of the streets, for words which
          passed away with the sound of their voices, and which, after all,
          reached only some thousands of hearers; while those same men, when
          they came afterwards to write for all earth's nations, and for all
          ages of the Church, "the lively oracles of God," were to be deprived
          of their first assistance? Will it be believed, that after having been
          more than the ancient prophets as respects preaching in public, they
          were to be less than those prophets, and were to become ordinary men,
          when they took the pen to finish the Book of the Prophets, to write
          their Gospels, their Epistles, and the Book of the Revelation? The
          unreasonableness and inadmissibility of such a supposition are felt at
          once.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But here we have to say something still more simple and more
          peremptory. We would speak of the rank that is assigned them; and
          indeed, after what we said of the prophets of the Old Testament, we
          might even have limited ourselves to this simple fact, that the
          apostles were all of them PROPHETS, and MORE THAN PROPHETS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their writings, therefore, are WRITTEN PROPHECIES (προφητεία γραφῆς),
          as much, and even more, than those of the Old Testament; and hence we
          are led to conclude once more, that all Scripture in the New
          Testament, as well as in the Old, is inspired of God, even to its
          smallest particles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have said that the apostles were all prophets. They often declare
          this; but, not to multiply quotations unnecessarily, we content
          ourselves here with appealing to the two following passages of the
          apostle St Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is addressed to the Ephesians (3:4, 5): "Whereby," he tells
          them, "when ye read WHAT I WROTE before in a few words, ye may
          understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages
          was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is NOW revealed unto
          his holy APOSTLES AND PROPHETS by the Spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          One clearly sees, then, here the apostle and prophet Paul, the
          apostles and prophets Matthew, John, Jude, Peter, James, received by
          the Spirit the revelation of the mystery of Christ; and wrote about it
          as PROPHETS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, it is of the same mystery, and of the writings of the same
          prophets, that that same apostle speaks in the second of the passages
          we have indicated, that is, in the last chapter of his Epistle to the
          Romans.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel,
          and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
          mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made
          manifest, and by the SCRIPTURES OP THE PROPHETS (διά τε γραφῶν
          προφητικῶν), according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made
          known to all nations for the obedience of faith: to God only wise, be
          glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, we have the authors of the New Testament again called
          PROPHETS; we have their writings called PROPHETICAL WRITINGS (γραφαὶ
          προφητικαί, the equivalent of the προφητεία γραφῆς of St Peter). And
          since we have already seen that no prophecy ever came by the will of
          him that uttered it, but that it was as moved and impelled by the Holy
          Ghost that holy men of God spake; the prophets of the New Testament
          spoke therefore like those of the Old, and according to the
          commandment of the everlasting God. They were all of them prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we may advance a step farther; for, as we have said, they were
          MORE THAN PROPHETS. Here again we have a remark of the learned
          Michaelis. Loose as are his principles on the inspiration of a part of
          the New Testament, this has not escaped his notice. It is clear,
          according to him, looking to the context, that, in the judgment
          pronounced by Jesus Christ on John Baptist (Matt. 11:9, 11), the terms
          great and little of the 11th verse, apply only to the title of prophet
          which precedes them at the 9th verse; so that Jesus Christ there
          declares, that if John Baptist is the greatest of the prophets—if he
          is even more than a prophet—still the least of the prophets of the New
          Testament is greater than John Baptist; that is to say, greater than
          the greatest of the Old Testament prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, this superiority of the apostles and prophets of the New
          Testament, is more than once attested to us in the apostolical
          writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every where, when mention is made of the different offices established
          in the Churches, the apostles are placed above the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take, for example, a very remarkable passage of the 1st Epistle to the
          Corinthians. The apostle's object is to make known to us the
          gradations of excellence and dignity among the several miraculous
          charges constituted by God in the primitive Church, and he expresses
          himself as follows:—"And God hath set some in the Church, first
          APOSTLES, secondarily PROPHETS, thirdly TEACHERS, after that miracles,
          then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the fourth chapter of his Epistle to the Ephesians, at verse 11, he
          again puts the apostles ABOVE the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          At chapter 2. ver. 20, he calls the apostles, APOSTLES and PROPHETS.
          And at chapter 14 of the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians, he places
          himself ABOVE the prophets whom God had raised up in that Church. His
          wish is, that every one of them, if he have really received the Holy
          Ghost, should employ the gifts he has received in acknowledging that
          the things that he wrote unto them were the commandments of the Lord;
          and so fully convinced is he that what he writes is dictated by
          inspiration of God, that, after having dictated ORDERS to the
          Churches, and concluded them with these words, which nothing short of
          the highest inspiration could sanction, It is thus I ORDAIN in all the
          Churches, he goes farther, he proceeds to rank himself ABOVE THE
          PROPHETS; or rather, being himself a prophet, he calls upon the spirit
          of prophecy in them to acknowledge the words of Paul as the words of
          the Lord; and he ends with these remarkable expressions:—"What? came
          the word of God out from you?… If any man think himself to be a
          PROPHET, or SPIRITUAL, let him acknowledge that the things that I
          WRITE UNTO YOU are the COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD."
        </p>
        <p>
          The writings of the Apostles, then, are (like those of the ancient
          prophets) the commandments of the everlasting God; they are "written
          prophecies" (προφητεία γραφῆς), as much as the Psalms, and Moses, and
          the prophets (Luke 24:44); and all their authors then could say with
          St Paul, CHRIST SPEAKS IN ME (2 Cor. 13:3; 1 Thess. 2:13); what I say
          is the word of God, and the things I speak are taught me by the Holy
          Ghost (1 Cor. 2:13); quite as David before them had said, "The spirit
          of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, besides, their own words, when they speak of what they are.
          Would it be possible to declare more clearly than they have done, that
          words as well as subject have been given them by God. "As for us,"
          they say, "we have the mind of Christ."—(1 Cor. 2:16.) "For this cause
          also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received THE WORD
          OF GOD which ye heard of us, ye received not the word of men, but (as
          it is in truth) the WORD OF GOD."—(1 Thes. 2:13.) "He therefore that
          despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his
          holy Spirit."—(1 Thes. 4:8.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Such then, in fine, is the word of the New Testament. It is like that
          of the Old, a word uttered by prophets, and by prophets greater even
          than those that preceded them; in such sort, for example, as has been
          very well remarked by Michaelis, that an epistle commencing with these
          words, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,"4 thereby gives us a higher
          attestation of his divine authority and his divine inspiration, than
          could have been given even by the writings of the most illustrious
          prophets of the Old Testament when they began with these words, "Thus
          saith the Lord"—"The vision of Isaiah"—"The word that Isaiah saw"—"the
          words of Jeremiah … to whom the word of the Lord came"2—"Hear the word
          of the Lord"—or such like analogous expressions. And if there be in
          the New Testament some books where such inscriptions are not to be
          found, their inspiration is no more compromised thereby than this or
          that book of the Old Testament (the second or the ninety-fifth psalm,
          for example); which, although they have not the names of the prophets
          that composed them, are not the less quoted as divine by Jesus Christ
          and his apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objection has sometimes been started that Luke and Mark were not
          apostles, properly so called; and that consequently they did not
          receive the same inspiration as the other sacred writers of the New
          Testament. True, they were not apostles; but they were certainly
          prophets, and they were even greater than the greatest of those of the
          Old Testament.—(Luke 7:26, 28.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Without insisting here on the ancient traditions, which say that both
          were of the number of the seventy disciples whom Jesus sent at first
          to preach in Judea, or at least of those one hundred and twenty on
          whom the tongues of the Holy Ghost descended on the day of Pentecost;
          are such objectors not aware that the apostles had received the power
          of conferring, by the imposition of hands, miraculous gifts on all who
          believed, and that they exercised this power in all the countries and
          all the cities whither they directed their steps? And since St Luke
          and St Mark were, amid so many other prophets, the fellow-workers
          chosen by St Paul and St Peter, is it not clear enough that these two
          apostolic men must have bestowed upon such associates the gifts which
          they dispensed to so many besides who had believed? Do we not see
          Peter and John first go down to Samaria to confer these gifts on the
          believers of that city; this followed by Peter coming to Cesarea,
          there to shed them on all the Gentiles who had heard the word in the
          house of the centurion Cornelius? Do we not see St Paul bestow them
          abundantly on the believers of Corinth, on those of Ephesus, on those
          of Rome?2 Do we not see him, before employing his dear son Timothy as
          his fellow- labourer, causing spiritual powers to descend upon him?
          And is it not evident that St Peter must have done as much for his
          dear son Mark,4 as St Paul did for his companion Luke? Silas, whom St
          Paul had taken to accompany him (as he took Luke and John, whose
          surname was Mark), Silas was a prophet at Jerusalem.6 Prophets
          abounded in all the primitive churches. Many were seen to come down
          from Jerusalem to Antioch; a great many were to be found in Corinth;8
          Judas and Silas were prophets in Jerusalem. Agabus was such in Judea;
          farther, four daughters, still in their youth, of Philip the
          evangelist, were prophetesses in Cesarea; and in the Church of
          Antioch, there were to be seen many believers who were prophets and
          doctors;10 among others Barnabas (St Paul's first companion), Simeon,
          Manaen, Saul of Tarsus himself; and, finally, that Lucius of Cyrene,
          who is thought to be the Lucius whom Paul (in his Epistle to the
          Romans) calls his kinsman, and whom (in his Epistle to the Colossians)
          he calls Luke the physician;12 in a word, the St Luke whom the ancient
          fathers call indifferently Lucas, Lucius, and Lucanus.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these facts, then, it becomes sufficiently evident that St Luke
          and St Mark ranked at least among the prophets whom the Lord had
          raised up in such numbers in all the Churches of the Jews and the
          Gentiles, and that from among all the rest they were chosen by the
          Holy Ghost to be conjoined with the apostles in writing the sacred
          books of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, moreover (and let this be specially noticed), the prophetical
          authority of St Mark and St Luke is far from resting solely on these
          inductions. It rests on the testimony even of the apostles of Jesus
          Christ. It ought not to be forgotten, that it was under the long
          protracted government of those men of God, that the divine canon of
          the Scriptures of the New Testament was collected and transmitted to
          all the Churches. By a remarkable dispensation of God's providence,
          the lives of the greater number of the apostles were prolonged to a
          great many years. St Peter and St Paul lived to edify the Church of
          God for above thirty-four years after the resurrection of their
          Master; nay, St John continued his ministry, in the province of Asia,
          in the centre of the Roman empire, for more than thirty years longer,
          after their death. The book of the Acts, which was written by St Luke
          subsequently to his Gospel, had been already diffused through the
          Church a long while (I mean to say, for ten years at least) before the
          martyrdom of St Paul. But St Paul, even long before going to Rome, had
          already diffused the gospel abundantly from Jerusalem as far as
          Illyricum.2 The apostles maintained a constant correspondence with the
          Christians of all countries; they were daily called to meet the cares
          they had to sustain with respect to all the Churches. St Peter, in his
          second letter, addressed to the catholicity of God's Churches, spoke
          to them even then of ALL THE EPISTLES of St Paul as incorporated with
          the Old Testament. And for more than half a century, all the Christian
          Churches were formed and conducted under the superintendence of these
          men of God. It was, accordingly, with the assent, and under the
          prophetic government, of these apostles, called as they were to bind
          and to loose, and to become, next to Christ, the twelve foundations of
          the universal Church, that the canon of the Scriptures was formed, and
          that the new people of God received its lively oracles, to transmit
          them to us. And it is thus that the Gospel of Luke, that of Mark, and
          the book of Acts, have been received by common consent, on the same
          authoritative grounds, and with the same submission as the apostolical
          books of Matthew, of Paul, of Peter, and John. These books, then, have
          the same authority for us as all the rest; and we are called upon to
          receive them equally, "not as the word of men, but as it is in truth
          the word of God, which worketh effectually in all that believe."2
        </p>
        <p>
          We venture to believe that these reflections will suffice for enabling
          the reader to comprehend how little ground there is for the
          distinction which Michaelis, and some other German doctors, have made
          bold to establish with respect to inspiration, between the two
          evangelists and the other writers of the New Testament. It even
          appears to us, that it was in order to obviate any such supposition
          that Luke took care to place at the head of his gospel the four verses
          that serve as a preface to it. You see, in fact, that his object there
          is to contrast the certainty and divinity of his own account with the
          uncertainty and the human character of those narrations, which many
          (πολλοί) had taken in hand to set forth (ἐπεχείρησαν ἀνατάξασθαι) on
          the facts connected with the gospel—facts, he adds, most surely
          believed among us, that is to say, among the apostles and prophets of
          the New Testament (τῶν πεπληροφορημένων ἐν ἡμῖν πραγμάτων, the word in
          the original signifying the highest degree of certainty, as may be
          seen, Rom. 4:21; 14:5; 2 Tim. 4:5, 17.) And therefore, adds St Luke,
          it seemed good to ME also, having had perfect understanding of all
          things FROM ABOVE, to write of them unto thee in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          St Luke had obtained this knowledge FROM ABOVE; that is to say, by the
          wisdom which comes from above, "and which had been given him." It is
          very true that the meaning ordinarily attached to this last
          expression, in this passage, is from the very first, as if instead of
          the word ἄνωθεν (from above), there were here the same words ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς
          (from the commencement), which we find in verse second. But it appears
          to us that the opinion of Erasmus, of Gomar, of Henry, of Lightfoot,
          and other commentators, ought to be preferred as more natural, and
          that we must take the word ἄνωθεν here in the sense in which St John
          and St James have used it, when they say: "Every perfect gift cometh
          from above (James 1:17)—"Thou couldst have no power against me, except
          it were given thee from above" (John 19:11) —"Except a man be born
          from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3)—"The wisdom
          that cometh from above is first pure."—(James 3:15, 17.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophet Luke, then, "had obtained from above a perfect
          understanding of all things that Jesus began both to do and teach,
          until the day in which he was taken up."
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, whatever translation one may prefer giving to these words,
          it is by other arguments that we have shown how Luke and Mark were
          prophets, and how their writings, transmitted to the Church by the
          authority of the apostles, are incorporated with those of the
          apostles, as well as with all the other books of the everlasting Word
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, then, is the extent to which our argument has conducted us, and
          this is, we have had to acknowledge, on the very authority of Holy
          Scripture. It is, first of all, that the inspiration of the words of
          the prophets was entire; that the Holy Ghost spake by them, and that
          the Word of the Lord was upon their tongue. It is, next, that whatever
          was written in the Bible, having been so written by prophecy, all the
          sacred books are holy letters (ἱερὰ γράμματα), written prophecies
          (προπητείαι γραφῆς), and Scriptures given by divine inspiration
          (γραφαὶ θεόπνευστοι.) Every thing there is from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, the reader will be pleased to remember (we once more
          repeat it here, although we have had occasion more than once to say it
          already), that it does not necessarily follow that the prophets of the
          Old and New Testament were thrown into a state of excitation and
          enthusiasm, which took them out of themselves; we must, on the
          contrary, beware of entertaining any such idea. The ancient Church
          attached so much importance even to this principle, that under the
          reign of the emperor Commodus, according to what Eusebius says,
          Miltiades (the illustrious author of a Christian Apology) "composed a
          book for the express purpose of establishing," against Montanus and
          the false prophets of Phrygia, "that true prophets ought to be masters
          of themselves, and ought not to speak in ecstasy." The action of God
          was exerted upon them without their passing entirely out of their
          ordinary condition. "The spirits of the prophets," says St Paul, "are
          subject to the prophets."2 Their intellectual faculties were at the
          time directed, not suspended. They knew, they felt, they willed, they
          recollected, they understood, they approved. They could say, "It
          seemed good to me to write;" and, as apostles, "It seemed good to the
          Holy Ghost and to us." And the words as well as the thoughts were
          given them; for, after all, words are themselves but second thoughts
          relating to language, and having recourse to it for the selection of
          expressions. In both cases, to explain the gift is equally easy and
          equally difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, as respects inspiration, there is something in holy
          Scripture that strikes us if possible still more than all those
          declarations of the apostles and of Jesus Christ himself, and that is
          the examples they present to us.
