        <h2>I. Might not Inspiration pertain to the Thoughts only</h2>
        <p>
          "The prophets and the apostles," some say, "were, no doubt, inspired
          when they wrote their sacred books, in so far as respected their
          thoughts; but we must believe, that, beyond this, they were left to
          themselves as respects their language; so that in this written
          revelation the ideas are God's, and the expressions those of a man.
          The task of the sacred writers resembles, in some sort, that of a man
          before whose eyes there have been successively passed some very highly
          coloured pictures, while he has been charged to describe them merely
          in so far as they have passed before his eyes. It is thus that the
          Divine Spirit is considered to have presented the holy truths they
          announce to the view of the evangelists and the prophets, leaving them
          no more to do than simply to express them; and this mode of conceiving
          of what they did," it is added, "at once accounts for the striking
          differences of style which their writings exhibit."
        </p>
        <p>We reply:—</p>
        <p>
          1. That this system is directly contrary to Scripture testimony. The
          Bible declares itself to be written, "not with the words which man's
          wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth." It calls itself
          "the word of God," "the words of God,"2 "the voice of God," "the
          oracles of God," "the lively oracles of God,"4 "the holy letters of
          God," "the scripture of God." A scripture, or writing, is made up of
          letters and words, and not of invisible thoughts only: but, we are
          told, "all SCRIPTURE is given by inspiration of God." What is WRITTEN,
          therefore, is inspired of God (θεόπνευστος); and that which is
          inspired of God is ALL SCRIPTURE—it is all that is written (πᾶσα
          γραφὴ).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. While this system is contradictory to the Bible, it is also most
          irrational. The ideas of our fellow-men embody themselves in words;
          and it is there only that you can seize them. Souls are revealed to us
          only in the flesh. You do not learn their character; you know nothing
          of their desires or their experiences; you do not even suspect their
          existence; and betwixt you and them there are no ties, until they have
          become clothed with bodies, and have received organs, so that they can
          manifest themselves to you. My most intimate friend is known to me
          only by the language of his voice and his gestures. If he had no power
          of employing these, in vain might he remain for twenty years at my
          side: he would be to me as if he were not.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than this. There exists, in so far as we are concerned, an
          inevitable dependance between souls and their organs, betwixt their
          ideas and words. Not only do we come to know the existence of the
          former only by the language of the latter, but (even after they have
          spoken to us) we can but guess only at their true character, as long
          as we have not the assurance that the organ has been the faithful
          interpreter of the mind, that the word has truly reflected the idea,
          and the proposition the thought. And if we have some room to apprehend
          that language has not been the pliant and adequate servant of the
          will, we possess no certainty that we have not been mistaken. Though
          we might know that God himself had placed in the soul of a writer the
          purest thoughts of heaven, still there would always be required, in
          order to our having through these words a certain revelation of them,
          that there should be given us the assurance that the language is
          exact, that the reflections are faithful, and that they reproduce to
          us without alteration the objects deposited in the secret chambers of
          that soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Language, then, is the wondrous mirror which reflects to us the depths
          of the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Were you a son weeping for the loss of a mother, and were God, for
          your consolation, to desire that you should see again, for some
          moments, in a looking-glass, the ever-to-be-venerated features of that
          mother, would it be enough that she herself were made to come down
          behind you and occupy the place where the reflected light would come
          from the object to your eyes in most abundance? Doubtless not, it
          would further be necessary that the mirror should be without any
          twist, furrow, or blemish. Were it unequal and faithless, of what use
          would it be to you? You would have near you, it is true, the smiling
          features of your own mother; her inimitable look would bear towards
          you the ardent expression of her maternal good wishes and her august
          benediction; but all this would be in vain; you would have no better
          than a stranger before your eyes, one perhaps of a hideous
          expression—a deformed creature, with features positively revolting! O
          my good mother, it is, then, no longer you! you would exclaim. Thus
          would it also be for you with the thoughts of God, if left to receive
          them disfigured by the errors of the human language that reflected
          them to us. It is no longer thou, O thought of my God! we should have
          to say to it. It is necessary then for our security, that we should
          have the divine guarantee as well for the fidelity of the mirror as
          for the faithfulness of the objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          These reflections will suffice, no doubt, to enable us to comprehend
          how irrational it is to think of receiving with exactness and
          certainty the thoughts of another through the medium of inexact and
          uncertain expressions. Can you lay hold of these thoughts otherwise
          than by words? And without God's words, how can you be sure of
          possessing his thoughts?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This theory of a divine revelation, in which you would have the
          inspiration of the thoughts without the inspiration of the language,
          is so inevitably irrational that it cannot be sincere, and proves
          false even to those who propose it; for, without their suspecting it,
          it makes them come much further down in their arguments than their
          first position seems at a first glance to indicate. Listen to them.
          Though the words are those of man, say they, the thoughts are those of
          God. And how will they prove this to you? Alas! once more, by
          attributing to this Scripture from God, contradictions, mistakes,
          proofs of ignorance! Is it then the words alone that they attack? and
          are not these alleged errors much more in the ideas than in the words?
          So true it is that we cannot separate the one from the other, and that
          a revelation of God's thoughts ever demands a revelation of God's
          words also.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This theory is not only antibiblical, irrational, and mischievous;
          further, it is taken up arbitrarily, and amounts at best to a
          gratuitous hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Besides, it is very useless; for it resolves no difficulty. You
          find it difficult, say you, to conceive how the Holy Ghost could have
          given the words in Holy Scripture; but can you tell us any better how
          he gave the thoughts? Will it be more easy for you, for example, to
          explain how God suggested to Moses the knowledge of the different acts
          of the creation, or to St John that of all the scenes of the last day,
          than to conceive how he made them write the narrative of these things
          in the language of the Hebrews, or in that of the Greeks?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But we have much more to say than this. That which in this theory
          ought above all to strike every attentive mind, is its extreme
          inconsistency, seeing that those even who hold it most strenuously,
          are forced withal to admit that, in its greatest part, the Scripture
          behoved to be inspired to the men of God EVEN IN ITS WORDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that the Holy Ghost were to call on you to go down this
          morning to the public street, there to proclaim, in Russian or in
          Tamil, "the wonderful works of God;" what would become of you, were he
          to be content with inspiring you with ideas, without giving you words?
          You might have the third heaven before your eyes, and in your heart
          the transports of archangels, still you would have to remain as if
          dumb and stupid before the persons composing this multitude. In order
          to your inspiration being of any use to you, it would be necessary
          that the periods, the phrases, and even the smallest words of your
          discourse, should be entirely given to you? What do I say? People
          might very well dispense with your own thoughts, provided you could
          make them hear, without even understanding them, the thoughts of God
          in the words of God. Well, then, let us carry this supposition into
          Jerusalem, and into the persons of the apostles. When the fishermen of
          Capernaum and Bethsaida, met in their upper chamber on the day of
          Pentecost, received the command to come down, and to go forth and
          publish, before that people which had assembled from every region
          under heaven, the wonderful works of God, in Latin, in Parthian, in
          Elamite, in Chaldean, in Coptic, in Arabic, would not the giving of
          the words be necessary? What could they have done on that occasion
          without the words? Why, nothing; while, with their words, they could
          convert the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          When, afterwards, in the church of Corinth, the faithful who had
          received miraculous powers spoke in the midst of the congregations in
          strange tongues, and found it necessary that some other, to whom the
          gift of interpretation had been given, should translate after them the
          unknown words which they had uttered in the ears of their brethren,
          was it not equally necessary that the words and all the phrases should
          be entirely dictated to them? When all the prophets, after having
          written their sacred pages, set themselves to meditate upon them with
          so much respect and care, as they would have done to the oracles of a
          stranger prophet; when they meditated upon them night and day,
          searching what (as Peter tells us2) the Spirit of Christ which was in
          them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
          Christ, and the glory that should follow—was it not, then, also
          necessary that all the words should have been given them? When Moses
          gives an account of the creation of the world, and of the extrication
          of chaos; when Solomon describes the Eternal Wisdom; when David
          recites, a thousand years beforehand, the prayers of the Son of God on
          the cross; when Daniel relates in detail, and without very well
          understanding them himself, the remote destinies of the World and of
          the Church; and when, in fine, John continues, in his own prophecies,
          the revelations of the prophet Daniel, was it not necessary that the
          smallest words should be given to them? and do not all interpreters,
          in reading them, acknowledge how far we might be led away from the
          true meaning, by the smallest word being put in the place of some
          other word, by the tense of the verb being illchosen, by the imprudent
          placing of a particle?
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, therefore, we must conclude, since so considerable a part
          of the Scriptures is necessarily inspired, even in its words, that the
          system of an inspiration of the thoughts, without an inspiration of
          the language, is inconsistent in the highest degree. There are not two
          kinds of the Word of God in the Holy Scriptures; there are not two
          sorts of God's Oracles. If it was "as moved by the Holy Ghost that
          holy men spoke," then all the Sacred Letters are divinely inspired;
          and that which is divinely inspired in the Sacred Letters is ALL
          SCRIPTURE.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these last reflections are about to conduct us to something at
          once more simple and more important. Here let the utmost caution be
          observed, for the question has been misrepresented. It has been said
          that the sacred Scriptures were inspired by God; and people have asked
          themselves up to what point this behoved to be the case. The matter
          for inquiry, however, did not lie there.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. We have said, that the question relates to the BOOK, and not to the
          WRITERS. You believe that God gave them the thoughts always, and not
          always the words; but the Scripture tells us, on the contrary, that
          God has given them always the words, and not always the thoughts. As
          for their thoughts, while they were in the act of writing, God might
          inspire them with ideas more or less lively, more or less pure, more
          or less elevated: that interests my charity alone, but has no bearing
          on my faith. The SCRIPTURE—the Scripture which they have transmitted
          to me, perhaps without themselves seizing its meaning, at least
          without ever entirely comprehending it, this is what concerns me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul might have been mistaken in his thoughts, when, on appearing
          before the council of the priests, and not recognizing God's
          highpriest, he ventured to say to him, "God shall strike thee, thou
          whited wall!" This is of little consequence, however, provided I know
          that WHEN HE WRITES THE WORD OF GOD, "it is Jesus Christ that speaks
          in him!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter might have been mistaken in his thoughts when, refusing to
          believe that God could send him among the heathen, he did not perceive
          and acknowledge that "in every nation, they who turn to God are
          accepted of him." He might have been still more grievously mistaken
          when, at Antioch, he compelled Paul to withstand him to the face,
          because he was to be blamed, and because he walked not uprightly
          according to the truth of the Gospel. But how does this concern me,
          after all, I repeat, at least as respects my faith? For the question
          is, not how I can know at what moments, or in what measure, Paul,
          John, Mark, James, or Peter, were inspired in their thoughts, or
          sanctified in their conduct: what, above all, interests me, is to know
          that all the sacred pages were divinely inspired; that their written
          words were the words of God; and that, in giving these to us, they
          spoke, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the
          Holy Ghost teacheth,3 (οὐκ ἐν διδακτοῖς ἀνθρωπίνης σοφίας λόγοις);
          that then it is NOT THEY that speak, but the Holy Ghost; in a word,
          that "God hath spoken BY THE MOUTH of his prophets since the world
          began."
        </p>
        <p>
          The sacred writers were SOMETIMES inspired; but the Holy Scriptures
          were so ALWAYS. Accordingly, the times, the measures, the degrees, the
          alternations of the inspiration of the men of God, are not for us an
          object of faith; but that which is an object of faith, is that the
          Scripture is divinely inspired, and that that which is divinely
          inspired is the whole Scripture. "Not one jot or tittle of it shall
          pass away."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is doubtless an inspiration of thoughts, as there is an
          inspiration of words; but the first makes the CHRISTIAN, while it is
          the second that makes the PROPHET.
        </p>
        <p>
          A true Christian is inspired in his thoughts: the Spirit of God
          reveals to him the deep things of God; it is not flesh and blood that
          have made him know the counsels of God and the glories of Jesus
          Christ, it is God the Father;2 for the Holy Ghost leads him into all
          truth; and he has been incapable of truly owning in his soul Jesus as
          Lord (the Lord of lords) but by the Holy Ghost.4 Every true believer,
          then, is more or less inspired by God in his thoughts; but he is not
          so in his words. He is Christian, but not Prophet. The holiest
          discourses of Cyprian, Augustine, Bernard, Luther, Calvin, Beza,
          Leighton, are only the words of men on the truths of God—venerable
          words, no doubt, precious and powerful words, and worthy of our utmost
          attention, because of the wisdom that has been given to them, and of
          the abundant expression which we find in them of the thought of God;
          still these, after all, are but the words of men—they form but a
          sermon. It is quite otherwise in the case of the prophet. The latter
          may have, and he may not have, the thought of God in his thought; but
          that which he will always have, as long AS HE SHALL SPEAK AS A
          PROPHET, is "the word of God IN HIS MOUTH." The Spirit of God will
          speak by him, and the word of God will be on his tongue. He will be
          the mouth of God, a mouth intelligent or unintelligent, voluntary or
          involuntary—that is of little consequence, provided that God's oracles
          flow from him, and that I receive the thought of my God in the words
          of my God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a word, one may be a Christian without having on his lips the words
          of God, and one may be a prophet without having on his heart or in his
          understanding the thoughts of God; but one cannot be a Christian
          without having in his heart the thoughts of God, and one cannot be a
          prophet without having on his lips the words of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the language of the Bible (this we shall ere long establish), a
          prophet is a person in whose mouth God puts, for a time, the words
          which he wishes to have uttered upon earth. Such a person prophesied
          only by intervals, "according as the Spirit gave him utterance." One
          might not be a prophet, like King Saul, more than twice in his life;
          and, as his soldiers, more than once.2 One might then pronounce the
          words of God while understanding them, or without understanding them,
          often even without having been previously apprized, and sometimes even
          without having wished it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Daniel had traced his last pages, he did not understand, he
          himself tells us, what the Spirit had made him write. When Caiaphas
          uttered prophetic words, "he spoke not of himself;" he had the will,
          but he had neither the consciousness nor the comprehension of what God
          caused him to pronounce. When Balaam went up three times to the top of
          a hill to curse Israel, and when, three times, words of benediction
          proceeded from his lips, as it were in spite of himself, because "the
          Lord had met him and put a word into his mouth,"5 he had the
          consciousness of what he did, but neither fully comprehended, nor
          fully willed it. When Saul's armed followers went in search of David
          to Ramah, and when the Spirit of the Lord was upon them, so that they
          also prophesied; and when Saul, three successive times, sent others of
          them, who also three successive times prophesied; and when the profane
          Saul went himself likewise to the great well in Sechu, and when God
          (to illustrate his power, and to manifest more clearly to us what it
          is to be a prophet, and what his word is) had made his Spirit to come
          on that unbelieving man also; when he went on and prophesied; when the
          word of the Lord was in that ordinarily profane mouth, and he
          prophesied before Samuel all that day and all that night, "what was it
          that happened to the son of Kish? Was Saul also among the prophets?"
          Yes, and Saul had the consciousness of his condition, and of the part
          he acted as a prophet; but of this he had neither the full will, nor
          the anticipation, nor probably the full comprehension. When the old
          prophet had seated himself amicably at table with the man of God, whom
          he had seduced from his road by an unbelieving and carnal kindness,
          and when, all of a sudden, under an impulse from on high, menacing
          words proceeded in a loud voice from his mouth against his imprudent
          and guilty guest, he prophesied with the consciousness of what he did,
          but he prophesied without having the wish to do so. What do I say? Did
          not God make his voice be heard in the empty air, in the presence of
          Moses and of all the people, on Mount Sinai? Did he not cause it to be
          heard by the couch of a child in the tabernacle at Shiloh? To the ears
          of the three apostles, and of the two saints who had risen again from
          Hades, on Mount Tabor? To John the Baptist, and to all the people, on
          the banks of the Jordan?

          Be it well understood, then, it is the holy letters (τὰ ἱερὰ γράμματα,
          2 Tim. 3:15); it is all that is written, that is to say, the phrases
          and the words, that are divinely inspired, that are θεόπνευστοι. The
          question, then, is about the words, and not about the men who have
          written. As to the latter, that concerns you little. The Spirit was
          able more or less to associate their individuality, their conscience,
          their recollections, their affections, with what he caused them to
          write, and you are nowise obliged to know how far this was the case;
          but that which it behoves you to know is (as St Peter has said), "that
          NO WRITTEN PROPHECY came by the will of man, but that it was as moved
          by the Holy Ghost, holy men of God spake;" and just as at Belshazzar's
          feast people troubled themselves little about knowing what was passing
          in the fingers of that terrible hand which came forth from the wall
          over against the candlestick, while, on the contrary, all the thoughts
          of the guests were turned to the words that were traced on the plaster
          of the wall, "Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin," because they knew well
          that these words were from God; so likewise it concerns you little, in
          point of faith, to penetrate into what passed in the thoughts of Mark,
          the thoughts of John, the thoughts of Luke, the thoughts of Matthew,
          during the time that they were writing the roll of the Gospels. It
          behoves you rather to direct your entire attention towards the words
          which they have written, because you know that these words are from
          God. Be the prophet holy like Moses, wise like Daniel, an enemy of God
          like Caiaphas, ignorant of the language in which he speaks like the
          prophets at Corinth, impure like Balaam—what do I say?—insensible,
          like the hand that wrote on the wall in the palace at Babylon; without
          form, without body, without soul, like the empty air in which was
          heard the voice of God (on Sinai, on the banks of Jordan, on Mount
          Tabor …), it is of little consequence, once more (unless it be where
          their personality itself should be found so interested as to make an
          essential part of their revelation.) Thy thoughts, O my God, thy
          thoughts and thy words, these are what concern me!
