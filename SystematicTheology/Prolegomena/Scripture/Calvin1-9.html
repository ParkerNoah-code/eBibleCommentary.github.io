        </p>

        <h2>1.The fanatics wrongly appeal to the Holy Spirit</h2>
        <p>
          Those who, rejecting Scripture, imagine that they have some peculiar
          way of penetrating to God, are to be deemed not so much under the
          influence of error as madness. For certain giddy men have lately
          appeared, who, while they make a great display of the superiority of
          the Spirit, reject all reading of the Scriptures themselves, and
          deride the simplicity of those who only delight in what they call the
          dead and deadly letter. But I wish they would tell me what spirit it
          is whose inspiration raises them to such a sublime height that they
          dare despise the doctrine of Scripture as mean and childish. If they
          answer that it is the Spirit of Christ, their confidence is
          exceedingly ridiculous; since they will, I presume, admit that the
          apostles and other believers in the primitive Church were not
          illuminated by any other Spirit. None of these thereby learned to
          despise the word of God, but every one was imbued with greater
          reverence for it, as their writings most clearly testify. And, indeed,
          it had been so foretold by the mouth of Isaiah. For when he says, "My
          Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,
          shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed,
          nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from
          henceforth and for ever," he does not tie down the ancient Church to
          external doctrine, as he were a mere teacher of elements; he rather
          shows that, under the reign of Christ, the true and full felicity of
          the new Church will consist in their being ruled not less by the Word
          than by the Spirit of God. Hence we infer that these miscreants are
          guilty of fearful sacrilege in tearing asunder what the prophet joins
          in indissoluble union. Add to this, that Paul, though carried up even
          to the third heaven, ceased not to profit by the doctrine of the law
          and the prophets, while, in like manner, he exhorts Timothy, a teacher
          of singular excellence, to give attention to reading, (1 Tim. 4: 13.)
          And the eulogium which he pronounces on Scripture well deserves to be
          remembered, viz., that "it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that the man of
          God may be perfect," (2 Tim. 3: 16.) What an infatuation of the devil,
          therefore, to fancy that Scripture, which conducts the sons of God to
          the final goal, is of transient and temporary use?
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I should like those people to tell me whether they have imbibed
          any other Spirit than that which Christ promised to his disciples.
          Though their madness is extreme, it will scarcely carry them the
          length of making this their boast. But what kind of Spirit did our
          Saviour promise to send? One who should not speak of himself, (John
          16: 13,) but suggest and instil the truths which he himself had
          delivered through the word. Hence the office of the Spirit promised to
          us, is not to form new and unheard-of revelations, or to coin a new
          form of doctrine, by which we may be led away from the received
          doctrine of the gospel, but to seal on our minds the very doctrine
          which the gospel recommends.
        </p>

        <h2>
          2. The Holy Spirit is recognized in his agreement with Scripture
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hence it is easy to understand that we must give diligent heed both to
          the reading and hearing of Scripture, if we would obtain any benefit
          from the Spirit of God, (just as Peter praises those who attentively
          study the doctrine of the prophets, (2 Pet. 1: 19,) though it might
          have been thought to be superseded after the gospel light arose,) and,
          on the contrary, that any spirit which passes by the wisdom of God's
          Word, and suggests any other doctrine, is deservedly suspected of
          vanity and falsehood. Since Satan transforms himself into an angel of
          light, what authority can the Spirit have with us if he be not
          ascertained by an infallible mark? And assuredly he is pointed out to
          us by the Lord with sufficient clearness; but these miserable men err
          as if bent on their own destruction, while they seek the Spirit from
          themselves rather than from Him. But they say that it is insulting to
          subject the Spirit, to whom all things are to be subject, to the
          Scripture: as if it were disgraceful to the Holy Spirit to maintain a
          perfect resemblance throughout, and be in all respects without
          variation consistent with himself. True, if he were subjected to a
          human, an angelical, or to any foreign standard, it might be thought
          that he was rendered subordinate, or, if you will, brought into
          bondage, but so long as he is compared with himself, and considered in
          himself, how can it be said that he is thereby injured? I admit that
          he is brought to a test, but the very test by which it has pleased him
          that his majesty should be confirmed. It ought to be enough for us
          when once we hear his voice; but lest Satan should insinuate himself
          under his name, he wishes us to recognise him by the image which he
          has stamped on the Scriptures. The author of the Scriptures cannot
          vary, and change his likeness. Such as he there appeared at first,
          such he will perpetually remain. There is nothing contumelious to him
          in this, unless we are to think it would be honourable for him to
          degenerate, and revolt against himself.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Word and Spirit belong inseparably together</h2>
        <p>
          Their cavil about our cleaving to the dead letter carries with it the
          punishment which they deserve for despising Scripture. It is clear
          that Paul is there arguing against false apostles, (2 Cor. 3: 6,) who,
          by recommending the law without Christ, deprived the people of the
          benefit of the New Covenant, by which the Lord engages that he will
          write his law on the hearts of believers, and engrave it on their
          inward parts. The letter therefore is dead, and the law of the Lord
          kills its readers when it is dissevered from the grace of Christ, and
          only sounds in the ear without touching the heart. But if it is
          effectually impressed on the heart by the Spirit; if it exhibits
          Christ, it is the word of life converting the soul, and making wise
          the simple. Nay, in the very same passage, the apostle calls his own
          preaching the ministration of the Spirit, (2 Cor. 3: 8,) intimating
          that the Holy Spirit so cleaves to his own truth, as he has expressed
          it in Scripture, that he then only exerts and puts forth his strength
          when the word is received with due honour and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is nothing repugnant here to what was lately said, (chap. 7)
          that we have no great certainty of the word itself, until it be
          confirmed by the testimony of the Spirit. For the Lord has so knit
          together the certainty of his word and his Spirit, that our minds are
          duly imbued with reverence for the word when the Spirit shining upon
          it enables us there to behold the face of God; and, on the other hand,
          we embrace the Spirit with no danger of delusion when we recognise him
          in his image, that is, in his word. Thus, indeed, it is. God did not
          produce his word before men for the sake of sudden display, intending
          to abolish it the moment the Spirit should arrive; but he employed the
          same Spirit, by whose agency he had administered the word, to complete
          his work by the efficacious confirmation of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way Christ explained to the two disciples, (Luke 24: 27,) not
          that they were to reject the Scriptures and trust to their own wisdom,
          but that they were to understand the Scriptures. In like manner, when
          Paul says to the Thessalonians, "Quench not the Spirit," he does not
          carry them aloft to empty speculation apart from the word; he
          immediately adds, "Despise not prophesying," (1 Thess. 5: 19, 20.) By
          this, doubtless, he intimates that the light of the Spirit is quenched
          the moment prophesying fall into contempt. How is this answered by
          those swelling enthusiasts, in whose idea the only true illumination
          consists, in carelessly laying aside, and bidding adieu to the Word of
          God, while, with no less confidence than folly, they fasten upon any
          dreaming notion which may have casually sprung up in their minds?
          Surely a very different sobriety becomes the children of God. As they
          feel that without the Spirit of God they are utterly devoid of the
          light of truth, so they are not ignorant that the word is the
          instrument by which the illumination of the Spirit is dispensed. They
          know of no other Spirit than the one who dwelt and spake in the
          apostles--the Spirit by whose oracles they are daily invited to the
          hearing of the word.
