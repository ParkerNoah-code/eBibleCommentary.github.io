        <p>V. Roman Catholic Doctrine Concerning the Rule of Faith:</p>
        <p>
          <b>ยง 1. Statement of the Doctrine</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. ROMANISTS reject the doctrine of the Rationalists who make human
          reason either the source or standard of religious truth. It is one of
          their principles, that faith is merely human when either its object or
          ground is human. Faith to be divine must have truth supernaturally
          revealed as its object, and the evidence on which it rests must be the
          supernatural testimony of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They reject the Mystical doctrine that divine truth is revealed to
          every man by the Spirit. They admit an objective, supernatural
          revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They maintain, however, that this revelation is partly written and
          partly unwritten; that is, the rule of faith includes both Scripture
          and tradition. Moreover, as the people cannot certainly know what
          books are of divine origin, and, therefore, entitled to a place in the
          canon; and as they are incompetent to decide on the meaning of
          Scripture, or which among the multitude of traditionary doctrines and
          usages are divine, and which are human, God has made the Church an
          infallible teacher by which all these points are determined, whose
          testimony is the proximate and sufficient ground of faith to the
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far as the Romish doctrine concerning the Rule of Faith differs
          from that of Protestants, it presents the following points for
          consideration: First, The doctrine of Romanists concerning the
          Scriptures. Second, Their doctrine concerning tradition. Third, Their
          doctrine concerning the office and authority of the Church as a
          teacher.
