          By the completeness of the Scriptures is meant that they contain all
          the extant revelations of God designed to be a rule of faith and
          practice to the Church. It is not denied that God reveals himself,
          even his eternal power and Godhead, by his works, and has done so from
          the beginning of the world. But all the truths thus revealed are
          clearly made known in his written Word. Nor is it denied that there
          may have been, and probably were, books written by inspired men, which
          are no longer in existence. Much less is it denied that Christ and his
          Apostles delivered many discourses which were not recorded, and which,
          could they now be known and authenticated, would be of equal authority
          with the books now regarded as canonical. All that Protestants insist
          upon is, that the Bible contains all the extant revelations of God,
          which He designed to be the rule of faith and practice for his Church;
          so that nothing can rightfully be imposed on the consciences of men as
          truth or duty which is not taught directly or by necessary implication
          in the Holy Scriptures. This excludes all unwritten traditions, not
          only; but also all decrees of the visible Church; all resolutions of
          conventions, or other public bodies, declaring this or that to be
          right or wrong, true or false. The people of God are bound by nothing
          but the Word of God. On this subject little need be said. The
          completeness of Scripture, as a rule of faith, is a corollary of the
          Protestant doctrine concerning tradition. If that be true, the former
          must also be true. This Romanists do not deny. They make the Rule of
          Faith to consist of the written and unwritten word of God, i.e., of
          Scripture and tradition. If it be proved that tradition is
          untrustworthy, human, and fallible, then the Scriptures by common
          consent stand alone in their authority. As the authority of tradition
          has already been discussed, further discussion of the completeness of
          the Scriptures becomes unnecessary.

        <p>
          It is well, however, to bear in mind the importance of this doctrine.
          It is not by Romanists only that it is denied, practically at least,
          if not theoretically. Nothing is more common among Protestants,
          especially in our day, than the attempt to coerce the conscience of
          men by public opinion; to make the opinions of men on questions of
          morals a rule of duty for the people, and even for the Church. If we
          would stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, we
          must adhere to the principle that in matters of religion and morals
          the Scriptures alone have authority to bind the conscience.
