          The Suspension Of Its Authority On The Judgment Of The Church, An
          Impious Fiction
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. The authority of Scripture derived not from men, but from the
          Spirit of God. Objection, That Scripture depends on the decision of
          the Church. Refutation:
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          I. The truth of God would thus be subjected to the will of man.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">II. It is insulting to the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          III. It establishes a tyranny in the Church.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">IV. It forms a mass of errors.</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">V. It subverts conscience.</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          VI. It exposes our faith to the scoffs of the profane.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another reply to the objection drawn from the words of the Apostle
          Paul. Solution of the difficulties started by opponents. A second
          objection refuted.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A third objection founded on a sentiment of Augustine considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Conclusion, That the authority of Scripture is founded on its being
          spoken by God. This confirmed by the conscience of the godly, and the
          consent of all men of the least candour. A fourth objection common in
          the mouths of the profane. Refutation.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Last and necessary conclusion, That the authority of Scripture is
          sealed on the hearts of believers by the testimony of the Holy Spirit.
          The certainty of this testimony. Confirmation of it from a passage of
          Isaiah, and the experience of believers. Also, from another passage of
          Isaiah.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Scripture has its authority from God, not from the church</h2>
        <p>
          Before proceeding farther, it seems proper to make some observations
          on the authority of Scripture, in order that our minds may not only be
          prepared to receive it with reverence, but be divested of all doubt.
          When that which professes to be the Word of God is acknowledged to be
          so, no person, unless devoid of common sense and the feelings of a
          man, will have the desperate hardihood to refuse credit to the
          speaker. But since no daily responses are given from heaven, and the
          Scriptures are the only records in which God has been pleased to
          consign his truth to perpetual remembrance, the full authority which
          they ought to possess with the faithful is not recognised, unless they
          are believed to have come from heaven, as directly as if God had been
          heard giving utterance to them. This subject well deserves to be
          treated more at large, and pondered more accurately. But my readers
          will pardon me for having more regard to what my plan admits than to
          what the extent of this topic requires.
        </p>
        <p>
          A most pernicious error has very generally prevailed; viz.,that
          Scripture is of importance only in so far as conceded to it by the
          suffrage of the Church; as if the eternal and inviolable truth of God
          could depend on the will of men. With great insult to the Holy Spirit,
          it is asked, who can assure us that the Scriptures proceeded from God;
          who guarantee that they have come down safe and unimpaired to our
          times; who persuade us that this book is to be received with
          reverence, and that one expunged from the list, did not the Church
          regulate all these things with certainty? On the determination of the
          Church, therefore, it is said, depend both the reverence which is due
          to Scripture, and the books which are to be admitted into the canon.
          Thus profane men, seeking, under the pretext of the Church, to
          introduce unbridled tyranny, care not in what absurdities they
          entangle themselves and others, provided they extort from the simple
          this one acknowledgement, viz., that there is nothing which the Church
          cannot do. But what is to become of miserable consciences in quest of
          some solid assurance of eternal life, if all the promises with regard
          to it have no better support than man's judgement? On being told so,
          will they cease to doubt and tremble? On the other hand, to what jeers
          of the wicked is our faith subjected - into how great suspicion is it
          brought with all, if believed to have only a precarious authority lent
          to it by the goodwill of men?
        </p>

        <h2>2. The church is itself grounded upon Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          These ravings are admirably refuted by a single expression of an
          apostle. Paul testifies that the Church is "built on the foundation of
          the apostles and prophets," (Eph. 2: 20.) If the doctrine of the
          apostles and prophets is the foundation of the Church, the former must
          have had its certainty before the latter began to exist. Nor is there
          any room for the cavil, that though the Church derives her first
          beginning from thence, it still remains doubtful what writings are to
          be attributed to the apostles and prophets, until her judgement is
          interposed. For if the Christian Church was founded at first on the
          writings of the prophets, and the preaching of the apostles, that
          doctrine, wheresoever it may be found, was certainly ascertained and
          sanctioned antecedently to the Church, since, but for this, the Church
          herself never could have existed. Nothings therefore can be more
          absurd than the fiction, that the power of judging Scripture is in the
          Church, and that on her nod its certainty depends. When the Church
          receives it, and gives it the stamp of her authority, she does not
          make that authentic which was otherwise doubtful or controverted but,
          acknowledging it as the truth of God, she, as in duty bounds shows her
          reverence by an unhesitating assent. As to the question, How shall we
          be persuaded that it came from God without recurring to a decree of
          the Church? it is just the same as if it were asked, How shall we
          learn to distinguish light from darkness, white from black, sweet from
          bitter? Scripture bears upon the face of it as clear evidence of its
          truth, as white and black do of their colour, sweet and bitter of
          their taste.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Augustine cannot be cited as counterevidence</h2>
        <p>
          I am aware it is usual to quote a sentence of Augustine in which he
          says that he would not believe the gospel, were he not moved by the
          authority of the Church, (Aug. Cont. Epist. Fundament.c. 5.) But it is
          easy to discover from the context, how inaccurate and unfair it is to
          give it such a meaning. He was reasoning against the Manichees, who
          insisted on being implicitly believed, alleging that they had the
          truth, though they did not show they had. But as they pretended to
          appeal to the gospel in support of Manes, he asks what they would do
          if they fell in with a man who did not even believe the gospel - what
          kind of argument they would use to bring him over to their opinion. He
          afterwards adds, "But I would not believe the gospel," &c.; meaning,
          that were he a stranger to the faith, the only thing which could
          induce him to embrace the gospel would be the authority of the Church.
          And is it any thing wonderful,that one who does not know Christ should
          pay respect to men?
        </p>
        <p>
          Augustine, therefore, does not here say that the faith of the godly is
          founded on the authority of the Church; nor does he mean that the
          certainty of the gospel depends upon it; he merely says that
          unbelievers would have no certainty of the gospel, so as thereby to
          win Christ, were they not influenced by the consent of the Church. And
          he clearly shows this to be his meaning, by thus expressing himself a
          little before: "When I have praised my own creed, and ridiculed yours,
          who do you suppose is to judge between us; or what more is to be done
          than to quit those who, inviting us to certainty, afterwards command
          us to believe uncertainty, and follow those who invite us, in the
          first instance, to believe what we are not yet able to comprehend,
          that waxing stronger through faith itself, we may become able to
          understand what we believe - no longer men, but God himself internally
          strengthening and illuminating our minds?"
        </p>
        <p>
          These unquestionably are the words of Augustine, (August. Cont. Epist.
          Fundament. cap. 4;) and the obvious inference from them is, that this
          holy man had no intention to suspend our faith in Scripture on the nod
          or decision of the Church, but only to intimate (what we too admit to
          be true) that those who are not yet enlightened by the Spirit of God,
          become teachable by reverence for the Church, and thus submit to learn
          the faith of Christ from the gospel. In this way, though the authority
          of the Church leads us on, and prepares us to believe in the gospel,
          it is plain that Augustine would have the certainty of the godly to
          rest on a very different foundation. At the same time, I deny not that
          he often presses the Manichees with the consent of the whole Church,
          while arguing in support of the Scriptures, which they rejected. Hence
          he upbraids Faustus (lib. 32) for not submitting to evangelical truth
          - truth so well founded, so firmly established, so gloriously
          renowned, and handed down by sure succession from the days of the
          apostles. But he nowhere insinuates that the authority which we give
          to the Scriptures depends on the definitions or devices of men. He
          only brings forward the universal judgement of the Church, as a point
          most pertinent to the cause, and one, moreover, in which he had the
          advantage of his opponents. Any one who desires to see this more fully
          proved may read his short treatises De Utilitate Credendi,(The
          Advantages of Believing,) where it will be found that the only
          facility of believing which he recommends is that which affords an
          introduction, and forms a fit commencement to inquiry; while he
          declares that we ought not to be satisfied with opinion, but to strive
          after substantial truth.
        </p>

        <h2>
          4. The witness of the Holy Spirit: this is stronger than all proof
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is necessary to attend to what I lately said, that our faith in
          doctrine is not established until we have a perfect conviction that
          God is its author. Hence, the highest proof of Scripture is uniformly
          taken from the character of him whose Word it is. The prophets and
          apostles boast not their own acuteness or any qualities which win
          credit to speakers, nor do they dwell on reasons; but they appeal to
          the sacred name of God, in order that the whole world may be compelled
          to submission. The next thing to be considered is, how it appears not
          probable merely, but certain, that the name of God is neither rashly
          nor cunningly pretended. If, then, we would consult most effectually
          for our consciences, and save them from being driven about in a whirl
          of uncertainty, from wavering, and even stumbling at the smallest
          obstacle, our conviction of the truth of Scripture must be derived
          from a higher source than human conjectures, judgements, or reasons;
          namely, the secret testimony of the Spirit. It is true, indeed, that
          if we choose to proceed in the way of arguments it is easy to
          establish, by evidence of various kinds, that if there is a God in
          heaven, the Law, the Prophecies, and the Gospel, proceeded from him.
          Nay, although learned men, and men of the greatest talent, should take
          the opposite side, summoning and ostentatiously displaying all the
          powers of their genius in the discussion; if they are not possessed of
          shameless effrontery, they will be compelled to confess that the
          Scripture exhibits clear evidence of its being spoken by God, and,
          consequently, of its containing his heavenly doctrine. We shall see a
          little farther on, that the volume of sacred Scripture very far
          surpasses all other writings. Nay, if we look at it with clear eyes,
          and unblessed judgement, it will forthwith present itself with a
          divine majesty which will subdue our presumptuous opposition, and
          force us to do it homage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, however, it is preposterous to attempt, by discussion, to rear
          up a full faith in Scripture. True, were I called to contend with the
          craftiest despisers of God, I trust, though I am not possessed of the
          highest ability or eloquence, I should not find it difficult to stop
          their obstreperous mouths; I could, without much ado, put down the
          boastings which they mutter in corners, were anything to be gained by
          refuting their cavils. But although we may maintain the sacred Word of
          God against gainsayers, it does not follow that we shall forthwith
          implant the certainty which faith requires in their hearts. Profane
          men think that religion rests only on opinion, and, therefore, that
          they may not believe foolishly, or on slight grounds, desire and
          insist to have it proved by reason that Moses and the prophets were
          divinely inspired. But I answer,that the testimony of the Spirit is
          superior to reason. For as God alone can properly bear witness to his
          own words, so these words will not obtain full credit in the hearts of
          men, until they are sealed by the inward testimony of the Spirit. The
          same Spirit, therefore, who spoke by the mouth of the prophets, must
          penetrate our hearts, in order to convince us that they faithfully
          delivered the message with which they were divinely entrusted. This
          connection is most aptly expressed by Isaiah in these words, "My
          Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,
          shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed,
          nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from
          henceforth and for ever," (Isa. 59: 21.) Some worthy persons feel
          disconcerted, because, while the wicked murmur with impunity at the
          Word of God,they have not a clear proof at hand to silence them,
          forgetting that the Spirit is called an earnest and seal to confirm
          the faith of the godly, for this very reason, that, until he
          enlightens their minds, they are tossed to and fro in a sea of doubts.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Scripture bears its own authentication</h2>
        <p>
          Let it therefore be held as fixed, that those who are inwardly taught
          by the Holy Spirit acquiesce implicitly in Scripture; that Scripture
          carrying its own evidence along with it, deigns not to submit to
          proofs and arguments, but owes the full conviction with which we ought
          to receive it to the testimony of the Spirit. Enlightened by him, we
          no longer believe, either on our own judgement or that of others, that
          the Scriptures are from God; but, in a way superior to human
          judgement, feel perfectly assured - as much so as if we beheld the
          divine image visibly impressed on it -that it came to us, by the
          instrumentality of men, from the very mouth of God. We ask not for
          proofs or probabilities on which to rest our judgement, but we subject
          our intellect and judgement to it as too transcendent for us to
          estimate. This, however, we do, not in the manner in which some are
          wont to fasten on an unknown object, which, as soon as known,
          displeases, but because we have a thorough conviction that, in holding
          it, we hold unassailable truth; not like miserable men, whose minds
          are enslaved by superstition, but because we feel a divine energy
          living and breathing in it - an energy by which we are drawn and
          animated to obey it, willingly indeed, and knowingly, but more vividly
          and effectually than could be done by human will or knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, God most justly exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah, "Ye are my
          witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye
          may know and believe me, and understand that I am he," (Isa. 43:
          10.)Such, then, is a conviction which asks not for reasons; such,
          acknowledge which accords with the highest reason, namely knowledge in
          which the mind rests more firmly and securely than in any reasons;
          such in fine, the conviction which revelation from heaven alone can
          produce. I say nothing more than every believer experiences in
          himself, though my words fall far short of the reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not dwell on this subject at present, because we will return to
          it again: only let us now understand that the only true faith is that
          which the Spirit of God seals on our hearts. Nay, the modest and
          teachable reader will find a sufficient reason in the promise
          contained in Isaiah, that all the children of the renovated Church
          "shall be taught of the Lord," (Isaiah 54: 13.) This singular
          privilege God bestows on his elect only, whom he separates from the
          rest of mankind. For what is the beginning of true doctrine but prompt
          alacrity to hear the Word of God? And God, by the mouth of Moses, thus
          demands to be heard: "It is not in heavens that thou shouldest say,
          Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may
          hear and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee,in thy mouth and
          in thy heart," (Deut. 30: 12, 14.) God having been pleased to reserve
          the treasure of intelligence for his children, no wonder that so much
          ignorance and stupidity is seen in the generality of mankind. In the
          generality, I include even those specially chosen, until they are
          ingrafted into the body of the Church. Isaiah, moreover, while
          reminding us that the prophetical doctrine would prove incredible not
          only to strangers, but also to the Jews, who were desirous to be
          thought of the household of God, subjoins the reason, when he asks,
          "To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" (Isaiah 53: 1.) If at
          any time, then we are troubled at the small number of those who
          believe, let us, on the other hand, call to mind, that none comprehend
          the mysteries of God save those to whom it is given.
