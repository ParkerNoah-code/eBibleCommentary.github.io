        <h2>IV. Proof of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          In point of theory, it were allowable to say that a religion might be
          divine without the books that teach it being miraculously inspired. It
          were possible, for example, to figure to ourselves a Christianity
          without divine inspiration; and one might conceive, perhaps, that all
          the miracles of our faith have been performed with the single
          exception of this one. On this supposition (which nothing authorizes),
          the everlasting Father would have given his Son to the world; the
          creating Word, made flesh, would have submitted for us to the death of
          the cross, and caused to descend from heaven upon his apostles the
          spirit of understanding and the power of working miracles; but, all
          these mysteries of redemption once consummated, he might have
          relinquished to these men of God the care of writing, according to
          their own wisdom, our sacred books; and their writings would thus have
          presented no more than the natural language of their supernatural
          illuminations, of their convictions, and their charity. Such an order
          of things, no doubt, is but an idle supposition, directly opposed to
          the testimony which the Scriptures have rendered to what they are. But
          without saying here that it resolves nothing, and that, miracle for
          miracle, that of illumination is not less inexplicable than that of
          inspiration; without saying, farther, that the Word of God possesses a
          divine power which belongs to it alone— such an order of things,
          granting it were a reality, would have exposed us to innumerable
          errors, and plunged us into the most dismal uncertainty. Upon what
          testimony could, in that case, our faith have rested? On something
          said by men? But faith is founded only on the Word of God.—(Rom.
          10:17.) In such a system, then, you would only have had a Christianity
          without Christians. Deprived of any security against the imprudence of
          the writers, you could not even have given their books the authority
          at present possessed in the Church by those of Augustine, Bernard,
          Luther, and Calvin, or of so many other men whom the Holy Ghost
          enlightened with a knowledge of the truth. We are, in fact,
          sufficiently aware how many imprudent expressions and erroneous
          propositions have found their way into the midst even of the finest
          pages of those admirable doctors. And yet the apostles (on the
          supposition we have made) would have been far more subject to serious
          mistakes even than they were, since they would not have had, like the
          doctors of the Church, a Word of God by which to direct their own; and
          since they themselves would have had to compose the whole language of
          religious science. (A science is more than half formed when its
          language is formed.) What deplorable and inevitable errors must have
          necessarily accompanied, in their case, this revelation without divine
          inspiration! and in what deplorable doubts would their hearers have
          been left!—errors in the selection of facts, errors in the
          appreciation of them, errors in the statement of them, errors in the
          mode of conceiving the relations they bear to doctrines, errors in the
          expression of those very doctrines, errors of omission, errors of
          language, errors of exaggeration, errors in adopting certain national
          prejudices, or prejudices arising from a man's rank or party, errors
          in the foresight of the future, and in judgments pronounced upon the
          past.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, thanks be to God, it is not thus with our sacred books. They
          contain no error; they are written throughout by inspiration of God.
          "Holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;" they did so,
          "not with words that man's wisdom teacheth, but with words which the
          Spirit of God taught;" in such sort, that not one of these words
          should be neglected, and that we are called to respect them and to
          study them, even to their smallest iota and their slightest jot: for
          "this Scripture is pure, like silver refined seven times: it is
          perfect."
        </p>
        <p>
          These assertions, which are themselves testimonies of the Word of God,
          have already comprised our last definition of Divine Inspiration, and
          lead us to characterise it, finally, as that inexplicable power which
          the Divine Spirit put forth of old on the authors of holy Scripture,
          in order to their guidance even in the employment of the words they
          used, and to preserve them alike from all error and from all omission.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new definition, which might appear complex, is not so really; for
          the two traits of which it is composed are equivalent, and to admit
          the one is to accept the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          We propose them disjunctively to the assent of our readers, and we
          offer them the alternative of accepting either. One has more
          precision, the other more simplicity, in so far as it presents the
          doctrine under a form more disengaged from all questions relative to
          the mode of inspiration, and to the secret experiences of the sacred
          writers. Let either be fully accepted, and then there will have been
          rendered to the Scriptures the honour and the credit to which they are
          entitled.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we propose, therefore, is to establish the doctrine of Divine
          inspiration under one or other of these two forms:—
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures are given and warranted by God, even in their language;
          and, The Scriptures contain no error—(whereby we understand that they
          say all that they ought to say, and that they do not say what they
          ought not to say.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how shall a man establish this doctrine? By the Scriptures, and
          only by the Scriptures. Once that we have recognised these as true, we
          must go to them to be taught what they are; and once that they have
          told us that they are inspired of God, it belongs to them farther to
          tell us how they are so, and how far they are so.
        </p>
        <p>
          To attempt the proof of their inspiration a priori—by arguing from
          that miracle being necessary for the security of our faith—would be to
          adopt a feeble mode of reasoning, and almost to imitate, in one sense,
          the presumption which, in another sense, imagines a priori four
          degrees of divine inspiration. Further; to think of establishing the
          entire inspiration of the Scriptures on the consideration of their
          beauty, their constant wisdom, their prophetic foresight, and all the
          characters of divinity which occur in them, would be to build on
          arguments no doubt just, but contestable, or at least contested. It is
          solely on the declarations of holy Scripture, therefore, that we have
          to take our stand. We have no authority but that for the doctrines of
          our faith; and divine inspiration is just one of those doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, however, let us anticipate a misapprehension. It may happen that
          some reader, still but feebly established in his Christianity,
          mistaking our object, and thinking to glance through our book in
          search of arguments which may convince him, might find himself
          disappointed, and might conceive himself authorized to charge our line
          of argument with some vicious reasoning, as if we wanted to prove in
          it the inspiration of the Scriptures by the inspiration of the
          Scriptures. It is of consequence that we should put him right. We have
          not written these pages for the disciples of Porphyry, or of Voltaire,
          or of Rousseau; and it has not been our object to prove that the
          Scriptures are worthy of belief. Others have done this, and it is not
          our task. We address ourselves to men who respect the Scriptures, and
          who admit their veracity. To these we attest, that, being true, they
          say that they are inspired; and that, being inspired, they declare
          that they are so throughout: whence we conclude that they necessarily
          must be so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, of all truths, this doctrine is one of the simplest and the
          clearest to minds meekly and rationally submissive to the testimony of
          the Scriptures. No doubt modern divines may be heard to represent it
          as full of uncertainties and difficulties; but they who have desired
          to study it only by the light of God's Word, have been unable to
          perceive those difficulties, or to find those uncertainties. Nothing,
          on the contrary, is more clearly or oftener taught in the Scriptures
          than the Inspiration of the Scriptures. Accordingly, the ancients knew
          nothing on this subject of the embarrassments and the doubts of the
          doctors of the present day; for them the Bible was from God, or it was
          not from God. On this point antiquity presents an admirable unanimity.
          But since the moderns, in imitation of the Talmudistic Jews and
          Rabbins of the middle ages, have imagined learned distinctions between
          four or five different degrees of inspiration, who can wonder that for
          them difficulties and uncertainties have been multiplied? Contesting
          what the Scriptures teach, and explaining what the Scriptures do not
          teach, it is easy to see how they come to be embarrassed; but for this
          they have only their own rashness to blame.
        </p>
        <p>
          So very clear, indeed, is this testimony which the Scriptures render
          to their own inspiration, that one may well feel amazed that, among
          Christians, there should be any diversities of opinion on so
          welldefined a subject. But the evil is too easily explained by the
          power of preconceived opinions. The mind once wholly pre-occupied by
          objections of its own raising, sacred passages are perverted from
          their natural meaning in proportion as those objections present
          themselves; and, by a secret effort of thought, people try to
          reconcile these with the difficulties that embarrass them. The plenary
          inspiration of the Scriptures is, in spite of the Scriptures, denied
          (as the Sadducees denied the resurrection), because the miracle is
          thought inexplicable; but we must recollect the answer made by Jesus
          Christ, "Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not THE SCRIPTURES,
          nor THE POWER OF GOD?"—(Mark 12:24, 27.) It is, therefore, because of
          this too common disposition of the human mind, that we have thought it
          best not to present the reader with our scriptural proofs until after
          having completed our definition of divine inspiration, by an attentive
          examination of the part to be assigned in it to the individuality of
          the sacred writers. This will be the subject of the following section.
          No less do we desire being able to present the reader with a more
          didactic expression of the doctrine that occupies us, and of some of
          the questions connected with it: but we have thought that a more
          fitting place might be found for this development elsewhere, partly
          because it will be more favourably received after our scriptural
          proofs shall have been considered; partly because we have no desire,
          by employing the forms of the school, to repel, at the very threshold,
          unlearned readers who may have taken up these pages with the idea of
          finding something in them for the edification of their faith.
