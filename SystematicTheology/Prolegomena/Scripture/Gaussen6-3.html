          III. Sacred Criticism is the Doorkeeper of the Temple, not its God
        </h2>
        <p>
          This reflexion will present itself at once under the form of an advice
          and of an argument. But let not this alarm the reader. We venture on
          the advice only as a prelude to the argument; for we do not forget
          that our task in this book is to establish the fact of the divine
          inspiration, not to preach it. To begin with the advice; it is as
          follows:—
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning is a doorkeeper who conducts you to the temple of the
          Scriptures. Never forget, then, that she is not the God, and that her
          house is not the temple. In other terms, when you study sacred
          criticism, beware of keeping to that, even as regards learning. She
          leaves you in the street; you must enter. And now for the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you penetrate, in fact, into the sanctuary of the Scriptures, then
          not only will you find inscribed by the hand of God on all its walls
          that God fills it, and that he is every where there, but, further, you
          will receive the proof of it experimentally. There you will behold him
          every where; there you will feel him every where. In other terms, when
          one reads God's oracles with care, he not only meets with the frequent
          declaration of their entire inspiration, but, further, through
          unexpected strokes, and often through a single verse or the power of a
          single word, he receives a profound conviction of the divinity stamped
          upon it throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
          As regards advice, it must not be imagined that we have given it with
          the view of discrediting learned investigations; we offer it, on the
          contrary, in their interest, and in order to their completion. In
          fact, it too often happens that a prolonged course of study, devoted
          to the extrinsic parts of the sacred book (its history, its
          manuscripts, its versions, its language), by entirely absorbing the
          attention of the men who give themselves to it, leaves them
          inattentive to its more intrinsic attributes, its meaning, its object,
          the moral power which displays itself there, the beauties that reveal
          themselves there, the life that diffuses itself there. And as there
          exist, nevertheless, necessary relations between these essential
          attributes and those exterior forms, two great evils result from this
          pre-occupation of the mind. By this absorption the student stifles his
          spiritual life as a man, and compromises final salvation. This,
          however, is not the evil we have to do with in these pages: as a
          learned inquirer, he compromises his science by it, and renders
          himself incapable of forming a sound estimate of the very objects of
          his studies. His learning is wanting in coherence and consistency, and
          from that very cause becomes contracted and creeping. How can a man
          become acquainted with the temple, when he has seen but the stones,
          and knows nothing of the Shekinah? Can the types be understood, when
          he has not even a suspicion of their antitype? he has seen but altars,
          sheep, knives, utensils, blood, fire, incense, costumes, and
          ceremonies; he has not beheld the world's redemption, futurity,
          heaven, the glory of Jesus Christ! And, in this state, he has been
          unable so much as to comprehend the relations which these external
          objects have amongst themselves, because he has not comprehended their
          harmony with the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          A learned man, without faith, living in the days of Noah, who had
          studied the structure of the ark, would have lost his soul, no doubt;
          but, further, he would have remained ignorant of a great part of the
          very objects which he pretended to appreciate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that a Roman traveller, in the days of Pompey the Great, had
          wished to describe Jerusalem and its temple. Arriving in the city on a
          Sabbath day, he repairs to the holy place with his guide; he makes the
          tour of it; he admires its enormous stones; he measures its porticoes;
          he inquires about its antiquity and the names of the architects; he
          passes through its gigantic gates, which two hundred men daily open at
          sunrise and shut again at noon; there he sees arriving by thousands,
          in regular order, the Levites and choristers in their linen habits;
          and while in the interior, the sons of Aaron perform their rites;
          while the psalms of the prophet king resound under the sacred vaults,
          and thousands of choristers, accompanying them with their instruments,
          respond to each other in their sublime antiphonies; while the law is
          read, the word preached, and the souls that look for the consolation
          of Israel are lifted up with delight to the glories that are
          invisible, and filled with the deepest awe in contemplating that God
          "with whom there is plenteous redemption;" while aged Simeons are
          raising their thoughts to "that glorious salvation unceasingly waited
          for;" while sinners are turning to God; while more than one poor
          publican strikes upon his breast; while more than one poor widow, with
          joyous emotion, takes out her two mites for God's treasury; and while
          so many invisible but ardent prayers are rising towards heaven;—what
          may we suppose our traveller to be doing? Why, counting the pillars,
          admiring the pavements, measuring the courts, scrutinizing the
          congregation, taking drawings of the altar of incense, the
          candlestick, the table of shewbread, the golden censer; after which,
          he walks off, mounts to the battlements of the fortress, goes down to
          the Xystus and to the brook Kedron, makes the circuit of the walls,
          counting his steps as he goes, and then returns to his quarters, there
          to write out his observations and to prepare his book. No doubt, he
          might boast of his having seen the Hebrew nation, and their worship
          and temple; he might publish his journey, and find numerous readers;
          but, even with respect to the scientific knowledge which his book is
          meant to diffuse, how many errors of judgment will be found in it! and
          how many errors would the worshippers in the temple have to refute in
          it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is the advice we proffer, in the sole interests of your
          theological learning. It necessarily follows, from the necessary
          relations that subsist betwixt the eternal ends contemplated by God in
          his Word and its external forms, that, in order to judge correctly of
          the latter, you must first have made yourselves acquainted with the
          former.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would form a judgment of a physician, you would no doubt desire
          to know what country he is from, what has been his course of study,
          what universities he has attended, and what testimonials he can
          produce; but should he be the first to tell you what are your most
          latent disorders; should he reveal to you sensations in your system
          which you have hitherto vaguely felt, and the secret reality of which
          you recognize as soon as he has defined them to you; should he, above
          all, prescribe and supply the only remedy that could ever give you
          relief; would not such an experience tell you far more about him than
          his diplomas can do?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, the following is the counsel we venture to give to all
          such of our readers as have made any acquaintance with sacred
          criticism. Read the Bible, study the Bible by itself and for itself;
          ask it, if you like, where it has taken its degrees, and in what
          school its writers have studied; but come to its consultations, as a
          sick person eager to be cured; be as careful to make the experience of
          its words, as you can have been in studying its language and its
          history; and then, not only will you be healed (which is not the
          question at issue here), but you will be enlightened. "He that healed
          me said: Take up thy bed and walk! Whether he be a sinner I know not:
          one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the author would take occasion to mention what a thirst he felt
          for apologetical books during his youthful studies; how Abbadie,
          Leslie, Huet, Turretine, Grotius, Littleton, Jennings, Ranhardt, and
          Chalmers formed his habitual reading; and how, while tormented with a
          thousand doubts, he came at last to be convinced and satisfied only by
          the word itself of the Scriptures. That word gives testimony to
          itself, not only by its assertions, but by its effects, like light,
          like heat, like life, like health; for it carries in its beams health,
          life, heat, and light. A man might prove to me, by correct
          calculations, that at this moment the sun ought to be above the
          horizon; but can I have any need of these, if my eye behold him, if I
          am bathed in his beams and invigorated by them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the Bible, then; do not be learned by halves; let every thing
          have its proper place. It is the Bible that will convince you. It will
          tell you whether it came from God. And when you shall have heard a
          voice there, sometimes more powerful than the sound of mighty waters,
          sometimes soft and still as the sound that fell on the ear of Elijah:
          "The Lord, merciful and compassionate, the God who is pitiful, slow to
          wrath, abundant in mercy, the God of all consolation, the God who
          pardons so much, and more!!" … ah, then, we venture to tell you
          beforehand, that the simple reading of a psalm, of a story, of a
          precept, of a verse, of a word in a verse, will, erelong, attest the
          divine inspiration of all the Scriptures to you more powerfully than
          could have been done by all the most solid reasonings of doctors or of
          books. Then you will see, you will know by experience, that God is
          every where in the Scriptures; then you will not ask of them if they
          are inspired; for you will feel them to be quick and powerful
          searchers of the thoughts and desires of the heart, sharper than any
          two-edged sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of your soul and
          spirit, and of your joints and marrow, causing your tears to flow from
          a deep and unknown source, overthrowing you with resistless power, and
          raising you up again with such a tenderness, and such sympathies, as
          are found only in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this is as yet mere advice; but we proceed to show in what
          respect, nevertheless, these considerations may be presented, if not
          as a proof, at least as a strong presumption, in favour of the
          inspiration of the very words of Scripture. In them, in fact, we
          indicate to our readers a threefold experience, which at all times has
          borne the fruit of profound convictions among other Christians, and
          the testimony rendered by which ought, at least, to strike them as
          demanding the most serious consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the strongest proofs, no doubt, of the divine authority of the
          Scriptures, is that majesty of theirs which fills us with respect and
          awe; it is the imposing unity of that book, the composition of which
          extends over a period of fifteen hundred years, and which has had so
          many authors, some of whom wrote no less than two centuries before the
          fabulous times of Hercules, Jason, and the Argonauts; others in the
          heroic days of Priam, Achilles, and Agamemnon; others in the days of
          Thales and Pythagoras; others in the age of Seneca, Tacitus, Plutarch,
          Tiberius, and Domitian; and who all, nevertheless, pursue one and the
          same plan, constantly advancing, as if they had all understood each
          other, towards one sole grand end, the history of the world's
          redemption by the Son of God; it is this vast harmony of all the
          Scriptures; this Old Testament filled with Jesus Christ, as well as
          the New; this universal history, which nothing stops, which tells of
          the revolutions of empire to the end of time, and which, when its
          scenes of the past have come to a close, continues them onward with
          those of the future, until the moment arrive when all the world's
          empires shall have become the possession of Jesus Christ and his
          saints:—at the first page, the earth created for the reception of
          sinless man; in the following pages, the earth cursed for the
          reception of man ever sinning; at the last page, a new earth for the
          reception of man who will never sin more!—at the first page, the tree
          of life interdicted, paradise lost, sin entering into the world by the
          first Adam, and death by sin; at the last page, paradise found again,
          life again entering into the world by the second Adam, death
          vanquished, no more sorrow to be found, God's image restored in man,
          and the tree of life in the midst of the paradise of God. Assuredly
          there is in this majestic whole, commencing before there were men, and
          continued on to the end of time, a powerful and altogether heavenly
          unity; a convergence of long ages, universal, immense, whose grandeur
          captivates thought, transcends all our human conceptions, and
          proclaims its Author's divinity as irresistibly as, on a summer night,
          the view of a sky glittering with stars, and the thought of all those
          shining worlds which revolve night and day in the immensity of space.
          "Myriads of things in perfect intimacy and symphony," says one of the
          earliest fathers of the Church. And yet, over and above the beauties
          presented by the Scriptures, viewed thus as a whole, we have to
          contemplate something not less glorious, which reveals to us also the
          divine action in their smallest parts, and attests to us their verbal
          inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three orders of persons, or rather three orders of experiences,
          testify to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And first, if you consult ministers who have spent their whole
          lives in meditating on the Scriptures, with the view of finding daily
          nourishment from them for the Lord's flocks, they will tell you that
          the more they have given themselves to this blessed study, and have
          set themselves to look more narrowly into the oracles of God, the more
          also has their admiration of the letter of that Word increased.
          Surprised, as they proceed, by unexpected beauties, they have
          recognised in these, even in the most minute expressions, instances of
          divine foresight, profound mutual bearings, spiritual grandeurs which
          reveal themselves there by the sole fact of a more exact translation,
          or of the attention of the mind being longer directed to the detail of
          a single verse. They will tell you that the man of God who keeps for
          some time close to the eyes of his soul some text of that holy book,
          soon feels himself called to adopt the language of the naturalist who,
          with the microscope, studies a leaf from the forest, with its
          integuments, its nerves, its thousand pores, and its thousand vessels.
          He that made the forest made the leaf! he exclaims; yes, says the
          other, and he who made the Bible, made its verses also!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A second order of experiences, of which we would here cite the
          testimony, is that of the interpreters of the prophecies. All of them
          will tell you with what evidence, after one has bestowed some time on
          that study, it is perceived that in these miraculous pages every
          verse, every word, without any exception, and even down to apparently
          the most indifferent particle, must have been guaranteed by God. The
          slightest alteration in a verb, in an adverb, or even in the simplest
          conjunction, might lead an interpreter into the most serious error.
          And it has often been remarked, that if the prophecies that are now
          fulfilled were ill understood before the event, this arose, in a great
          measure, from the circumstance that people had not examined, with
          sufficient attention, all the details of their text. Of this we might
          adduce many examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But there is yet another order of persons who attest to us more
          loudly, if possible, the divine inspiration of the Scriptures, even in
          their smallest parts; these are Christians who have experienced their
          power, first in their conversion, and afterwards in the conflicts that
          followed. Go, and in the biographies of those who have been great in
          the kingdom of God, look for the moment at which they passed from
          death unto life; inquire, around you, about the same fact, of the
          Christians who in their turn have experienced this virtue of the Word
          of God: they will all bear one unanimous testimony. When the holy
          Scripture, overmastering their conscience, made them lie low at the
          foot of the cross, and there revealed to them the love of God, what
          seized hold of them was not the Bible as a whole, it was not a
          chapter, it was a verse; aye, a word, which was for them like the
          humble and powerful knob of the electric pile, the disks of which
          should mount to heaven, or, as it were, the point of a sword wielded
          by the very hand of God. They found it quick and powerful. It was an
          influence from above which was concentrated in a single word, and
          which made it become for them, "as a fire, saith the Lord, and as a
          hammer that breaketh the stone." They perused, in the moment of their
          need, a psalm, or some words of the prophets, or some sentences from
          the epistles, or some narratives of sacred history; and as they were
          reading, behold, a word seized their conscience with an unknown,
          sweeping, irresistible force. It was no more than a single word, but
          that word remained upon their soul; there it spoke, there it preached,
          there it resounded, as if all the church bells of the city of God had
          been struck to call him to fasting, to the bending of the knee, to
          prayer, to meeting with Jesus Christ! It was but a word, but that word
          was from God. It was but one of apparently the meanest chords of the
          harp from heaven; but that chord was so stretched as to be in unison
          with the heart of man; it gave forth unexpected sounds, all-powerful
          harmonies, which stirred their inmost souls; and then they felt that
          those tones are miraculous, that those harmonies proceed from heaven.
          They knew it to be the call of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, then, is the voice of the Church; such has been in every age the
          unanimous testimony of the saints. The inspiration which the Bible
          attributes to itself, they have said, we ourselves have experienced.
          We believe it, no doubt, because it attests it; but we believe it also
          because we have seen it, and because we ourselves can bear to it the
          testimony of a blessed experience, and of an irresistible impulse of
          feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          One might adduce such examples by thousands. Let us be content to name
          here two of the noblest minds that have ever served as guides to
          humanity. Let the reader call to his recollection how the two greatest
          lights of ancient and modern times were kindled. It was a word—a
          single word of the Scriptures—which, just at the moment that had been
          prepared by God, put into their souls the light of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luther, while as yet a monk, went off to Rome. He lay ill a-bed at
          Bologna, in a foreign land, overwhelmed with the burden of his guilt,
          and believing himself to be at the gates of death. It was then that
          the 17th verse of the 1st chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
          "Justus ex fide vivet"—"the just shall live by faith"—came like a beam
          from heaven, and enlightened his whole being. These simple words
          seized him twice with a superhuman power; first at Bologna, there to
          fill him with inexpressible energy and peace; after that at Rome
          itself, there to check and elevate him, while with an idolatrous crowd
          he dragged himself on both knees up Pilate's fabulous staircase. It
          was with these words that the Reformation of the West commenced.
          "Words of creative power for the Reformer and the Reformation,"
          exclaims on this subject my precious friend Merle D'Aubigné. It was by
          them that God then said, "Let there be light, and there was light."
          "In truth," says the Reformer himself, "I felt as if entirely born
          again; and these words were for me the very gate of paradise." "Hic me
          prorsus renatum esse sensi, et apertis portis in ipsum paradisum
          intrasse."

          Here, too, shall we not call to mind the greatest of the doctors of
          Christian antiquity (the admirable Augustine), when, in his garden
          near Milan, wretched, ill at ease, feeling, as Luther felt, a tempest
          in his soul, as he reclined under a fig-tree, "jactans voces
          miserabiles et dimittens habenas lacrymis," groaning, and giving vent
          to a flood of tears, he heard from an adjoining house that youthful
          voice, which sang, with a rapid repetition of the burthen of the song:
          "Tolle, lege! tolle, lege!" "Take and read; take and read!" He went
          off to the neighbourhood of Alypius for the roll of the Epistles of
          Paul, which he had left there; (adripui, aperui et legi in
          silentio)—he grasped it, opened it, and read in silence the first
          chapter that caught his eye. And when he came to the 13th verse of the
          13. chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, then all was decided by a
          word. Jesus had overcome: the grand career of the holiest of the
          doctors began its course. A word, but a word from God, had lighted up
          that mighty beacon which was to illuminate ten centuries of the
          church's existence, and whose rays delight her still. After thirty-one
          years of revolt, of conflicts, of relapses, of wretchedness, faith,
          life, peace had descended into that loving soul; a new light, but an
          everlasting light, had risen upon it. After these words, he wanted
          nothing more; he shut the book, he tells us; he no longer felt doubt.
          "Nec ultrà volui legere, nec opus erat;" for with the close of that
          sentence, a stream of light and security was poured into his soul; and
          all the night of his doubts had vanished. "Statim quippe cum fine
          hujus sententiæ, quasi luce securitatis infusa cordi meo, omnes
          dubitationis tenebræ diffugerunt!"

          There is one experience more of the same kind with which we have been
          too deeply struck not to refer to it in these pages, although its
          testimony may probably be admitted by those only who are already pious
          men. The farther a man advances in the Christian life—the more
          abundant the measure he receives of God's Spirit—the more, also, you
          must have observed what, in two contrary senses, on the one hand, our
          sacred books, and, on the other, the best writings of men, become for
          him. While you will see him ever more and more independent of the
          latter, because more fully aware that they have hardly any thing more
          to teach him, or at least, because, after having read them once, he
          has received all that they have to give him, mark with admiration how
          very much otherwise it is for him with respect to the divine sayings,
          and with what a marvellous contrast he is seen to be ever more
          attached to the letter of the Scriptures, ever more convinced of the
          wisdom that is revealed there, and of the divine power put forth
          there, ever more eager to drink in their slightest expressions, ever
          more capable of deriving delicious nourishment, for whole days and
          nights, from a single passage, and from a single verse! Certainly,
          there is in this fact, to the person who has witnessed it, something
          peculiarly striking. We ourselves have seen it.

          Such, then, is the triple testimony which we would invoke, and by
          which the Church attests to us that an influence from God has been
          infused into the smallest parts of the sacred Word, in such wise, that
          "all Scripture is divinely inspired."

          We must, however, be properly understood. We have made no pretension
          here to impose upon some the experience of others. Proofs from
          feeling, are proofs to those alone who have felt. They have, no doubt,
          an irresistible force for men who, having experienced them, have seen
          the testimonies of the Word confirmed in them with unquestionable
          evidence; but nothing would be less logical than to offer them as
          demonstrations to souls who are strangers to them. If you have had
          these experiences, you will be more than convinced, and we should have
          no more to say to you. Accordingly, we have presented them only as
          strong historical presumptions, to dispose you in this way to receive
          with readier submission the Scriptural proofs already put before you.
          A whole multitude of well-informed and pious persons, we say, attest
          to you for ages past, and by a threefold experience, that in the close
          study of the Word of God, one is brought to recognise, on the clearest
          evidence, its inspiration, even in its words. Let this act, at least,
          as a powerful recommendation to listen with respect and candour to the
          testimonies in which the Bible itself has told you what it is. At
          least, let this voice of the church call to you, as it were, from an
          adjoining house, Take and read, take and read! adripe, aperi, lege in
          silentio! Read it in silence; and you yourself will feel how far its
          inspiration goes. No more doubt, you will say, like Augustine; for the
          morning star has risen in my heart; and you will not need to read
          more. Nec ultrà voles legere, nec opus erit; statim quippe cum fine
          unius sententiæ, quasi luce securitatis infusa cordi tuo, omnes
          dubitationis tenebræ diffugient!
