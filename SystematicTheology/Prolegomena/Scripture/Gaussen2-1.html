        <h2>I. All Scripture is Divinely Inspired</h2>
        <p>
          We shall commence by reproducing here that oft-repeated passage, 2
          Tim. 3:16, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God;" that is to
          say, all parts of it are given by the Spirit or by the breath of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This statement admits of no exception and of no restriction. Here
          there is no exception; it is ALL SCRIPTURE; it is all that is written
          (πᾶσα γραφὴ); meaning thereby the thoughts after they have received
          the stamp of language.—No restriction; all Scripture is in such wise a
          work of God, that it is represented to us as uttered by the divine
          breathing, just as human speech is uttered by the breathing of a man's
          mouth. The prophet is the mouth of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purport of this declaration of St Paul remains the same in both
          the constructions that may be put upon his words, whether we place, as
          our versions do, the affirmation of the phrase on the word θεόπνευστος
          (divinely inspired), and suppose the verb to be understood (all
          Scripture is divinely inspired, profitable …); or, making the verb
          apply to the words that follow, we understand θεόπνευστος (divinely
          inspired) only as a determinative adjective (all Scripture divinely
          inspired of God, is profitable …).—This last construction would even
          give more force than the first to the apostle's declaration. For then,
          as his statement would necessarily relate to the whole Scripture of
          the holy Letters (τὰ ἱερὰ γράμματα), of which he had been speaking,
          would assume, as an admitted and incontestable principle, that the
          simple mention of the holy Letters implies of itself that Scriptures
          inspired by God are meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless it will be proper to give a farther expression of this
          same truth, by some other declaration of our holy books.
