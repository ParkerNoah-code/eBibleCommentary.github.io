        <p>
          <b>§ 5. Perspicuity of Scripture. The Right of Private Judgment</b>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          The Bible is a plain book. It is intelligible by the people. And they
          have the right, and are bound to read and interpret it for themselves;
          so that their faith may rest on the testimony of the Scriptures, and
          not on that of the Church. Such is the doctrine of Protestants on this
          subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not denied that the Scriptures contain many things hard to be
          understood; that they require diligent study; that all men need the
          guidance of the Holy Spirit in order to right knowledge and true
          faith. But it is maintained that in all things necessary to salvation
          they are sufficiently plain to be understood even by the unlearned.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not denied that the people, learned and unlearned, in order to
          the proper understanding of the Scriptures, should not only compare
          Scripture with Scripture, and avail themselves of all the means in
          their power to aid them in their search after the truth, but they
          should also pay the greatest deference to the faith of the Church. If
          the Scriptures be a plain book, and the Spirit performs the functions
          of a teacher to all the children of God, it follows inevitably that
          they must agree in all essential matters in their interpretation of
          the Bible. And from that fact it follows that for an individual
          Christian to dissent from the faith of the universal Church (i.e., the
          body of true believers), is tantamount to dissenting from the
          Scriptures themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          What Protestants deny on this subject is, that Christ has appointed
          any officer, or class of officers, in his Church to whose
          interpretation of the Scriptures the people are bound to submit as of
          final authority. What they affirm is that He has made it obligatory
          upon every man to search the Scriptures for himself, and determine on
          his own discretion what they require him to believe and to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arguments in support of the former of these positions have already
          been presented in the discussion concerning the infallibility of the
          Church. The most obvious reasons in support of the right of private
          judgment are,—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the obligations to faith and obedience are personal. Every man
          is responsible for his religious faith and his moral conduct. He
          cannot transfer that responsibility to others; nor can others assume
          it in his stead. He must answer for himself; and if he must answer for
          himself, he must judge for himself. It will not avail him in the day
          of judgment to say that his parents or his Church taught him wrong. He
          should have listened to God, and obeyed Him rather than men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Scriptures are everywhere addressed to the people, and not to
          the officers of the Church either exclusively, or specially. The
          prophets were sent to the people, and constantly said, "Hear, O
          Israel," "Hearken, O ye people." Thus, also, the discourses of Christ
          were addressed to the people, and the people heard him gladly. All the
          Epistles of the New Testament are addressed to the congregation, to
          the "called of Jesus Christ;" "to the beloved of God;" to those
          "called to be saints;" "to the sanctified in Christ Jesus;" "to all
          who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord;" "to the saints which
          are in (Ephesus), and to the faithful in Jesus Christ;" or "to the
          saints and faithful brethren which are in (Colosse);" and so in every
          instance. It is the people who are addressed. To them are directed
          these profound discussions of Christian doctrine, and these
          comprehensive expositions of Christian duty. They are everywhere
          assumed to be competent to understand what is written, and are
          everywhere required to believe and obey what thus came from the
          inspired messengers of Christ. They were not referred to any other
          authority from which they were to learn the true import of these
          inspired instructions. It is, therefore, not only to deprive the
          people of a divine right, to forbid the people to read and interpret
          the Scriptures for themselves; but it is also to interpose between
          them and God, and to prevent their hearing his voice, that they may
          listen to the words of men.
        </p>
        <p>The People commanded to search the Scriptures</p>
        <p>
          3. The Scriptures are not only addressed to the people, but the people
          were called upon to study them, and to teach them unto their children.
          It was one of the most frequently recurring injunctions to parents
          under the old dispensation, to teach the Law unto their children, that
          they again might teach it unto theirs. The "holy oracles" were
          committed to the people, to be taught by the people; and taught
          immediately out of the Scriptures, that the truth might be retained in
          its purity. Thus our Lord commanded the people to search the
          Scriptures, saying, "They are they which testify of me." (John 5:39.)
          He assumed that they were able to understand what the Old Testament
          said of the Messiah, although its teachings had been misunderstood by
          the scribes and elders, and by the whole Sanhedrim. Paul rejoiced that
          Timothy had from his youth known the Holy Scriptures, which were able
          to make him wise unto salvation. He said to the Galatians (1:8, 9),
          "Though we, or an angel from heaven,—if any man preach any other
          gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed." This
          implies two things,— first, that the Galatian Christians, the people,
          had a right to sit in judgment on the teaching of an Apostle, or of an
          angel from heaven; and secondly, that they had an infallible rule by
          which that judgment was to be determined, namely, a previous
          authenticated revelation of God. If, then, the Bible recognizes the
          right of the people to judge of the teaching of Apostles and angels,
          they are not to be denied the right of judging of the doctrines of
          bishops and priests. The principle laid down by the Apostle is
          precisely that long before given by Moses (Deut. 13:1–3), who tells
          the people that if a prophet should arise, although he worked wonders,
          they were not to believe or obey him, if he taught them anything
          contrary to the Word of God. This again assumes that the people had
          the ability and the right to judge, and that they had an infallible
          rule of judgment. It implies, moreover, that their salvation depended
          upon their judging rightly. For if they allowed these false teachers,
          robed in sacred vestments, and surrounded by the insignia of
          authority, to lead them from the truth, they would inevitably perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It need hardly be remarked that this right of private judgment is
          the great safeguard of civil and religious liberty. If the Bible be
          admitted to be the infallible rule of faith and practice in accordance
          with which men are bound on the peril of their souls, to frame their
          creed and conduct; and if there be a set of men who have the exclusive
          right of interpreting the Scripture, and who are authorized to impose
          their interpretations on the people as of divine authority, then they
          may impose on them what conditions of salvation they see fit. And the
          men who have the salvation of the people in their hands are their
          absolute masters. Both reason and experience fully sustain the dictum
          of Chillingworth, when he says, "He that would usurp an absolute
          lordship and tyranny over any people, need not put himself to the
          trouble and difficulty of abrogating and disannulling the laws, made
          to maintain the common liberty; for he may frustrate their intent, and
          compass his own design as well, if he can get the power and authority
          to interpret them as he pleases, and add to them what he pleases, and
          to have his interpretations and additions stand for laws; if he can
          rule his people by his laws, and his laws by his lawyers." This is
          precisely what the Church of Rome has done, and thereby established a
          tyranny for which there is no parallel in the history of the world.
          What renders this tyranny the more intolerable, is, that, so far as
          the mass of the people is concerned, it resolves itself into the
          authority of the parish priest. He is the arbiter of the faith and
          morals of his people. No man can believe unless the ground of faith is
          present to his mind. If the people are to believe that the Scriptures
          teach certain doctrines, then they must have the evidence that such
          doctrines are really taught in the Bible. If that evidence be that the
          Church so interprets the sacred writings, then the people must know
          what is the Church, i.e., which of the bodies claiming to be the
          Church, is entitled to be so regarded. How are the people, the
          uneducated masses, to determine that question? The priest tells them.
          If they receive his testimony on that point, then how can they tell
          how the Church interprets the Scriptures? Here again they must take
          the word of the priest. Thus the authority of the Church as an
          interpreter, which appears so imposing, resolves itself into the
          testimony of the priest, who is often wicked, and still oftener
          ignorant. This cannot be the foundation of the faith of God's elect.
          That foundation is the testimony of God himself speaking his word, and
          authenticated as divine by the testimony of the Spirit with and by the
          truth in the heart of the believer.
