        <h2>I. Catechetical Sketch of the Main Points of the Doctrine</h2>
        <p><b>I. What, then, are we to understand by divine inspiration?</b></p>
        <p>
          Divine inspiration is the mysterious power put forth by the Spirit of
          God on the authors of holy writ, to make them write it, to guide them
          even in the employment of the words they use, and thus to preserve
          them from all error?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >II. What are we told of the spiritual power put forth on the men of
            God while they were writing their sacred books?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told that they were led or moved (φἐρόμενοι) "not by the will
          of man, but by the Holy Ghost; so that they set forth the things of
          God, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy
          Ghost teacheth." "God," says the apostle,2 "spake BY THE PROPHETS at
          sundry times, and in divers manners (πολυμερῶς και πολυτρόπως);"
          sometimes enabling them to understand what he made them say; sometimes
          without doing so; sometimes by dreams and by visions which he
          afterwards made them relate; sometimes by giving them words internally
          (λόγῳ ἐνδιάθετῳ), which he caused them immediately to utter; sometimes
          by words transmitted to them externally (λὁγῳ προφόρικῳ), which he
          caused them to repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >III. But what passed in their hearts and minds while they were
            writing?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This we cannot tell. It is a fact which, subject besides to great
          varieties, could not be for us an object either of scientific inquiry
          or of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >IV. Have not modern authors, however, who have written on this
            subject, often distinguished in the Scriptures three or four degrees
            of inspiration (superintendence, elevation, direction,
            suggestion)?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This is but idle conjecture; and the supposition, besides, is in
          contradiction with the Word of God, which knows but one kind of
          inspiration. Here, there is none true but suggestion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >V. Do we not see, however, that the men of God were profoundly
            acquainted, and often even profoundly affected, with the sacred
            things which they taught, with the future things which they
            predicted, with the past things which they related?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt they might be so—nay, in most instances they were so—but they
          might not have been so; this happened in different measures, of which
          the degree remains to us unknown, and the knowledge of which is not
          required of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >VI. What then must we think of those definitions of divine
            inspiration, in which Scripture seems to be represented as the
            altogether human expression of a revelation altogether divine;—
            what, for example, must we think of that of Baumgarten, who says,
            that inspiration is but the means by which revelation, at first
            immediate, became mediate, and took the form of a book (medium quo
            revelatio immediata, mediata facta, inque libros relata est)?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          These definitions are not exact, and may give rise to false notions of
          inspiration. I say they are not exact. They contradict facts.
          Immediate revelation does not necessarily precede inspiration; and
          when it precedes it, it is not its measure. The empty air prophesied;
          a hand coming forth from a wall wrote the words of God;3 a dumb animal
          reproved the madness of a prophet. Balaam prophesied without any
          desire to do so; and the believers of Corinth did so without even
          knowing the meaning of the words put by the Holy Ghost on their lips.5
        </p>
        <p>
          I would next observe, that these definitions produce or conceal false
          notions of inspiration. In fact, they assume its being nothing more
          than the natural expression of a supernatural revelation; and that the
          men of God had merely of themselves, and in a human way, to put down
          in their books what the Holy Ghost made them see in a divine way, in
          their understandings. But inspiration is more than this. Scripture is
          not the mind of God elaborated by the understanding of man, to be
          promulgated in the words of man; it is at once the mind of God and the
          word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >VII. The Holy Ghost having in all ages illuminated God's elect, and
            having moreover distributed miraculous powers among them in ancient
            times, in which of these two orders of spiritual gifts ought we to
            rank inspiration?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We must rank it among the extraordinary and wholly miraculous gifts.
          The Holy Ghost in all ages enlightens the elect by his powerful inward
          virtue; he testifies to them of Christ; gives them the unction of the
          Holy One; teaches them all things, and convinces them of all truth.2
          But, besides these ordinary gifts of illumination and faith, the same
          Spirit shed extraordinary ones on the men who were commissioned to
          promulgate and to write the oracles of God. Divine inspiration was one
          of those gifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >VIII. Is the difference, then, between illumination and inspiration
            a difference of kind or only of degree?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>It is a difference of kind, and not of degree only.</p>
        <p>
          <b
            >IX. Nevertheless, did not the apostles, besides inspiration,
            receive from the Holy Ghost illumination in extraordinary measure,
            and in its most eminent degree?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In its most eminent degree, is what none can affirm; in an
          extraordinary degree, is what none can contradict.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Paul, for example, did not receive the gospel from any
          man, but by a revelation from Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wrote "ALL HIS EPISTLES," St Peter tells us, not only in words
          taught by the Holy Ghost,3 as had been the OTHER SCRIPTURES (of the
          old Testament), but according to a wisdom which had been given to him.
          He had the knowledge of the mystery of Christ.5 Jesus Christ had
          promised to give his disciples not only "a mouth, but wisdom to
          testify of him." David, when he seemed to speak only of himself in the
          Psalms, KNEW that it was of the Messiah that his words were to be
          understood: "Being a prophet, and knowing that of the fruit of his
          loins, according to the flesh, God would raise up Christ to sit on his
          throne."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >X. Why, then, should we not say that divine inspiration is but
            illumination in its most exalted and abundant measure?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We must beware of saying so; for thus we should have but a narrow,
          confused, contingent, and constantly fluctuating idea of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>In fact,—</p>
        <p>
          1. God, who often conjoined those two gifts in one man, often also saw
          fit to disjoin them, in order that he might give us to understand that
          they essentially differ, the one from the other, and that, when
          united, they are independent. Every true Christian has the Holy Ghost,
          but every Christian is not inspired, and such an one who utters the
          words of God, may not have received either life-giving affections or
          life-giving light.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It may be demonstrated by a great many examples, that the one of
          these gifts was not the measure of the other; and that the divine
          inspiration of the prophets did not observe the ratio of their
          knowledge, any more than that of their holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Far, indeed, from the one of those gifts being the measure of the
          other, one may even say that divine inspiration appeared all the more
          strikingly the more that the illumination of the sacred writer
          remained in arrear of his illumination. When you behold the very
          prophets, who were most enlightened by God's Spirit, bending over
          their own pages after having written them, and endeavouring to
          comprehend the meaning which the Spirit in them had caused them to
          express, it should become manifest to you that their divine
          inspiration was independent of their illumination.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Even supposing the prophet's illumination raised to its utmost
          pitch, still it did not reach the altitude of the divine idea, and
          there might be much more meaning in the word dictated to them than the
          prophet was yet cognisant of. David, doubtless, in hymning his psalms,
          knew that they referred to "Him who was to be born of his loins, to
          sit upon his throne for ever." Most of the prophets, like Abraham
          their father, saw the day of Christ, and when they saw it, were glad;2
          they searched what the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, did
          signify, when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of the
          Messiah, and the glory that should follow. Yet notwithstanding all
          this, our Lord attests to us that the simplest Christian, the least
          (in knowledge) in the kingdom of God, knows more on that subject than
          the greatest of the prophets.4
        </p>
        <p>
          5. These gifts differ from each other in essential characters, which
          we will presently describe.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Finally, it is always the inspiration of the book that is presented
          to us as an object of faith, never the inward state of him that writes
          it. His knowledge or ignorance nowise affects the confidence I owe to
          his words; and my soul ought ever to look not so much to the lights of
          his understanding as to the God of all holiness, who speaks to me by
          his mouth. The Saviour desired, it is true, that most of those who
          related his history should also have been witnesses of what they
          related. This was, no doubt, in order that the world might listen to
          them with the greater confidence, and might not start reasonable
          doubts as to the truth of their narratives. But the Church, in her
          faith, looks much higher than this: to her the intelligence of the
          writers is imperfectly known, and a matter of comparative
          indifference—what she does know is their inspiration. It is never in
          the breast of the prophet that she goes to look for its source; it is
          in that of her God. "Christ speaks in me," says St Paul, "and God hath
          spoken to our fathers in the prophets." "Why look ye so earnestly on
          us," say to her all the sacred writers, "as though by our own power or
          holiness we had done this work?"2 Look upwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XI. If there exist, then, between these two spiritual graces of
            illumination and inspiration a specific difference, in what must we
            say that it consists?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Though you should find it impossible to say what that difference is,
          you would not the less be obliged by the preceding reasons to declare
          that it does exist. In order to be able fully to reply to this
          question, it were necessary that you should know the nature and the
          mode of both these gifts; whereas the Holy Ghost has never explained
          to us, either how he infuses God's thoughts into the understanding of
          a believer, or how he puts God's words into the mouth of a prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, we can here point out two essential characters by which
          these two operations of the Holy Ghost have always shown themselves to
          be distinct: the one of these characters relates to their duration,
          the other to their measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In point of duration, illumination is continuous, whereas inspiration
          is intermittent. In point of measure, illumination admits of degrees,
          whereas inspiration does not admit of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XII. What are we to understand by saying that illumination is
            continuous, and inspiration intermittent?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The illumination of a believer by the Holy Ghost is a permanent work.
          Having commenced for him on the day of his new birth, it goes on
          increasing, and attends him with its rays to the termination of his
          course. That light, no doubt, is but too much obscured by his acts of
          faithlessness and negligence, but never more will it leave him
          altogether. "His path," says the wise man, "is like the shining light,
          shining more and more unto the perfect day." "When it pleased God, who
          separated me from my mother's womb, to reveal his Son in me,"2 he
          preserves to the end the knowledge of the mystery of Jesus Christ, and
          can at all times set forth its truths and its glories. As it was not
          flesh and blood that had revealed these things to him, but the Father,
          that unction which he received from the Holy One4 abides in him, says
          St John, and he needs not that any man teach him; but as the same
          anointing teacheth him of all things, and is truth, so, even as he
          hath been taught by it, he will remain in it. Illumination, therefore,
          abideth on the faithful; but it is not so with miraculous gifts, nor
          with the divine inspiration, which is one of those gifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for miraculous gifts, they were always intermittent with the men of
          God, if we except the only man who "received not the Spirit by
          measure." The apostle Paul, for example, who at one time restored
          Eutychus to life, and by whom God wrought such special miracles7 (so
          as that it sufficed that handkerchiefs and aprons should touch his
          body and be laid upon the sick, in order to cures being effected); at
          other times could not relieve either his colleague Trophimus or his
          beloved Epaphroditus, or his son Timothy. It is the same with
          inspiration, which is only the most excellent of miraculous gifts. In
          the Lord's prophets, it was exerted only by intervals. The prophets,
          and even the apostles, who (as we shall show) were prophets, and more
          than prophets,2 did not prophesy as often as they pleased. Inspiration
          was sent to them by intervals; it came upon them according as the Holy
          Ghost saw fit to give it to them (καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου αὐτοῖς
          ἀποφθέγγεσθαι); for "never did prophecy come by the will of man," says
          St Peter;4 "but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
          Ghost." God spake in the prophets (ἐν τοῖς προφήταις), says St Paul,
          when he wished to do so, at sundry times (πολυμερῶς), as well as in
          divers manners (πολυτρόπως). On such a day, and at such a time, it is
          often written, "the word of Jehovah was upon such a man (אליו דבר־יחוה
          ויהי)." "In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, the
          word of Jehovah came to me," said the prophet. In the fifteenth year
          of the reign of Tiberius, the word of the Lord came unto John, the son
          of Zacharias (ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰωάννην); and on the eighth day,
          Zacharias, his father, was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied,
          saying, …7
        </p>
        <p>
          So then we ought not to imagine that the divine infallibility of the
          language of the prophets (and even of the apostles), lasted longer
          than the times in which they were engaged in their miraculous task,
          and in which the Spirit caused them to speak. Without divine
          inspiration, they were in most instances enlightened, sanctified, and
          preserved by God, as holy and faithful men in our own days may still
          be; but then they no more spoke as moved by the Holy Ghost;—"their
          language might still be worthy of the most respectful attention; but
          it was a holy man that spoke; it was no longer God: they again became
          fallible."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XIII. Can any examples be adduced of this fallibility being
            attached to their language, when unaccompanied with Divine
            inspiration?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A multitude of instances occur. Men are often, after having been for a
          time the mouth of the Lord, seen to become false prophets, and
          mendaciously to pretend to utter the words of Jehovah, after the
          Spirit had ceased to speak in them; "although the Lord sent them not,
          neither commanded them, neither spake unto them." "They speak a vision
          of their own heart, not out of the mouth of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          But without referring to those wicked men, or to the profane Saul, or
          to Balaam, who were for some time numbered among the prophets, shall
          it be thought that all the words of king David were infallible during
          the course of that long year which he passed in adultery? Yet "these,"
          saith the Scripture, "be the last words of David, the sweet psalmist
          of Israel: THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD SPAKE BY ME, AND HIS WORD WAS IN MY
          TONGUE." Shall it be thought that all the words of the prophet Solomon
          still continued infallible, when he fell into idolatry in his old age,
          and the salvation of his soul became a problem for the Church of God?
          And to come down to Christ's holy apostles and prophets (Eph. 3:5),
          shall it be thought that all the words of Paul himself were
          infallible, and that he still could say that "Christ spoke by him"
          when there was a sharp contention (παροξυσμὸς) betwixt him and
          Barnabas; or when, in the midst of the council, under a mistaken
          impression with regard to the person of the High Priest, he "spoke
          evil of the Ruler of his people," and cried, "God shall strike thee,
          thou whited wall;" or further (since there may remain some doubt as to
          the character of this reprimand), shall it be thought that all the
          words of the apostle St Peter were infallible, when, at Antioch, he
          showed himself "so much to be blamed" (κατεγνωσμένος); when he feared
          those that came from St James; when he dissembled; and when he forced
          the apostle St Paul "to withstand him to his face before them all,
          because he walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel
          (οὐκ ἦν ὀρθοποδήσας)?"

            >XIV. What, then, are we to conclude from this first difference
            which we have recognised as existing between illumination and
            inspiration, with respect to the duration of those gifts?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>We must conclude from it,</p>
        <p>
          1. That these two operations of the Holy Ghost differ in their
          essence, and not in their degree only.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the infallibility of the sacred writers depended not on their
          illumination (which, although raised to an extraordinary measure in
          the case of some of them, they nevertheless enjoyed in common with all
          the saints), but solely on their divine inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That divinely-inspired words, having been miraculous, are also all
          of them the words of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That as our faith in every part of the Bible rests no longer on the
          illumination of the writers, but on the inspiration of their writings,
          it may dispense henceforth with the perplexing study of their internal
          state, of the degree in which they were enlightened, or of that of
          their holiness; but must stay itself in all things on God, in nothing
          on man.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XV. If such have been the difference between illumination and
            inspiration in the prophets and the apostles, as respects the
            duration of those gifts, what has it been as respects their
            measure?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Illumination is susceptible of degrees; inspiration does not admit of
          them. A prophet is more or less enlightened by God; but what he says
          is not more or less inspired. It is so, or it is not so; it is from
          God, or it is not from God; here there is neither measure nor degree,
          neither increase nor diminution. David was enlightened by God; John
          Baptist more than David; a simple Christian possibly more than John
          Baptist; an apostle was more enlightened than that Christian, and
          Jesus Christ more than that apostle. But the inspired word of David,
          what do I say? the inspired word of Balaam himself is that of God, as
          was that of John Baptist, as was that of St Paul, as was that of Jesus
          Christ! IT IS THE WORD OF GOD. The most enlightened of the saints
          cannot speak by inspiration, whilst the most wicked, the most
          ignorant, and the most impure of men, may speak not of his own will
          (ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ ὀυκ ἐιπεῖν), but by inspiration (ἀλλὰ προφητεύσαι.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In a man who is truly regenerated, there is always the divine spirit
          and the human spirit, which operate at once—the one enlightening, the
          other darkening; and the illumination will be so much the greater, the
          more that of the divine Spirit surpasses that of the human spirit. In
          the prophets, and, above all, in the apostles, these two elements also
          are to be found. But, thanks be to God, our faith in the words of
          Scripture nowise depends on the unknown issue of that combat which was
          waged between the Spirit and the flesh in the soul of the sacred
          writers. Our faith goes directly to the heart of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XVI. Can much harm result from the doctrine according to which the
            language of inspiration would be no more than the human expression
            of a superhuman revelation, and, so to speak, of a natural
            reflection of a supernatural illumination?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          One or other of two evils will always result from it; either the
          oracles of God will be brought down to the level of the words of the
          saints, or these last will be raised to the level of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a deplorable consequence, the alternative involved in which
          has been reproduced in all ages. It became unavoidable.
        </p>
        <p>
          All truly regenerated men being enlightened by the Holy Ghost, it
          would follow, according to this doctrine, that they would all possess,
          though in different degrees, the element of inspiration; so that,
          according to the arbitrary idea which you would form to yourselves of
          their spiritual condition, you would be led inevitably sometimes to
          assimilate the sacred writers to them, sometimes to raise them to the
          rank of writers inspired from above.

        <p>
          <b
            >XVII. Might religious societies be mentioned in which the former of
            these two evils is realized; I mean to say, where people have been
            led, by this path, to lower the Scriptures to the level of the
            sayings of saints?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          All the systems of the Protestant doctors who assume that there is
          some mixture of error in the Holy Scriptures, are based on this
          doctrine; from Semler and Ammon to Eichhorn, Paulus, Gabler, Schuster,
          and Restig; from M. de Wette to the more respectable systems of
          Michaelis, Rosenmüller, Scaliger, Capellus, John le Clerc, or of
          Vossius. According to these theories, the divine light with which the
          intellects of the sacred writers was enlightened, might suffer some
          partial eclipses, through the inevitable effect of their natural
          infirmities, of a defect of memory, of innocent ignorance, of popular
          prejudice; so that traces of these have remained in their writings,
          and so that we can perceive in these where their shadows have fallen.

          <b
            >XVIII. Might religious societies be mentioned also, where the
            latter of these evils has been consummated; I mean to say, where, in
            consequence of having been willing to confound inspiration with
            illumination, saints and doctors have been elevated to the rank of
            divinely inspired men?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these, two in particular may be mentioned, the Jews and the Latins.
        </p>
        <p><b>XIX. What have the Jews done?</b></p>
        <p>
          They have considered the rabbins of the successive ages of the
          Dispersion as endowed with an infallibility which put them on a level
          with (if not above) Moses and the prophets. They have, to be sure,
          attributed a kind of divine inspiration to holy Scripture; but they
          have prohibited the explanation of its oracles otherwise than
          according to their traditions. They have called the immense body of
          those commandments of men the oral law (פה שבעל תורה), the Doctrine,
          or the Talmud (תלמוד), distinguishing it into the Mishna, or Second
          Law (משנה), and Gémara, complement or perfection (גמרא). They have
          said that it passed from God to Moses, from Moses to Joshua, from
          Joshua to the prophets, from the prophets to Esdras, from Esdras to
          the doctors of the great synagogue, and from them to the rabbins
          Antigone, Soccho, Shemaia, Hillel, Schammai, until at last Juda the
          saint deposited it in the traditions or repetitions of the law
          (משניות, δευτερώσεις), which afterwards, with their commentary or
          complement (the gémara), formed, first, the Talmud of Jerusalem, and
          afterwards that of Babylon.
        </p>
        <p>
          "One of the greatest obstacles that we have to encounter in dealing
          with the Jews," says the missionary MacCaul, "is their invincible
          prejudice in favour of their traditions and of their commentaries, so
          that we cannot prevail on them to buy our Bibles without notes or
          commentaries."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The law they say is salt; the mishna, pepper; the talmuds,
          aromatics:" "the Scripture is water; the mishna, wine; the gémara,
          spiced wine." "My son," says rabbi Isaac, "learn to pay more attention
          to the words of the scribes than to the words of the law." "Turn away
          your children" (said rabbi Eleazar, on his deathbed, to his scholars,
          who asked him the way of life), "turn away your children from the
          study of the Bible, and place them at the feet of the wise." "Learn,
          my son," says the rabbi Jacob, "that the words of the scribes are more
          agreeable than those of the prophets!"
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>XX. And what has been the result of these monstrous principles?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is, that by this means millions and millions of immortal souls,
          although wandering upon the earth, although weary and heavy laden,
          although every where despised and persecuted, have contrived to carry
          the book of the Old Testament, intact and complete, among all the
          nations of the whole world, without ceasing to read it in Hebrew every
          Sabbath, in thousands of synagogues, for the last eighteen hundred
          years, … without, notwithstanding all this, recognising there that
          Jewish Messiah whom we all adore, and the knowledge of whom would be
          at this day their deliverance, as it behoves one day to be their
          happiness and their glory!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Full well," said Jesus to them, "full well ye reject the commandment
          of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."
        </p>
        <p><b>XXI. And what have the Latins done?</b></p>
        <p>
          They have considered the fathers, the popes, and the councils of the
          successive ages of the Roman Church, as endowed with an infallibility
          which puts them on a level with Jesus, the prophets, and the apostles,
          if not above them. They have differed greatly, it is true, from each
          other on the doctrine of the inspiration of the Scriptures; and the
          faculties of Douay and Louvain, for example, have vigorously opposed
          the opinion of the Jesuits, who would see nothing in the operation of
          the Holy Ghost but a direction preserving the sacred writers from
          error; but all have forbidden the explanation of the Scriptures
          otherwise than by their traditions. They have thought themselves
          entitled to say, in all their councils, as did the apostles and
          prophets at Jerusalem, "It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to
          us." They have declared that it appertained to them to pronounce upon
          the true meaning of holy Scripture. They have called the immense body
          of those commandments of men, the oral law, the unwritten traditions,
          the unwritten law. They have said that they have been transmitted by
          God, and dictated by the mouth of Jesus Christ, or of the Holy Ghost,
          by a continual succession.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Seeing," says the Council of Trent, "that the saving truth and
          discipline of manners are contained in the written books and the
          unwritten traditions, which, having been received by the apostles from
          the mouth of Jesus Christ, or from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
          by succession of time are come down to us, following the example of
          the apostolic fathers, the Council receives with the same affection
          and reverence (pari pietatis et reverentiæ affectu), and honours all
          the books of the Old and New Testament (seeing that God is their
          author), and together with them the TRADITIONS relating to faith as
          well as manners, as having been dictated by the mouth of Jesus Christ
          or of the Holy Ghost, and preserved in the Catholic Church by
          continual succession." "If any one receive not the whole of the said
          books, with all their parts, as holy and canonical as they have been
          wont to be read in the Catholic Church, and in the old vulgate
          translation" (that of Jerome, which, especially in Job and the Psalms,
          is crammed with very numerous, very serious, and very evident errors,
          and has even been corrected abundantly since by other popes), "or
          knowingly despises the said traditions, let him be accursed!"
        </p>
        <p>
          They have thus put the bulls of the bishops of Rome, and the decrees
          of their synods, above the Scriptures. "Holy Scripture," say they,
          "does not contain all that is necessary for salvation, and is not
          sufficient." "It is obscure."3 "It does not belong to the people to
          read Holy Scripture." "We must receive with obedience of faith many
          things that are not contained in Scripture."5 "We must serve God
          according to the tradition of the ancients."
        </p>
        <p>
          The bull Exsurge of Leo X. places in the number of Luther's heresies
          his having said, "That it is not in the power of the Church, or of the
          Pope, to establish articles of faith."
        </p>
        <p>
          The bull Unigenitus condemns to perpetuity, as being respectively
          false, captious, scandalous, pernicious, rash, suspected of heresy,
          savouring of heresy, heretical, impious, blasphemous, &c., the
          following propositions:—"It is profitable at all times, in all places,
          and for all sorts of persons, to study the Scriptures, and to become
          acquainted with their spirit, piety, and mysteries," (on 1 Cor. 16:5.)
          "The reading of Holy Scripture in the hands of a man of business, and
          a financier, shows that it is intended for every body," (on Acts
          8:28.) "The holy obscurity of the Word of God is no ground for the
          laity's being dispensed from reading it," (on Acts 8:30, 31.) "The
          Lord's day ought to be sanctified by the reading of books of piety,
          and especially of the Scriptures. They are the milk which God himself,
          who knows our hearts, has supplied for them. It is dangerous to desire
          being weaned from it."—(Acts 15:29. "It is a mistake to imagine that
          the knowledge of the mysteries of religion ought not to be
          communicated to that sex (women) by the reading of the holy books,
          after this example of confidence with which Jesus Christ manifests
          himself to this woman (the Samaritan).") "It is not from the
          simplicity of women, but from the proud learning of men, that abuse of
          the Scriptures has arisen, and heresies have been generated."—(John
          4:26.) "It amounts to shutting the mouth of Christ to Christians, and
          to wresting from their hands the holy book, or to keep it shut to them
          by depriving them of the means of hearing it."—(1 Thess. 5:2.) "To
          interdict Christians from reading it, is to interdict children from
          the use of light, and to subject them to a kind of excommunication,"
          (on Luke 11:33.)

          Still more lately, in 1824, the encyclical epistle of Pope Leo XII.
          mournfully complains of the Bible Societies, "which," it says,
          "violate the traditions of the fathers (!!!) and the Council of Trent,
          by circulating the Scriptures in the vernacular tongues of all
          nations." ("Non vos latet, venerandi fratres, societatem quamdam,

          how pernicious for the faith and for morals this perfidious
          institution (the Bible Society) is! (ut ostendatur quantopere fidei et

        <p>
          It is this, that millions and millions of immortal souls in France, in
          Spain, in Italy, in Germany, and in America, and even in the Indies,
          although they carry every where intact and complete the New Testament,
          although they have not ceased to read it in Latin, every Lord's day,
          in thousands and thousands of churches, for twelve hundred years, …
          have been turned away from the fountains of life, have, like the Jews,
          "paid more attention to the words of the scribes than to those of the
          law;" have diverted their children, according to the counsel of
          Eleazer, "from the study of the Bible, to place them at the feet of
          the wise." They have found, like rabbi Jacob, "the words of the
          scribes more agreeable than those of the prophets." It is thus that
          they have contrived, for twelve centuries, to maintain doctrines the
          most contrary to the Word of God, on the worship of images;2 on the
          exaltation of the priests; on their forced celibacy; on their
          auricular confession; on the absolution which they dare to give; on
          the magical power which they attribute even to the most impure among
          them, of creating his God with three Latin words, opere operato; on an
          ecclesiastical priesthood, of which Scripture has never said a word;
          on prayers to the dead; on the spiritual pre-eminence of the city
          which the Scripture has called Babylon; on the use of an unknown
          tongue in worship; on the celestial empire of the blessed but humble
          woman to whom Jesus himself said, "Woman, what have I to do with
          thee?" on the mass; on the taking away of the cup; on the interdiction
          of the Scriptures to the people; on indulgences; on purgatory; on the
          universal episcopate of an Italian priest; on the interdiction of
          meals; so that just as people annul the sole priesthood of the Son of
          man by establishing other priesthoods by thousands, just as they annul
          his divinity by acknowledging thousands of demigods or dead men,
          present in all places, hearing throughout the whole earth the most
          secret prayers of human beings, protecting cities and kingdoms,
          working miracles in favour of their worshippers; … just so, also, they
          annul the inspiration of Scripture, by acknowledging by thousands
          other writings which share in its divine authority, and which surpass
          and swallow up its eternal infallibility!

        <p>
          It was in opposition to the very similar tenets maintained by the
          heretics of his time, that Saint Irenæus said, "For when convicted by
          the Scriptures, they turn about and accuse the Scriptures themselves,
          as if they were imperfect, and wanting in authority, and uncertain,
          and as if one could not find the truth in them, if ignorant of
          tradition; for that was given, not in writing, but by the living
          voice."

          secondly, a suggestion, that is to say, an action on their

            by the occasion?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, no doubt; and the occasion was prepared by God, just as the
          writer was. "The Holy Ghost," says Claude, "employed the pen of the
          evangelists … and of the prophets. He supplied them with the occasions
          on which they wrote; he gave them the wish and the strength to do so;
          the matter, form, order, economy, expressions, are from his immediate
          inspiration and direction."

        <p>
          <b
            >XXVI. But do we not clearly recognise, in the greater part of the
            sacred books, the individual character of the person who writes?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          from disowning this, we, on the contrary, admire its being so. The
          individual character which comes from God, and not from sin and the
          fall, was prepared and sanctified by God for the work to which it had
          been destined by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XXVII. Ought we, then, to think that all has been equally inspired
            of God, in each of the books of Holy Scripture?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture, in speaking of what it is, does not admit any distinction.
          All these sacred books, without exception, are the word of the Lord.
          ALL SCRIPTURE, says St Paul (πᾶσα γραφὴ), IS INSPIRED BY GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          This declaration, as we have already said, is susceptible of two
          constructions, according as we place the verb, not expressed but
          understood, before or after the Greek word which we here translate
          inspired by God;—both these constructions invincibly establish, that
          in the apostle's idea, all without exception, in each and all of the
          books of the Scriptures, is dictated by the Spirit of God. In fact, in
          both the apostle equally attests that these HOLY LETTERS (τὰ ἱερὰ
          γράμματα), of which he had been speaking to Timothy, are all divinely
          inspired Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we know that in the days of Jesus Christ, the whole Church meant
          one SOLE AND THE SAME COLLECTION OF BOOKS by the Scripture, the Holy
          Scripture, or the Scriptures, or the Holy Letters, or the Law and the
          Prophets, (γραφὴ, or ἡ γραφὴ ἁγία, or αἱ γραφαι,̀ or ὁ νόμος καὶοἱ
          προφήται, or τὰ ἱερὰ γράμματα5). These were the twenty-two sacred
          books which the Jews held from their prophets, and on which they were
          all perfectly agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entire and perfect divine inspiration of all the Scriptures of
          the Jews was so fully, in the days of Jesus Christ, the doctrine of
          the whole of that ancient people of God (as it was that of Jesus
          Christ, of Timothy, and of St Paul), that we find the following
          testimony to it in the works of the Jewish general Josephus (who had
          reached his thirtieth year at the time when the Apostle Paul wrote his
          Second Epistle to Timothy). "Never" (says he, in speaking of "the
          twenty-two books"8 of the Old Testament, which he calls τὰ ἰδία
          γράμματα, as St Paul calls them here τὰ ἱερὰ γράμματα), "never,
          although many ages have elapsed, has any one dared either to TAKE
          AWAY, or to ADD, or to TRANSPOSE in these any thing whatever; for it
          is with all the Jews, as it were an inborn conviction (ΠΑΣΙ δὲ
          σύμφυτόν ἐστιν), from their very earliest infancy, to call them GOD'S
          TEACHINGS, to abide in them, and, if necessary, to die joyfully in
          maintaining them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "They are given to us" (he says further) "by the inspiration that
          comes from God. (κατὰ τὴν ἐπίπνοιαν τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ); but as for the
          other books, composed since the times of Artaxerxes, they are not
          thought worthy of a like faith." …
        </p>
        <p>
          These passages from Josephus are not quoted here as an authority for
          our faith, but as an historical testimony, showing the sense in which
          the apostle St Paul spoke, and attesting to us that, in mentioning the
          holy letters (τὰ ἰερὰ γράμματα), and in saying that they are all
          divinely inspired Scriptures, he meant to declare to us that, in his
          eyes, there was nothing in the sacred books which was not dictated by
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, since the books of the New Testament are ἱερὰ γράμματα, Holy
          Scriptures, the Scriptures, the Holy Letters, as well as those of the
          Old; since the apostles have put their writings, and since St Peter,
          for example, has put ALL THE LETTERS OF PAUL (πάσας τὰς ἐπιστολὰς) in
          the same rank with the REST OF THE SCRIPTURES (ὡς καὶτὰς λοιπὰς
          ΓΡΑΦΑΣ), hence we ought to conclude that all is inspired by God in all
          the books of the Old and New Testament. XXVIII. But if all the sacred
          books (τα ἱερὰ γράμματα) are divinely inspired, how can we discover
          that such and such a book is a sacred book, and that such another is
          not one?
        </p>
        <p>This, in a great measure, is a purely historical question.</p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XXIX. Yet, have not the Reformed Churches maintained that it was by
            the Holy Ghost that they recognised the divinity of the sacred
            books; and, for example, has not the Confession of Faith of the
            Churches of France said in its 4th article, that we know these books
            to be canonical, and a very certain rule of our faith, not so much
            by the common accord and agreement of the Church, as by the
            testimony and the persuasion of the Holy Ghost, which enables us to
            discern between them and the other ecclesiastical books?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This maxim is perfectly true, if you apply it to the sacred books as a
          whole. In that sense the Bible is evidently an ἀυτόπιστος book, which
          needs itself only in order to be believed. To the man, whoever he be,
          that studies it "with sincerity and as before God," it presents itself
          evidently, and of itself, as a miraculous book; it reveals all that is
          hidden in men's consciences; it discerns the thoughts and affections
          of the heart. It has foretold the future; it has changed the face of
          the world; it has converted souls; it has created the Church. Thus it
          produces in men's hearts "an inward testimony and conviction of the
          Holy Ghost," which attests its inimitable divinity, independently of
          any testimony of men. But we do not think that our Churches ever
          ventured to affirm that one might be content to abide by this mark for
          discerning such or such a book, or such or such a chapter, or such or
          such a verse of the Word of God, and for ascertaining its celestial
          origin. They think that for this detail one must look, as they did,
          "to the common accord and agreement of the Church." We ought to admit
          as divine the entire code of the Scriptures, before each of its parts
          has enabled us to prove by itself that it is of God. It does not
          belong to us to judge this book; it is this book which will judge us.

            >XXX. Nevertheless, has not Luther, starting from a principle laid
            down by St Paul2 and by St John, said, that "the touchstone by which
            one might recognise certain scriptures as divine, is this: Do they
            preach Christ or do they not preach him?"4 And among the moderns,
            has not Dr Twesten also said, "that the different parts of the
            Scriptures are more or less inspired, according as they are more or
            less preaching; and that inspiration does not extend to words and
            historical matters beyond what has a relation to the Christian
            conscience, beyond what proceeds from Christ, or serves to show us
            Christ."</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is, no doubt, the way, the truth, and the life; the spirit of
          prophecy, no doubt, is the testimony of Jesus; but this touchstone
          might in our hands prove fallacious:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Because many writings speak admirably of Christ without being
          inspired;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Although all that is to be found in the inspired Scriptures relates
          to Jesus Christ, possibly we might fail to perceive this divine
          character at a first glance; and
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In fine, because we ought to BELIEVE BEFORE SEEING it, that all
          Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and
          for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect,
          throughly furnished unto all good works.

          modern, good and bad.

        <p>
          It is written, "that unto them were committed the oracles of God;"
          which means, that God in his wisdom chose them for being, under the
          Almighty government of his providence, sure depositories of his
          written word. Jesus Christ received their sacred code, and we accept
          of it as he did.

        <p><b>XXXIV. Shall our faith then depend upon the Jews?</b></p>
        <p>
          The Jews often fell into idolatry; they denied the faith; they slew
          their prophets; they crucified the King of kings; since that they have
          hardened their hearts for near two thousand years; they have filled up
          the measure of their sins, and wrath "is come upon them to the
          uttermost." Nevertheless, to them were committed the oracles of God.
          And albeit that these oracles condemn them, albeit that the veil
          remains on their hearts when they read the Old Testament;4 albeit they
          have for ages despised the Word of God, and worshipped their Talmud;
          they HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE not to give us the book of the Scriptures
          intact and complete; and the historian Josephus might still say of
          them what he wrote eighteen hundred years ago: "After the lapse of so
          many centuries (τοσούτου γὰρ αἰῶνος ἤδη ταρῳχηκότος), no one among the
          Jews has dared to ADD or to TAKE AWAY, or to transpose any thing in
          the sacred Scriptures."

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall reply to this question in but a very few words. Its warranty
          is to be found in the promises of God; its cause in the providence of
          God; and its means in the concurrence of the five following
          circumstances:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The religion of the Jews, which has carried their respect for the
          very letter of Scriptures even to a superstitious length.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The indefatigable labours of the Masorethes, who so carefully
          guarded its purity, even to the slightest accents.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The rivalry of the Judaical sects, none of which would have
          sanctioned any want of faithfulness on the part of the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The extraordinary dispersion of that people in all countries long
          before the ruin of Jerusalem; for "of old time," says St James, "Moses
          hath in every (pagan) city them that preach him, being read in the
          synagogues every Sabbath-day."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Finally, the innumerable copies of the sacred book diffused among
          all nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XXXVI. And with respect to the New Testament, what are we now to
            understand by the testimony of the Catholic Church?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          By this we are to understand the universal agreement of the ancient
          and modern Churches, Asiatic and European, good and bad, which call on
          the name of Jesus Christ; that is to say, not only the faithful sects
          of the blessed Reformation, but the Greek sect, the Arminian sects,
          the Syrian sect, the Roman sect, and perhaps we might add the
          Unitarian sects.

            >XXXVII. Should our faith then be founded on the Catholic Church?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          All Churches have erred, or might have erred. Many have denied the
          faith, persecuted Jesus Christ in his members, denied his divinity,
          made his cross of none effect, restored the worship of statues and
          graven images, exalted the priests, shed the blood of the saints,
          interdicted the use of the Scriptures to the people, committed to the
          flames those of the faithful who desired to read them in the
          vernacular tongue, have set up in the temple of God him who sits there
          as a God, have trampled upon the Scriptures, worshipped traditions,
          warred against God, and cast down the truth. Nevertheless, the new
          oracles of God have been committed to them, as those of the Old
          Testament were to the Jews. And albeit these oracles condemn them;
          albeit for ages they have despised the Scriptures and almost adored
          their traditions;—they have NOT BEEN ABLE not to give us the Book of
          the Scriptures of the New Testament intact and complete; and one may
          say of them, as Josephus said of Jews, "After the lapse of so many
          ages, never has any one in the Churches dared either to add or take
          away any thing in the Holy Scriptures." They have been compelled, in
          spite of themselves, to transmit them to us in their integrity.

            >XXXVIII. Nevertheless has there not been in Christendom one
            powerful sect, which for three hundred years has introduced into the
            canon of the Scriptures the Apocryphal Books, disavowed as they have
            been by the Jews (as even Pope St Gregory himself attests),2 and
            rejected by the fathers of the ancient Church (as St Jerome
            attests)?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This, it is true, is what was done for the Latin sect by the
          fifty-three persons who composed, on the 8th of April 1546, the famous
          Council of Trent, and who pretended to be the representatives of the
          CHURCH UNIVERSAL OF JESUS CHRIST. But they could do it for the Old
          Testament only, which was entrusted to the Jews and not to the
          Christians. Neither that Council, nor any even of the most corrupt and
          idolatrous Churches, have been able to add a single Apocryphal Book to
          the New Testament. God has not permitted this, however mischievous may
          have been their intentions. It is thus that the Jews have been able to
          reject the New Testament, which was not committed to them; while they
          HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE to introduce a single book of man into the Old
          Testament. God has never permitted them to do so; and, in particular,
          they have always excluded from it those which the fifty-three
          ecclesiastics of Trent were daring enough to cause to be inserted in
          it, in the name of the universal Church.

        </p>
        <p>To this question we shall reply but in a very few words.</p>
        <p>
          The warranty has lain in the promises of God; the cause in the
          providence of God; and the means principally in the concurrence of the
          following circumstances:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The religion of the ancient Christians, and their extraordinary
          respect for the sacred texts; a respect shown on all occasions in
          their churches, in their councils,2 in their oaths, and even in their
          domestic customs.4
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The pains taken by learned men in different ages to preserve the
          purity of the sacred text.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The many quotations made from Scripture by the fathers of the
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The mutual jealousy of the sects into which the Christian Church
          has been subdivided.
        </p>
        <p>5. The versions made from the first ages in many ancient tongues.</p>
        <p>
          6. The number and abundant dissemination of manuscripts of the New
          Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The dispersion of the new people of God as far as the extremities
          of Asia, and to the farthest limits of the west.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XL. Does it then result from these facts that the authority of the
            Scriptures is founded for us, as Bellarmin has said, on that of the
            Church?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctors of Rome, it is true, have gone so far as to say, that
          without the testimony of the Church the Scripture has no more
          authority than Livy, the Alcoran, or Æsop's fables; and Bellarmin,
          horrified no doubt at such impious opinions, would fain distinguish
          the authority of the Church in itself, and with respect to us (quoad
          se, et quoad nos). In this last sense, he says, the Scripture has no
          authority except by the testimony of the Church. Our answer will be
          very simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every manifestation having three causes, an objective cause, a
          subjective cause, and an instrumental cause, one may say also that the
          knowledge that we receive of the authority of the Scriptures has,
          first of all, for its objective cause, the Holy Bible itself, which
          proves its divinity by its own beauty, and by its own doings; in the
          second place, for subjective or efficient cause, the Holy Ghost, who
          confirms and seals to our souls the testimony of God; and in fine, in
          the third place, for instrumental cause, the Church, not the Roman,
          not the Greek, more ancient than the Roman, not even the Syriac, more
          ancient than either, but the Universal Church.

          The pious St Augustine expresses this triple cause, in his book
          against the Epistle of Manicheus, called Fundamenti. In speaking of
          the time at which he was still a Manichean, he says: "I should not
          have believed in the gospel had I not been drawn to it by the
          authority of the Church;" but he takes care to add: "Let us follow
          those who invite us first to believe, when we are not yet in a state
          to see: in order that, being rendered more capable (valentiores) by
          faith itself, we may deserve to comprehend what we believe. Then it
          will no more be men, it will be God himself within us, who will
          confirm our souls and illuminate them."

          In this affair, then, the Church is a servant and not a mistress; a
          depositary and not a judge. She exercises the office of a minister,
          not of a magistrate, ministerium non magisterium. She delivers a
          testimony, not a judicial sentence. She discerns the canon of the
          Scriptures, she does not make it; she has recognised their
          authenticity, she has not given it. And as the men of Sichem believed
          in Jesus Christ by means of the impure but penitent woman who called
          them to him, we say to the Church: "Now we believe, not because of thy
          saying; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed
          the Christ, the Saviour of the world."2 We have believed, then, per
          eam, not propter eam, through her means, not on her account. We found
          her on her knees; she showed us her Master; we recognised him, and we
          knelt down along with her. Were I to mingle in the rear of an imperial
          army, and should I ask those around me to show me their prince, they
          would do with respect to him, for me, what the Church has done with
          regard to the Scriptures. They would not call their regiment the
          œcumenical army; above all, they would not say that the emperor has no
          authority but what is derived from its testimony, whether as it
          respected itself or with respect to us; whether quoad se or quoad nos
          (to use Bellarmin's language). The authority of the Scriptures is not
          founded, then, on the authority of the Church: it is the Church that
          is founded on the authority of the Scriptures.

            inspiration?</b

          There would be a begging of the question here, if, in order to prove
          that the Scriptures are inspired, we should invoke their testimony
          while assuming them to be inspired. But we are far from adopting this
          process. First of all, the Bible is viewed solely in the light of an
          historical document, deserving our respect from its authenticity, and
          by means of which one may know the doctrine of Jesus Christ, nearly as
          one would learn that of Socrates from the books of Plato, or that of
          Leibnitz from the writings of Wolff. Now this document declares to us,
          in all its pages, that the whole system of the religion which it
          teaches, is founded on the grand fact of a miraculous intervention of
          God in the revelation of its history and its doctrines.

          The learned Michaelis, who held such loose principles on inspiration,
          himself declares that the inspiration of the apostolic writings
          necessarily results from their authenticity. There is no other
          alternative, says he; if what they relate is true, they are inspired;
          if they were not inspired, they would not be sincere; but they are
          sincere, therefore they are inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is nothing in such reasoning that can be thought like a begging
          of the question.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >XLIII. If it be by the Bible itself that we establish the dogma of
            a certain inspiration in the sacred books, by what can it be proved
            that that inspiration is universal, and that it extends to the
            minutest details of the instructions they convey?

          If it be the Scriptures that tell us of their divine inspiration, it
          is they too that will be able to inform us in what divine inspiration
          consisted. In order to our admitting their inspiration on their own
          sole testimony, it should have sufficed for us to be assured that they
          were authentic; but, in order to our admitting their plenary
          inspiration, we shall have something more; for we shall then be able
          to invoke their testimony as writings already admitted to be divine.
          It will no longer be authentic books only that say to us, I am
          inspired; but books, both authentic and inspired, will say to us, I am
          so altogether. The Scriptures are inspired, we affirm, because, being
          authentic and true, they say of themselves that they are inspired; but
          the Scriptures are plenarily inspired, we also add, because, being
          inspired, they say that they are so entirely, and without any
          exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, there is neither more nor less than a doctrine which the
          Bible will teach us, as it teaches us all the rest. And just as we
          believe, because it tells us so, that Jesus Christ is God, and that he
          became man; so also we believe that the Holy Ghost is God, and that he
          dictated the whole of the Scriptures.
