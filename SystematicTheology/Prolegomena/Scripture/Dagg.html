        <h1>ORIGIN AND AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE</h1>
        <h2>I. ORIGIN</h2>
        <p>
          We are rational beings; and, as such, the desire of knowledge is
          natural to us. In early childhood, as each new object of interest
          comes under our notice, we ask, who made it; and as we advance in
          years, the same inquisitiveness attends us, and prompts us to
          investigate the sources of knowledge which are ever opening before us.
          Brutes may look with indifference on the works of God, and tread under
          foot the productions of human ingenuity, without inquiry into their
          origin; but rational men cannot act thus without violence to the first
          principles of their nature. Among the objects which have occupied a
          large space in human thought, and which claim our consideration, the
          BIBLE stands conspicuous. Its antiquity; the veneration in which it
          has been held, and continues to be held, by a large part of mankind;
          and the influence which it has manifestly exerted on their conduct and
          happiness, are sufficient, if not to awaken higher emotions, at least
          to attract our curiosity, and excite a desire to know its origin and
          true character.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are moral beings. The Bible comes to us as a rule of conduct. The
          claim which is set up for it is, that it is the highest standard of
          morals, admitting no appeal from its decisions. We are, therefore,
          under the strongest obligations to examine the foundation of this
          claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are, if the Bible is true, immortal beings. Heathen philosophers
          have conjectured that man may be immortal; and infidels have professed
          to believe it; but, if we exclude the Bible, we have no means of
          certain knowledge on this point. Yet it is a matter of the utmost
          importance. If we are immortal, we have interests beyond the grave
          which infinitely transcend all our interests in the present life. What
          folly, then, it is, to reject the only source of information on this
          momentous subject! Besides if we have such interests in a future
          world, we have no means of knowing how to secure them, except from the
          Bible. Shall we throw this book from us, and trust to vain conjecture,
          on questions in which our all is involved ? it would be folly and
          madness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us then inquire, whence came the Bible? Is it from heaven, or from
          men ? If it is from men, is it the work of good men, or of bad men ?
        </p>
        <p>
          If bad men had been the authors of the Bible, they would have made it
          to their liking. If made to please them, it would please other men of
          like character. But it is not a book in which bad men delight. They
          hate it. Its precepts are too holy; its doctrines too pure; its
          denunciations against all manner of iniquity too terrible. It is not
          at all written according to the taste of such men. There are men who
          prize the Bible; who pore over its pages with delight; who have
          recourse to it in all their perplexities and sorrows; who seek its
          counsels to guide them, and its instructions to make them wise; who
          esteem its words more than gold, and feast on them as their sweetest
          food. But who are these men? They are those who detest all deceit and
          falsehood, and whom this very book has transformed, from men of
          iniquity and vice, to men of purity and holiness. It is impossible,
          therefore, that the Bible should be the work of bad men.
        </p>
        <p>
          It remains that the Bible must be either from heaven or from good men.
          So pure a stream cannot proceed from a corrupt fountain. If it be from
          good men, they will not wilfully deceive us. Let us, then, look to the
          account which they have given of its origin: "All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God."[1] "The things that I write unto you are the
          commandments of the Lord."[2] "And so we have the prophetic word more
          firm, to which ye do well to take heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark
          place, until the day dawn, and the morning star arise in your hearts;
          knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private
          invention. For never, at any time, was prophecy brought by the will of
          man, but the holy men of God spake, being moved by the Holy Ghost."[3]
        </p>
        <p>
          It may, perhaps, be objected to the use of these quotations, that we
          permit the Bible to speak for itself; but this is no unprecedented
          procedure. If a stranger were passing through our neighborhood, and we
          were desirous to know whence he came, it would not be unnatural to
          propose the inquiry to the man himself. If there were about him marks
          of honesty and simplicity of character, and if, after our most careful
          investigations, it should appear that he has no evil design to
          accomplish, and no interest to promote by deceiving us, we should rely
          on the information we derive from him. Such a stranger is the Bible;
          and why may we not rely on its testimony concerning itself? Nay, it is
          not a stranger. Though claiming a heavenly origin, it has long dwelt
          on earth, and gone in and out among us, a familiar companion. We have
          been accustomed to hear its words; and have known them to be tried
          with every suspicion, and every scrutiny, and no falsehood has been
          detected. More, it has been among us as a teacher of truth and
          sincerity; and truth and sincerity have abounded just in proportion as
          its teachings have been heeded. Old men of deceit have shrunk from its
          probings, and trembled at its threatenings; and young men have been
          taught by it to put away all lying and hypocrisy. Can it be that the
          Bible itself is a deceiver and impostor ? Impossible! It must be, what
          it claims to be, a book from heaven--the Book of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth that the Bible is from God, is not only testified by the
          inspired men who wrote it, but it is established by many other
          decisive proofs, some of which we shall proceed to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Divine origin of the Bible is proved by the CHARACTER OF THE
          REVELATION which it contains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The character of God, as exhibited in the Bible, cannot be of human
          origin. We know what sort of gods men make; for they have multiplied
          them without number. They carve deities from blocks of wood and stone,
          and worship them with stupid adoration; but this is not the most
          debasing and abominable idolatry of which they are guilty. Their vain
          imaginations fashion gods more vile than these. The blocks of wood or
          stone may take the form of birds, four-footed beasts, and creeping
          things; but the deities which derive their origin from the
          imaginations of men have passions and propensities that are beastly,
          and even worse than beastly. Such are the objects which they worship
          with laborious and costly devotion. Let any man visit the temples of
          the heathen, observe their horrid ceremonies, and study the character
          of their gods; and then let him say whether these gods, and the God of
          the Bible, are from one common origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some objectors may allege that the deities to which we have referred
          are those of uncivilized tribes. What then? Were the gods of the most
          civilized nations better than these? What were the divinities which
          were worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans, even by their sages
          and philosophers, whose talents and genius have been admired in every
          age? Jupiter, their Optimus Maximus, best and greatest, was a monster
          of crime; and Venus, Bacchus, Mercury, Mars, and the rest of their
          deities, were his fit companions. They were patrons and examples of
          vice. The infidel Rousseau has drawn their character correctly. "Cast
          your eyes over all the nations of the world, and all the histories of
          nations. Amid so many inhuman and absurd superstitions, amid that
          prodigious diversity of manners and characters, you will find every
          where the same principles and distinctions of moral good and evil. The
          paganism of the ancient world produced, indeed, abominable gods, who
          on earth would have been shunned or punished as monsters, and who
          offered as a picture of supreme happiness only crimes to commit and
          passions to satiate. But vice, armed with this sacred authority,
          descended in vain from the eternal abode; she found, in the heart of
          man, a moral instinct to repel her. The continence of Xenocrates was
          admired by those who celebrated the debaucheries of Jupiter--the
          chaste Lucretia adored the unchaste Venus--the most intrepid Roman
          sacrificed to Fear. He invoked the god who dethroned his father, and
          he died without a murmur by the hand of his own. The most contemptible
          divinities were served by the greatest men. The holy voice of Nature,
          stronger than that of the gods, made itself heard, and respected, and
          obeyed on earth, and seemed to banish as it were to the confinement of
          heaven, guilt, and the guilty.''[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          Go now to the Pantheon, and study the character and works of Rome's
          innumerable deities. After infidelity has acknowledged that they are
          monsters, more vicious than men, and sending forth a corrupting
          influence into human society, invite her to study the character of
          Jehovah, the God of the Bible, a Spirit, whose form cannot be
          represented; a Being whose eyes cannot behold iniquity, who is
          glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, and doing wonders; and who
          requires to be worshipped in the beauty of holiness. Let her stand
          with Moses in the cleft of the rock, and hear the Lord proclaim his
          name: "The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering
          and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
          forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and that will by no
          means clear the guilty.''[5] Surely she will bow her head with
          reverence, and confess, this is the voice of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The account of the life and character of Christ given in the gospels,
          is not a fiction of human invention. The introduction of Christianity,
          its existence in the world, the persecutions which it has encountered,
          its spread in spite of opposition, and the influence which it has
          exerted on nations and governments, are all so interwoven with the
          history of the last eighteen hundred years, that all history must be
          doubted, if these are fables. The evidence that there were such men as
          Alexander and Julius Caesar, is not so abundant and indisputable as
          that Jesus Christ appeared at the time and place stated in the
          gospels. The accounts of his life, sufferings, and death, given by
          Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, come down to us with all the marks of
          authentic history. No signs of fraud can be detected in the
          narratives. The admirable simplicity of the writers, their
          ingenuousness in relating the faults and weaknesses of their own
          characters, their artlessness in depicting the sublime virtues of
          their Master, and recording his stupendous works, and the
          unimpassioned manner in which they described the cruel treatment he
          received from his persecutors and murderers; all these considerations
          place the truth of their narratives beyond question. Add to all this,
          that they had sufficient means of knowing the truth of the facts which
          they have recorded; that they attested the sincerity of their faith in
          them by enduring tortures and death; and that those who received their
          testimony, and transmitted it to us, testified their faith in it by
          like endurance. No other facts in the history of the world have
          evidence so strong. But if this evidence can be rejected, an
          insuperable difficulty still remains. It is impossible to account for
          the existence of the gospels on any other supposition, than that they
          are what they profess to be, true delineations of a real character.
          The authors were incapable of conceiving such a fiction. Even such men
          as Virgil and Homer were incapable of such an effort. They could
          conceive and describe such characters as Aeneas and Ulysses, but not
          such a character as Jesus Christ. Besides, the learning of the world
          was arrayed against Christianity; and to the unlearned and humble
          fishermen of Galilee the task was assigned of recording the life and
          works of Jesus of Nazareth. That such men should have transmitted to
          succeeding ages a fiction such as this, is incredible--impossible.
          Another quotation from Rousseau will show the overpowering influence
          of these considerations on the mind of an infidel: "I will confess to
          you further, that the majesty of the Scripture strikes me with
          admiration, as the purity of the gospel hath its influence on my
          heart. Peruse the works of our philosophers, with all their pomp of
          diction--how mean--how contemptible--are they, compared with the
          Scripture! Is it possible, that a book at once so simple and sublime
          should be merely the work of man? Is it possible that the sacred
          personage whose history it contains should be himself a mere man? Do
          we find that he assumed the air of an enthusiast or ambitious sectary?
          What sweetness, what purity in his manner! What an affecting
          gracefulness in his delivery! What sublimity in his maxims! What
          profound wisdom in his discourses! What presence of mind! What
          subtilty. What truth in his replies! How great the command over his
          passions! Where is the man, where the philosopher, who could so live
          and die, without weakness and without ostentation? Shall we suppose
          the Evangelic History a mere fiction? Indeed, my friend, it bears not
          the marks of fiction. On the contrary, the history of Socrates, which
          nobody presumes to doubt, is not so well attested as that of Jesus
          Christ. The Jewish authors were incapable of the diction, and
          strangers to the morality contained in the gospels; the marks of whose
          truth are so striking and invincible, that the inventor would be a
          more astonishing character than the hero. "[6]
        </p>
        <p>
          If the gospels give a true account of Jesus Christ, he was a teacher
          from heaven; and both the doctrine which he taught, and the
          Scriptures, to which he often appealed as of divine authority, are
          from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method of salvation revealed in the Bible is not a human device.
          The preaching of Christ crucified was to the Jews a stumbling-block,
          and to the Greeks foolishness, yet salvation by the Cross is the grand
          peculiarity of the gospel. Were Christianity a cunningly-devised
          fable, a doctrine so offensive to mankind would not have been made
          prominent in the scheme. To this day, men of proud intellect and
          corrupt heart reject the doctrine of salvation by the obedience and
          sufferings of another. To the humble and contrite, oppressed with a
          sense of sin, and seeking, from the borders of despair, some divine
          method of escape from the wrath to come, this doctrine is thrice
          welcome; but the humble and contrite are not the men to cheat the
          world with a forged system of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BLESSINGS which the Bible confers on mankind have their origin in
          infinite Benevolence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare the condition of those nations where Paganism reigns with that
          of the nations where the most corrupt forms of Christianity exist, and
          you will find the latter preferable. Institute another comparison
          between these, and the lands where a purer Christianity prevails, and
          where the Bible, instead of being withheld from the common people, is
          open to the reading of all, and you will perceive a far better state
          of human society, where the Sacred Volume is best known. Compare,
          again, in these most favored lands, the families where the Bible is
          least regarded, with those in which its doctrines are revered and its
          precepts obeyed and you will be sensible that a heavenly influence
          pervades the latter. But even in such families as these, the
          individual members often differ widely from each other. Though they
          may all worship at the same altar, and read the same Bible, some have
          the word of truth on their lips only, while others treasure it up deep
          in their hearts, and find it sweeter to their taste than honey and the
          honeycomb. What elevation of character, what pure and unsullied bliss
          do the latter enjoy! Take, lastly, an individual of the last most
          favored class, and compare the different moments of his life--those in
          which the Bible is least regarded, with those in which he feasts on
          its truths and promises, and experiences joy unspeakable and full of
          glory, while he receives the divine word into his heart; and you will
          have a full view of the blessed influence which the Bible can impart.
          We know that the sun is a source of light and heat, because all is
          dark and cold when his beams are absent; and light and heat are found
          to increase in proportion as we draw nearer to him. Precisely so it is
          with the Bible. From Paganism, cold and dark, where the Bible is
          unknown, to the saint in his most rapturous devotions, when he has the
          sweetest foretaste of heaven which mortals on earth can enjoy; the
          light of truth which fills the understanding, and the warmth of love
          which glows in the heart, bear an exact proportion to the proximity of
          the Bible. If the sun, which enlightens the material world, is the
          work of a benevolent Creator, much more may we ascribe to the same
          benevolence the authorship of the Bible, the source of spiritual
          illumination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having compared the Bible to the sun, it may be a fit occasion to
          remark that both these lights have their darknesses--the Bible its
          obscurities, and the sun its spots. The Deist may cavil at the one,
          and the Atheist at the other; but the cavils of both are alike absurd
          and unavailing. Because there are spots in the sun, shall we conclude
          that God did not make it, or that it is not a blessing to mankind? Yet
          this conclusion would not be more irrational than to deny that God is
          the author of the Bible, or that the Bible is a blessing to the world,
          because there are obscurities found in its pages. Suppose it be
          admitted that the spots in the sun, and the obscurities in the Bible
          are imperfections, is God the author of nothing in which imperfections
          exist? If everything material, and everything human, be marked with
          imperfection, may not God nevertheless glorify himself by things
          material and human? The new Jerusalem has no need of a material sun to
          enlighten it, because the glory of God and the Lamb is the light
          thereof; but God has fixed the sun in the firmament to enlighten this
          world of matter; and the sun in the firmament, notwithstanding its
          spots, declares its Maker's glory. So God may make revelation of
          Himself to the pure intelligences of heaven in language free from
          human imperfection; but when He speaks to mortals on earth, He uses
          the language of mortals; and whatever may be the imperfection of the
          medium, this revelation of God displays his glory in the brightest
          light in which human eyes can behold it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But are the spots in the sun and the obscurities in the Bible to be
          accounted imperfections? The light of the sun is pure and abundant;
          and, if it were deficient, the deficiency might be supplied, as well
          by enlarging the sun, as by removing its spots. It would, therefore,
          be as rational to complain that the sun is not larger, as to complain
          that there are spots in its disc. In like manner, the light of God's
          Word is pure, and sufficient to make men wise to salvation; and we
          might as well complain that the Bible is not larger, as that it
          contains obscurities. Besides, the obscurities of the Bible may have a
          beneficial use. If, as some astronomers suppose, the solar spots are
          the body of the sun, seen through the partings of its luminous
          atmosphere, they can scarcely be deemed imperfections; much less can
          they be so regarded, if they are streams of gas rising in the sun's
          atmosphere, and diffusing itself to become fuel for the lamp of day.
          According to the latter hypothesis, the spots are as far from being
          imperfections, as are the clouds that sometimes darken our sky, but
          which are the rich sources of the earth's fertility, and the granaries
          of our bread. So, some of the obscurities of the Bible are the deep
          things of God, seen through; the light of revelation--the inscrutable
          mystery of the divine nature appearing through the light with which He
          has clothed Himself. Other mysteries are, in process of time,
          dissipated; and, like clouds which burst, pour out a blessing. It was
          a mystery "that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs and partakers of
          the promise of Christ by the gospel;" but in due time this mystery was
          explained, and the bursting cloud poured the richest blessing on all
          the Gentile world. The Old Testament dispensation was dark, abounding
          with shadows of good things to come; but since the Sun of
          Righteousness has arisen, the dark places have been illuminated, and
          are full of instruction. Prophecies have been delivered in obscure
          language; but their fulfilment has interpreted them. Some obscurities
          have given occasion to the infidel to charge the Bible with
          contradictions; but a careful examination of the inspired word has not
          only served to repel the charge by reconciling the apparent
          discrepancies, but it has added new proof that the Scriptures were
          written by undesigning and honest men, without any collusion; and that
          there is perfect harmony in their statements, even when apparently
          most discordant. Men of superior intellect may find a pleasant and
          profitable exercise of their powers in investigating those parts of
          the Bible which are less clear; while its plainest truths are adapted
          to men of least capacity, and are sufficient for their necessities.
          Here are waters in which "a lamb may wade," and in which "an elephant
          may swim." There is yet another use of Bible obscurities. When God
          gave a law to mankind, he did not give one which it was impossible to
          violate, but one which men, as free agents, might violate, and by
          violating bring ruin on their souls. So, when he gave a revelation to
          mankind, he did not give one which could not be caviled at, but one at
          which men might cavil, and, by caviling, bring wrath upon themselves.
          The obscurities of the Bible serve for this use; for the Bible itself
          declares, that it contains "some things hard to be understood, which
          they that are unlearned and unstable wrest unto their own
          destruction." Let those who choose rather to cavil at the obscurities
          of the Bible, than to walk in its light, read this declaration, and
          fear and tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          The revelations contained in the Bible have the attestation of
          MIRACLES. It is a plain dictate of common sense, that Almighty God,
          who created and governs the world, may direct its movements as He
          chooses. He appointed the laws of Nature, and He may suspend these
          laws whenever He pleases, and turn the course of things out of the
          ordinary channel. It is equally clear, that none but the Author of
          Nature can effect such changes. It follows, therefore, that miracles,
          if wrought in attestation of a revelation professing to be from
          Heaven, stamp upon it the seal of Omnipotence. Persons who saw such
          miracles wrought, reasoned well when they said: "We know that thou art
          a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles that thou
          doest, except God be with him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Though miracles furnished, to those who saw them with their own eyes,
          a more impressive evidence than to us who see them through the light
          of history, yet the argument founded on them is perfectly conclusive,
          even at the present time. That Moses and the prophets, Christ and his
          apostles, performed works truly miraculous, is as well attested as any
          ancient fact whatever. The character of the works attributed to them,
          their number, the circumstances in which they were performed, the
          absence of everything indicating fraud or imposture, the sufferings by
          which the witnesses demonstrated their sincerity, the credence which
          their testimony obtained rapidly and extensively, and in the face of
          bitter persecution, and the absence of all counter testimony; all
          these considerations compel the belief that miracles were wrought, and
          if wrought, the revelation which they attest must be from God. The
          evidence, though it may be less impressive, is not less decisive than
          it would have been if we had personally witnessed the miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not wholly indebted for the evidence of miracles, to the light
          of history. It does not need historical proof to satisfy our minds
          that the pyramids of Egypt were built by human labor and skill. We are
          as well satisfied of this, as if we had seen them rise under the hands
          of the workmen. We know that they are the work of man, because they
          resemble, in kind, other works of man. But he who gazes on these
          stupendous structures, may turn his eyes to the great globe beneath
          them, and feel equally well assured that it is not the work of man.
          So, in contemplating a system of heathen mythology or philosophy, we
          may be convinced that it is of human origin, because it bears the
          marks of man's workmanship; but in contemplating the Bible, and the
          religion which it has introduced into the world, we may be as well
          assured that the origin of these is superhuman. A system so destitute
          of everything which could recommend it to the carnal mind, and
          claiming to be attested "with signs and wonders, and with divers
          miracles," could not, in the absence of such miracles, obtain,
          according to the ordinary course of things, easy and extensive
          credence among mankind, and become firmly established in their
          confidence. The propagation, in such circumstances, must itself have
          been miraculous. It is of no importance to the present argument,
          whether the miracle was wrought before the eyes of him who received
          the doctrine, or on his mind, to incline him to receive it. In either
          case, there was a miracle, an interposition of Divine Power, and such
          an interposition demonstrated that the doctrine was from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PROPHECIES which the Bible contains, must have proceeded from
          infallible foreknowledge. This is proved by their exact fulfilment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel prophesied to Nebuchadnezzar, the proud head of the Babylonian
          empire, then in its glory and strength, that this empire would give
          place to three others which were to arise after it.[7] This succession
          of empires, the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Grecian, and the
          Roman, is more fully described afterward in the prophecies of Daniel,
          together with a series of events extending down to the present
          time.[8] More than a century before the time of Daniel, the prophet
          Isaiah predicted[9] the taking of Babylon by the Persians, who were,
          at the time of the prediction, a feeble and obscure nation. He
          foretold the very name of the Persian leader, and the manner of his
          entrance into the city, through gates which, by a special ordering of
          Providence, were carelessly left open by the Babylonians in their
          drunken festivity. Other prophets foretold the destruction and final
          desolation of Babylon,[10] and of Nineveh,[11] the overthrow of
          ancient Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar,[12] and afterward of insular Tyre by
          Alexander,[13] and the decline and present state of Egypt,[14] once
          the proudest of nations. All these predictions were made when the
          events predicted were so improbable, that they could not be foreknown
          by any human sagacity; yet history, and the reports of travellers,
          attest their exact accomplishment. Many other examples of fulfilled
          prophecy might readily be cited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophecies concerning the Jews are remarkable, and we refer to
          them with the more satisfaction, because the reader has probably, to
          some extent, personal knowledge of the facts predicted. These people
          are scattered through our nation, and through most of the nations on
          earth. Their synagogues, in which they meet to worship the God of
          their fathers, are found in all our principal cities. The Scriptures
          of the Old Testament are regularly read in their public worship, and
          are regarded with religious veneration, as their sacred book, received
          from God by their ancient prophets, and handed down to them from their
          forefathers. This book minutely describes,[15] in the language of
          prediction, the sufferings which they have undergone; their wonderful
          preservation as a distinct people, notwithstanding these sufferings,
          and their dispersed condition among all nations. Other ancient tribes,
          when scattered, have been lost in the general mass of mankind; but
          these people, after centuries of dispersion and persecution, still
          remain distinct, and stand forth to the world as witnesses of the
          wonderful fulfilment of the predictions respecting them, uttered by
          their ancient prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sacred writings of the Jews not only contain predictions of the
          dispersion, sufferings, and wonderful preservation of this people, but
          also furnish explanation of these extraordinary events. The book
          describes a covenant between this nation and the God whom they
          worship, and its records show that they have repeatedly violated this
          covenant, and suffered the threatened penalty. The whole history of
          the nation illustrates the dealings of God with them, in accordance
          with the stipulations of this covenant. Once before, as a punishment
          of their unfaithfulness, they were driven from their land into
          captivity for seventy years, yet they were preserved and brought back.
          The prophetic declarations of their sacred volume explain that their
          present dispersion and sufferings are, in like manner, in consequence
          of their crimes, and that their preservation is in prospect of another
          restoration. Their condition, therefore, resembles that of a
          malefactor nailed to the cross, with his accusation written over his
          head; a fit punishment for the nation that crucified the Lord of
          glory. They hold in their hands the book which specifies their crimes
          and predicts their sufferings, and they furnish, in their persons, the
          spectacle of these predictions fulfilled. They not only claim that
          their book is divine, but they are the proof of its divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews may be made witnesses for the New Testament also, which they
          reject, and for Christianity, which they hate. What crime so great,
          has extended their dispersion and sufferings through the long period
          of eighteen centuries? The New Testament gives the only satisfactory
          answer to this inquiry, and it answers in perfect accordance with
          their own Scriptures. They have rejected and crucified their King,
          their long-expected Messiah, whom their prophets had foretold. It was
          predicted that he would appear before the tribe of Judah should become
          extinct, or should cease to maintain a distinct government of its
          own;[16] before the second temple should be destroyed;[17] and in 490
          years from the decree of Cyrus to rebuild Jerusalem.[18] At this time
          Jesus Christ appeared, claiming to be their Messiah, and furnishing
          most abundant proofs that he came from God; yet, as their prophets had
          foretold, they rejected him,[19] and united with Gentile rulers to
          destroy him.[20] Their own Scriptures, and their confessed hatred of
          Jesus Christ, fully make out the crime for which they suffer, and
          these unite with the known fact of their sufferings to demonstrate the
          Messiahship of Jesus and the divine origin of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament contains various predictions[21] which have been
          exactly fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; the
          calamities of the Jews; their dispersion and their preservation; also
          concerning the persecutions of Christianity; its spread through the
          world, and the Papal Apostasy.[22] Besides these, it contains
          predictions, yet not accomplished, of the conversion of the Gentiles,
          the restoration of the Jews, and the millennial state of the Church.
          When these shall have been fulfilled, the prophetical evidence now
          constantly accumulating will be complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          In concluding this brief inquiry into the origin of the Bible, we may
          admire and adore the wonderful providence of God, which has made his
          enemies the preservers and witnesses of his revelation. The Jews, who
          killed the prophets and crucified the Son of God himself, have
          preserved and transmitted the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and are
          now witnesses to the world of its divine origin, and the truth of its
          prophecies. The Roman Catholic Church, the great Antichrist, or man of
          sin, drunk with the blood of the saints, has transmitted to us the
          Scriptures of the New Testament, and now gives, in the same two-fold
          manner, its testimony to this part of the Sacred Volume. Even the
          infidel scoffer is made an unconscious witness. In its pages, his very
          scoffs are predicted, and his corrupt heart, from which, rather than
          from sober judgment, these scoffs proceed, is portrayed with an
          accuracy and skill which bespeak the Author divine, the Searcher of
          hearts. The word which "is quick and powerful, and sharper than any
          two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
          spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
          thoughts and intents of the heart," must be "the word of God." Even
          the reluctant tongue of the infidel, as in the case of Rousseau, is
          sometimes constrained to utter its testimony aloud; and at other
          times, when danger comes or death threatens, his alarm and terror
          divulge the truth, that his rock is not as our rock, himself being
          judge. Unhappy infidel! Is there a God? Hast thou an immortal soul?
          Until thou canst, with unfaltering hardihood, answer, No to both these
          inquiries, do not cast away from thee the Bible, the Book of God, the
          Light of immortality.
        </p>
        <h2>II. AUTHORITY</h2>
        <p>
          THOUGH the Bible was written by inspired men, they are to be regarded
          merely as the instruments chosen, fitted, and employed by God, for the
          production of this work. God himself is the author of the Bible. When
          we read its sacred pages, we should realize that God speaks to us, and
          when we suffer it to lie neglected, we should remember that we are
          refusing to listen to God, when he proffers to instruct us on subjects
          of infinite moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible contains the testimony of God, and is therefore a Rule of
          Faith. The declarations of an honest man ought to be believed, much
          more ought those which are made by the God of truth; "if we receive
          the witness of men, the witness of God is greater." To reject the
          testimony of God, is to make him a liar. To call a fellow-man a liar,
          is to offer an insult of the grossest character. This insult we offer
          to the great God, when we refuse to receive his testimony, given to us
          in his holy Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible contains the precepts of God, and is therefore a Rule of
          Duty. We are bound to obey the commands of parents and civil rulers,
          but God has a higher claim on our obedience. He is our Father in
          heaven, and the Supreme Lawgiver of the universe. Against this high
          authority we rebel, when we refuse to obey the precepts of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible contains the promises of God, and is therefore a Rule of
          Hope. It determines, not only what we are to believe and to do, but
          also what we are to expect. It presents, as the foundation of our
          hope, the promise and the oath of God, two immutable things, in which
          it is impossible for God to lie. We look to him as the rewarder of
          those that diligently seek him, and all our confidence respecting the
          nature and extent of this reward, and the certainty of our obtaining
          it, is founded on the sure word of prophecy, the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether, as a rule of faith, of duty, or of hope, the authority of the
          Bible is supreme. We may rely on the testimony of men, but they
          sometimes deceive us. We may regulate our conduct by the command of
          those who are over us, or by the dictates of our own conscience, but
          rulers may command what is wrong, and conscience is not infallible. We
          may cherish hopes founded on human promises, or the natural tendencies
          of things, but human promises are often delusive, and the promises of
          Nature are buds which, however beautiful and fragrant, are often
          blasted before they produce fruit. God never deceives. "The grass
          withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but the word of the
          Lord endureth forever." When the Bible speaks, all else may be silent,
          and its decisions leave no room for doubt and admit no appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authority of the Bible is independent. It was not conferred on it
          by the inspired men who wrote it; nor does it derive any from the
          persons who have transmitted it to us. The purest church on earth
          cannot invest it with authority; much less can the corrupt Church of
          Rome. The inspired writers referred the authority of what they wrote
          to God; and here it must rest. The transcribers of the manuscripts,
          who have been the agents of Providence in preserving and transmitting
          the Sacred Volume to us, and the printers and bookbinders by whose
          labors this volume is so widely circulated, have conferred no
          authority on it, and it has received as little from the Church of Rome
          as from these. It possesses authority simply because it is the word of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authority of the Bible is immediate. Its address is directly from
          God, and directly to the mind and heart of every individual reader. We
          have no mediator but Christ, and no infallible interpreter but the
          Holy Spirit. We may derive assistance from men in understanding the
          Bible, but they have no right to understand it for us. We should
          employ our own minds in the study of God's Word, and allow no human
          interpreter to intervene between God and our own conscience. We should
          say, each one for himself, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth."
        </p>
        <p>
          What a precious gift is the Bible! Who will not prize it? Who will not
          bind it to his heart? We stand on the narrow isthmus of life, between
          two oceans, the boundless past and the boundless future. The records
          of eternity past are beyond our reach, but the Ancient of Days has
          opened them, and has revealed to us in the Bible whatever it is
          necessary that we should know. The vanishing present is all important
          to us, because on it depends our everlasting all, but who will
          instruct us how to use the swiftly passing moments as we ought? The
          only wise God has condescended to speak to us in the Bible, and to
          teach us how to order our steps in life's short way, so as to insure
          life eternal. The future world is just before us. For myself, I
          realize that I am standing on the shore of the boundless ocean, with
          but an inch of crumbling sand remaining. I hear the shrieks of the
          dying infidel at my side, to whose view all is covered with
          impenetrable darkness. He, too, has come to the brink, and would
          gladly refuse to proceed, but he cannot. Perplexed, terrified,
          shuddering, he plunges in and sinks, he knows not whither. How
          precious, at this trying moment, is the Book of God! How cheering this
          Light from heaven! Before it I see the shades retiring. The Bible
          lifts its torch--nay, not a feeble torch, such as reason may raise, to
          shine on the darkness and render it visible; the Bible sheds the light
          of the noonday sun on the vast prospect before me, and enables me,
          tranquil and joyful, to launch into eternity with the full assurance
          of hope. Mortals, hastening to the retributions of eternity, be wise;
          receive the revelation from heaven presented to you in the Bible;
          attend diligently to its instructions, and reverence its authority, as
          the word of the final Judge before whom you will soon appear.
