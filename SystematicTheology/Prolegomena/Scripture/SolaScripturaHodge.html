        <h2>Sola Scriptura</h2>
        <p>
          The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, Having Been Given By
          Inspiration of God, Are the All-Sufficient and Only Rule of Faith and
          Practice, and Judge of Controversies.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What is meant by saying that the Scriptures are the only infallible
          rule of faith and practice?
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever God teaches or commands is of sovereign authority. Whatever
          conveys to us an infallible knowledge of his teachings and commands is
          an infallible rule. The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are
          the only organs through which, during the present dispensation, God
          conveys to us a knowledge of his will about what we are to believe
          concerning himself, and what duties he requires of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What does the Romish Church declare to be the infallible rule of
          faith and practice?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romish theory is that the complete rule of faith and practice
          consists of Scripture and tradition, or the oral teaching of Christ
          and his apostles, handed down through the Church. Tradition they hold
          to be necessary, 1st, to teach additional truth not contained in the
          Scriptures; and, 2nd, to interpret Scripture. The Church being the
          divinely constituted depository and judge of both Scripture and
          tradition.--" Decrees of Council of Trent," Session IV, and "Dens
          Theo.," Tom. 2., N. 80 and 81.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. By what arguments do they seek to establish the authority of
          tradition? By what criterion do they distinguish true traditions from
          false, and on what grounds do they base the authority of the
          traditions they receive?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Their arguments in behalf of tradition are-- (1) Scripture
          authorizes it, 2 Thes 2:15; 3:6. (2) The early fathers asserted its
          authority and founded their faith largely upon it. (3) The oral
          teaching of Christ and his apostles, when clearly ascertained, is
          intrinsically of equal authority with their writings. The scriptures
          themselves are handed down to us by the evidence of tradition, and the
          stream cannot rise higher than its source. (4) The necessity of the
          case. (a) Scripture is obscure, needs tradition as its interpreter.
          (b) Scripture is incomplete as a rule of faith and practice; since
          there are many doctrines and institutions, universally recognized,
          which are founded only upon tradition as a supplement to Scripture.
          (5) Analogy. every state recognizes both written and unwritten, common
          and statute law.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The criterion by which they distinguish between true and false
          traditions is Catholic consent. The Anglican ritualists confine the
          application of the rule to the first three or four centuries. the
          Romanists recognize that as an authoritative consent which is
          constitutionally expressed by the bishops in general council, or by
          the Pope ex-cathedra, in any age of the church whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. They defend the traditions which they hold to be true. (1) On the
          ground of historical testimony, tracing them up to the apostles as
          their source. (2) The authority of the Church expressed by Catholic
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. By what arguments may the invalidity of all ecclesiastical
          tradition, as a part of our rule of faith and practice, be shown?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The Scriptures do not, as claimed, ascribe authority to oral
          tradition. Tradition, as intended by Paul in the passage cited (2 Thes
          2:15, and 2 Thes 3:6), signifies all his instructions, oral and
          written, communicated to those very people themselves, not handed
          down. On the other hand, Christ rebuked this doctrine of the Romanists
          in their predecessors, the Pharisees, Mat 15:3, Mat 15:6; Mark 7:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. It is improbable a priori that God would supplement Scripture
          with tradition as part of our rule of faith. (1) Because Scripture, as
          will be shown below (questions 7-14), is certain, definite, complete,
          and perspicuous. (2) Because tradition, from its very nature, is
          indeterminate, and liable to become adulterated with every form of
          error. Besides, as will be shown below (question 20), the authority of
          Scripture does not rest ultimately upon tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd The whole ground upon which Romanists base the authority of their
          traditions (viz., history and church authority) is invalid. (1)
          History utterly fails them. For more than three hundred years after
          the apostles they have very little, and that contradictory, evidence
          for any one of their traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are thus forced to the absurd assumption that what was taught in
          the fourth century was therefore taught in the third, and therefore in
          the first. (2) The church is not infallible, as will be shown below
          (question 18).
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Their practice is inconsistent with their own principles. Many of
          the earliest and best attested traditions they do not receive. Many of
          their pretended traditions are recent inventions unknown to the
          ancients.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Many of their traditions, such as relate to the priesthood, the
          sacrifice of the mass, etc., are plainly in direct opposition to
          Scripture. Yet the infallible church affirms the infallibility of
          Scripture. A house divided against itself cannot stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What is necessary to constitute a sole and infallible rule of
          faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          Plenary inspiration, completeness, perspicuity or clarity, and
          accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. What arguments do the Scriptures themselves afford in favor of the
          doctrine that they are the only infallible rule of faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The Scriptures always speak in the name of God, and command faith
          and obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Christ and his apostles always refer to the written Scriptures,
          then existing, as authority, and to no other rule of faith
          whatsoever.-- Luke 16:29; Luke 10:26; John 5:39; Rom 4:3; 2 Tim 3:15.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The Bereans are commended for bringing all questions, even
          apostolic teaching, to this test.-- Acts 17:11; see also Isa 8:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Christ rebukes the Pharisees for adding to and perverting the
          Scriptures.-- Mat 15:7-9; Mark 7:5-8; see also Rev 22:18-19, and Deut
          4:2; Deut 12:32; Josh 1:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. In what sense is the completeness of Scripture as a rule of faith
          asserted?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not meant that the Scriptures contain every revelation which God
          has ever made to man, but that their contents are the only
          supernatural revelation that God does now make to man, and that this
          revelation is abundantly sufficient for man's guidance in all
          questions of faith, practice, and modes of worship, and excludes the
          necessity and the right of any human inventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. How may this completeness be proved, from the design of scripture?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures profess to lead us to God. Whatever is necessary to
          that end they must teach us. If any supplementary rule, as tradition,
          is necessary to that end, they must refer us to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Incompleteness here would be falsehood." But while one sacred writer
          constantly refers us to the writings of another, not one of them ever
          intimates to us either the necessity or the existence of any other
          rule.-- John 20:31; 2 Tim 3:15-17.
        </p>
        <p>9. By what other arguments may this principle be proved?</p>
        <p>
          As the Scriptures profess to be a rule complete for its end, so they
          have always been practically found to be such by the true spiritual
          people of God in all ages. They teach a complete and harmonious system
          of doctrine. They furnish all necessary principles for the government
          of the private lives of Christians, in every relation, for the public
          worship of God, and for the administration of the affairs of his
          kingdom; and they repel all pretended -traditions and priestly
          innovations.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. In what sense do Protestants affirm and Romanists deny the
          perspicuity of Scripture?
        </p>
        <p>
          Protestants do not affirm that the doctrines revealed in the
          Scriptures are level to man's powers of understanding. Many of them
          are confessedly beyond all understanding. Nor do they affirm that
          every part of Scripture can be certainly and perspicuously expounded,
          many of the prophesies being perfectly obscure until explained by the
          event. But they do affirm that every essential article of faith and
          rule of practice is clearly revealed in Scripture, or may certainly be
          deduced therefrom. This much the least instructed Christian may learn
          at once; while, on the other hand, it is true, that with the advance
          of historical and critical knowledge, and by means of controversies,
          the Christian church is constantly making progress in the accurate
          interpretation of Scripture, and in the comprehension in its integrity
          of the system therein taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protestants affirm and Romanists deny that private and unlearned
          Christians may safely be allowed to interpret Scripture for
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. How can the perspicuity of scripture be proved from the fact that
          it is a law and a message?
        </p>
        <p>
          We saw (question 8) that Scripture is either complete or false, from
          its own professed design. We now prove its perspicuity upon the same
          principle. It professes to be (1) a law to be obeyed; (2) a revelation
          of truth to be believed, to be received by us in both aspects upon the
          penalty of eternal death. To suppose it not to be perspicuous,
          relatively to its design of commanding and teaching is to charge God
          with clearing with us in a spirit at once disingenuous and cruel.
        </p>
        <p>12. In what passages is their perspicuity asserted?</p>
        <p>
          Ps 19:7-8; Ps 119:1-5, Ps 119:130; 2 Cor 3:14; 2 Pet 1:18-19; Hab 2:2;
          2 Tim 3:15, 2 Tim 3:17.
        </p>
        <p>13. By what other arguments may this point be established?</p>
        <p>
          1st. The Scriptures are addressed immediately, either to all men
          indiscriminately, or else to the whole body of believers as such.--
          Deut 6:4-9; Luke 1:3; Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 1:1; 2 Cor 4:2; Gal
          1:2; Eph 1:1; Php 1:1; Col 1:2; James 1:1; 1 Pet 1:1; 2 Pet 1:1; 1 Jn
          2:12, 1 Jn 2:14; Jud 1:1; Rev 1:3-4; Rev 2:7. The only exceptions are
          the epistles to Timothy and Titus.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. All Christians indiscriminately are commanded to search the
          Scriptures.-- 2 Tim 3:15, 2 Tim 3:17; Acts 17:11; John 5:39.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Universal experience. We have the same evidence of the
          light-giving power of Scripture that we have of the same property in
          the sun. The argument to the contrary, is an insult to the
          understanding of the whole world of Bible readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The essential unity in faith and practice, in spite of all
          circumstantial differences, of all Christian communities of every age
          and nation, who draw their religion directly from the open Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. What was the third quality required to constitute the scriptures
          the sufficient rule of faith and practice?
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessibility. It is self-evident that this is the pre-eminent
          characteristic of the Scriptures, in contrast to tradition, which is
          in the custody of a corporation of priests, and to every other
          pretended rule whatsoever. The agency of the church in this matter is
          simply to give all currency to the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. What is meant by saying that the Scriptures are the judge as well
          as the rule in questions of faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          "A rule is a standard of judgment; a judge is the expounder and
          applier of that rule to the decision of particular cases." The
          Protestant doctrine is--
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. That the Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. (1) negatively. That there is no body of men who are either
          qualified, or authorized, to interpret the Scriptures, or apply their
          principles to the decision of particular questions, in a sense binding
          upon the faith of their fellow Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Positively. That Scripture is the only infallible voice in the
          church, and is to be interpreted, in its own light, and with the
          gracious help of the Holy Ghost, who is promised to every Christian (1
          Jn 2:20-27), by each individual for himself; with the assistance,
          though not by the authority, of his fellow Christians. Creeds and
          confessions, as to form, bind only those who voluntarily profess them,
          and as to matter, they bind only so far as they affirm truly what the
          Bible teaches, and because the Bible does so teach.
        </p>
        <p>
          16. What is the Romish doctrine regarding the authority of the church
          as the infallible interpreter of the rule of faith and the
          authoritative judge of all controversies?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romish doctrine is that the church is absolutely infallible in all
          matters of Christian faith and practice, and the divinely authorized
          depository and interpreter of the rule of faith. Her office is not to
          convey new revelations from God to man, yet her inspiration renders
          her infallible in disseminating and interpreting the original
          revelation communicated through the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church, therefore, authoritatively determines--1st. What is
          Scripture. 2nd. What is genuine tradition 3rd. What is the true sense
          of Scripture and 'tradition', and what is the true application of that
          perfect rule to every particular question of belief or practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This authority vests in the pope, when acting in his official
          capacity, and in the bishops as a body, as when assembled in general
          council, or when giving universal consent to a decree of pope or
          council.--"Decrees of Council of Trent," Session 4.; "Deus Theo.," N.
          80, 81, 84, 93, 94, 95, 96. "Bellarmine," Lib. 3., de eccles., cap.
          14., and Lib. 2., de council., cap. 2.
        </p>
        <p>17. By what arguments do they seek to establish this authority?</p>
        <p>
          1st. The promises of Christ, given, as they claim, to the apostles,
          and to their official successor, securing their infallibility, and
          consequent authority.-- Mat 16:18; Mat 18:18-20; Luke 24:47-49; John
          16:13; John 20:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The commission given to the church as the teacher of the world.--
          Mat 28:19-20; Luke 10:16, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The church is declared to be "the pillar and ground of the
          truth," and it is affirmed that "the gates of hell shall never prevail
          against her."
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. To the church is granted power to bind and loose, and he that
          will not hear the church is to be treated as a heathen. Mat 16:19; Mat
          18:15-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. The church is commanded to discriminate between truth and error,
          and must consequently be qualified and authorized to do so-- 2 Thes
          3:6; Rom 16:17; 2 Jn 1:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. From the necessity of the case, men need and crave an
          ever-living, visible, and cotemporaneous infallible Interpreter and
          Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. From universal analogy every community among men has the living
          judge as well as the written law, and the one would be of no value
          without the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          8th. This power is necessary to secure unity and universality, which
          all acknowledge to be essential attributes of the true church.
        </p>
        <p>
          18. By what arguments may this claim of the Romish church be shown to
          be utterly baseless?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. A claim vesting in mortal men a power so momentous can be
          established only by the most clear and certain evidence, and the
          failure to produce such converts the claim into a treason at once
          against God and the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Her evidence fails, because the promises of Christ to preserve
          his church from extinction and from error do none of them go the
          length of pledging infallibility. The utmost promised is, that the
          true people of God shall never perish entirely from the earth, or be
          left to apostatize from the essentials of the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Her evidence fails, because these promises of Christ were
          addressed not to the officers of the church as such, but to the body
          of true believers. Compare John 20:23 with Luke 24:33, Luke 24:47-49
          and 1 Jn 2:20, 1 Jn 2:27.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Her evidence fails, because the church to which the precious
          promises of the Scriptures are pledged is not an external, visible
          society, the authority of which is vested in the hands of a perpetual
          line of apostles. For-- (1) the word church ekklhsia is a collective
          term, embracing the effectually called klhtoi or regenerated.-- Rom
          1:7; Rom 8:28; 1 Cor 1:2; Jud 1:1; Rev 17:14; also Rom 9:24; 1 Cor
          7:18-24; Gal 1:15; 2 Tim 1:9; Heb 9:15; 1 Pet 2:9; 1 Pet 5:10; Eph
          1:18; 2 Pet 1:10. (2) The attributes ascribed to the church prove it
          to consist alone of the true, spiritual people of God as such.-- Eph
          5:27; 1 Pet 2:5; John 10:27; Col 1:18, Col 1:24. (3) The epistles are
          addressed to the church, and in their salutations explain that phrase
          as equivalent to "the called,""the saints,""all true worshippers of
          God;" witness the salutations of 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Ephesians,
          Colossians, 1st and 2nd Peter and Jude. The same attributes are
          ascribed to the members of the true church as such throughout the body
          of the Epistles.-- 1 Cor 1:30; 1 Cor 3:16; 1 Cor 6:11, 1 Cor 6:19; Eph
          2:3-8, and Eph 2:19-22; 1 Thes 5:4-5; 2 Thes 2:13; Col 1:21; Col 2:10;
          1 Pet 2:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. The inspired apostles have had no successors. (1) There is no
          evidence that they had such in the New Testament. (2) While provision
          was made for the regular perpetuation of the offices of presbyter and
          deacon (1 Tim 3:1-13), there are no directions given for the
          perpetuation of the apostolate. (3) There is perfect silence
          concerning the continued existence of any apostles in the church in
          the writings of the early centuries. Both the name and the thing
          ceased. (4) No one ever claiming to be one of their successors have
          possessed the "signs of an apostle."-- 2 Cor 12:12; 1 Cor 9:1; Gal
          1:1, Gal 1:12; Acts 1:21-22.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. This claim, as it rests upon the authority of the Pope, is
          utterly unscriptural, because the Pope is not known to Scripture. As
          it rests upon the authority of the whole body of the bishops,
          expressed in their general consent, it is unscriptural for the reasons
          above shown, and it is, moreover, impracticable, since their universal
          judgment never has been and never can be impartially collected and
          pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. There can be no infallibility where there is not self-
          consistency. But as a matter of fact the Papal church has not been
          self-consistent in her teaching. (1) She has taught different
          doctrines in different sections and ages. (2) She affirms the
          infallibility of the holy Scriptures, and at the same time teaches a
          system plainly and radically inconsistent with their manifest sense;
          witness the doctrines of the priesthood, the mass, penance, of works,
          and of Mary worship. Therefore the Church of Rome hides the Scriptures
          from the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          8th. If this Romish system be true then genuine spiritual religion
          ought to flourish in her communion, and all the rest of the world
          ought to be a moral desert. The facts are notoriously the reverse. If;
          therefore, we admit that the Romish system is true, we subvert one of
          the principal evidences of Christianity itself; viz., the
          self-evidencing light and practical power of true religion, and the
          witness of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          19. By what direct arguments may the doctrine that the Scriptures are
          the final judge of controversies be established?
        </p>
        <p>
          That all Christians are to study the Scriptures for themselves, and
          that in all questions as to God's revealed will the appeal is to the
          Scriptures alone, is proved by the following facts:
        </p>
        <p>1st. Scripture is perspicuous, see above, questions 11-13.</p>
        <p>
          2nd. Scripture is addressed to all Christians as such, see above,
          question 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. All Christians are commanded to search the scriptures, and by
          them to judge all doctrines and all professed teachers.-- John 5:39;
          Acts 17:11; Gal 1:8; 2 Cor 4:2; 1 Thes 5:21; 1 Jn 4:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The promise of the Holy Spirit, the author and interpreter of
          Scripture, is to all Christians as such. Compare John 20:23 with Luke
          24:47-49; 1 Jn 2:20, 1 Jn 2:27; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 3:16-17.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Religion is essentially a personal matter. Each Christian must
          know and believe the truth explicitly for himself; on the direct
          ground of its own moral and spiritual evidence, and not on the mere
          ground of blind authority. Otherwise faith could not be a moral act,
          nor could it "purify the heart." Faith derives its sanctifying power
          from the truth which it immediately apprehends on its own experimental
          evidence.-- John 17:17, John 17:19; James 1:18; 1 Pet 1:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          20. What is the objection which the Romanists make to this doctrine,
          on the ground that the church is our only authority for believing that
          the scriptures are the word of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          Their objection is, that as we receive the scriptures as the word of
          God only on the authoritative testimony of the church, our faith in
          the Scriptures is only another form of our faith in the church, and
          the authority of the church, being the foundation of that of
          Scripture, must of course be held paramount.
        </p>
        <p>This is absurd, for two reasons--</p>
        <p>
          1st. The assumed fact is false. The evidence upon which we receive
          Scripture as the word of God is not the authority of the church, but--
          (1) God did speak by the apostles and prophets, as is evident (a) from
          the nature of their doctrine, (b) from their miracles, (c) their
          prophecies, (d) our personal experience and observation of the power
          of the truth. (2) These very writings which we possess were written by
          the apostles, etc., as is evident, (a) from internal evidence, (b)
          from historical testimony rendered by all competent cotemporaneous
          witnesses in the church or out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Even if the fact assumed was true, viz., that we know the
          Scriptures to be from God, on the authority of the church's testimony
          alone, the conclusion they seek to deduce from it would be absurd. The
          witness who proves the identity or primogenitor of a prince does not
          thereby acquire a right to govern the kingdom, or even to interpret
          the will of the prince.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. How is the argument for the necessity of a visible judge, derived
          from the diversities of sects and doctrines among Protestants, to be
          answered?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. We do not pretend that the private judgment of Protestants is
          infallible, but only that when exercised in a humble, believing
          spirit, it always leads to a competent knowledge of essential truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The term Protestant is simply negative, and is assumed by many
          infidels who protest as much against the Scriptures as they do against
          Rome. But Bible Protestants, among all their circumstantial
          differences, are, to a wonderful degree, agreed upon the essentials of
          faith and practice. Witness their hymns and devotional literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The diversity that does actually exist arises from failure in
          applying faithfully the Protestant principles for which we contend.
          Men do not simply and without prejudice take their creed from the
          Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The Catholic church, in her last and most authoritative utterance
          through the Council of Trent, has proved herself a most indefinite
          Judge. Her doctrinal decisions need an infallible interpreter
          infinitely more than the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          22. How may it be shown that the Romanist theory, as well as the
          Protestant, necessarily throws upon the people the obligation of
          private judgment?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there a God? Has he revealed himself? Has he established a church?
          Is that church an infallible teacher? Is private judgment a blind
          leader? Which of all pretended churches is the true one? Every one of
          these questions evidently must be settled in the Private judgment of
          the inquirer, before he can, rationally or irrationally, give up his
          private judgment to the direction of the self-asserting church. Thus
          of necessity Romanists appeal to the Scriptures to prove that the
          Scriptures cannot be understood, and address arguments to the private
          judgment of men to prove that private judgment is incompetent; thus
          basing an argument upon that which it is the object of the argument to
          prove is baseless.
        </p>
        <p>
          23. How may it be proved that the people are far more competent to
          discover what the Bible teaches than to decide, by the marks insisted
          upon by the Romanists, which is the true church?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romanists, of necessity, set forth certain marks by which the true
          church is to be discriminated from all counterfeits. These are (1)
          Unity (through subjection to one visible head, the Pope) ; (2)
          Holiness; (3) Catholicity; (4) Apostolicity, (involving an
          uninterrupted succession from the apostles of canonically ordained
          bishops) --"Cat. of Council of Trent," Part 1., Cap. 10. Now, the
          comprehension and intelligent application of these marks involve a
          great amount of learning and intelligent capacity upon the part of the
          inquirer. He might as easily prove himself to be descended from Noah
          by an unbroken series of legitimate marriages, as establish the right
          of Rome to the last mark. Yet he cannot rationally give up the right
          of studying the Bible for himself until that point is made clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely the Scriptures, with their self-evidencing spiritual power,
          make less exhaustive demands upon the resources of private judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          ROMAN CATHOLIC DOCTRINE AS TO THE PRIVATE INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE,
          AND AS TO TRADITION, AND AS TO THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE POPE.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE.--"Decrees of council of
          Trent," Sess. 4.--"Moreover the same sacred and holy Synod ordains and
          declares, that the said old and Vulgate edition, which, by the
          lengthened usage of so many ages, has been approved of in the Church,
          be in public lectures, disputations, sermons, and expositions held as
          authentic; and that no one is to dare or presume to reject it under
          any pretext whatever."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Furthermore, in order to restrain petulant spirits, it decrees that
          no one, relying on his own skill shall in matters of faith and of
          morals pertaining to the edification of Christian doctrine, wresting
          the sacred Scripture to his own senses, presume to interpret the said
          sacred scripture contrary to that sense which holy mother
          church--whose it is to judge of the true sense and interpretation of
          the Holy scriptures--hath held and doth hold, or even contrary to the
          unanimous consent of the Fathers; even though such interpretations
          were never (intended) to be at any time published."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dogmatic Decrees of the Vatican council," ch. 2.--"And as the things
          which the holy Synod of Trent decreed for the good of souls concerning
          the interpretation of Divine Scripture, in order to curb rebellious
          spirits, have been wrongly explained by some, we, renewing the said
          decree, declare this to be their sense, that, in matters of faith and
          morals, appertaining to the building up of Christian doctrine, that is
          to be held as the true sense of Holy Scripture which our holy mother
          Church hath held and holds, to whom it belongs to judge of the true
          sense of the Holy Scripture; and therefore that it is permitted to no
          one to interpret the sacred scripture contrary to this sense, nor,
          likewise contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers. "
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. AS TO TRADITION.--"Prof. Fidei Tridentinoe"-- (A. D. 1564) 2. and
          3. "I most steadfastly admit and embrace apostolic and ecclesiastic
          traditions, and all other observances and constitutions of the same
          Church. I also admit the Holy scriptures, according to that sense
          which our holy mother Church has held and does hold, to which it
          belongs to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the
          Scriptures, neither will I ever take and interpret them otherwise than
          according, to the unanimous consent of the Fathers."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Council of Trent," Sess. 4.--"And seeing clearly that this truth and
          discipline are contained in the written books, and the unwritten
          traditions which, received by the apostles from the mouth of Christ
          himself or from the apostles themselves the Holy Ghost dictating, have
          come down even unto us transmitted as it were from hand to hand."
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. AS TO THE ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE.--"Dogmatic Decisions of
          the Vatican Council," chap. 3.--"Hence we teach and declare that by
          the appointment of our Lord . . . the power of jurisdiction of the
          Roman Pontiff is immediate, to which all, of whatever rite and
          dignity, both pastors and faithful, both individually and
          collectively, are bound, by their duty of hierarchical subordination
          and true obedience, to submit not only in matters which belong to
          faith and morals, but also in those that appertain to the discipline
          and government of the Church throughout the world. . . . We further
          teach and declare that he is the supreme judge of the faithful, and
          that in all causes, the decision of which belongs to the Church,
          recourse may be had to his tribunal, and that none may reopen the
          judgment of the Apostolic See, than whose authority there is no
          greater, nor can any lawfully review his judgment. Wherefore they err
          from the right course who assert that it is lawful to appeal from the
          judgments of the Roman Pontiff to an ecumenical council, as to an
          authority higher than that of the Roman Pontiff."
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. CONCERNING THE ABSOLUTE INFALLIBILITY OF THE POPE AS THE TEACHER
          OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH.--"Dogmatic Decrees of the Vatican Council,"
          Chap. 4.--"Therefore faithfully adhering to the tradition received
          from the beginning of the Christian faith, for the glory of God our
          Saviour, the exaltation of the Catholic religion, and the salvation of
          Christian people, the sacred Council approving, we teach and define
          that it is a dogma divinely revealed:That the Roman Pontiff when he
          speaks ex cathedra, that is, when in discharge of the office of pastor
          and doctor of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic
          authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to he held
          by the universal Church, by the divine assistance promised to him in
          blessed Peter, is possessed of the infallibility with which the divine
          Redeemer willed that his Church should be endowed for defining
          doctrine according to faith and morals; and that therefore such
          definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable of themselves, and
          not from the consent of the church. But if any one--which may God
          avert--presume to contradict this our definition:let him be anathema."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cardinal Manning in his "Vatican Council" says, "In this definition
          there are six points to be noted:"
        </p>
        <p>
          "1st. It defines the meaning of the well-known phrase loquens ex
          cathedra ; that is, speaking from the Seat, or place, or with the
          authority of the supreme teacher of all Christians, and binding the
          assent of the universal Church."
        </p>
        <p>
          "2nd. The subject matter of the infallible teaching, namely, the
          doctrine of faith and morals."
        </p>
        <p>
          "3rd. The efficient cause of infallibility, that is, the divine
          assistance promised to Peter, and in Peter to his successors."
        </p>
        <p>
          "4th. The act to which this divine assistance is attached, the
          defining of doctrines of faith and morals."
        </p>
        <p>
          "5th. The extension of this infallible authority to the limits of the
          doctrinal office of the Church."
        </p>
        <p>
          "6th. The dogmatic value of the definitions ex cathedra, namely that
          they are in themselves irreformable, because in themselves infallible,
          and not because the Church, or any part or member of the Church,
          should assent to them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dogmatic Decrees of Vatican Council" Ch. 4.--"For the Holy Spirit was
          not promised to the successors of Peter, that by his revelation they
          might make known new doctrine; but that by his assistance they might
          inviolably keep and faithfully expound the revelation or deposit of
          faith delivered through the Apostles."
