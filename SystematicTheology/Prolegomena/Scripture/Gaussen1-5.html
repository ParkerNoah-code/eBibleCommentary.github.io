        <h2>V. Individuality of the Sacred Writings</h2>
        <p>
          The individuality of the sacred writers, so profoundly stamped on the
          books they have respectively written, seems to many impossible to be
          reconciled with a plenary inspiration. No one, say they, can read the
          Scriptures without being struck with the differences of language,
          conception, and style, discernible in their authors; so that even were
          the titles of the several books to give us no intimation that we were
          passing from one author to another, still we should almost instantly
          discover, from the change of their character, that we had no longer to
          do with the same writer, but that a new personage had taken the pen.
          This diversity reveals itself even on comparing one prophet with
          another prophet, and one apostle with another apostle. Who could read
          the writings of Isaiah and Ezekiel, of Amos and Hosea, of Zephaniah
          and Habakkuk, of Jeremiah and Daniel, and proceed to study those of
          Paul and Peter, or of John, without observing, with respect to each of
          them, how much his views of the truth, his reasonings, and his
          language, have been influenced by his habits, his condition in life,
          his genius, his education, his recollections—all the circumstances, in
          short, that have acted upon his outer and inner man? They tell us what
          they saw, and just as they saw it. Their memory is put into
          requisition, their imagination is called into exercise, their
          affections are drawn out—their whole being is at work, and their moral
          physiognomy is clearly delineated. We are sensible that the
          composition of each has greatly depended, both as to its essence and
          its form, on its author's circumstances and peculiar turn of mind.
          Could the son of Zebedee have composed the Epistle to the Romans, as
          we have received it from the apostle Paul? Who would think of
          attributing to him the Epistle to the Hebrews? And although the
          Epistles general of Peter were without their title, who would ever
          think of ascribing them to John? It is thus, likewise, with the
          evangelists. All four are very distinctly recognisable, although they
          all speak of the same Master, profess the same doctrines, and relate
          the same acts. Such, we are told, is the fact, and the following
          consequences are boldly deduced from it:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Were it God who speaks alone and constantly in the Scriptures, we
          should see, in their various parts, an uniformity which is not to be
          found there.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It must be admitted that two different impulses have acted at the
          same time on the same authors, while they were composing the
          Scriptures; the natural impulses of their individuality, and the
          miraculous impulses of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There must have resulted from the conflict, the concurrence, or the
          balanced action of these two forces,—an inspiration variable, gradual,
          sometimes entire, sometimes imperfect, and ofttimes even reduced to
          the feeble measure of a mere superintendence.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The variable power of the Divine Spirit, in this combined action,
          must have been in the ratio of the importance and the difficulty of
          the matters treated of by the sacred author. He might even have
          abstained from any intervention when the judgment and the
          recollections of the writer could suffice, inasmuch as God never
          performs useless miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It belongs not to man to say where nature ends, and where inspiration
          begins," says Bishop Wilson.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The exaggeration we find in the notions which some have entertained
          of inspiration," says Dr Twesten, "does not consist in their having
          extended them to all, but in their having extended them to all
          equally. If inspiration does not exclude the personal action of the
          sacred authors, no more does it destroy all influence proceeding from
          human imperfection. But we may suppose this influence to be more and
          more feeble in the writers, in proportion as the matter treated of is
          more intimately related to Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr Dick recognises three degrees of inspiration in the holy
          Scriptures:—"1. There are many things in the Scriptures which the
          writers might have known, and probably did know, by ordinary means.…
          In these cases, no supernatural influence was necessary to enlighten
          and invigorate their minds; it was only necessary that they should be
          infallibly preserved from error. 2. There are other passages of
          Scripture, in composing which the minds of the writers must have been
          supernaturally endowed with more than ordinary vigour.… 3. It is
          manifest, with respect to many passages of Scripture, that the
          subjects of which they treat must have been directly revealed to the
          writers."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Hence it follows, that if this plenary inspiration were sometimes
          necessary, still, with respect to matters at once easy and of no
          religious importance, there might be found in the Scriptures some
          harmless errors, and some of those stains ever left by the hand of man
          on all he touches. While the energies of the divine mind, by an action
          always powerful, and often victorious, enlarged the comprehension of
          the men of God, purified their affections, and led them to seek out,
          from among all their recollections of the past, those which might be
          most usefully transmitted to the Church of God, the natural energies
          of their own minds, left to themselves in so far as regarded all
          details of no consequence either to faith or virtue, may have led to
          the occurrence in the Scriptures of some mixture of inaccuracy and
          imperfection. "We must not therefore," says M. Twesten, "attribute an
          unlimited infallibility to the Scripture, as if there were no error
          there. No doubt God is truth, and in matters of importance all that is
          from him is truth; but if all be not of equal importance, all does not
          then proceed equally from him; and if inspiration does not exclude the
          personal action of the sacred authors, no more does it destroy all
          influence of human imperfection."
        </p>
        <p>
          All these authors include in their assumptions and conclusions the
          notion, that there are some passages in the Scriptures quite devoid of
          importance, and that there are others alloyed with error. We shall
          erelong repel with all our might both these imputations; but this is
          not yet the place for it. The only question we have to do with here,
          is that respecting the living and personal form under which the
          Scriptures of God have been given to us, and its alleged
          incompatibility with the fact of a plenary inspiration. To this we
          proceed to reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We begin by declaring how far we are from contesting the fact
          alleged, while, however, we reject the false consequences that are
          deduced from it. So far are we from not acknowledging this human
          individuality stamped throughout on our sacred books, that, on the
          contrary, it is with profound gratitude—with an ever-growing
          admiration—that we contemplate this living, actual, dramatic,
          humanitary character diffused with so powerful and charming an effect
          through all parts of the book of God. Yes (we cordially unite with the
          objectors in saying it), here is the phraseology, the tone, the accent
          of a Moses; there, of a John: here, of an Isaiah; there, of an Amos:
          here, of a Daniel or of a Peter; there, of a Nehemiah, there again of
          a Paul. We recognise them, listen to them, see them. Here, one may
          say, there is no room for mistake We admit the fact; we delight in
          studying it; we profoundly admire it; and we see in it, as we shall
          have occasion more than once to repeat, one additional proof of the
          divine wisdom which has dictated the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Of what consequence to the fact of the divine inspiration is the
          absence or the concurrence of the sacred writers' affections? Cannot
          God equally employ them or dispense with them? He who can make a
          statue speak, can he not, as he pleases, make a child of man speak? He
          who rebuked by means of a dumb animal the madness of one prophet, can
          he not put into another prophet the sentiments or the words which suit
          best the plan of his revelations? He that caused to come forth from
          the wall a hand, without any mind of its own to direct it, that it
          might write for him those terrible words, "Mene, mene, tekel,
          upharsin," could he not equally guide the intelligent and pious pen of
          his apostle, in order to its tracing for him such words as these: "I
          say the truth in Christ, and my conscience bears me witness in the
          Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my
          heart, for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, and who are
          Israelites"? Know you how God acts, and how he abstains from acting?
          Will you teach us the mechanism of inspiration? Will you say what is
          the difference between its working where individuality is
          discoverable, and its working where individuality is not discoverable?
          Will you explain to us why the concurrence of the thoughts, the
          recollections, and the emotions of the sacred writers, should diminish
          aught of their theopneustia? and will you tell us whether this very
          concurrence may not form part of it? There is a gulf interposed
          betwixt the fact of this individuality and the consequence you deduce
          from it; and your understanding is no more competent to descend into
          that gulf to contest the reality of theopneustia than ours is to
          explain it. Was there not a great amount of individuality in the
          language of Caiaphas, when that wicked man, full of the bitterest
          spite, abandoning himself to the counsels of his own evil heart, and
          little dreaming that he was giving utterance to the words of God,
          cried out in the Jewish council, "Ye know nothing at all, nor consider
          that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people?"
          Certainly there was in these words, we should say, abundance of
          individuality; and yet we find it written that Caiaphas spake this not
          of himself (ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ), but that, being high priest for that year,
          "he prophesied," unconsciously, that Jesus should die, "in order that
          he might gather into one the children of God that were scattered
          abroad."—(John 11:49–52.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, then, should not the same Spirit, in order to the utterance of
          the words of God, employ the pious affections of the saints, as well
          as the wicked and hypocritical thoughts of his most detestable
          adversaries?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. When a man tells us that if, in such or such a passage, the style
          be that of Moses or of Luke, of Ezekiel or of John, then it cannot be
          that of God—it were well that he would let us know what is God's
          style. One would call our attention, forsooth, to the accent of the
          Holy Ghost—would show us how to recognise him by the peculiar cast of
          his phraseology, by the tone of his voice; and would tell us wherein,
          in the language of the Hebrews or in that of the Greeks, his supreme
          individuality reveals itself!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It should not be forgotten, that the sovereign action of God, in
          the different fields in which it is displayed, never excludes the
          employment of second causes. On the contrary, it is in the
          concatenation of their mutual bearings that he loves to make his
          mighty wisdom shine forth. In the field of creation he gives us plants
          by the combined employment of all the elements—heat, moisture,
          electricity, the atmosphere, light, the mechanical attraction of the
          capillary vessels, and the manifold operations of the organs of
          vegetation. In the field of providence, he accomplishes the
          development of his vastest plans by means of the unexpected
          concurrence of a thousand millions of human wills, alternately
          intelligent and yielding, or ignorant and rebellious. "Herod and
          Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel" (influenced by so
          many diverse passions), "were gathered together," he tells us, only
          "to do whatsoever his hand and counsel had determined before to be
          done." Thus, too, in the field of prophecy does he bring his
          predictions to their accomplishment. He prepares, for example, long
          beforehand, a warlike prince in the mountains of Persia, and another
          in those of Media; the former of these he had indicated by name two
          hundred years before; he unites them at the point named with ten other
          nations against the empire of the Chaldeans; he enables them to
          surmount a thousand obstacles; and makes them at last enter the great
          Babylon, at the moment when the seventy years, so long marked out for
          the captivity of the Jewish people, had come to a close. In the field
          of his miracles, even, he is pleased still to make use of second
          causes. There he had only to say, "Let the thing be, and it would have
          its being;" but he desired, by employing inferior agents, even in that
          case to let us know that it is he that gives power to the feeblest of
          them. To divide the Red Sea, he not only causes the rod of Moses to be
          stretched out over the deep—he sends from the east a mighty wind,
          which blows all night, and makes the waters go back. To cure the man
          that was born blind, he makes clay and anoints his eyelids. In the
          field of redemption, instead of converting a soul by an immediate act
          of his will, he presents motives to it, he makes it read the Gospel,
          he sends preachers to it; and thus it is that, while it is he who
          "gives us to will and to do according to his good pleasure," he
          "begets us by his own will, by the word of truth." Well, then, why
          should it not be thus in the field of inspiration (theopneustia)?
          Wherefore, when he sends forth his Word, should he not cause it to
          enter the understanding, the heart, and the life of his servants, as
          he puts it upon their lips? Wherefore should he not associate their
          personality with what they reveal to us? Wherefore should not their
          sentiments, their history, their experiences, form part of their
          inspiration (theopneustia)?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What may, moreover, clearly expose the error involved in this
          alleged difficulty, is the extreme inconsistency shown in the use that
          is made of it? In fact, in order to impugn the plenary inspiration of
          certain portions of the Scriptures, the individuality with which they
          are marked is insisted on; and yet it is admitted that other parts of
          the sacred books, in which this character is equally manifest, must
          have been given directly by God, even to the most minute details.
          Isaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the author of the Apocalypse,
          have each stamped upon their prophecies their peculiar style,
          features, manner—in a word, their mark; just as Luke, Mark, John,
          Paul, and Peter have been able to do in their narratives, or in their
          letters. There is no validity, then, in the objection. If it proved
          any thing, it would prove too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. What still farther strikes us in this objection, and in the
          intermittent system of inspiration with which it is associated, is its
          triple character of complication, rashness, and childishness.
          Complication; for it is assumed that the divine action, in dictating
          the Scriptures, intermitted or fell off as often as the passage falls
          in the scale of difficulty, or in the scale of importance; and thus
          God is made to retire or advance successively in the mind of the
          sacred writer during the course of one and the same chapter, or one
          and the same passage! Rashness; for the majesty of the Scriptures not
          being recognised, it is boldly assumed that they are of no importance,
          and require no wisdom beyond that of man, except in some of their
          parts. We add childishness; one is afraid, it is alleged, to attribute
          to God useless miracles,—as if the Holy Ghost, after having, as is
          admitted, dictated, word for word, one part of the Scriptures, must
          find less trouble in doing nothing more elsewhere than aiding the
          sacred author by enlightening him, or leaving him to write by himself
          under mere superintendence!
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But this is by no means all. What most of all makes us protest
          against a theory according to which the Scriptures are classed into
          the inspired, the half-inspired, and the uninspired (as if this sorry
          doctrine behoved to flow from the individuality stamped upon them), is
          its direct opposition to the Scriptures. One part of the Bible is from
          man (people venture to say), and the other part is from God. And yet,
          mark what its own language on the subject is. It protests that "ALL
          Scripture is given by inspiration of God." It points to no exception.
          What right, then, can we have to make any, when itself admits none?
          Just because people tell us, if there be in the Scriptures a certain
          number of passages which could not have been written except under
          plenary inspiration, there are others for which it would have been
          enough for the author to have received some eminent gifts, and others
          still which might have been composed even by a very ordinary person!
          Be it so; but how does this bear upon the question? When you have been
          told who the author of a book is, you know that all that is in that
          book is from him—the easy and the difficult, the important and the
          unimportant. If, then, the whole Bible "is given by inspiration of
          God," of what consequence is it to the question that there are
          passages, in your eyes, more important or more difficult than others?
          The least among the companions of Jesus might no doubt have given us
          that 5th verse of the 11th chapter of St John, "Now Jesus loved
          Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus;" as the most petty schoolmaster
          also might have composed that first line of Athalie, "Into his temple,
          lo! I come, Jehovah to adore." But were we told that the great Racine
          employed some village schoolmaster to write out his drama, at his
          dictation, should we not continue, nevertheless, still to attribute to
          him all its parts—its first line, the notation of the scenes, the
          names of the dramatis personæ, the indications of their exits and
          their entrances, as well as the most sublime strophes of his choruses?
          If, then, God himself declares to us his having dictated the whole
          Scriptures, who shall dare to say that that 5th verse of the 11th
          chapter of St John is less from God than the sublime words with which
          the Gospel begins, and which describe to us the eternal Word?
          Inspiration, no doubt, may be perceptible in certain passages more
          clearly than in others; but it is not, on that account, less real in
          the one case than in the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a word, were there some parts of the Bible without inspiration, no
          longer could it be truly said that the whole Bible is divinely
          inspired. No longer would it be throughout the Word of God. It would
          have deceived us.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Here it is of special importance to remark, that this fatal system
          of a gradual, imperfect, and intermittent inspiration, has its origin
          in that misapprehension to which we have more than once had occasion
          to advert. It is because people have almost always wished to view
          inspiration in the man, while it ought to have been seen only in the
          book. It is "ALL SCRIPTURE," it is all that is written, that is
          inspired of God. We are not told, and we are not asked, how God did
          it. All that is attested to us is that He has done it. And what we
          have to believe is simply that, whatever may have been the method he
          took for accomplishing it.

        <p>
          To this deceptive point of view, which some have thought good to take
          in contemplating the fact of inspiration, the three following
          illusions may be traced:—
        </p>
        <p>
          First; in directing their regards to inspiration in the sacred author,
          people have naturally been led to figure it to themselves as an
          extraordinary excitation in him, of which he was conscious, which took
          him out of himself, which animated him, after the manner of the
          ancient Pythonesses, with an afflatu divino, a divine fire, easily
          discernible; in such sort, that wherever his words are simple, calm,
          familiar, they have been unable to see how divine inspiration could be
          attributed to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next; in contemplating inspiration in persons, people have farther
          been led to attribute to it different degrees of perfection, seeing
          they knew that the sacred authors had themselves received very
          different measures of illumination and personal holiness. But if you
          contemplate inspiration in the book, then you will immediately
          perceive that it cannot exist there in degrees. A word is from God, or
          it is not from God. If it be from God, it is not so after two
          different fashions. Whatever may have been the spiritual state of the
          writer, if all he writes be divinely inspired, all his words are from
          God. And (mark well) it is according to this principle that no
          Christian will hesitate, any more than Jesus Christ has done, to rank
          the scriptures of Solomon with those of Moses, any more than those of
          Mark or of Matthew with those of the disciple whom Jesus loved—nay,
          with the words of the Son of God himself. They are all from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally; by a third illusion, from contemplating inspiration in the
          men who wrote the Scriptures, not in the Scriptures which they wrote,
          people have been naturally led to deem it absurd that God should
          reveal miraculously to any one what that person knew already. They
          would, on this ground, deny the inspiration of those passages in which
          the sacred writers simply tell what they had seen, or simply state
          opinions, such as any man of plain good sense might express without
          being inspired. But it will be quite otherwise the moment inspiration
          is viewed, not as in the writer, but as in that which is written. Then
          it will be seen that all has been traced under God's guidance—both the
          things which the writer knew already and those of which he knew
          nothing. Who is not sensible, to give an example, that the case in
          which I should dictate to a student a book on geometry, altogether
          differs from that in which, after having instructed him more or less
          perfectly in that science, I should employ him to compose a book on it
          himself under my auspices? In the latter work, it is true, he would
          require my intervention only in the difficult propositions; but then,
          who would think of saying the book was mine? In the former case, on
          the contrary, all parts of the book, easy and difficult alike, from
          the quadrature of the transcendental curves to the theory of the
          straight line or of the triangle, would be mine. Well, then, so is it
          with the Bible. It is not, as some will have it, a book which God
          employed men, whom he had previously enlightened, to write under his
          auspices. No—it is a book which he dictated to them; it is the word of
          God; the Spirit of the Lord spake by its authors, and his words were
          upon their tongues.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. That the style of Moses, Ezekiel, David, St Luke, and St John, may
          be at the same time God's style, is what a child might tell us. Let us
          suppose that some modern French author had thought good, at the
          commencement of the present century, to aim at popularity by borrowing
          for a time the style, we shall say, of Chateaubriand; might it not
          then be said with equal truth, but in two different senses, that the
          style was the author's and yet the style too of Chateaubriand? And if,
          to save the French from some terrible catastrophe by bringing them
          back to the Gospel, God should condescend to employ certain prophets
          among them, by the mouths of whom he should proclaim his message,
          would not these men have to preach in French? What, then, would be
          their style, and what would you require in it, in order to its being
          recognised as that of God? If such were his pleasure, one of these
          prophets might speak like Fénélon, another like Bonaparte; in which
          case there is no doubt that it would be, in one sense, the curt,
          barking, jerking style of the great captain; also, and in the same
          sense, the sustained and varied flow of the priest of Cambray's
          rounded eloquence; while in another, and a higher and truer sense, it
          would, in both these mouths, be the style of God, the manner of God,
          the word of God. No doubt, on every occasion on which he has revealed
          himself, God might have caused an awful voice to resound from heaven,
          as of old from the top of Sinai, or on the banks of the Jordan. His
          messengers, at least, might have been only angels of light. But even
          then what languages would these angels have spoken? Evidently those of
          the earth! And if he behoved on this earth to substitute for the
          syntax of heaven and the vocabulary of the archangels, the words and
          the constructions of the Hebrews or the Greeks, why not equally have
          borrowed their manners, style, and personality?
        </p>
        <p>
          10. This there is no doubt that he did, but not so as that any thing
          was left to chance. "Known unto him are all his works from the
          beginning of the world;" and just as, year after year, he causes the
          tree to put forth its leaves as well for the season when they respire
          the atmospheric elements, and, co-operating with the process at the
          roots, can safely draw nourishment from their juices, as for that in
          which the caterpillars that are to spin their silk on its branches are
          hatched and feed upon them; just as he prepared a gourd for the very
          place and the very night on which Jonah was to come and seat himself
          to the east of Nineveh, and when the next morning dawned, a gnawing
          worm when the gourd was to be withered; so, too, when he would proceed
          to the most important of his doings, and cause that Word to be written
          which is to outlast the heavens and the earth, the Lord God could
          prepare long beforehand each of those prophets, for the moment and for
          the testimony to which he had foreordained them from eternity. He
          chose them, in succession, for their several duties, from among all
          men born of women; and, with respect to them, fulfilled in its
          perfection that saying, "Send, O Lord, by the hand thou shouldst
          send."
        </p>
        <p>
          As a skilful musician, when he would execute a long score by himself,
          takes up by turns the funereal flute, the shepherd's pipe, the merry
          fife, or the trumpet that summons to battle; so did Almighty God, when
          he would make us hear his eternal word, choose out from of old the
          instruments which it seemed fit to him to inspire with the breath of
          his spirit. "He chose them before the foundation of the world, and
          separated them from their mother's womb."
        </p>
        <p>
          Has the reader ever paid a visit to the astonishing organist, who so
          charmingly elicits the tourist's tears in the Cathedral at Freiburg,
          as he touches one after another his wondrous keys, and greets your ear
          by turns with the march of warriors on the river-side, the voice of
          prayer sent up from the lake during the fury of the storm, or of
          thanksgiving when it is hushed to rest? All your senses are
          electrified, for you seem to have seen all, and to have heard all.
          Well, then, it was thus that the Lord God, mighty in harmony, applied,
          as it were, the finger of his Spirit to the stops which he had chosen
          for the hour of his purpose, and for the unity of his celestial hymn.
          He had from eternity before him all the human stops which he required;
          his Creator's eye embraces at a glance this range of keys stretching
          over threescore centuries; and when he would make known to our fallen
          world the everlasting counsel of his redemption, and the coming of the
          Son of God, he put his left hand on Enoch, the seventh man from Adam,
          and his right on John, the humble and sublime prisoner of Patmos. The
          celestial anthem, seven hundred years before the flood, began with
          these words, "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints,
          to execute judgment upon all;" but already, in the mind of God, and in
          the eternal harmony of his work, the voice of John had answered to
          that of Enoch, and closed the hymn, three thousand years after him,
          with these words, "Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall
          see him, and they also which pierced him! Even so, Lord Jesus, come
          quickly. Amen!" And during this hymn of thirty centuries, the Spirit
          of God never ceased to breathe in all his messengers; the angels, an
          apostle tells us, desired to look into its wondrous depths. God's
          elect were moved, and life eternal came down into the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between Enoch and St John, listen to Jeremiah, twenty-four centuries
          after the one, and seven hundred years before the other, "Before I
          formed thee in the belly," saith the Lord, "I knew thee; and before
          thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained
          thee a prophet unto the nations." In vain did this alarmed man
          exclaim, "Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child." The
          Lord answers him, "Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt speak
          whatsoever I command thee;" and the Lord put forth his hand and
          touched his mouth, "Behold," said he, "I have put my words in thy
          mouth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Between Enoch and Jeremiah, listen to Moses. He, too, struggles on
          Mount Horeb against the call of the Lord, "Alas, O my Lord, I am not
          eloquent; send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send."
          But the anger of the Lord is kindled against Moses. "Who hath made
          man's mouth?" he says to him. "Now therefore go, and I will be with
          thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say." Between Jeremiah
          and John, listen to Paul of Tarsus, "When it pleased God, who
          separated me from my mother's womb, to reveal his Son in me, he called
          me by his grace, that I might preach him among the heathen."
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, then, it was sometimes the artless and sublime simplicity of
          John; sometimes the impassioned, elliptical, rousing, and logical
          energy of Paul; sometimes the fervour and solemnity of Peter; it was
          Isaiah's magnificent, and David's lyrical poetry; it was the simple
          and majestic narratives of Moses, or the sententious and royal wisdom
          of Solomon—yes, it was all this; it was Peter, it was Isaiah, it was
          Matthew, it was John, it was Moses; yet it was God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are not all these which speak Galileans?" the people exclaimed on the
          day of Pentecost; yes, they are so; but the message that is on their
          lips comes from another country—it is from heaven. Listen to it; for
          tongues of fire have descended on their heads, and it is God that
          speaks to you by their mouths.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Finally, we would fain that people should understand that this
          human individuality to which our attention is directed in the
          Scriptures, far from leaving any stain there, or from being an
          infirmity there, stamps upon them, on the contrary, a divine beauty,
          and powerfully reveals to us their inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, we have said that it is God who speaks to us there, but it is
          also man;—it is man, but it is also God. Admirable Word of God! it has
          been made man in its own way, as the eternal Word was! Yes, God has
          made it also come down to us full of grace and truth, like unto our
          words in all things, yet without error and sin! Admirable Word, divine
          Word, yet withal full of humanity, much-to-be-loved Word of my God!
          Yes, in order to our understanding it, it had of necessity to be put
          upon mortal lips, that it might relate human things; and, in order to
          attract our regard, behoved to invest itself with our modes of
          thinking, and with all the emotions of our voice; for God well knew
          whereof we are made. But we have recognised it as the Word of the
          Lord, mighty, efficacious, sharper than a two-edged sword; and the
          simplest among us, on hearing it, may say like Cleopas and his friend,
          "Did not our hearts burn within us while it spoke to us?"
        </p>
        <p>
          With what a mighty charm do the Scriptures, by this abundance of
          humanity, and by all this personality with which their divinity is
          invested, remind us that the Lord of our souls, whose touching voice
          they are, does himself bear a human heart on the throne of God,
          although seated on the highest place, where the angels serve him and
          adore him for ever! It is thus, also, that they present to us not only
          that double character of variety and unity which already embellishes
          all the other works of God, as Creator of the heavens and the earth;
          but, further, that mingling of familiarity and authority, of sympathy
          and grandeur, of practical details and mysterious majesty, of humanity
          and divinity, which is rećognisable in all the dispensations of the
          same God, as Redeemer and Shepherd of his Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus, then, that the Father of mercies, while speaking in his
          prophets, behoved not only to employ their manner as well as their
          voice, and their style as well as their pen; but, further, often to
          put in operation their whole faculties of thought and feeling.
          Sometimes, in order to show us his divine sympathy there, he has
          deemed it fitting to associate their own recollections, their human
          convictions, their personal experiences, and their pious emotions,
          with the words he dictated to them; sometimes, in order to remind us
          of his sovereign intervention, he has preferred dispensing with this
          unessential concurrence of their recollections, affections, and
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>Such did the Word of God behove to be.</p>
        <p>
          Like Immanuel, full of grace and truth; at once in the bosom of God
          and in the heart of man; mighty and sympathizing; heavenly and of the
          earth; sublime and lowly; awful and familiar; God and man! Accordingly
          it bears no resemblance to the God of the Rationalists. They, after
          having, like the disciples of Epicurus, banished the Divinity far from
          man into a third heaven, would have had the Bible also to have kept
          itself there. "Philosophy employs the language of the gods," says the
          too famous Strauss of Ludwigsburg, "while religion makes use of the
          language of men." No doubt she does so; she has recourse to no other;
          she leaves to the philosophers and to the gods of this world their
          empyrean and their language. Studied under this aspect, considered in
          this character, the Word of God stands forth without its like; it
          presents attractions quite unequalled; it offers to men of all times,
          all places, and all conditions, beauties ever fresh; a charm that
          never grows old, that always satisfies, never palls. With it, what we
          find with respect to human books is reversed; for it pleases and
          fascinates, extends and rises in your regard the more assiduously you
          read it. It seems as if the book, the more it is studied and studied
          over again, grows and enlarges itself, and that some kind unseen being
          comes daily to stitch in some fresh leaves. And thus it is that the
          souls, alike of the learned and the simple, who have long nourished
          themselves on it, keep hanging upon it as the people hung of old on
          the lips of Jesus Christ. They all think it incomparable; now powerful
          as the sound of mighty waters; now soft and gentle, like the voice of
          the spouse to her bridegroom; but always perfect, "always restoring
          the soul, and making wise the simple."
        </p>
        <p>
          To what book, in this respect, would you liken it? Go and put beside
          it the discourses of Plato, or Seneca, or Aristotle, or Saint Simon,
          or Jean Jacques. Have you read Mahomet's books? Listen to him but for
          one hour, and your ears will tingle while beaten on by his piercing
          and monotonous voice. From the first page to the last, it is still the
          same sound of the same trumpet; still the same Medina horn, blown from
          the top of some mosque, minaret, or war-camel; still sybilline
          oracles, shrill and harsh, uttered in an unvarying tone of command and
          threat, whether it ordain virtue or enjoin murder; ever one and the
          same voice, surly and blustering, having no bowels, no familiarity, no
          tears, no soul, no sympathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          After trying other books, if you experience religious longings open
          the Bible; listen to it. Sometimes you find here the songs of angels,
          but of angels that have come down among the children of Adam. Here is
          the deep-sounding organ of the Most High, but an organ that serves to
          soothe man's heart and to rouse his conscience, alike in shepherd's
          cots and in palaces; alike in the poor man's garrets and in the tents
          of the desert. The Bible, in fact, has lessons for all conditions; it
          brings upon the scene both the lowly and the great; it reveals equally
          to both the love of God, and unveils in both the same miseries. It
          addresses itself to children; and it is often children that show us
          there the way to heaven and the great things of Jehovah. It addresses
          itself to shepherds and herdsmen; and it is often shepherds and
          herdsmen who lift up their voices there, and reveal to us the
          character of God. It speaks to kings and to scribes; and it is often
          kings and scribes that teach us there man's wretchedness, humiliation,
          confession, and prayer. Domestic scenes, confessions of conscience,
          pourings forth of prayer in secret, travels, proverbs, revelations of
          the depths of the heart, the holy courses pursued by a child of God,
          weaknesses unveiled, falls, recoveries, inward experiences, parables,
          familiar letters, theological treatises, sacred commentaries on some
          ancient Scripture, national chronicles, military annals, political
          statistics, descriptions of God, portraits of angels, celestial
          visions, practical counsels, rules of life, solutions of cases of
          conscience, judgments of the Lord, sacred hymns, predictions of future
          events, narratives of what passed during the days preceding our
          creation, sublime odes, inimitable pieces of poetry;—all this is found
          there by turns; and all this meets our view in most delightful
          variety, and presenting a whole whose majesty, like that of a temple,
          is overpowering. Thus it is, that, from its first to its last page,
          the Bible behoved to combine with its majestic unity the indefinable
          charm of human-like instruction, familiar, sympathetic, personal, and
          the charm of a drama extending over forty centuries. In the Bible of
          Desmarets, it is said, "There are fords here for lambs, and there are
          deep waters where elephants swim."
        </p>
        <p>
          But behold, at the same time, what unity, and, lo! what innumerable
          and profound harmonies in this immense variety! Under all forms it is
          still the same truth; ever man lost, and God the Saviour; ever man
          with his posterity coming forth out of Eden and losing the tree of
          life, and the second Adam with his people re-entering paradise, and
          regaining possession of the tree of life; ever the same cry uttered in
          tones innumerable, "O heart of man, return to thy God, for he
          pardoneth! We are in the gulf of perdition; let us come out of it; a
          Saviour hath gone down into it.… He bestows holiness as he bestows
          life."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is it possible that a book at once so sublime and so simple can be
          the work of man?" was asked of the philosophers of the last century by
          one who was himself too celebrated a philosopher. And all its pages
          have replied, No—it is impossible; for every where, traversing so many
          ages, and whichever it be of the God-employed writers that holds the
          pen, king or shepherd, scribe or fisherman, priest or publican, you
          every where perceive that one same Author, at a thousand years'
          interval, and that one same eternal Spirit, has conceived and dictated
          all;—every where, at Babylon as at Horeb, at Jerusalem as at Athens,
          at Rome as at Patmos, you will find described the same God, the same
          world, the same men, the same angels, the same future, the same
          heaven;—every where, whether it be a poet or a historian that
          addresses you, whether it be in the plains of the desert in the age of
          Pharaoh, or in the prisons of the capitol in the days of the
          Cæsars—every where in the world the same ruin; in man the same
          impotency; in the angels the same elevation, the same innocence, the
          same charity; in heaven the same purity, the same happiness, the same
          meeting together of truth and mercy, the same mutual embracing of
          righteousness and peace; the same counsels of a God who blotteth out
          iniquity, and who, nevertheless, doth not clear the guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude, therefore, that the abundance of humanity to be found in
          the Scriptures, far from compromising their divine inspiration, is
          only one farther mark of their divinity.
