        <h2>IV. Errors of Reasoning or of Doctrine</h2>
        <p>
          We abandon the various readings, other opponents will say; and we own
          that one may regard the sacred text as the original language of the
          prophets and the apostles. But this very text, intact as it is, we
          cannot study without being compelled to recognise in it the part that
          has been taken in it by human weakness. We find there reasonings ill
          conducted or ill wound up, quotations ill applied, popular
          superstitions, prejudices, and other infirmities—all this being the
          unavoidable tax which the simplicity of the men of God had to pay to
          the ignorance, on various points, of their times and of their
          condition. "St Paul," St Jerome himself has said, "does not know how
          to develop a hyperbaton, or how to conclude a sentence; and as he had
          to do with rude, uncultivated persons, he has availed himself of
          conceptions which (if he had not taken care to let us know beforehand
          that he spoke after the manner of men) might have given umbrage to
          persons of good sense." Such, then, being the marks of human infirmity
          which we can trace in the Scriptures, it remains an impossibility to
          recognise in such a book an inspiration that has descended even to the
          smallest details of their language.
        </p>
        <p>
          To these charges brought against the Scriptures our reply is fourfold.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First of all, we protest, with the utmost force of our convictions,
          against such reproaches. We maintain, that a more attentive and a more
          serious study of the Word of God would reduce them to nothing; and we
          protest, that they have no foundation but in the errors and the
          precipitation of those who advance them. This we could demonstrate, by
          repelling, one by one, all these charges, in each of the cases in
          which they have been sought to be renewed. It would prove a task more
          long than difficult, and we cannot find room for it here, for its
          details would be endless. There is not, in fact, a line of
          argument—there is not a quotation—there is not a doctrine— which the
          adversaries of the inspiration of the Scriptures have not at various
          times made a subject for reproaches; and it is well enough known that
          the greater part of objections that can be stated clearly in three
          words, require three pages for a clear refutation. It is necessary,
          therefore, that in proportion as the men of the world recommence their
          attacks, the Church should renew her replies; and that, like those
          respectful and indefatigable servants who, among the Eastern nations,
          watch day and night near the face of their king, she stand constantly
          by the side of the Word of her God, to repel those swarms of
          objections, which are no sooner seen to be driven off than they
          re-appear by another way, and incessantly return to plant some sting
          in it anew. Before inquiry—and this the experience of all ages, and in
          particular that of these last times, has sufficiently shown— before
          inquiry, those difficulties which some would object to the Scriptures
          are smoothed away; those obscurities burst into light; and erelong
          unexpected harmonies, beauties which no human eye had till then
          suspected, reveal themselves in the Word of God, by means of those
          very objections. Though today objects of doubt, to-morrow, when better
          studied, they would become to you motives to faith: today, subjects
          that distract and perplex you; to-morrow they would become proofs to
          convince and assure you.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Meanwhile we have no wish to evade any one of these charges brought
          against the Scriptures by the adversaries of the full inspiration of
          that sacred book, for it is an advantage which they give us.—Yes, and
          we are not afraid to say it: on hearing such objections, we feel
          ourselves at one and the same time under the too opposite impressions
          of satisfaction and of sadness; of sadness at seeing persons who
          acknowledge the Bible to be a revelation from God, not afraid,
          notwithstanding, to bring so hastily the most serious accusations
          against it; and of satisfaction, from considering with what force such
          language confirms the doctrine which we defend.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the mouth of a deist, they would be objections, and we behoved to
          reply; but in that of the Christians who advance them, they involve a
          flagrant abandonment of their own proper principle, and an admission
          of all the evil to be found in that abandonment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us not be misunderstood: it is not at the bar of professed
          infidels that we here maintain the plenary inspiration of the
          Scriptures; it is before men who say that they hold the Bible to be a
          revelation from God. Inspiration, we have told them, is a doctrine
          written down in that sacred book: according to its own testimony, all
          Scripture is given by inspiration of God; it is perfect, it is pure,
          it is silver seven times refined. What has been their reply?—They do
          not reject, they say, such an inspiration except with regard to the
          language, the forms of discourse and unimportant details; they
          believe, moreover, that a continual providence directed the minds of
          the sacred writers, to preserve them from all serious error. But how
          do they prove this position? Is it to the language only, is it to the
          forms of discourse, is it to insignificant details, that they
          object?—Alas! let us hear their own words: In the doctrines there are
          superstitions; in the quotations there are things misapprehended; in
          the reasonings there are weak points!—You see, then, it is thus that,
          in order to attack the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, they
          descend into the ranks of the unbelievers who cast stones at the Word
          of God; and if they will not venture, like them, to take away God from
          the Holy Bible, they would fain at least rectify God's errors in the
          Holy Bible. Which of these two attempts would be the most outrageous,
          it were hard to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude, therefore, that since it is impossible to combat plenary
          inspiration without charging the Word of God with error, we must
          necessarily cleave ever more and more to this sentence of Scripture,
          that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But we have to call attention to a still more serious view of the
          matter. We ask, Where do they mean to stop in the course they have
          begun? And by what reasons would they stop those, in their turn, who
          would fain advance farther than they are willing to go? They make bold
          to correct one saying of God's Word; what right, then, have they to
          censure those who would rectify all the rest? Creatures of a day,
          during which they fleet through this world, with the everlasting book
          of God in their hands, they are foolhardy enough to say to him: This,
          Lord, is worthy of thee, this is not worthy of thee! They make bold of
          themselves to sift God's oracles, to assign a share in them to the
          folly of man, to separate in them from the thought of the divine mind,
          proofs of ignorance shown by Isaiah and Moses, the prejudices of St
          Peter and St Jude, the paralogisms of St Paul, the superstitions of St
          John! Lamentable temerity! We repeat it: Where will they stop in this
          fatal task? for they proceed to take their seats at the same table
          where the Socinuses, the Grimaldis, and the Priestleys occupy one
          side, and the Rousseaus, the Volneys, and the Dupuis the other.
          Betwixt them and Eichhorn, betwixt them and William Cobbet, betwixt
          them and Strauss, where will you find the difference? It is in the
          species, not in the genus. It is in the quantity, and no longer in the
          quality, of imputations of error and tokens of irreverence. There is a
          difference in point of hardihood, none at all in point of profanation.
          Both pretend to have found errors in the Word of God; both take it
          upon them to rectify it. But will they tell us, is it less absurd on
          the part of a creature to set about correcting in the works of God the
          creation of the hyssop that springs from the wall, than that of the
          cedar that grows on Lebanon; to pretend to rectify the organism of a
          glow-worm than to send a supply of light to the sun? What right have
          ministers, who say they see only the language of Jewish prejudices in
          what the Evangelists relate about the demoniacs and the miracles of
          Jesus Christ in casting out unclean spirits,—what right have they to
          think it strange that such or such another person should see in the
          miracles of the conversion of St Paul, of the resurrection, of the
          multiplication of the loaves, or of the day of Pentecost, no more than
          an useful and sage complaisance for the ignorant minds of a people
          that were fond of the marvellous? What right would a professor, who
          should deny the inspiration of the reasonings of St Paul, have to
          blame M. de Wette for rejecting that of the prophecies of the Old
          Testament, or M. Wirgmann for proceeding to his Divarication of the
          New Testament, or M. Strauss, for changing into myths the miracles,
          and even the person of Jesus Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Three or four years ago, a young Bernese minister gave us a reading of
          a manual of theology, which, he said, had been put into his hands in
          one of the academies of Eastern Switzerland. We have forgotten the
          name of the author, together with that of his residence: but having at
          the time taken a note of his principal arguments against the plenary
          inspiration of the Scriptures, we can reproduce here the quotations by
          which he sought to prove that the sacred books, as they contained
          evident errors, could not be altogether the Word of God. The reader
          will understand that we cannot stop here to reply to him. All we wish
          to do is merely to give one an idea of the measure of these
          temerities.
        </p>
        <p>
          "St Paul speaks of 'having delivered an incestuous person over to
          Satan.'—(1 Cor. 5:5.) Could this passage (fanatical no doubt) have
          been inspired?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He tells them that 'we shall judge the angels.'—(1 Cor. 6:3). A
          gnostic reverie, no doubt. Could such a passage be inspired?" "He even
          goes so far as to tell them that, 'in consequence of their unworthy
          communions, many among them are sick, and some are dead.'—(1 Cor.
          11:30.) This passage cannot be inspired!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He tells them, further, 'that in Adam all die.'—(1 Cor. 15:22.)
          Judaical superstition! It is impossible that such a passage can be
          inspired!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "And when St Paul assures the Thessalonians (1 Thes. 4:15), which St
          James repeats (James 5:8), 'that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh,'
          could so manifest an error be inspired?"
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus, then, that men dare to sit in judgment on the eternal
          Word! We still remain unaware, we have said, if these doctrines,
          professed in Switzerland ten or twelve years ago, were so professed at
          Zurich more than elsewhere. But if they were actually in vogue there,
          then one must excuse, alas! the magistrates of that city, if we would
          not deal unfairly by them. It was not they who called Strauss into
          their country, in order to subvert the faith of a whole people there;
          for Strauss was already in their professors' chairs, if such teachers
          delivered their opinions from them. They had seen them with ample
          scissors in hand, cutting out from the Scriptures the errors of the
          apostles. What difference could they perceive betwixt such men and the
          man they called? A little more learning, boldness, consistency, in
          following out his principles; and in his more practised hand, a longer
          and sharper instrument; but hardly more heartfelt contempt for the
          Scriptures of God! Among the judges of the Sanhedrim who smote Jesus
          on the face we should make little difference as to the number of blows
          they severally dealt; and when sixty conspirators in the palace of
          Pompey threw down Cæsar from his throne of gold in the midst of the
          senate, Casca, who first grazed him with his sword, was no less his
          murderer than Cassius, who clove his head, or than the sixty
          conspirators, who on all sides drew their swords on him, and pierced
          him with twenty-three wounds. Is the doctor, then, who denies the
          inspiration of an argument or of a doctrine of the Scriptures, less in
          revolt against the God of the Scriptures than the man who rejects the
          inspiration of a whole book? We think not.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude, that since the man who denies the plenary inspiration of
          the Scriptures necessarily enters on the career of daring temerities,
          and gives the signal, by the first thrust of his sword, for all the
          revolts that may follow against the Word of God, we must, once more,
          look more narrowly to that saying of the Holy Ghost: "All Scripture is
          given by inspiration of God."
        </p>
        <p>But we have one last reflection farther to make.</p>
        <p>
          4. You do not, it seems, comprehend the divinity, the propriety, the
          wisdom, the utility of such or such a passage of the Scriptures; and,
          on that account, you deny their inspiration!—Is this an argument that
          can have any real value, we do not say in our eyes, but in yours? Who
          are you? "Keep thy foot when thou goest into the house of God," feeble
          child of man, "and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice
          of fools: for they consider not the evil that they do. Be not rash
          with thy mouth: God is in heaven, and thou upon earth." Who art thou,
          then, who wouldst judge the oracles of God? Hath not the Scripture
          itself told us beforehand, that it would be to some a stumbling-block,
          and to others foolishness;2 that the natural man receiveth not the
          things of the Spirit of God, and that he cannot even do so, and that
          they are spiritually discerned? Ought you not, therefore, to expect to
          feel at first some repugnance in mind, in heart, in conscience, even
          to its first teachings? Man must first return to his place as a weak,
          ignorant, and demoralized creature! He cannot comprehend God until he
          has humbled himself. Let him go and cast himself upon his knees in his
          closet; let him pray, and he will comprehend what it means! An
          argument is ill grounded, because you do not seize its scope! a
          doctrine is a prejudice, because you do not admit it! a quotation is
          not to the point, because its true meaning has escaped you! What would
          remain in the world, were God to leave nothing there but what you
          could explain? The Emperors of Rome, incapable of understanding either
          the lives or the faith of our martyrs, threw them to the wild beasts
          in the amphitheatre, and had their bodies dragged to the Tiber. It is
          thus that people strike their own defective knowledge, like an impure
          hook, into the Word of God, and drag to the public dunghill whatever
          they have been unable to understand, and have condemned!
        </p>
        <p>
          While tracing these lines, we are reminded of a teacher of divinity,
          in other respects an honourable man, but imbued with the wisdom of his
          own age, who set himself to prove that the reasonings of St Paul are
          not inspired. Now, how went he about to demonstrate this? Why, he
          quoted as a convincing example a passage (Gal. 3:16) in which St Paul
          proposes, not to prove (mark this well—the whole solution lies here),
          not to prove, but to AFFIRM that the promise made by God to Abraham
          and his posterity, regarded not all his posterities (since it was
          evident enough that his posterities by Agar, by Keturah, by Esau, were
          rejected), but one special, elected and personal posterity. And what
          think you the professor did to establish his thesis on this passage?
          Why, he palmed on the apostle an argument so puerile, that the merest
          child among the Galatians might have reproved him for it! St Paul,
          according to him, instead of doing no more than affirm a fact, meant
          to argue from the singular of a collective noun that such a word could
          designate no more than a single person! Absurd as it is for us, said
          he, this argument might be good for the Jews, or for the gross-minded
          Gauls of Asia Minor. We give this example; a hundred more of the same
          value might easily be produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the author venture here to refer to his own experience? He
          recollects, with no less humiliation than gratitude, his earliest and
          his latest impressions on the Epistles of St Paul. He was enabled,
          from his earliest years, to come to the conviction that the Bible is
          from God; but he did not yet understand the doctrines which it
          teaches. He wished to respect the apostle's pages, because he saw,
          through other marks, that the not-to-be-counterfeited seals of the
          most high God are suspended there; but in reading them he was agitated
          with a secret uneasiness, which drove him to other books. St Paul
          appeared to him to reason wrong—not to go straight to his point; to
          discourse in a round-about and embarrassed manner; to wind about his
          subject in long spiral turnings, and to say the things that were
          attributed to him quite differently from what one himself would have
          wished to have done. In a word, he felt, in reading them, somewhat of
          the painful discomfort of a tenderly affectionate son as he waits on a
          declining parent whose memory is beginning to fail, and who stammers
          in his attempts to speak. O how anxiously would he conceal from
          others, and dissemble to himself, that his venerated father totters,
          and seems no longer to be himself! But no sooner had Divine grace
          revealed to us that doctrine of the righteousness of faith, which is
          the burning and shining flame of the Scriptures, than every word
          became light, harmony, and life; the apostle's reasonings seemed
          limpid as the water that flows from the rock; his thoughts profound
          and practical; all his epistles a power of God unto salvation for
          those who believe. We saw abundant proofs of divinity shine forth from
          those very parts of the Scriptures which had long given us such
          uneasiness; and we could say, with the joy of one who has made a
          discovery, and with the gratitude of a tender adoration, as we felt
          inimitable, and until then silent, chords vibrate within us, in unison
          with the Word of God, "Yes, my God, all the Scriptures are divinely
          inspired!" …
