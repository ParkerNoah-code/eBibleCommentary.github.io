        <p>
          THE religion of the Bible is a frankly supernatural religion. By this
          is not meant merely that, according to it, all men, as creatures,
          live, move and have their being in God. It is meant that, according to
          it, God has intervened extraordinarily, in the course of the sinful
          world's development, for the salvation of men otherwise lost. In Eden
          the Lord God had been present with sinless man in such a sense as to
          form a distinct element in his social environment (Gen. iii. 8). This
          intimate association was broken up by the Fall. But God did not
          therefore withdraw Himself from concernment with men. Rather, He began
          at once a series of interventions in human history by means of which
          man might be rescued from his sin and, despite it, brought to the end
          destined for him. These interventions involved the segregation of a
          people for Himself, by whom God should be known, and whose distinction
          should be that God should be "nigh unto them" as He was not to other
          nations (Deut. iv. 7; Ps. cxlv. 18). But this people was not permitted
          to imagine that it owed its segregation to anything in itself fitted
          to attract or determine the Divine preference; no consciousness was
          more poignant in Israel than that Jehovah had chosen it, not it Him,
          and that Jehovah's choice of it rested solely on His gracious will.
          Nor was this people permitted to imagine that it was for its own sake
          alone that it had been singled out to be the sole recipient of the
          knowledge of Jehovah; it was made clear from the beginning that God's
          mysteriously gracious dealing with it had as its ultimate end the
          blessing of the whole world (Gen. xii. 2.3; xvii. 4.5.6.16; xviii. 18;
          xxii. 18; cf Rom. iv. 13), the bringing together again of the divided
          families of the earth under the glorious reign of Jehovah, and the
          reversal of the curse under which the whole world lay for its sin
          (Gen. xii. 3). Meanwhile, however, Jehovah was known only in Israel.
          To Israel God showed His word and made known His statutes and
          judgments, and after this fashion He dealt with no other nation; and
          therefore none other knew His judgments (Ps. cxlvii. 19 f.).
          Accordingly, when the hope of Israel (who was also the desire of all
          nations) came, His own lips unhesitatingly declared that the salvation
          He brought, though of universal application, was "from the Jews" On.
          iv. 221). And the nations to which this salvation had not been made
          known are declared by the chief agent in its proclamation to them to
          be, meanwhile, "far off," "having no hope" and "without God in the
          world" (Eph. ii. 12), because they were aliens from the commonwealth
          of Israel and strangers from the covenant of the promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The religion of the Bible thus announces itself, not as the product of
          men's search after God, if haply they may feel after Him and find Him,
          but as the creation in men of the gracious God, forming a people for
          Himself, that they may show forth His praise. In other words, the
          religion of the Bible presents itself as distinctively a revealed
          religion. Or rather, to speak more exactly, it announces itself as the
          revealed religion, as the only revealed religion; and sets itself as
          such over against all other religions, which are represented as all
          products, in a sense in which it is not, of the art and device of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not, however, implied in this exclusive claim to revelation -
          which is made by the religion of the Bible in all the stages of its
          history -that the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and
          the sea and all that in them is, has left Himself without witness
          among the peoples of the world (Acts xiv. 17). It is asserted indeed,
          that in the process of His redemptive work, God suffered for a season
          all the nations to walk in their own ways; but it is added that to
          none of them has He failed to do good, and to give from heaven rains
          and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness. And
          not only is He represented as thus constantly showing Himself in His
          providence not far from any one of them, thus wooing them to seek Him
          if haply they might feel after Him and find Him (Acts xvii. 27), but
          as from the foundation of the world openly manifesting Himself to them
          in the works of His hands, in which His everlasting power and Divinity
          are clearly seen (Rom. i. 20). That men at large have not retained Him
          in their knowledge, or served Him as they ought, is not due therefore
          to failure on His part to keep open the way to knowledge of Him, but
          to the darkening of their senseless hearts by sin and to the vanity of
          their sin-deflected reasonings (Rom. i. 21 ff.), by means of which
          they have supplanted the truth of God by a lie and have come to
          worship and serve the creature rather than the ever-blessed Creator.
          It is, indeed, precisely because in their sin they have thus held down
          the truth in unrighteousness and have refused to have God in their
          knowledge (so it is intimated) ; and because, moreover, in their sin,
          the revelation God gives of Himself in His works of creation and
          providence no longer suffices for men's needs, that God has intervened
          supernaturally in the course of history to form a people for Himself,
          through whom at length all the world should be blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is quite obvious that there are brought before us in these several
          representations two species or stages of revelation, which should be
          discriminated to avoid confusion. There is the revelation which God
          continuously makes to all men: by it His power and Divinity are made
          known. And there is the revelation which He makes exclusively to His
          chosen people: through it His saving grace is made known. Both species
          or stages of revelation are insisted upon throughout the Scriptures.
          They are, for example, brought significantly together in such a
          declaration as we find in Ps. xix : "The heavens declare the glory of
          God . . . their line is gone out through all the earth" (vers. 1.4) ;
          "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul" (ver. 7). The
          Psalmist takes his beginning here from the praise of the glory of God,
          the Creator of all that is, which has been written upon the very
          heavens, that none may fail to see it. From this he rises, however,
          quickly to the more full-throated praise of the mercy of Jehovah, the
          covenant God, who has visited His people with saving instruction. Upon
          this higher revelation there is finally based a prayer for salvation
          from sin, which ends in a great threefold acclamation, instinct with
          adoring gratitude: "O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer " (ver, 14).
          "The heavens," comments Lord Bacon, "indeed tell of the glory of God,
          but not of His will according to which the poet prays to be pardoned
          and sanctified." In so commenting, Lord Bacon touches the exact point
          of distinction between the two species or stages of revelation. The
          one is adapted to man as man; the other to man as sinner; and since
          man, on becoming sinner, has not ceased to be man, but has only
          acquired new needs requiring additional provisions to bring him to the
          end of his existence, so the revelation directed to man as sinner does
          not supersede that given to man as man, but supplements it with these
          new provisions for his attainment, in his new condition of blindness,
          helplessness and guilt induced by sin, of the end of his being.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two species or stages of revelation have been commonly
          distinguished from one another by the distinctive names of natural and
          supernatural revelation, or general and special revelation, or natural
          and soteriological revelation. Each of these modes of discriminating
          them has its particular fitness and describes a real difference
          between the two in nature, reach or purpose. The one is communicated
          through the media of natural phenomena, occurring in the course of
          Nature or of history; the other implies an intervention in the natural
          course of things and is not merely in source but in mode supernatural.
          The one is addressed generally to all intelligent creatures, and is
          therefore accessible to all men; the other is addressed to a special
          class of sinners, to whom God would make known His salvation. The one
          has in view to meet and supply the natural need of creatures for
          knowledge of their God; the other to rescue broken and deformed
          sinners from their sin and its consequences. But, though thus
          distinguished from one another, it is important that the two species
          or stages of revelation should not be set in opposition to one
          another, or the closeness of their mutual relations or the constancy
          of their interaction be obscured. They constitute together a unitary
          whole, and each is incomplete without the other. In its most general
          idea, revelation is rooted in creation and the relations with His
          intelligent creatures into which God has brought Himself by giving
          them being. Its object is to realize the end of man's creation, to be
          attained only through knowledge of God and perfect and unbroken
          communion with Him. On the entrance of sin into the world, destroying
          this communion with God and obscuring the knowledge of Him derived
          from Nature, another mode of revelation was necessitated, having also
          another content, adapted to the new relation to God and the new
          conditions of intellect, heart and will brought about by sin. It must
          not be supposed, however, that this new mode of revelation was an ex
          post facto expedient, introduced to meet an unforeseen contingency.
          The actual course of human development was in the nature of the case
          the expected and the intended course of human development, for which
          man was created; and revelation, therefore, in its double form was the
          Divine purpose for man from the beginning, and constitutes a unitary
          provision for the realization of the end of his creation in the actual
          circumstances in which he exists. We may distinguish in this unitary
          revelation the two elements by the cooperation of which the effect is
          produced; but we should bear in mind that only by their cooperation is
          the effect produced. Without special revelation, general revelation
          would be for sinful men incomplete and ineffective, and could issue,
          as in point of fact it has issued wherever it alone has been
          accessible, only in leaving them without excuse (Rom. i. 20). Without
          general revelation, special revelation would lack that basis in the
          fundamental knowledge of God as the mighty and wise, righteous and
          good, maker and ruler of all things, apart from which the further
          revelation of this great God's interventions in the world for the
          salvation of sinners could not be either intelligible, credible or
          operative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only in Eden has general revelation been adequate to the needs of man.
          Not being a sinner, man in Eden had no need of that grace of God
          itself by which sinners are restored to communion with Him, or of the
          special revelation of this grace of God to sinners to enable them to
          live with God. And not being a sinner, man in Eden, as he contemplated
          the works of God, saw God in the unclouded mirror of his mind with a
          clarity of vision, and lived with Him in the untroubled depths of his
          heart with a trustful intimacy of association, inconceivable to
          sinners. Nevertheless, the revelation of God in Eden was not merely
          "natural." Not only does the prohibition of the forbidden fruit
          involve a positive commandment (Gen. ii. 16), but the whole history
          implies an immediacy of intercourse with God which cannot easily be
          set to the credit of the picturesque art of the narrative, or be fully
          accounted for by the vividness of the perception of God in His works
          proper to sinless creatures. The impression is strong that what is
          meant to be conveyed to us is that man dwelt with God in Eden, and
          enjoyed with Him immediate and not merely mediate communion. In that
          case, we may understand that if man had not fallen, he would have
          continued to enjoy immediate intercourse with God, and that the
          cessation of this immediate intercourse is due to sin. It is not then
          the supernaturalness of special revelation which is rooted in sin,
          but, if we may be allowed the expression, the specialness of
          supernatural revelation. Had man not fallen, heaven would have
          continued to lie about him through all his history, as it lay about
          his infancy; every man would have enjoyed direct vision of God and
          immediate speech with Him. Man having fallen, the cherubim and the
          flame of a sword, turning every way, keep the path: and God breaks His
          way in a round-about fashion into man's darkened heart to reveal there
          His redemptive love. By slow steps and gradual stages He at once works
          out His saving purpose and molds the world for its reception, choosing
          a people for Himself and training it through long and weary ages,
          until at last when the fulness of time has come, He bares His arm and
          sends out the proclamation of His great salvation to all the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, from the gate of Eden onward, God's general revelation
          ceased to be, in the strict sense, supernatural. It is, of course, not
          meant that God deserted His world and left it to fester in its
          iniquity. His providence still ruled over all, leading steadily onward
          to the goal for which man had been created, and of the attainment of
          which in God's own good time and way the very continuance of men's
          existence, under God's providential government, was a pledge. And His
          Spirit still everywhere wrought upon the hearts of men, stirring up
          all their powers (though created in the image of God, marred and
          impaired by sin) to their best activities, and to such splendid effect
          in every department of human achievement as to command the admiration
          of all ages, and in the highest region of all, that of conduct, to
          call out from an apostle the encomium that though they had no law they
          did by nature (observe the word "nature") the things of the law. All
          this, however, remains within the limits of Nature, that is to say,
          within the sphere of operation of Divinely directed and assisted
          second causes. It illustrates merely the heights to which the powers
          of man may attain under the guidance of providence and the influences
          of what we have learned to call God's "common grace." Nowhere,
          throughout the whole ethnic domain, are the conceptions of God and His
          ways put within the reach of man, through God's revelation of Himself
          in the works of creation and providence, transcended; nowhere is the
          slightest knowledge betrayed of anything concerning God and His
          purposes, which could be known only by its being supernaturally told
          to men. Of the entire body of "saving truth," for example, which is
          the burden of what we call "special revelation," the whole heathen
          world remained in total ignorance. And even its hold on the general
          truths of religion, not being vitalized by supernatural enforcements,
          grew weak, and its knowledge of the very nature of God decayed, until
          it ran out to the dreadful issue which Paul sketches for us in that
          inspired philosophy of religion which he incorporates in the latter
          part of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind even the ethnic development, there lay, of course, the
          supernatural intercourse of man with God which had obtained before the
          entrance of sin into the world, and the supernatural revelations at
          the gate of Eden (Gen. iii. 8), and at the second origin of the human
          race, the Flood (Gen. viii. 21,22; ix. 1-17 ). How long the tradition
          of this primitive revelation lingered in nooks and corners of the
          heathen world, conditioning and vitalizing the natural revelation of
          God always accessible, we have no means of estimating. Neither is it
          easy to measure the effect of God's special revelation of Himself to
          His people upon men outside the bounds of, indeed, but coming into
          contact with, this chosen people, or sharing with them a common
          natural inheritance. Lot and Ishmael and Esau can scarcely have been
          wholly ignorant of the word of God which came to Abraham and Isaac and
          Jacob; nor could the Egyptians from whose hands God wrested His people
          with a mighty arm fail to learn something of Jehovah, any more than
          the mixed multitudes who witnessed the ministry of Christ could fail
          to infer something from His gracious walk and mighty works. It is
          natural to infer that no nation which was intimately associated with
          Israel's life could remain entirely unaffected by Israel's revelation.
          But whatever impressions were thus conveyed reached apparently
          individuals only: the heathen which surrounded Israel, even those most
          closely affiliated with Israel, remained heathen; they had no
          revelation. In the sporadic instances when God visited an alien with a
          supernatural communication - such as the dreams sent to Abimelech
          (Gen. xx.) and to Pharaoh (Gen. xl. xli.) and to Nebuchadnezzar (Dan,
          ii. 1 ff.) and to the soldier in the camp of the Midian (Jgs. vii. 13)
          - it was in the interests, not of the heathen world, but of the chosen
          people that they were sent; and these instances derive their
          significance wholly from this fact. There remain, no doubt, the
          mysterious figure of Melchizedek, perhaps also of Jethro, and the
          strange apparition of Balaam, who also, however, appear in the sacred
          narrative only in connection with the history of God's dealings with
          His people and in their interest. Their unexplained appearance cannot
          in any event avail to modify the general fact that the life of the
          heathen peoples lay outside the supernatural revelation of God. The
          heathen were suffered to walk in their own ways (Acts xiv. 16).

        <h2 id="2" href="#ref2">II. THE PROCESS OF REVELATION</h2>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, however, God had not forgotten them, but was preparing
          salvation for them also through the supernatural revelation of His
          grace that He was making to His people. According to the Biblical
          representation, in the midst of and working confluently with the
          revelation which He has always been giving of Himself on the plane of
          Nature, God was making also from the very fall of man a further
          revelation of Himself on the plane of grace. In contrast with His
          general, natural revelation, in which all men by virtue of their very
          nature as men share, this special, supernatural revelation was granted
          at first only to individuals, then progressively to a family, a tribe,
          a nation, a race, until, when the fulness of time was come, it was
          made the possession of the whole world. It may be difficult to obtain
          from Scripture a clear account of why God chose thus to give this
          revelation of His grace only progressively; or, to be more explicit,
          through the process of a historical development. Such is, however, the
          ordinary mode of the Divine working: it is so that God made the
          worlds, it is so that He creates the human race itself, the recipient
          of this revelation, it is so that He builds up His kingdom in the
          world and in the individual soul, which only gradually comes whether
          to the knowledge of God or to the fruition of His salvation. As to the
          fact, the Scriptures are explicit, tracing for us, or rather embodying
          in their own growth, the record of the steady advance of this gracious
          revelation through definite stages from its first faint beginnings to
          its glorious completion in Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          So express is its relation to the development of the kingdom of God
          itself, or rather to that great series of Divine operations which are
          directed to the building up of the kingdom of God in the world, that
          it is sometimes confounded with them, or thought of as simply their
          reflection in the contemplating mind of man. Thus it is not
          infrequently said that revelation, meaning this special redemptive
          revelation, has been communicated in deeds, not in words; and it is
          occasionally elaborately argued that the sole manner in which God has
          revealed Himself as the Saviour of sinners is just by performing those
          mighty acts by which sinners are saved. This is not, however, the
          Biblical representation. Revelation is, of course, often made through
          the instrumentality of deeds; and the series of His great redemptive
          acts by which He saves the world constitutes the preeminent revelation
          of the grace of God - so far as these redemptive acts are open to
          observation and are perceived in their significance. But revelation,
          after all, is the correlate of understanding and has as its proximate
          end just the production of knowledge, though not, of course, knowledge
          for its own sake, but for the sake of salvation. The series of the
          redemptive acts of God, accordingly, can properly be designated
          "revelation" only when and so far as they are contemplated as adapted
          and designed to produce knowledge of God and His purpose and methods
          of grace. No bare series of unexplained acts can be thought, however,
          adapted to produce knowledge, especially if these acts be, as in this
          case, of a highly transcendental character. Nor can this particular
          series of acts be thought to have as its main design the production of
          knowledge; its main design is rather to save man. No doubt the
          production of knowledge of the Divine grace is one of the means by
          which this main design of the redemptive acts of God is attained. But
          this only renders it the more necessary that the proximate result of
          producing knowledge should not fail; and it is doubtless for this
          reason that the series of redemptive acts of God has not been left to
          explain itself, but the explanatory word has been added to it.
          Revelation thus appears, however, not as the mere reflection of the
          redeeming acts of God in the minds of men, but as a factor in the
          redeeming work of God, a component part of the series of His redeeming
          acts, without which that series would be incomplete and so far
          inoperative for its main end. Thus the Scriptures represent it, not
          confounding revelation with the series of the redemptive acts of God,
          but placing it among the redemptive acts of God and giving it a
          function as a substantive element in the operations by which the
          merciful God saves sinful men. It is therefore not made even a mere
          constant accompaniment of the redemptive acts of God, giving their
          explanation that they may be understood. It occupies a far more
          independent place among them than this, and as frequently precedes
          them to prepare their way as it accompanies or follows them to
          interpret their meaning. It is, in one word, itself a redemptive act
          of God and by no means the least important in the series of His
          redemptive acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This might, indeed, have been inferred from its very nature, and from
          the nature of the salvation which was being wrought out by these
          redemptive acts of God. One of the most grievous of the effects of sin
          is the deformation of the image of God reflected in the human mind,
          and there can be no recovery from sin which does not bring with it the
          correction of this deformation and the reflection in the soul of man
          of the whole glory of the Lord God Almighty. Man is an intelligent
          being; his superiority over the brute is found, among other things,
          precisely in the direction of all his life by his intelligence; and
          his blessedness is rooted in the true knowledge of his God - for this
          is life eternal, that we should know the only true God and Him whom He
          has sent. Dealing with man as an intelligent being, God the Lord has
          saved him by means of a revelation, by which he has been brought into
          an ever more and more adequate knowledge of God, and been led ever
          more and more to do his part in working out his own salvation with
          fear and trembling as he perceived with ever more and more clearness
          how God is working it out for him through mighty deeds of grace.

        <p>
          This is not the place to trace, even in outline, from the material
          point of view, the development of God's redemptive revelation from its
          first beginnings, in the promise given to Abraham - or rather in what
          has been called the Protevangelium at the gate of Eden - to its
          completion in the accent and work of Christ and the teaching of His
          apostles; a steadily advancing development, which, as it lies spread
          out to view in the pages of Scripture, takes to those who look at it
          from the consummation backward, the appearance of the shadow cast
          athwart preceding ages by the great figure of Christ. Even from the
          formal point of view, however, there has been pointed out a
          progressive advance in the method of revelation, consonant with its
          advance in content, or rather with the advancing stages of the
          building up of the kingdom of God, to subserve which is the whole
          object of revelation. Three distinct steps in revelation have been
          discriminated from this point of view. They are distinguished
          precisely by the increasing independence of revelation of the deeds
          constituting the series of the redemptive acts of God, in which,
          nevertheless, all revelation is a substantial element. Discriminations
          like this must not be taken too absolutely; and in the present
          instance the chronological sequence cannot be pressed. But, with much
          interlacing, three generally successive stages of revelation may be
          recognized, producing periods at least characteristically of what we
          may somewhat conventionally call theophany, prophecy and inspiration.
          What may be somewhat indefinitely marked off as the Patriarchal age is
          characteristically "the period of Outward Manifestations, and Symbols,
          and Theophanies": during it "God spoke to men through their senses, in
          physical phenomena, as the burning bush, the cloudy pillar, or in
          sensuous forms, as men, angels, etc. . . . In the Prophetic age, on
          the contrary, the prevailing mode of revelation was by means of inward
          prophetic inspiration": God spoke to men characteristically by the
          movements of the Holy Spirit in their hearts." Prevailingly, at any
          rate from Samuel downwards, the supernatural revelation was a
          revelation in the hearts of the foremost thinkers of the people, or,
          as we call it, prophetic inspiration, without the aid of external
          sensuous symbols of God" (A. B. Davidson, OT Prophecy, 1903, p. 148;
          cf. pp. 12-14, 145 ff.). This internal method of revelation reaches
          its culmination in the New Testament period, which is preeminently the
          age of the Spirit. What is especially characteristic of this age is
          revelation through the medium of the written word, what may be called
          apostolic as distinguished from prophetic inspiration. The revealing
          Spirit speaks through chosen men as His organs, but through these
          organs in such a fashion that the most intimate processes of their
          souls become the instruments by means of which He speaks His mind.
          Thus at all events there are brought clearly before us three
          well-marked modes of revelation, which we may perhaps designate
          respectively, not with perfect discrimination, it is true, but not
          misleadingly, (1) external manifestations, (2) internal suggestion,
          and (3) concursive operation.

        <h2 id="3" href="#ref3">III. MODES OF REVELATION</h2>
        <p>
          Theophany may be taken as the typical form of "external
          manifestation"; but by its side may be ranged all of those mighty
          works by which God makes Himself known, including express miracles, no
          doubt, but along with them every supernatural intervention in the
          affairs of men, by means of which a better understanding is
          communicated of what God is or what, are His purposes of grace to a
          sinful race. Under "internal suggestion" may be subsumed all the
          characteristic phenomena of what is most. properly spoken of as
          "prophecy": visions and dreams, which, according to a fundamental
          passage (Num. xii. 6), constitute the typical forms of prophecy, and
          with them the whole "prophetic word," which shares its essential
          characteristic with visions and dreams, since it comes not by the will
          of man but from God. By "concursive operation" may be meant that form
          of revelation illustrated in an inspired psalm or epistle or history,
          in which no human activity - not even the control of the will - is
          superseded, but the Holy Spirit works in, with and through them all in
          such a manner as to communicate to the product qualities distinctly
          superhuman. There is no age in the history of the religion of the
          Bible, from that of Moses to that of Christ and His apostles, in which
          all these modes of revelation do not find place. One or another may
          seem particularly characteristic of this age or of that; but they all
          occur in every age. And they occur side by side, broadly speaking, on
          the same level. No discrimination is drawn between them in point of
          worthiness as modes of revelation, and much less in point of purity in
          the revelations communicated through them. The circumstance that God
          spoke to Moses, not by dream or vision but mouth to mouth, is, indeed,
          adverted to (Num. xii. 8) as a proof of the peculiar favor shown to
          Moses and even of the superior dignity of Moses above other organs of
          revelation: God admitted him to an intimacy of intercourse which He
          did not accord to others. But though Moses was thus distinguished
          above all others in the dealings of God with him, no distinction is
          drawn between the revelations given through him and those given
          through other organs of revelation in point either of Divinity or of
          authority. And beyond this we have no Scriptural warrant to go on in
          contrasting one mode of revelation with another. Dreams may seem to us
          little fitted to serve as vehicles of Divine communications. But there
          is no suggestion in Scripture that revelations through dreams stand on
          a lower plane than any others; and we should not fail to remember that
          the essential characteristics of revelations through dreams are shared
          by all forms of revelation in which (whether we should call them
          visions or not) the images or ideas which fill, or pass in procession
          through, the consciousness are determined by some other power than the
          recipient's own will. It may seem natural to suppose that revelations
          rise in rank in proportion to the fulness of the engagement of the
          mental activity of the recipient in their reception. But we should
          bear in mind that the intellectual or spiritual quality of a
          revelation is not derived from the recipient but from its Divine
          Giver. The fundamental fact in all revelation is that it is from God.
          This is what gives unity to the whole process of revelation, given
          though it may be-in divers portions and in divers manners and
          distributed though it may be through the ages in accordance with the
          mere will of God, or as it may have suited His developing purpose-
          this and its unitary end, which is ever the building up of the kingdom
          of God. In whatever diversity of forms, by means of whatever variety
          of modes, in whatever distinguishable stages it is given, it is ever
          the revelation of the One God, and it is ever the one consistently
          developing redemptive revelation of God. On a prima facie view it may
          indeed seem likely that a difference in the quality of their
          supernaturalness would inevitably obtain between revelations given
          through such divergent modes. The completely supernatural character of
          revelations given in theophanies is obvious. He who will not allow
          that God speaks to man, to make known His gracious purposes toward
          him, has no other recourse here than to pronounce the stories
          legendary. The objectivity of the mode of communication which is
          adopted is intense, and it is thrown up to observation with the
          greatest emphasis. Into the natural life of man God intrudes in a
          purely supernatural manner, bearing a purely supernatural
          communication. In these communications we are given accordingly just a
          series of "naked messages of God." But not even in the Patriarchal age
          were all revelations given in theophanies or objective appearances.
          There were dreams, and visions, and revelations without explicit
          intimation in the narrative of how they were communicated. And when we
          pass on in the history, we do not, indeed, leave behind us theophanies
          and objective appearances. It is not only made the very characteristic
          of Moses, the greatest figure in the whole history of revelation
          except only that of Christ, that he knew God face to face (Deut.
          xxxiv. 10), and God spoke to him mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and
          not in dark speeches (Num. xii. 8); but throughout the whole history
          of revelation down to the appearance of Jesus to Paul on the road to
          Damascus, God has shown Himself visibly to His servants whenever it
          has seemed good to Him to do so and has spoken with them in objective
          speech. Nevertheless, it is expressly made the characteristic of the
          Prophetic age that God makes Himself known to His Servants "in a
          vision," "in a dream" (Num. xii. 6). And although, throughout its
          entire duration, God, in fulfilment of His promise (Deut. xviii. 18),
          put His words in the mouths of His prophets and gave them His
          commandments to speak, yet it would seem inherent in the very
          employment of men as instruments of revelation that the words of God
          given through them are spoken by human mouths; and the purity of their
          supernaturalness may seem so far obscured. And when it is not merely
          the mouths of men with which God thus serves Himself in the delivery
          of His messages, but their minds and hearts as well - the play of
          their religious feelings, or the processes of their logical reasoning,
          or the tenacity of their memories, as, say, in a psalm or in an
          epistle, or a history -the supernatural element in the communication
          may easily seem to retire still farther into the background. It can
          scarcely be a matter of surprise, therefore, that question has been
          raised as to the relation of the natural and the supernatural in such
          revelations, and, in many current manners of thinking and speaking of
          them, the completeness of their supernaturalness has been limited and
          curtailed in the interests of the natural instrumentalities employed.
          The plausibility of such reasoning renders it the more necessary that
          we should observe the unvarying emphasis which the Scriptures place
          upon the absolute supernaturalness of revelation in all its modes
          alike. In the view of the Scriptures, the completely supernatural
          character of revelation is in no way lessened by the circumstance that
          it has been given through the instrumentality of men. They affirm,
          indeed, with the greatest possible emphasis that the Divine word
          delivered through men is the pure word of God, diluted with no human
          admixture whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have already been led to note that even on the occasion when -Moses
          is exalted above all other organs of revelation (Num. xii. 6 ff.), in
          point of dignity and favor, no suggestion whatever is made of any
          inferiority, in either the directness or the purity of their
          supernaturalness, attaching to other organs of revelation. There might
          never afterward arise a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the
          Lord knew face to face (Deut. xxxiv. 10). But each of the whole series
          of prophets raised up by Jehovah that the people might always know His
          will was to be like Moses in speaking to the people only what Jehovah
          commanded them (Deut. xviii. 15,18,20). In this great promise,
          securing to Israel the succession of prophets, there is also included
          a declaration of precisely how Jehovah would communicate His messages
          not so much to them as through them. "I will raise them up a prophet
          from among their brethren, like unto thee," we read (Deut. xviii. 18),
          "and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them
          all that I shall command him." The process of revelation through the
          prophets was a process by which Jehovah put His words in the mouths of
          the prophets, and the prophets spoke precisely these words and no
          others. So the prophets themselves ever asserted. "Then Jehovah put
          forth his hand, and touched my mouth," explains Jeremiah in his
          account of how he received his prophecies, "and Jehovah said unto me,
          Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth" (Jer. i. 9; cf. v. 14; Isa.
          li. 16; lix. 21; Num. xxii. 35; xxiii. 5,12,16). Accordingly, the
          words "with which" they spoke were not their own but the Lord's: "And
          he said unto me," records Ezekiel, "Son of man, go, get thee unto the
          house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them " (Ezk. iii. 4). It
          is a process of nothing other than "dictation" which is thus described
          (2 S. xiv. 3,19), though, of course, the question may remain open of
          the exact processes by which this dictation is accomplished. The
          fundamental passage which brings the central fact before us in the
          most vivid manner is, no doubt, the account of the commissioning of
          Moses and Aaron given in Ex. iv. 10-17; vii. 1-7. Here, in the most
          express words, Jehovah declares that He who made the mouth can be with
          it to teach it what to speak, and announces the precise function of a
          prophet to be that he is "a mouth of God," who speaks not his own but
          God's words. Accordingly, the Hebrew name for "prophet" ( nābhī' ),
          whatever may be its etymology, means throughout the Scriptures just
          "spokesman," though not "spokesman" in general, but spokesman by way
          of eminence, that is, God's spokesman; and the characteristic formula
          by which a prophetic declaration is announced is: "The word of Jehovah
          came to me," or the brief "saith Jehovah" ( hwhy man, ne'um Yahweh).
          In no case does a prophet put his words forward as his own words. That
          he is a prophet at all is due not to choice on his own part, but to a
          call of God, obeyed often with reluctance; and he prophesies or
          forbears to prophesy, not according to his own will but as the Lord
          opens and shuts his mouth (Ezk, iii. 26 f.) and creates for him the
          fruit of the lips (Isa. lvii. 19; cf. vi. 7; l. 4). In contrast with
          the false prophets, he strenuously asserts that he does not speak out
          of his own heart ("heart" in Biblical language includes the whole
          inner man), but all that he proclaims is the pure word of Jehovah. The
          fundamental passage does not quite leave the matter, however, with
          this general declaration. It describes the characteristic manner in
          which Jehovah communicates His messages to His prophets as through the
          medium of visions and dreams. Neither visions in the technical sense
          of that word, nor dreams, appear, however, to have been the customary
          mode of revelation to the prophets, the record of whose revelations
          has come down to us. But, on the other hand, there are numerous
          indications in the record that the universal mode of revelation to
          them was one which was in some sense a vision, and can be classed only
          in the category distinctively so called.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole nomenclature of prophecy presupposes, indeed, its
          vision-form. Prophecy is distinctively a word, and what is delivered
          by the prophets is proclaimed as the "word of Jehovah.” That it should
          be announced by the formula, "Thus saith the Lord," is, therefore,
          only what we expect; and we are prepared for such a description of its
          process as: "The Lord Jehovah . . . wakeneth mine ear to hear." He
          "hath opened mine ear" (Isa. l. 4.5). But this is not the way of
          speaking of their messages which is most usual in the prophets. Rather
          is the whole body of prophecy cursorily presented as a thing seen.
          Isaiah places at the head of his book: "The vision of Isaiah . . .
          which he saw" (cf. Isa. xxix. 10,11; Ob. ver. 1); and then proceeds to
          set at the head of subordinate sections the remarkable words, "The
          word that Isaiah . . . saw" (ii. 1) ; "the burden [margin "oracle"] .
          . . which Isaiah . . . did see" (xiii. 1). Similarly there stand at
          the head of other prophecies: "the words of Amos . . . which he saw"
          (Am. i. 1); "the word of Jehovah that came to Micah . . . which he
          saw" (Mic. i. 1) ; "the oracle which Habakkuk the prophet did see"
          (Hab. i. 1 margin); and elsewhere such language occurs as this: "the
          word that Jehovah hath showed me" (Jer. xxxviii. 21); "the prophets
          have seen . . . oracles" (Lam. ii. 14); "the word of Jehovah came . .
          . and I looked, and, behold" (Ezk, i. 3,4); "Woe unto the foolish
          prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing" (Ezk.
          xiii. 3); "I . . . will look forth to see what he will speak with me,
          . . . Jehovah . . . said, Write the vision" (Hab. ii. 1 f.). It is an
          inadequate explanation of such language to suppose it merely a relic
          of a time when vision was more predominantly the, form of revelation.
          There is no proof that vision in the technical sense ever was more
          predominantly the form of revelation than in the days of the great
          writing prophets; and such language; is we have quoted too obviously
          represents the living point of view of the prophets to admit of the
          supposition that it was merely conventional on their lips. The
          prophets, in a word, represent the Divine communications which they
          received as given to them in some sense in visions. It is possible, no
          doubt, to exaggerate the significance of this. It is an exaggeration,
          for example, to insist that therefore all the Divine communications
          made to the prophets must have come to them in external appearances
          and objective speech, addressed to and received by means of the bodily
          eye and ear. This would be to break down the distinction between
          manifestation and revelation, and to assimilate the mode of prophetic
          revelation to that granted to Moses, though these are expressly
          distinguished (Num. xii. 6-8). It is also an exaggeration to insist
          that therefore the prophetic state must be conceived as that of strict
          ecstasy, involving, the complete abeyance of all mental life on the
          part of the prophet (amentia), and possibly also accompanying physical
          effects. It is quite clear from the records which the prophets
          themselves give us of their revelations that their intelligence was
          alert in all stages of their reception of them. The purpose of both
          these extreme views is the good one of doing full justice to the
          objectivity of the revelations vouchsafed to the prophets. If these
          revelations took place entirely externally to the prophet, who merely
          stood off and contemplated them, or if they were implanted in the
          prophets by a process so violent as not only to supersede their mental
          activity but, for the time being, to annihilate it, it would be quite
          clear that they came from a source other than the prophets' own minds.
          It is undoubtedly the fundamental contention of the prophets that the
          revelations given through them are not their own but wholly God's. The
          significant language we have just quoted from Ezk. xiii. 3: "Woe unto
          the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen
          nothing," is a typical utterance of their sense of the complete
          objectivity of their messages. What distinguishes the false prophets
          is precisely that they "prophesy out of their own heart" (Ezk. xiii.
          2- 17), or, to draw the antithesis sharply, that "they speak a vision
          of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah" (Jer. xxiii.
          16.26; xiv. 14 ). But these extreme views fail to do justice, the one
          to the equally important fact that the word of God, given through the
          prophets, comes as the pure and unmixed word of God not merely to, but
          from, the prophets; and the other to the equally obvious fact that the
          intelligence of the prophets is alert throughout the whole process of
          the reception and delivery of the revelation made through them.

        <p>
          That which gives to prophecy as a mode of revelation its place in the
          category of visions, strictly so called, and dreams, is that it shares
          with them the distinguishing characteristic which determines the
          class. In them all alike the movements of the mind are determined by
          something extraneous to the subject's will, or rather, since we are
          speaking of supernaturally given dreams and visions, extraneous to the
          totality of the subject's own psychoses. A power not himself takes
          possession of his consciousness and determines it according to its
          will. That power, in the case of the prophets, was fully recognized
          and energetically asserted to be Jehovah Himself or, to be more
          specific, the Spirit of Jehovah (1S. x. 6.10; Neh. ix. 30; Zec. vii.
          12; Joel ii. 28.20). The prophets were therefore ‘men of the Spirit’
          (Hos. ix. 7). What constituted them prophets was that the Spirit was
          put upon them (Isa. xlii. 1 ) or poured out on them (Joel ii. 28,29),
          and they were consequently filled with the Spirit (Mic. iii. 8), or,
          in another but equivalent locution, that "the hand" of the Lord, or
          "the power of the hand" of the Lord, was upon them (2K. iii. 15; Ezk.
          i. 3; iii. 14.22; xxxiii. 22; xxxvii. 1; xl. 1), that is to say, they
          were under the divine control. This control is represented as complete
          and compelling, so that, under it, the prophet becomes not the
          "mover," but the "moved" in the formation of his message. The apostle
          Peter very purely reflects the prophetic consciousness in his
          well-known declaration: ‘No prophecy of scripture comes of private
          interpretation; for prophecy was never brought by the will of man; but
          it was as borne by the Holy Spirit that men spoke from God' (2 Pet. i.
          20.21). What this language of Peter emphasizes - and what is
          emphasized in the whole account which the prophets give of their own
          consciousness - is, to speak plainly, the passivity of the prophets
          with respect to the revelation given through them. This is the
          significance of the phrase: ‘it was as borne by the Holy Spirit that
          men spoke from God.' To be "borne" (fe,rein, phérein) is not the same
          as to be led (a;gein, ágein), much less to be guided or directed
          (o`dhgei/n, hodēgeín) : he that is " borne " contributes nothing, to
          the movement induced, but is the object to he moved. The term "
          passivity " is, perhaps, however, liable to some misapprehension, and
          should not be overstrained. It is not intended to deny that the
          intelligence of the prophets was active in the reception of their
          message; it was by means of their active intelligence that their
          message was received: their intelligence was the instrument of
          revelation. It is intended to deny only that their intelligence was
          active in the production of their message: that it was creatively as
          distinguished from receptively active. For reception itself is a kind
          of activity. What the prophets are solicitous that their readers shall
          understand is that they are in no sense co-authors with God of their
          messages. Their messages are given them, given them entire, and given
          them precisely as they are given out by them. God speaks through them:
          they are not merely His messengers, but "His mouth." But at the same
          time their intelligence is active in the reception, retention and
          announcing of their messages, contributing nothing to them but
          presenting fit instruments for the communication of them - instruments
          capable of understanding, responding profoundly to and zealously
          proclaiming them. There is, no doubt, a not unnatural hesitancy abroad
          in thinking of the prophets as exhibiting only such merely receptive
          activities. In the interests of their personalities, we are asked not
          to represent God as dealing mechanically with them, pouring His
          revelations into their souls to be simply received as in so many
          buckets, or violently wresting their minds from their own proper
          action that He may do His own thinking with them. Must we not rather
          suppose, we are asked, that all revelations must he "psychologically
          mediated," must be given "after the mode of moral mediation," and must
          be made first of all their recipients' "own spiritual possession"? And
          is not, in point of fact, the personality of each prophet clearly
          traceable in his message, and that to such an extent as to compel us
          to recognize him as in a true sense its real author? The plausibility
          of such questionings should not be permitted to obscure the fact that
          the mode of the communication of the prophetic messages which is
          suggested by them is directly contradicted by the prophets' own
          representations of then relations to the revealing Spirit. In the
          prophets' own view they were just instruments through whom God gave
          revelations which came, from them, not as their own product, but as
          the pure word of Jehovah. Neither should the plausibility of such
          questionings blind us to their speciousness. They exploit subordinate
          considerations, which are not without their validity in their own
          place and under their own limiting conditions, as if they were the
          determining or even the sole considerations in the case, and in
          neglect of the really determining considerations. God is Himself the
          author of the instruments He employs for the communication of His
          messages to men and has framed them into precisely the instruments He
          desired for the exact communication of His message. There is just
          ground for the expectation that He will use all the instruments He
          employs according to their natures; intelligent beings therefore as
          intelligent beings, moral agents as moral agents. But there is no just
          ground for, asserting that God is incapable of employing the
          intelligent beings He has Himself created and formed to His will, to
          proclaim His messages purely as He gives them to them; or of making
          truly the possession of rational minds conceptions which they have.
          themselves had no part in creating. And there is no ground for
          imagining that God is unable to frame His own message in the language
          of the organs of His revelation without its thereby ceasing to be,
          because expressed in a fashion natural to these organs, therefore
          purely His message. One would suppose it to lie in the very nature of
          the case that if the Lord makes any revelation to men, He would do it
          in the language of men; or, to individualize more explicitly, in the
          language of the man He employs as the organ of His revelation; and
          that naturally means, not the language of his nation or circle merely,
          but his own particular language, inclusive of all that gives
          individuality to his self-expression. We may speak of this, if we
          will, as "the accommodation of the revealing God to the several
          prophetic individualities." But we should avoid thinking of it.
          externally and therefore mechanically, as if the revealing Spirit
          artificially phrased the message which He gives through each prophet
          in the particular forms of speech proper to the individuality of each,
          so as to create the illusion that the message comes out of the heart
          of the prophet himself. Precisely what the prophets affirm is that
          their messages do not come out of their own hearts and do not
          represent the workings of their own spirits. Nor is there any illusion
          in the phenomenon we are contemplating; and it is a much more
          intimate, and, we may add, a much more interesting phenomenon than an
          external "accommodation" of speech to individual habitudes. It
          includes, on the one hand, the "accommodation" of the prophet, through
          his total preparation, to the speech in which the revelation to be
          given through him is to be clothed; and on the other involves little
          more than the consistent carrying into detail of the broad principle
          that God uses the instruments He employs in accordance with their
          natures. No doubt, on adequate occasion, the very stones might cry out
          by the power of God, and dumb beasts speak, and mysterious voices
          sound forth from the void; and there have not been lacking instances
          in which men have been compelled by the same power to speak what they
          would not, and in languages whose very sounds were strange to their
          ears. But ordinarily when God the Lord would speak to men He avails
          Himself of the services of a human tongue with which to speak, and He
          employs this tongue according to its nature as a tongue and according
          to the particular nature of the tongue which He employs. It is vain to
          say that the message delivered through the instrumentality of this
          tongue is conditioned at least in its form by the tongue by which it
          is spoken, if not, indeed, limited, curtailed, in some degree
          determined even in its matter, by it. Not only was it God the Lord who
          made the tongue, and who made this particular tongue with all its
          peculiarities, not without regard to the message He would deliver
          through it; but His control of it is perfect and complete, and it is
          as absurd to say that He cannot. speak His message by it purely
          without that message suffering change from the peculiarities of its
          tone and modes of enunciation, as it would be to say that no new truth
          can be announced in any language because the elements of speech by the
          combination of which the truth in question is announced are already in
          existence with their fixed range of connotation. The marks of the
          several individualities imprinted on the messages of the prophets, in
          other words, are only a part of the general fact that these messages
          are couched in human language, and in no way beyond that general fact
          affect their purity as direct communications from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new set of problems is raised by the mode of revelation which we
          have called "concursive operation." This mode of revelation differs
          from prophecy, properly so called, precisely by the employment in it,
          as is not done in prophecy, of the total personality of the organ of
          revelation, as a factor. It has been common to speak of the mode of
          the Spirit's action in this form of revelation, therefore, as an
          assistance, a superintendence, a direction, a control, the meaning
          being that the effect aimed at - the discovery and enunciation of
          Divine truth - is attained through the action of the human
          powers-historical research, logical reasoning, ethical thought,
          religious aspiration - acting not by themselves, however, but under
          the prevailing assistance, superintendence, direction, control of the
          Divine Spirit. This manner of speaking has the advantage of setting
          this mode of revelation sharply in contrast with prophetic revelation,
          as involving merely a determining, and not, as in prophetic
          revelation, a supercessive action of the revealing Spirit. We are
          warned, however, against pressing this discrimination too far by the
          inclusion of the whole body of Scripture in such passages as 2 Pet. i.
          20 f. in the category of prophecy, and the assignment of their origin
          not to a mere "leading" but to the "bearing" of the Holy Spirit. In
          any event such terms as assistance, superintendence, direction,
          control, inadequately express the nature of the Spirit's action in
          revelation by "concursive operation." The Spirit is not to be
          conceived as standing outside of the human powers employed for the
          effect in view, ready to supplement any inadequacies they may show and
          to supply any defects they may manifest, but as working confluently
          in, with and by them, elevating them, directing them, controlling
          them, energizing them, so that, as His instruments, they rise above
          themselves and under His inspiration do His work and reach His aim.
          The product, therefore, which is attained by their means is His
          product through them. It is this fact which gives to the process the
          right to be called actively, and to the product the right to be called
          passively, a revelation. Although the circumstance that what is done
          is done by and through the action of human powers keeps the product in
          form and quality in a true sense human, yet the confluent operation of
          the Holy Spirit throughout the whole process raises the result above
          what could by any possibility be achieved by mere human powers and
          constitutes it expressly a supernatural product. The human traits are
          traceable throughout its whole extent, but at bottom it is a Divine
          gift, and the language of Paul is the most proper mode of speech that
          could be applied to it: "Which things also we speak, not in words
          which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth" (1 Cor.
          ii. 13); "The things which I write unto you . . . are the commandment
          of the Lord" (1 Cor. xiv. 37).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is supposed that all the forms of special or redemptive revelation
          which underlie and give its content to the religion of the Bible may
          without violence be subsumed under one or another of these three modes
          - external manifestation, internal suggestion, and concursive
          operation. All, that is, except the culminating revelation, not
          through, but in, Jesus Christ. As in His person, in which dwells all
          the fulness of the Godhead bodily, He rises above all classification
          and is sui generis; so the revelation accumulated in Him stands
          outside all the divers portions and divers manners in which otherwise
          revelation has been given and stuns up in itself all that has been or
          can be made known of God and of His redemption. He does not so much
          make a revelation of God as Himself is the revelation of God; He does
          not merely disclose God's purpose of redemption, He is unto us wisdom
          from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. The
          theophanies are but faint shadows in comparison with His manifestation
          of God in the flesh. The prophets could prophesy only as the Spirit of
          Christ which was in them testified, revealing to them as to servants
          one or another of the secrets of the Lord Jehovah; from Him as His
          Son, Jehovah has no secrets, but whatsoever the Father knows that the
          Son knows also. Whatever truth men have been made partakers of by the
          Spirit of truth is His (for all things whatsoever the Father hath are
          His) and is taken by the Spirit of truth and declared to men that He
          may be glorified. Nevertheless, though all revelation is thus summed
          up in Him, we should not fail to note very carefully that it would
          also be all sealed up in Him - so little is revelation conveyed by
          fact alone, without the word - had it not been thus taken by the
          Spirit of truth and declared unto men. The entirety of the New
          Testament is but the explanatory word accompanying and giving its
          effect to the fact of Christ. And when this fact was in all its
          meaning made the possession of men, revelation was completed and in
          that sense ceased. Jesus Christ is no less the end of revelation than
          He is the end of the law.

        <h2 id="4" href="#ref4">IV. BIBLICAL TERMINOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
          There is not much additional to be learned concerning the nature and
          processes of revelation, from the terms currently employed in
          Scripture to express the idea. These terns are ordinarily the common
          words for disclosing, making known, making manifest, applied with more
          or less heightened significance to supernatural acts or effects in
          kind. In the English Bible (AV) the verb "reveal" occurs about
          fifty-one times, of which twenty-two are in the Old Testament and
          twenty-nine in the New Testament. In the Old Testament the word is
          always the rendering of a Hebrew term hl'G', gālāh, or its Aramaic
          equivalent hl'G, gelāh, the root meaning of which appears to be
          "nakedness." When applied to revelation, it seems to hint at the
          removal of obstacles to perception or the uncovering of objects to
          perception. In the New Testament the word "reveal" is always (with the
          single exception of Lk. ii. 35) the rendering of a Greek term
          avpokalu,ptw, apokalúptō (but in 2 Thess. i. 7; 1 Pet. iv. 13 the
          corresponding noun avpoka,luyij, apokálupsis), which has a very
          similar basal significance with its Hebrew parallel. As this Hebrew
          word formed no substantive in this sense, the noun "revelation" does
          not occur in the English Old Testament, the idea being expressed,
          however, by other Hebrew terms variously rendered. It occurs in the
          English New Testament, on the other hand, about a dozen times, and
          always as the rendering of the substantive corresponding to the verb
          rendered "reveal" (apokálupsis). On the face of the English Bible, the
          terms "reveal," "revelation" bear therefore uniformly the general
          sense of "disclose," "disclosure." The idea is found in the Bible,
          however, much more frequently than the terms " reveal," " revelation "
          in English versions. Indeed, the, Hebrew and Greek terms exclusively
          so rendered occur more frequently in this sense than in this rendering
          in the English Bible. And by their side there stand various other
          terms which express in one way or another the general conception.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the New Testament the verb fanero,w, phaneróō, with the general
          sense of making manifest, manifesting, is the most common of these. It
          differs from apokalúptō the more general and external term from the
          more special and inward. Other terms also are occasionally used:
          evpifa,neia, epipháneia, "manifestation" (2 Thess. ii. 8; 1 Tim. vi.
          14; 2 Tim. i. 10; iv. 1; Tit. ii. 13; cf. evpifai,nw, epiphaínō, Tit.
          ii. 11; iii. 4); deiknu,w, deiknúō (Rev, i. 1; xvii. 1; xxii. 1.6.8;
          cf. Acts ix. 16; 1 Tim, iv. 15); evxhge,omai, exēgéomai (Jn. i. 18),
          of which, however, only one perhaps - crhmati,zw, chrēmatízō (Mt. ii.
          12.22; Lk. ii. 26; Acts x. 22; Heb. viii. 5; xi. 7; xii. 25);
          crhmatismo,j, chrēmatismós (Rom. xi. 4) - calls for particular notice
          as in a special way, according to its usage, expressing the idea of a
          Divine communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Old Testament, the common Hebrew verb for "seeing" (ha'r',
          rā'āh) is used in as appropriate stems, with God as the subject, for
          "appearing." "showing": "the Lord appeared unto . . ."; "the word
          which the Lord showed me." And from this verb not only is an active
          substantive formed which supplied the more ancient designation of the
          official organ or revelation: haero, rō'eh, "seer"; but also objective
          substantives, ha'rm;, mar'āh, and ham;, mar'eh which were used to
          designate the thing seen in a revelation - the "vision." By the side
          of these terms there were others in use, derived from a root which
          supplies to the Aramaic its common word for "seeing," but in Hebrew
          has a somewhat more pregnant meaning, hw'x', hạ̄ zāh. Its active
          derivative, hw,xo, họ̄ zeh, was a designation of a prophet which
          remained in occasional use, alternating with the more customary
          aybin', nābhī, long after ha'ro, rō'eh, had become practically
          obsolete; and its passive derivatives hạ̄ zōn, hịzzāyōn, hạ̄ zūth, mahặ
          zeh provided the ordinary terms for the substance of the revelation or
          "vision." The distinction between the two sets of terms, derived
          respectively from rā'āh and hạ̄ zāh, while not to be unduly pressed,
          seems to lie in the direction that the former suggests external
          manifestations and the latter internal revelations. The rō'eh is he to
          whom Divine manifestations, the họ̄ zeh he to whom Divine
          communications, have been vouchsafed; the mar'eh is an appearance, the
          hāzōn and its companions a vision. It may be of interest to observe
          that mar'āh is the term employed in Num. xii. 6, while it is hạ̄ zōn
          which commonly occurs in the headings of the written prophecies to
          indicate their revelatory character. From this it may possibly be
          inferred that in the former passage it is the mode, in the latter the
          contents of the revelation that is emphasized. Perhaps a like
          distinction may be traced between the hạ̄ zōn of Dan. viii. 15 and the
          mar'eh of the next verse. The ordinary verb for "knowing," [d;y",
          yādha', expressing in its causative stems the idea of making known,
          informing, is also very naturally employed, with God as its subject,
          in the sense of revealing, and that, in accordance with the natural
          sense of the word, with a tendency to pregnancy of implication, of
          revealing effectively, of not merely uncovering to observation, but
          making to know. Accordingly, it is paralleled not merely with hl'G",
          gālāh (Ps. xcviii. 2: 'The Lord hath made known his salvation; his
          righteousness hath he displayed in the sight of the nation'), but also
          with such terms as dm;l', lāmadh (Ps. xxv. 4: 'Make known to me thy
          ways, O Lord: teach me thy paths'). This verb yādha' forms no
          substantive in the sense of " revelation " (cf. t[;D;, da'ath, Num.
          xxiv. 16; Ps. xix, 3).

          The most common vehicles of the idea of "revelation" in the Old
          Testament are, however, two expressions which are yet to be mentioned.
          These are the phrase, "word of Jehovah." and the term commonly but
          inadequately rendered in the English versions by "law." The former
          (debhar Yahweh varied to debhar 'Ělōhīm or debhar hā-'Ělōhīm; cf.
          ne'um Yahweh, massa, Yahweh) occurs scores of times and is at once the
          simplest and the most colorless designation of a Divine communication.
          By the latter (tōrāh), the proper meaning of which is "instruction," a
          strong implication of authoritativeness is conveyed; and, in this
          sense, it becomes what may be called the technical designation of a
          specifically Divine communication. The two are not infrequently
          brought together, as in Isa. i. 10: "Hear the word of Jehovah, ye
          rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law [margin "teaching"] of our God,
          ye people of Gomorrah"; or Isa. ii. 3; Mic. iv. 2; "For out of Zion
          shall go forth the law [margin "instruction"], and the word of Jehovah
          from Jerusalem." Both terms are used for any Divine communication of
          whatever extent; and both came to be employed to express the entire
          body of Divine revelation, conceived as a unitary whole. In this
          comprehensive usage, the emphasis of the one came to fall more on the
          graciousness, and of the other more on the authoritativeness of this
          body of Divine revelation; and both passed into the New Testament with
          these implications. "The word of God," or simply "the word," comes
          thus to mean in the New Testament just the gospel, “the word of the
          proclamation of redemption, that is, all that which God has to say to
          man, and causes to be said" looking to his salvation. It expresses, in
          a word, precisely what we technically speak of as God's redemptive
          revelation. "The law," on the other hand, means in this New Testament
          use, just the whole body of the authoritative instruction which God
          has given men. It expresses, in other words, what we commonly speak of
          as God's supernatural revelation. The two things, of course, are the
          same: God's authoritative revelation is His gracious revelation; God's
          redemptive revelation is His supernatural revelation. The two terms
          merely look at the one aggregate of revelation from two aspects, and
          each emphasizes its own aspect of this one aggregated revelation. Now,
          this aggregated revelation lay before the men of the New Testament in
          a written form, and it was impossible to speak freely of it without
          consciousness of and at least occasional reference to its written
          form. Accordingly we hear of a Word of God that is written (Jn. xv.
          25; 1 Cor. xv. 54), and the Divine Word is naturally contrasted with
          mere tradition, as if its written form were of its very idea (Mk. vii.
          10); indeed, the written body of revelation - with an emphasis on its
          written form - is designated expressly ‘the prophetic word' (2 Pet. i.
          19). More distinctly still, "the Law" comes to be thought of as a
          written, not exactly, code, but body of Divinely authoritative
          instructions. The phrase, "It is written in your law" (Jn. x. 34; xv.
          25; Rom. iii. 19; 1 Cor. xiv. 21), acquires the precise sense of, "It
          is set forth in your authoritative Scriptures, all the content of
          which is ‘law,' that is, Divine instruction." Thus "the Word of God,"
          "the Law," came to mean just the written body of revelation, what we
          call, and what the New Testament writers called, in the same high
          sense which we give the term, "the Scriptures." These "Scriptures" are
          thus identified with the revelation of God, conceived as a
          well-defined corpus, and two conceptions rise before us which have had
          a determining part to play in the history of Christianity - the
          conception of an authoritative Canon of Scripture, and the conception
          of this Canon of Scripture as just the Word of God written. The former
          conception was thrown into prominence in opposition to the gnostic
          heresies in the earliest age of the church, and gave rise to a richly
          varied mode of speech concerning the Scriptures, emphasizing their
          authority in legal language, which goes back to and rests on the
          Biblical usage of "Law." The latter it was left to the Reformation to
          do justice to in its struggle against, on the one side, the Romish
          depression of the Scriptures in favor of the traditions of the church,
          and on the other side the Enthusiasts' supercession of them in the
          interests of the "inner Word." When Tertullian, on the one hand,
          speaks of the Scriptures as an "Instrument," a legal document, his
          terminology has an express warrant in the Scriptures' own usage of
          tōrāh, "law," to designate their entire content. And when John Gerhard
          argues that "between the Word of God and Sacred Scripture, taken in a
          material sense, there is no real difference," he is only declaring
          plainly what is definitely implied in the New Testament use of "the
          Word of God" with the written revelation in mind. What is important to
          recognize is that the Scriptures themselves represent the Scriptures
          as not merely containing here and there the record of revelations -
          "words of God," tōrōth - given by God, but as themselves, in all their
          extent, a revelation, an authoritative body of gracious instructions
          from God; or, since they alone, of all the revelations which God may
          have given, are extant - rather as the Revelation, the only "Word of
          God" accessible to men, in all their parts "law." that is,
          authoritative instruction from God.
