            >Question I. Was a verbal revelation necessary?</a
          >
          We affirm
        </p>

        <p>THE NECESSITY OF SCRIPTURE</p>

        </p>

        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Turretin2-3"

            inexplicable (alyta) passages which cannot be explained and made to
            harmonize?</a

          We deny
        </p>

        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Turretin2-6"
            >VI. From what source does the divine authority of the Scriptures
            become known to us? Does it depend upon the testimony of the church
            either as to itself or as to us?</a
          >
          We deny against the papists
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>THE APOCRYPHAL BOOKS</p>

        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Turretin2-9"
            >IX. Ought Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, the two first

        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Turretin2-12"
            >XII. Is the present Hebrew text in things as well as words so
            authentic and inspired (theopneustos) in such a sense that all the
            extant versions are to be referred to it as a rule and, wherever
            they vary, to be corrected by it? Or may we desert the reading it
            supplies, if judged less appropriate, and correct it either by a
            comparison of ancient translators or by suitable (stochastik√©)
            judgment and conjecture and follow another more suitable reading?</a
          >

          <a href="Turretin2-16"
            >XVI. Do the Scriptures so perfectly contain all things necessary to
            salvation that there is no need of unwritten (agraphois) traditions
            after it?</a

            >XVII. Are the Scriptures so perspicuous in things necessary to
            salvation that they can be understood by believers without the
            external help of oral (agraphou) tradition or ecclesiastical
            authority?</a
          >
          We affirm against the papists

            >XVIII. Can the Scriptures be profitably read by any believer, and
            ought he to read them without permission?</a
          >
          We affirm against the papists

        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Turretin2-19"

            supreme and infallible judge of controversies and the interpreter of
            the Scriptures. Or whether the church or the Roman pontiff is.</a
