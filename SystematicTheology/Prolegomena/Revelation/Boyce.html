        <h2>III. REASON AND REVELATION</h2>
        <p>
          HAVING considered the proofs of the existence of God, we should
          discuss the ways in which he has made himself known, before we study
          his nature, and attributes, and relations to us. These constitute the
          sources of our knowledge of Theology, which are two, Reason and
          Revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason is that power in man, which enables him to have mental
          perceptions, to exercise thought, and reflection, to know facts, to
          inquire into their mutual relations, and to deduce, logically, the
          conclusions which may be drawn from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason may be used either with reference to the natural or
          supernatural means of knowledge conferred by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we refer to reason as a source of knowledge distinct from
          revelation, we mean the information attained, by the use of this
          faculty, in connection only with the natural, as distinguished from
          the supernatural.
        </p>
        <p>
          By revelation, we mean the knowledge which God conveys by direct
          supernatural instruction, pre-eminently that given in the book known
          as the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason involves all the cognitive powers of man, which are the
          faculties through which the mind attains knowledge. These faculties
          are not separate, and independent, but are merely the instruments of
          the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mind is not itself an original source of knowledge, like the
          Scriptures, but is merely an instrument by which the man attains
          knowledge through the exercise of its appropriate faculties. There are
          no such things as innate ideas. These arrive only through the exercise
          of proper thought and reflection, in connection with some perceived
          facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The means by which the mind attains knowledge in the exercise of its
          faculties, are five.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Consciousness, by which we learn our own existence, and the fact
          that we think, and are personal beings, possessing personal identity
          during the term of our natural life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Observation, and experience of the world about us, through the
          senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Through intuitive conceptions, by which, upon the suggestion
          through some external object, of some principle, we find ourselves at
          once convinced of its correctness.
        </p>
        <p>4. The dispositions, instincts and tendencies of our natures.</p>
        <p>
          5. The curse of events in nature, as tending to good or evil, to what
          is desirable or disastrous.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is manifest that the knowledge obtained from these various sources
          must be abundant to teach man the simple facts upon which rests his
          duty to God; namely, that there is a God to whom he owes existence,
          and consequent reverence, service and love, and whose greatness and
          goodness enforce this obligation; also to show him that that duty has
          not been discharged, and that he has not the disposition to discharge
          it; and consequently to render him uneasy in his relations to God, and
          anxious to appease him, and secure some assurance of his pardon and
          approval. It has also been thought by many, that through reason alone
          man attains the conviction of immortality and of a future state of
          rewards and punishments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However abundant may be the information thus conveyed to man, it is
          nevertheless clear that his knowledge in these directions must still
          remain very imperfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          This must have been true of man even in a state of innocence. His
          finite nature and the finite conditions which surrounded him must
          still have left him ignorant upon many desirable matters. It is
          natural, therefore, to believe that, in that condition, he received
          direct communications from God, which are properly esteemed
          revelations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this imperfection must have been greatly increased by an
          subsequent, fall from innocence. By this the Perceptions of right and
          wrong would be dimmed, the power of conscience to enforce the right
          would be impaired, the desire to do the right would be diminished,
          prejudices against the right would be created, an affection for God
          would be greatly decreased, if not entirely obliterated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon these grounds we may infer the necessity of some further source
          of knowledge of God, and of his will with respect to man.
        </p>
        <p>We may also argue a priori as to the nature of this revelation.</p>
        <p>
          1. It must come from God, the source of all our other knowledge. No
          other could give it, and it is fit that no other should do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It must be suited to our present condition, confirming the truth
          already known, and teaching what is practically useful to man as
          sinner before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It must be secured from all possibility of error, so that its
          teachings may be relied on with equal, if not greater, confidence than
          those of reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It must come with authority, claiming and proving its claim to be
          the word of God, who has the right to command, and to punish those who
          disobey his commands; with authority also, that man may with
          confidence believe and trust the promises and hopes pardon and peace
          it may hold out.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. That it will be accompanied by difficulties and mysteries what may
          be expected, since these are found frequently attending the knowledge
          derived from reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gift of such a revelation must of course depend absolutely upon
          the will of God. It is not for man to say, before it is given, whether
          it certainly will, or will not, be bestowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          That it is not improbable may be inferred from the fact that God has
          already made himself known to us in various ways in ourselves and in
          nature. If we need further revelation we my hope for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reason to the contrary is that we have sinned against God,
          and he may have chosen to abandon us to our fate. But this is not so
          truly understood until revelation has confirmed our conviction of our
          sinful estate. On the other hand, the favors which God still bestows,
          and the means of continued knowledge of him which he affords, indicate
          that he has not yet consigned us to our deserved fate, and that he may
          have purposes of mercy towards us.
        </p>
        <p>
          That which renders it highly probable is the expectation seen in man,
          in the conceptions he has formed of God, as one to be propitiated by
          sacrifices and approached with prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the expectations thus formed are to he verified, the important
          question arises, in what way can God make known to us the new truth he
          wills to teach.
        </p>
        <p>
          They manifestly speak unadvisedly who assert that this can in nowise
          be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he should so choose, he could impress it on each one in like manner
          as we attain intuitive conceptions. He might reveal it to individuals
          in dreams and visions, so as to make each one feel and know that the
          vision is from God. Those through whom he has revealed himself have in
          some such way attained absolute conviction that God has spoken to and
          through them, and with God there is neither impossibility nor
          difficulty in producing like certainty in the mind of each individual
          of the race.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as God usually acts through means, so he has revealed himself to a
          few, and through them to mankind in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only question then is, how can he give evidence to the race at
          large that the men he has inspired are indeed his messengers?
        </p>
        <p>
          This also might be done in various ways, but he has chosen to do it by
          attesting their mission by miracles wrought through them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the measure of authority to be ascribed to these miracles, men
          differ in opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some teach that any miracle wrought is of itself sufficient
          attestation of the messenger and of the truth which he teaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, that miracles are only proofs to those who behold them, and
          dubious proofs even then, and that the true purpose of them is not to
          set the seal of God’s authority, but simply to awaken attention and
          excite awe, and thus prepare the way for a proper hearing of the
          divine message. These assert that the revelation comes to us with the
          authority only of the self-convincing nature of the truth made known.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is necessary, in this difference of opinions, to seek carefully
          after the true theory. From no source can we better obtain it than
          from the revelation itself, the teaching of which will be seen to be
          fully corroborated otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture theory seems to be this, that in any new revelation the
          prophet of God must present a doctrine perfectly consistent with ever
          past revelation and with the knowledge conveyed by nature, and must,
          at the same time, confirm by miracles his authority as a teacher from
          God. Without the miracle the new truth has no evidence that it is not
          simply the product of human reason or imagination. The coincidence in
          doctrine is necessary to protect against pretended miracles and the
          tricks of unprincipled men. Besides, the new truth can have no higher
          authority than the old, and therefore cannot supersede it, for the old
          also has come from God. No truth ever taught by God can be opposed by
          any new truth from him. What with God is truth is eternal truth. Like
          himself, it is the same “yesterday, to-day and forever.” It may be
          more abundantly or clearly revealed. We may learn to comprehend it
          better and to correct our own misapprehensions of it, but whatever God
          has once given as truth must so remain forever, as changeless as his
          own life.
        </p>
        <p>1. The Scriptural authority for this theory is conclusive.</p>
        <p>
          Moses announced the law, which shows the miracle alone not to be
          conclusive. See Deut. 13:1, 2, 3. “If there arise in the midst of thee
          a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a
          wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he shake unto
          thee, saying, let us go after other gods which thou hast not known,
          and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that
          prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth
          you to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and
          with all your soul.” This passage shows that even a miracle, wrought
          by one teaching doctrine not in accordance with that already received,
          should not tempt to belief in the divine authority of him who should
          work it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle Paul gives similar instruction to the Galatians, Gal. 1:8:
          ” Though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any
          gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be
          anathema.” Whatever might be the accredited authority of the
          messenger, his teachings were not to be received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, with all this, the Scriptures do not disparage the miracle. The
          miracles of Mosaic times are constantly referred to as indubitably
          marking it as divine. Nicodemus recognized the high position assigned
          to miracles by the Jews, John 3:2: “No man can do these signs that
          thou doest, except God be with him.” Christ himself says, John 10:25:
          “The works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory of the Scriptures is not necessarily based upon the idea
          that real miracles can be wrought otherwise than by divine power.
          Still the language sometimes used is liable to this construction. And
          much depends upon the definition of a miracle. If a miracle be a
          suspension of the fixed laws which God has established for the world,
          that suspension can only occur through his special permission. Taking
          this as the true meaning of the word, we can understand why such
          stress is laid in the Scriptures upon the Mosaic miracles and those of
          Christ, since many of them are such as nothing but divine power could
          accomplish. But the word miracle in the Scriptures has not this
          restricted meaning, but is applied likewise to any marked supernatural
          event. Because men are apt to put these upon a level with the miracles
          which God alone can work, they are warned not to follow after what is
          thus supernaturally done, if it be accompanied by such teaching as is
          contrary to truth already received.
        </p>
        <p>
          See the apparent reality of such miracles in connection with the
          magicians of Egypt, Ex. 7:11; Chap. 8:7, and compare with it the
          conviction expressed by the magicians, Ex. 8:19, when they failed to
          produce lice from the dust, “This is the finger of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice also what Christ says, Mark 13:22: “For there shall arise false
          Christs and false prophets, and shall shew signs and wonders, that
          they may lead astray, if possible, the elect.”
        </p>
        <p>
          See also Rev. 16:13, 14: “And I saw coming out of the mouth of the
          dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the
          false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs, for they are
          spirits of devils, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the
          whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of
          God the Almighty.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is because of this liability to be deceived, that the Scriptures
          require the miracle and the concurrent doctrine as both essential to
          the reception of a new revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This theory alone concurs with the course to which nature
          necessarily impels us.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent that we are fully convinced of the truth of a doctrine,
          no subsequent revelation could change our belief. It is true that this
          does not apply when we have doubts; but when our knowledge is fixed,
          we cannot be moved. No amount of miracle could convince a Christian
          that the nature of God is otherwise than pure and holy, or that he
          delights in worship not of the heart, or that he is not infinite in
          justice and holiness, in goodness, mercy and truth, or that be will
          pardon sin without due satisfaction to his law.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This theory accords with the progressive character of divine
          revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest revelation came to those who had heretofore been guided
          only by reason. This was true even down to the beginnings of the Old
          Testament Scriptures, and, in that economy, only preparation was made
          for the future glory of the New Testament revelation. Hence the truths
          taught were, for the most part, only those which come within the
          compass of discovery by reason, or acceptance by it upon due
          suggestion, namely,—the existence of one God, the fact of creation,
          the law of moral obligation to God and man, the punishment of sinners,
          the duty of repentance, the pardoning mercy of God, and the law of
          sacrifices, with substitution and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new economy goes further in its clear instructions: it teaches the
          vicarious atonement of Christ, involving representation in him and
          also in Adam, the doctrine of the Trinity in the Godhead, the
          mysterious union in the person of Christ, and many other truths
          heretofore only very indistinctly revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          These could not have been presented to those only taught heretofore by
          reason. But the revelation which stood between fore-shadowed them in
          different ways. From it alone originally they would not have been
          discovered. But now that they are made known, that former revelation
          is seen to concur with the new statements, and the conformity of the
          clearly expressed doctrine to the mere outlines of them in the past
          sustains the fact that they have a common author, and that the divine
          revealer is the same. It is like the presence in animals of the same
          genus in earlier days of germs which find their development in species
          which come later.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This accords with our means of judging what course of action
          infinite wisdom would have devised.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conviction we have of past truth renders it impossible that we
          should throw it aside. We must, therefore, still hold it fast. That
          conviction has come from God, and we can have no higher evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, other statements and doctrines very probably or even certainly
          true, may be taught by men, as revealed to them, when they are either
          self-deceived, or attempting to deceive others. Hence, we must have
          the attesting miracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, we are liable to be deceived as to what is
          supernatural, and especially, in the supernatural, as to what is
          within the limits of created power. Hence, we may be misled by the
          craft of men, or by the superhuman power of wicked spirits. Therefore,
          no doctrine must be accepted contrary to a truth already received.
        </p>
        <p>
          A revelation, such as we have described, having been given and proved,
          another question arises: what is the relation which reason bears
          towards it?
        </p>
        <p>We may lay down the following facts:</p>
        <p>
          1. That reason is the first revelation, and is consequently
          presupposed in any other.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the facts of reason cannot be denied by any subsequent
          revelation. No truth can destroy other truth.
        </p>

          A limitation must, however, be put on the province of reason. The
          doctrines of which it may judge, are those only which come within its
          sphere. Upon the presentation of a new doctrine reason may decide
          whether it agrees with former knowledge. If agreeable thereto, it must
          be accepted, if opposed, it must be rejected. But, if it be above
          reason, it must stand or fall with the rest of the revelation. God
          may, in his mercy, refrain from trying faith by a revelation of
          supernatural doctrine, but, if he reveals it, it must be no barrier to
          the reception of that doctrine itself, or of the revelation which
          accompanies it. In an able article in the Southern Presbyterian
          Review, Vol. I, pp. 1–34, on “Reason and Revelation,” Dr. Thornwell
          puts this limitation upon reason, that it is sole arbiter within its
          own bounds, but no judge beyond them. He thinks that in this way only
          can it be applied as a test of doctrine. The theory is undoubtedly
          correct. It fails only in not recognizing the precise manner in which
          Scripture brings it in as an arbiter, not as the judge of truth as
          disconnected from the past, but as related to the various times and
          forms in which God has taught it. Reason should judge a new
          revelation, not by the truths taught by reason alone, but also by
          those which have been made known in any previous revelation.

          The office of reason with respect to revelation, is therefore seen to
          be:
        </p>
        <p>1. To examine the evidence of the miracles upon which it rests.</p>
        <p>
          2. To compare its doctrines with the teaching of the past, and
          recognize their correspondence with or opposition to that teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To adopt or reject the revelation according to the evidence
          afforded that it is God’s truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To interpret its contents, according to the best light which
          learning affords.
