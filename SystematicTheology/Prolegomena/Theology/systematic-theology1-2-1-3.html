        <h2>3. Scripture and Mysticism.</h2>
        <p>
          As rationalism recognizes too little as coming from God, so mysticism
          recognizes too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. True mysticism.—We have seen that there is an illumination of the
          minds of all believers by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit, however, makes
          no new revelation of truth, but uses for his instrument the truth
          already revealed by Christ in nature and in the Scriptures. The
          illuminating work of the Spirit is therefore an opening of men&#x27;s
          minds to understand Christ&#x27;s previous revelations. As one
          initiated into the mysteries of Christianity, every true believer may
          be called a mystic. True mysticism is that higher knowledge and
          fellowship which the Holy Spirit gives through the use of nature and
          Scripture as subordinate and principal means.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mystic” = one initiated, from μύω, “to close the eyes”—probably in
          order that the soul may have inward vision of truth. But divine truth
          is a “mystery,” not only as something into which one must be
          initiated, but as ὑπερβάλλουσα τῆς γνώσεως (Eph. 3:19)—surpassing full
          knowledge, even to the believer; see Meyer on Rom. 11:25—“I would not,
          brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery.” The Germans have Mystik
          with a favorable sense, Mysticismus with an unfavorable
          sense,—corresponding respectively to our true and false mysticism.
          True mysticism is intimated in John 16:13—“the spirit of truth ...
          shall guide you into all the truth”; Eph. 3:9—“dispensation of the
          mystery”; 1 Cor. 2:10—“unto us God revealed them through the Spirit.”
          Nitzsch, Syst. of Christ. Doct., 35—“Whenever true religion revives,
          there is an outcry against mysticism, i. e., higher knowledge,
          fellowship, activity through the Spirit of God in the heart.” Compare
          the charge against Paul that he was mad, in Acts 26:24, 25, with his
          self-vindication in 2 Cor. 5:13—“whether we are beside ourselves, it
          is unto God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Inge, Christian Mysticism, 21—“Harnack speaks of mysticism as
          rationalism applied to a sphere above reason. He should have said
          reason applied to a sphere above rationalism. Its fundamental doctrine
          is the unity of all existence. Man can realize his individuality only
          by transcending it and finding himself in the larger unity of
          God&#x27;s being. Man is a microcosm. He recapitulates the race, the
          universe, Christ himself.” Ibid., 5—Mysticism is “the attempt to
          realize in thought and feeling the immanence of the temporal in the
          eternal, and of the eternal in the temporal. It implies (1) that the
          soul can see and perceive spiritual truth; (2) that man, in order to
          know God, must be a partaker of the divine nature; (3) that without
          holiness no man can see the Lord; (4) that the true hierophant of the
          mysteries of God is love. The ‘scala perfectionis’is (a) the purgative
          life; (b) the illuminative life; (c) the unitive life.” Stevens,
          Johannine Theology, 239, 240—“The mysticism of John ... is not a
          subjective mysticism which absorbs the soul in self-contemplation and
          revery, but an objective and rational mysticism, which lives in a
          world of realities, apprehends divinely revealed truth, and bases its
          experience upon it. It is a mysticism which feeds, not upon its own
          feelings and fancies, but upon Christ. It involves an acceptance of
          him, and a life of obedience to him. Its motto is: Abiding in Christ.”
          As the power press cannot dispense with the type, so the Spirit of God
          does not dispense with Christ&#x27;s external revelations in nature
          and in Scripture. E. G. Robinson, Christian Theology, 364—“The word of
          God is a form or mould, into which the Holy Spirit delivers us when he
          creates us anew”; cf. Rom. 6:17—“ye became obedient from the heart to
          that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered.”
        </p>
        <p>
          B. False mysticism.—Mysticism, however, as the term is commonly used,
          errs in holding to the attainment of religious knowledge by direct
          communication from God, and by passive absorption of the human
          activities into the divine. It either partially or wholly loses sight
          of (a) the outward organs of revelation, nature and the Scriptures;
          (b) the activity of the human powers in the reception of all religious
          knowledge; (c) the personality of man, and, by consequence, the
          personality of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In opposition to false mysticism, we are to remember that the Holy
          Spirit works through the truth externally revealed in nature and in
          Scripture (Acts 14:17—“he left not himself without witness”; Rom.
          1:20—“the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are
          clearly seen”; Acts 7:51—“ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your
          fathers did, so do ye”; Eph. 6:17—“the sword of the Spirit, which is
          the word of God”). By this truth already given we are to test all new
          communications which would contradict or supersede it (1 John
          4:1—“believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are
          of God”; Eph. 5:10—“proving what is well pleasing unto the Lord”). By
          these tests we may try Spiritualism, Mormonism, Swedenborgianism. Note
          the mystical tendency in Francis de Sales, Thomas à Kempis, Madame
          Guyon, Thomas C. Upham. These writers seem at times to advocate an
          unwarrantable abnegation of our reason and will, and a “swallowing up
          of man in God.” But Christ does not deprive us of reason and will; he
          only takes from us the perverseness of our reason and the selfishness
          of our will; so reason and will are restored to their normal clearness
          and strength. Compare Ps. 16:7—“Jehovah, who hath given me counsel;
          yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons”—God teaches his
          people through the exercise of their own faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          False mysticism is sometimes present though unrecognized. All
          expectation of results without the use of means partakes of it.
          Martineau, Seat of Authority, 288—“The lazy will would like to have
          the vision while the eye that apprehends it sleeps.”Preaching without
          preparation is like throwing ourselves down from a pinnacle of the
          temple and depending on God to send an angel to hold us up. Christian
          Science would trust to supernatural agencies, while casting aside the
          natural agencies God has already provided; as if a drowning man should
          trust to prayer while refusing to seize the rope. Using Scripture “ad
          aperturam libri” is like guiding one&#x27;s actions by a throw of the
          dice. Allen, Jonathan Edwards, 171, note—“Both Charles and John Wesley
          were agreed in accepting the Moravian method of solving doubts as to
          some course of action by opening the Bible at hazard and regarding the
          passage on which the eye first alighted as a revelation of God&#x27;s
          will in the matter”; cf. Wedgwood, Life of Wesley, 193; Southey, Life
          of Wesley, 1:216. J. G. Paton, Life, 2:74—“After many prayers and
          wrestlings and tears, I went alone before the Lord, and on my knees
          cast lots, with a solemn appeal to God, and the answer came: ‘Go
          home!’ ” He did this only once in his life, in overwhelming
          perplexity, and finding no light from human counsel. “To whomsoever
          this faith is given,” he says, “let him obey it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          F. B. Meyer, Christian Living, 18—“It is a mistake to seek a sign from
          heaven; to run from counsellor to counsellor; to cast a lot; or to
          trust in some chance coincidence. Not that God may not reveal his will
          thus; but because it is hardly the behavior of a child with its
          Father. There is a more excellent way,”—namely, appropriate Christ who
          is wisdom, and then go forward, sure that we shall be guided, as each
          new step must be taken, or word spoken, or decision made. Our service
          is to be “rational service”(Rom. 12:1); blind and arbitrary action is
          inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity. Such action makes us
          victims of temporary feeling and a prey to Satanic deception. In cases
          of perplexity, waiting for light and waiting upon God will commonly
          enable us to make an intelligent decision, while “whatsoever is not of
          faith is sin” (Rom. 14:23).

          “False mysticism reached its logical result in the Buddhistic
          theosophy. In that system man becomes most divine in the extinction of
          his own personality. Nirvana is reached by the eightfold path of right
          view, aspiration, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness,
          rapture; and Nirvana is the loss of ability to say: ‘This is I,’ and
          ‘This is mine.’ Such was Hypatia&#x27;s attempt, by subjection of
          self, to be wafted away into the arms of Jove. George Eliot was wrong
          when she said: ‘The happiest woman has no history.’ Self-denial is not
          self-effacement. The cracked bell has no individuality. In Christ we
          become our complete selves.” Col 2:9, 10—“For in him dwelleth all the
          fulness of the Godhead bodily, and in him ye are made full.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Royce, World and Individual, 2:248, 249—“Assert the spiritual man;
          abnegate the natural man. The fleshly self is the root of all evil;
          the spiritual self belongs to a higher realm. But this spiritual self
          lies at first outside the soul; it becomes ours only by grace. Plato
          rightly made the eternal Ideas the source of all human truth and
          goodness. Wisdom comes into a man, like Aristotle&#x27;s νοῦς.” A. H.
          Bradford, The Inner Light, in making the direct teaching of the Holy
          Spirit the sufficient if not the sole source of religious knowledge,
          seems to us to ignore the principle of evolution in religion. God
          builds upon the past. His revelation to prophets and apostles
          constitutes the norm and corrective of our individual experience, even
          while our experience throws new light upon that revelation. On
