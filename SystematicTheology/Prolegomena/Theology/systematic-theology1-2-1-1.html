        <h2>1. Scripture and Nature.</h2>
        <p>
          By nature we here mean not only physical facts, or facts with regard
          to the substances, properties, forces, and laws of the material world,
          but also spiritual facts, or facts with regard to the intellectual and
          moral constitution of man, and the orderly arrangement of human
          society and history.
        </p>
        <p>
          We here use the word “nature” in the ordinary sense, as including man.
          There is another and more proper use of the word “nature,” which makes
          it simply a complex of forces and beings under the law of cause and
          effect. To nature in this sense man belongs only as respects his body,
          while as immaterial and personal he is a supernatural being. Free will
          is not under the law of physical and mechanical causation. As Bushnell
          has said: “Nature and the supernatural together constitute the one
          system of God.” Drummond, Natural Law in the Spiritual World,
          232—“Things are natural or supernatural according to where we stand.
          Man is supernatural to the mineral; God is supernatural to the man.”
          We shall in subsequent chapters use the term “nature” in the narrow
          sense. The universal use of the phrase “Natural Theology,”however,
          compels us in this chapter to employ the word “nature” in its broader
          sense as including man, although we do this under protest, and with
          this explanation of the more proper meaning of the term. See Hopkins,
          in Princeton Review, Sept. 1882:183 sq.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. G. Robinson: “Bushnell separates nature from the supernatural.
          Nature is a blind train of causes. God has nothing to do with it,
          except as he steps into it from without. Man is supernatural, because
          he is outside of nature, having the power of originating an
          independent train of causes.” If this were the proper conception of
          nature, then we might be compelled to conclude with P. T. Forsyth, in
          Faith and Criticism, 100—“There is no revelation in nature. There can
          be none, because there is no forgiveness. We cannot be sure about her.
          She is only aesthetic. Her ideal is harmony, not reconciliation....
          For the conscience, stricken or strong, she has no word.... Nature
          does not contain her own teleology, and for the moral soul that
          refuses to be fancy-fed, Christ is the one luminous smile on the dark
          face of the world.”But this is virtually to confine Christ&#x27;s
          revelation to Scripture or to the incarnation. As there was an
          astronomy without the telescope, so there was a theology before the
          Bible. George Harris, Moral Evolution, 411—“Nature is both evolution
          and revelation. As soon as the question How is answered, the questions
          Whence and Why arise. Nature is to God what speech is to thought.” The
          title of Henry Drummond&#x27;s book should have been: “Spiritual Law
          in the Natural World,” for nature is but the free though regular
          activity of God; what we call the supernatural is simply his
          extraordinary working.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Natural theology.—The universe is a source of theology. The
          Scriptures assert that God has revealed himself in nature. There is
          not only an outward witness to his existence and character in the
          constitution and government of the universe (Ps. 19; Acts 14:17; Rom.
          1:20), but an inward witness to his existence and character in the
          heart of every man (Rom. 1:17, 18, 19, 20, 32; 2:15). The systematic
          exhibition of these facts, whether derived from observation, history
          or science, constitutes natural theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outward witness: Ps.19:1-6—“The heavens declare the glory of God”;
          Acts 14:17—“he left not himself without witness, in that he did good,
          and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons”; Rom. 1:20—“for
          the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are
          clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even
          his everlasting power and divinity.” Inward witness: Rom. 1:19—τὸ
          γνωστὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ = “that which is known of God is manifest in them.”
          Compare the ἀποκαλύπτεται of the gospel in verse 17, with the
          ἀποκαλύπτεται of wrath in verse 18—two revelations, one of ὀργή, the
          other of χάρις; see Shedd, Homiletics, 11. Rom. 1:32—“knowing the
          ordinance of God”; 2:15—“they show the work of the law written in
          their hearts.” Therefore even the heathen are “without excuse” (Rom.
          1:20). There are two books: Nature and Scripture—one written, the
          other unwritten: and there is need of studying both. On the passages
          in Romans, see the Commentary of Hodge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spurgeon told of a godly person who, when sailing down the Rhine,
          closed his eyes, lest the beauty of the scene should divert his mind
          from spiritual themes. The Puritan turned away from the moss-rose,
          saying that he would count nothing on earth lovely. But this is to
          despise God&#x27;s works. J. H. Barrows: “The Himalayas are the raised
          letters upon which we blind children put our fingers to spell out the
          name of God.”To despise the works of God is to despise God himself.
          God is present in nature, and is now speaking. Ps. 19:1—“The heavens
          declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his
          handiwork”—present tenses. Nature is not so much a book, as a voice.
          Hutton, Essays, 2:236—“The direct knowledge of spiritual communion
          must be supplemented by knowledge of God&#x27;s ways gained from the
          study of nature. To neglect the study of the natural mysteries of the
          universe leads to an arrogant and illicit intrusion of moral and
          spiritual assumptions into a different world. This is the lesson of
          the book of Job.” Hatch, Hibbert Lectures, 85—“Man, the servant and
          interpreter of nature, is also, and is thereby, the servant and
          interpreter of the living God.” Books of science are the record of
          man&#x27;s past interpretations of God&#x27;s works.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Natural theology supplemented.—The Christian revelation is the
          chief source of theology. The Scriptures plainly declare that the
          revelation of God in nature does not supply all the knowledge which a
          sinner needs (Acts 17:23; Eph. 3:9). This revelation is therefore
          supplemented by another, in which divine attributes and merciful
          provisions only dimly shadowed forth in nature are made known to men.
          This latter revelation consists of a series of supernatural events and
          communications, the record of which is presented in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Acts 17:23—Paul shows that, though the Athenians, in the erection of
          an altar to an unknown God, “acknowledged a divine existence beyond
          any which the ordinary rites of their worship recognized, that Being
          was still unknown to them; they had no just conception of his nature
          and perfections” (Hackett, in loco). Eph. 3:9—“the mystery which hath
          been hid in God”—this mystery is in the gospel made known for
          man&#x27;s salvation. Hegel, in his Philosophy of Religion, says that
          Christianity is the only revealed religion, because the Christian God
          is the only one from whom a revelation can come. We may add that as
          science is the record of man&#x27;s progressive interpretation of
          God&#x27;s revelation in the realm of nature, so Scripture is the
          record of man&#x27;s progressive interpretation of God&#x27;s
          revelation in the realm of spirit. The phrase “word of God” does not
          primarily denote a record,—it is the spoken word, the doctrine, the
          vitalizing truth, disclosed by Christ; see Mat. 13:19—“heareth the
          word of the kingdom”; Luke 5:1—“heard the word of God”; Acts
          8:25—“spoken the word of the Lord”; 13:48, 49—“glorified the word of
          God: ... the word of the Lord was spread abroad”; 19:10, 20—“heard the
          word of the Lord, ... mightily grew the word of the Lord”; 1 Cor.
          1:18—“the word of the cross”—all designating not a document, but an
          unwritten word; cf.Jer. 1:4—“the word of Jehovah came unto me”; Ez.
          1:3—“the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel, the priest.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The Scriptures the final standard of appeal.—Science and Scripture
          throw light upon each other. The same divine Spirit who gave both
          revelations is still present, enabling the believer to interpret the
          one by the other and thus progressively to come to the knowledge of
          the truth. Because of our finiteness and sin, the total record in
          Scripture of God&#x27;s past communications is a more trustworthy
          source of theology than are our conclusions from nature or our private
          impressions of the teaching of the Spirit. Theology therefore looks to
          the Scripture itself as its chief source of material and its final
          standard of appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an internal work of the divine Spirit by which the outer word
          is made an inner word, and its truth and power are manifested to the
          heart. Scripture represents this work of the Spirit, not as a giving
          of new truth, but as an illumination of the mind to perceive the
          fulness of meaning which lay wrapped up in the truth already revealed.
          Christ is “the truth” (John 14:6); “in whom are all the treasures of
          wisdom and knowledge hidden” (Col. 2:3); the Holy Spirit, Jesus says,
          “shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you” (John 16:14). The
          incarnation and the Cross express the heart of God and the secret of
          the universe; all discoveries in theology are but the unfolding of
          truth involved in these facts. The Spirit of Christ enables us to
          compare nature with Scripture, and Scripture with nature, and to
          correct mistakes in interpreting the one by light gained from the
          other. Because the church as a whole, by which we mean the company of
          true believers in all lands and ages, has the promise that it shall be
          guided “into all the truth” (John 16:13), we may confidently expect
          the progress of Christian doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian experience is sometimes regarded as an original source of
          religious truth. Experience, however, is but a testing and proving of
          the truth objectively contained in God&#x27;s revelation. The word
          “experience” is derived from experior, to test, to try. Christian
          consciousness is not “norma normans,” but “norma normata.” Light, like
          life, comes to us through the mediation of others. Yet the first comes
          from God as really as the last, of which without hesitation we say:
          “God made me,” though we have human parents. As I get through the
          service-pipe in my house the same water which is stored in the
          reservoir upon the hillside, so in the Scriptures I get the same truth
          which the Holy Spirit originally communicated to prophets and
          apostles. Calvin, Institutes, book I, chap. 7—“As nature has an
          immediate manifestation of God in conscience, a mediate in his works,
          so revelation has an immediate manifestation of God in the Spirit, a
          mediate in the Scriptures.” “Man&#x27;s nature,” said Spurgeon, “is
          not an organized lie, yet his inner consciousness has been warped by
          sin, and though once it was an infallible guide to truth and duty, sin
          has made it very deceptive. The standard of infallibility is not in
          man&#x27;s consciousness, but in the Scriptures. When consciousness in
          any matter is contrary to the word of God, we must know that it is not
          God&#x27;s voice within us, but the devil&#x27;s.” Dr. George A.
          Gordon says that “Christian history is a revelation of Christ
          additional to that contained in the New Testament.”Should we not say
          “illustrative,” instead of “additional”? On the relation between
          Christian experience and Scripture, see Stearns, Evidence of Christian
          Experience, 286-309: Twesten, Dogmatik, 1:344-348; Hodge, Syst.
          Theol., 1:15.
        </p>
        <p>
          H. H. Bawden: “God is the ultimate authority, but there are delegated
          authorities, such as family, state, church; instincts, feelings,
          conscience; the general experience of the race, traditions, utilities;
          revelation in nature and in Scripture. But the highest authority
          available for men in morals and religion is the truth concerning
          Christ contained in the Christian Scriptures. What the truth
          concerning Christ is, is determined by: (1) the human reason,
          conditioned by a right attitude of the feelings and the will; (2) in
          the light of all the truth derived from nature, including man; (3) in
          the light of the history of Christianity; (4) in the light of the
          origin and development of the Scriptures themselves. The authority of
          the generic reason and the authority of the Bible are co-relative,
          since they both have been developed in the providence of God, and
          since the latter is in large measure but the reflection of the former.
          This view enables us to hold a rational conception of the function of
          the Scripture in religion. This view, further, enables us to
          rationalize what is called the inspiration of the Bible, the nature
          and extent of inspiration, the Bible as history—a record of the
          historic unfolding of revelation; the Bible as literature—a compend of
          life-principles, rather than a book of rules; the Bible
          Christocentric—an incarnation of the divine thought and will in human
          thought and language.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The theology of Scripture not unnatural.—Though we speak of the
          systematized truths of nature as constituting natural theology, we are
          not to infer that Scriptural theology is unnatural. Since the
          Scriptures have the same author as nature, the same principles are
          illustrated in the one as in the other. All the doctrines of the Bible
          have their reason in that same nature of God which constitutes the
          basis of all material things. Christianity is a supplementary
          dispensation, not as contradicting, or correcting errors in, natural
          theology, but as more perfectly revealing the truth. Christianity is
          indeed the ground-plan upon which the whole creation is built—the
          original and eternal truth of which natural theology is but a partial
          expression. Hence the theology of nature and the theology of Scripture
          are mutually dependent. Natural theology not only prepares the way
          for, but it receives stimulus and aid from, Scriptural theology.
          Natural theology may now be a source of truth, which, before the
          Scriptures came, it could not furnish.
        </p>
        <p>
          John Caird, Fund. Ideas of Christianity. 23—“There is no such thing as
          a natural religion or religion of reason distinct from revealed
          religion. Christianity is more profoundly, more comprehensively,
          rational, more accordant with the deepest principles of human nature
          and human thought than is natural religion; or, as we may put it,
          Christianity is natural religion elevated and transmuted into
          revealed.” Peabody, Christianity the Religion of Nature, lecture
          2—“Revelation is the unveiling, uncovering of what previously existed,
          and it excludes the idea of newness, invention, creation.... The
          revealed religion of earth is the natural religion of heaven.” Compare
          Rev. 13:8—“the Lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the
          world” = the coming of Christ was no make-shift; in a true sense the
          Cross existed in eternity; the atonement is a revelation of an eternal
          fact in the being of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note Plato&#x27;s illustration of the cave which can be easily
          threaded by one who has previously entered it with a torch. Nature is
          the dim light from the cave&#x27;s mouth; the torch is Scripture. Kant
          to Jacobi, in Jacobi&#x27;s Werke, 3:523—“If the gospel had not
          previously taught the universal moral laws, reason would not yet have
          obtained so perfect an insight into them.” Alexander McLaren:
          “Non-Christian thinkers now talk eloquently about God&#x27;s love, and
          even reject the gospel in the name of that love, thus kicking down the
          ladder by which they have climbed. But it was the Cross that taught
          the world the love of God, and apart from the death of Christ men may
          hope that there is a heart at the centre of the universe, but they can
          never be sure of it.”The parrot fancies that he taught men to talk. So
          Mr. Spencer fancies that he invented ethics. He is only using the
          twilight, after his sun has gone down. Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theol.,
          252, 253—“Faith, at the Reformation, first gave scientific certainty;
          it had God sure: hence it proceeded to banish scepticism in philosophy
          and science.”See also Dove, Logic of Christian Faith, 333; Bowen,
          Metaph. and Ethics, 442-463; Bib. Sac., 1874:436; A. H. Strong, Christ
          in Creation, 226, 227.
