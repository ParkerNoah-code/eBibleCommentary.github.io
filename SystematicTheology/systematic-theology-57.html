        <p>I. The Means of Grace in General</p>
        <p>A. THE IDEA OF THE MEANS OF GRACE.</p>
        <p>
          Fallen man receives all the blessings of salvation out of the eternal
          fountain of the grace of God, in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ
          and through the operation of the Holy Spirit. While the Spirit can and
          does in some respects operate immediately on the soul of the sinner,
          He has seen fit to bind Himself largely to the use of certain means in
          the communication of divine grace. The term "means of grace" is not
          found in the Bible, but is nevertheless a proper designation of the
          means that are indicated in the Bible. At the same time the term is
          not very definite and may have a far more comprehensive meaning than
          it ordinarily has in theology. The Church may be represented as the
          great means of grace which Christ, working through the Holy Spirit,
          uses for the gathering of the elect, the edification of the saints,
          and the building up of His spiritual body. He qualifies her for this
          great task by endowing her with all kinds of spiritual gifts, and by
          the institution of the offices for the administration of the Word and
          the sacraments, which are all means to lead the elect to their eternal
          destiny. But the term may have an even wider scope. The whole
          providential guidance of the saints, through prosperity and adversity,
          often becomes a means by which the Holy Spirit leads the elect to
          Christ or to an ever closer communion with Him. It is even possible to
          include in the means of grace all that is required of men for the
          reception and the continued enjoyment of the blessings of the
          covenant, such as faith, conversion, spiritual warfare, and prayer. It
          is neither customary nor desirable, however, to include all this under
          the term "means of grace." The Church is not a means of grace
          alongside of the Word and the sacraments, because her power in
          promoting the work of the grace of God consists only in the
          administration of these. She is not instrumental in communicating
          grace, except by means of the Word and of the sacraments. Moreover,
          faith, conversion, and prayer, are first of all fruits of the grace of
          God, though they may in turn become instrumental in strengthening the
          spiritual life. They are not objective ordinances, but subjective
          conditions for the possession and enjoyment of the blessings of the
          covenant. Consequently, it is better not to follow Hodge when he
          includes prayer, nor McPherson when he adds to the Word and the
          sacraments both the Church and prayer. Strictly speaking, only the
          Word and the sacraments can be regarded as means of grace, that is, as
          objective channels which Christ has instituted in the Church, and to
          which He ordinarily binds Himself in the communication of His grace.
          Of course these may never be dissociated from Christ, nor from the
          powerful operation of the Holy Spirit, nor from the Church which is
          the appointed organ for the distribution of the blessings of divine
          grace. They are in themselves quite ineffective and are productive of
          spiritual results only through the efficacious operation of the Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WORD AND THE SACRAMENTS AS MEANS OF GRACE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that one can speak of means of grace in a rather general
          sense makes it imperative to point to the distinctive characteristics
          of the means of grace in the technical or restricted sense of the
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are instruments, not of common but of, special grace, the
          grace that removes sin and renews the sinner in conformity with the
          image of God. It is true that the Word of God may and in some respects
          actually does enrich those who live under the gospel with some of the
          choicest blessings of common grace in the restricted sense of the
          word; but it, as well as the sacraments, comes into consideration here
          only as a means of grace in the technical sense of the word. And the
          means of grace in this sense are always connected with the beginning
          and the progressive operation of the special grace of God, that is
          redemptive grace, in the hearts of sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They are in themselves and not in virtue of their connection with
          things not included in them, means of grace. Striking experiences may,
          and undoubtedly sometimes do, serve to strengthen the work of God in
          the hearts of believers, but this does not constitute them means of
          grace in the technical sense, since they accomplish this only in so
          far as these experiences are interpreted in the light of God's Word,
          through which the Holy Spirit operates. The Word and the sacraments
          are in themselves means of grace; their spiritual efficacy is
          dependent only on the operation of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They are continuous instruments of God's grace, and not in any
          sense of the word exceptional. This means that they are not associated
          with the operation of God's grace merely occasionally or in a more or
          less accidental way, but are the regularly ordained means for the
          communication of the saving grace of God and are as such of perpetual
          value. The Heidelberg Catechism asks in Question 65, "Since, then, we
          are made partakers of Christ and all His benefits by faith only,
          whence comes this faith?" And the answer is, "From the Holy Spirit,
          who works it in our hearts by the preaching of the holy gospel, and
          confirms it by the use of the holy sacraments."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They are the official means of the Church of Jesus Christ. The
          preaching of the Word (or, the Word preached) and the administration
          of the sacraments (or, the sacraments administered) are the means
          officially instituted in the Church, by which the Holy Spirit works
          and confirms faith in the hearts of men. Some Reformed theologians
          limit the idea of the means of grace still more by saying that they
          are administered only within the visible Church, and that they
          presuppose the existence of the principle of the new life in the soul.
          Shedd and Dabney both speak of them, without any qualification, as
          "means of sanctification." Says the former: "When the world of
          unregenerate men are said to have the means of grace, the means of
          conviction under common grace, not of sanctification under special
          grace, are intended."36 Honig also distinguishes between the Word of
          God as a means of grace and the Word as it contains the call to
          conversion and serves to call Gentiles to the service of the living
          God.37 Dr. Kuyper, too, thinks of the means of grace merely as means
          for the strengthening of the new life when he says: "The media gratiae
          are means instituted by God that He makes use of to unfold, both
          personally and socially, for and through our consciousness, the
          re-creation that He immediately established in our nature."38 There
          is, of course, a truth in this representation. The principle of the
          new life is wrought in the soul immediately, that is, without the
          mediation of the Word that is preached. But in so far as the
          origination of the new life also includes the new birth and internal
          calling, it may also be said that the Holy Spirit works the beginning
          of the new life or of faith, as the Heidelberg Catechism says, "by the
          preaching of the holy gospel."
        </p>
        <p>C. HISTORICAL VIEWS RESPECTING THE MEANS OF GRACE.</p>
        <p>
          There has been considerable difference of opinion respecting the means
          of grace in the Church of Jesus Christ. The early Church does not
          furnish us with anything very definite on this point. There was far
          more emphasis on the sacraments than on the Word of God. Baptism was
          rather generally regarded as the means by which sinners were
          regenerated, while the eucharist stood out as the sacrament of
          sanctification. In course of time, however, certain definite views
          were developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC VIEW. While the Roman Catholics regarded even
          relics and images as means of grace, they singled out in particular
          the Word and the sacraments. At the same time they failed to give due
          prominence to the Word, and ascribed to it only preparatory
          significance in the work of grace. As compared with the Word, the
          sacraments were considered to be the real means of grace. In the
          system that was gradually developed the Church of Rome recognizes a
          means that is even superior to the sacraments. The Church itself is
          regarded as the primary means of grace. In it Christ continues His
          divine-human life on earth, performs His prophetic, priestly, and
          kingly work, and through it He communicates the fulness of His grace
          and truth. This grace serves especially to raise man from the natural
          to the supernatural order. It is a gratia elevans, a supernatural
          physical power, infused into the natural man through the sacraments
          working ex opere operato. In the sacraments the visible signs and the
          invisible grace are inseparably connected. In fact, the grace of God
          is contained in the means as a sort of substance, is conveyed through
          the channel of the means, and is therefore absolutely bound to the
          means. Baptism regenerates man ex opere operato, and the even more
          important eucharist raises his spiritual life to a higher level. Apart
          from Christ, from the Church, and from the sacrament, there is no
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE LUTHERAN VIEW. With the Reformation the emphasis was shifted
          from the sacraments to the Word of God. Luther gave great prominence
          to the Word of God as the primary means of grace. He pointed out that
          the sacraments have no significance apart from the Word and are in
          fact merely the visible Word. He did not entirely succeed in
          correcting the Roman Catholic error as to the inseparable connection
          between the outward means and the inward grace communicated through
          them. He, too, conceived of the grace of God as a sort of substance
          contained in the means and not to be obtained apart from the means.
          The Word of God is in itself always efficacious and will effect a
          spiritual change in man, unless he puts a stumblingblock in the way.
          And the body and blood of Christ is "in, with, and under" the elements
          of bread and wine, so that they who eat and drink the latter also
          receive the former, though this will be to their advantage only if
          they receive them in the proper manner. It was especially his
          opposition to the subjectivity of the Anabaptists that caused Luther
          to stress the objective character of the sacraments and to make their
          effectiveness dependent on their divine institution rather than on the
          faith of the recipients. The Lutherans did not always steer clear of
          the idea that the sacraments function ex opere operato.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE VIEW OF THE MYSTICS. Luther had to contend a great deal with
          the mystical Anabaptists, and it was especially his reaction to their
          views that determined his final view of the means of grace. The
          Anabaptists, and other mystical sects of the age of the Reformation
          and of later times, virtually deny that God avails Himself of means in
          the distribution of His grace. They stress the fact that God is
          absolutely free in communicating His grace, and therefore can hardly
          be conceived of as bound to such external means. Such means after all
          belong to the natural world, and have nothing in common with the
          spiritual world. God, or Christ, or the Holy Spirit, or the inner
          light, work directly in the heart, and both the Word and the
          sacraments can only serve to indicate or to symbolize this internal
          grace. This whole conception is determined by a dualistic view of
          nature and grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE RATIONALISTIC VIEW. The Socinians of the days of the
          Reformation, on the other hand, moved too far in the opposite
          direction. Socinus himself did not even regard baptism as a rite
          destined to be permanent in the Church of Jesus Christ, but his
          followers did not go to that extreme. They recognized both baptism and
          the Lord's Supper as rites of permanent validity, but ascribed to them
          only a moral efficacy. This means that they thought of the means of
          grace as working only through moral persuasion, and did not associate
          them at all with any mystical operation of the Holy Spirit. In fact,
          they placed the emphasis more on what man did in the means of grace
          than on what God accomplished through them, when they spoke of them as
          mere external badges of profession and (of the sacraments) as
          memorials. The Arminians of the seventeenth century and the
          Rationalists of the eighteenth century shared this view.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. THE REFORMED VIEW. While reaction to the Anabaptists caused the
          Lutherans to move in the direction of Rome and to bind the grace of
          God to the means in the most absolute sense â€” a position also taken
          by High Church Anglicans â€”, the Reformed Churches continued the
          original view of the Reformation. They deny that the means of grace
          can of themselves confer grace, as if they were endued with a magical
          power to produce holiness. God and God only is the efficient cause of
          salvation. And in the distribution and communication of His grace He
          is not absolutely bound to the divinely appointed means through which
          He ordinarily works, but uses them to serve His gracious purposes
          according to His own free will. But while they do not regard the means
          of grace as absolutely necessary and indispensable, they strongly
          oppose the idea that these means may be treated as purely accidental
          and indifferent and can be neglected with impunity. God has appointed
          them as the ordinary means through which He works His grace in the
          hearts of sinners, and their wilful neglect can only result in
          spiritual loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          D. CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENTS IN THE REFORMED DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF
          GRACE.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a proper understanding of the Reformed doctrine of the means of
          grace the following points deserve special emphasis.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The special grace of God operates only in the sphere in which the
          means of grace function. This truth must be maintained over against
          the Mystics, who deny the necessity of the means of grace. God is a
          God of order, who in the operation of His grace ordinarily employs the
          means which He Himself has ordained. This, of course, does not mean
          that He has Himself become subservient to the appointed means and
          could not possibly work without them in the communication of His
          grace, but only that it has pleased Him to bind Himself, except in the
          case of infants, to the use of these means.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. On a single point, namely, in the implanting of the new life, the
          grace of God works immediately, that is, without the use of these
          means as instruments. But even so it works only in the sphere of the
          means of grace, since these are absolutely required in drawing out and
          nourishing the new life. This is a direct negation of the position of
          Rationalism, which represents regeneration as the result of moral
          suasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. While the grace of God generally operates mediately, it is not
          inherent in the means as a divine deposit, but accompanies the use of
          these. This must be maintained in opposition to the Roman Catholics,
          the High Church Anglicans, and the Lutherans, who proceed on the
          assumption that the means of grace always operate in virtue of an
          inherent power, though their operation may be made ineffective by the
          condition or attitude of the recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Word of God may never be separated from the sacraments, but
          must always accompany them, since they are virtually only a visible
          representation of the truth that is conveyed to us by the Word. In the
          Church of Rome the Word retires into the background as having only
          preparatory significance, while the sacraments, considered apart from
          the Word, are regarded as the real means of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. All the knowledge which is obtained by the recipient of divine
          grace, is wrought in him by means of the Word and is derived from the
          Word. This position must be maintained in opposition to all kinds of
          Mystics, who lay claim to special revelations and to a spiritual
          knowledge that is not mediated by the Word, and who thereby lead us
          into a sea of boundless subjectivity.
