        <p>I. The Origin of Man</p>
        <p>A. THE DOCTRINE OF MAN IN DOGMATICS</p>
        <p>
          The transition from Theology to Anthropology, that is, from the study
          of God to the study of man, is a natural one. Man is not only the
          crown of creation, but also the object of God's special care. And
          God's revelation in Scripture is a revelation that is not only given
          to man, but also a revelation in which man is vitally concerned. It is
          not a revelation of God in the abstract, but a revelation of God in
          relation to His creatures, and particularly in relation to man. It is
          a record of God's dealings with the human race, and especially a
          revelation of the redemption which God has prepared for, and for which
          He seeks to prepare, man. This accounts for the fact that man occupies
          a place of central importance in Scripture, and that the knowledge of
          man in relation to God is essential to its proper understanding. The
          doctrine of man must follow immediately after the doctrine of God,
          since the knowledge of it is presupposed in all the following loci of
          Dogmatics. We should not confuse the present subject of study with
          general Anthropology or the science of mankind, which includes all
          those sciences which have men as the object of study. These sciences
          concern themselves with the origin and history of mankind, with the
          physiological structure and the psychical characteristics of man in
          general and of the various races of mankind in particular, with their
          ethnological, linguistic, cultural and religious development, and so
          on. Theological Anthropology is concerned only with what the Bible
          says respecting man and the relation in which he stands and should
          stand to God. It recognizes Scripture only as its source, and reads
          the teachings of human experience in the light of God's Word.
        </p>
        <p>B. SCRIPTURAL ACCOUNT OF ORIGIN OF MAN.</p>
        <p>
          Scripture offers us a twofold account of the creation of man, the one
          in Gen_1:26-27, and the other in Gen_2:7; Gen_2:21-23. Higher
          criticism is of the opinion that the writer of Genesis pieced together
          two creation narratives, the first found in Gen_1:1-31, Gen_2:1-3, and
          the second in Gen_2:4-25; and that these two are independent and
          contradictory. Laidlaw in his work on The Bible Doctrine of Man_1:1 is
          willing to admit that the author of Genesis made use of two sources,
          but refuses to find here two different accounts of creation. He very
          properly denies that in Gen_2:1-25 we have "a different account of
          creation, for the plain reason that it takes no account of the
          creation at large." In fact, the introductory words of the narrative
          beginning with Gen_2:4, "These are the generations of the heavens and
          of the earth, when they were created," seen in the light of the
          repeated use of the words "these are the generations" in the book of
          Genesis, point to the fact that we have something quite different
          here. The expression invariably points, not to the origin or beginning
          of those named, but to their family history. The first narrative
          contains the account of the creation of all things in the order in
          which it occurred, while the second groups things in their relation to
          man, without implying anything respecting the chronological order of
          man's appearance in the creative work of God, and clearly indicates
          that everything preceding it served to prepare a fit habitation for
          man as the king of creation. It shows us how man was situated in God's
          creation, surrounded by the vegetable and animal world, and how he
          began his history. There are certain particulars in which the creation
          of man stands out in distinction from that of other living beings:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. MAN'S CREATION WAS PRECEDED BY A SOLEMN DIVINE COUNSEL. Before the
          inspired writer records the creation of man, he leads us back, as it
          were, into the council of God, acquainting us with the divine decree
          in the words, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,"
          Gen_1:26. The Church has generally interpreted the plural "us" on the
          basis of the trinitarian existence of God. Some scholars, however,
          regard it as a plural of majesty; others, as a plural of
          communication, in which God includes the angels with Himself; and
          still others, as a plural of self-exhortation. Of these three
          suggestions the first is very unlikely, since the plural of majesty
          originated at a much later date; the second is impossible, because it
          would imply that the angels were cocreators with God, and that man is
          also created in the image of the angels, which is an un-Scriptural
          idea; and the third is an entirely gratuitous assumption, for which no
          reason can be assigned. Why should such a self-exhortation be in the
          plural, except for the reason that there is a plurality in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE CREATION OF MAN WAS IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD AN
          IMMEDIATE ACT OF GOD. Some of the expressions used in the narrative
          preceding that of the creation of man indicate mediate creation in
          some sense of the word. Notice the following expressions: "And God
          said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs, yielding seed, and
          fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind" â€” "Let the waters swarm
          with swarms of living creatures" ...and, "Let the earth bring forth
          living creatures after their kind"; and compare these with the simple
          statement, "And God created man." Whatever indication of mediacy in
          the work of creation is contained in the former expressions, is
          entirely wanting in the latter. Evidently the work of God in the
          creation of man was not mediated in any sense of the word. He did make
          use of pre-existent material in forming the body of man, but even this
          was excluded in the creation of the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IN DISTINCTION FROM THE LOWER CREATURES MAN WAS CREATED AFTER A
          DIVINE TYPE. With respect to fishes, birds, and beasts we read that
          God created them after their kind, that is, on a typical form of their
          own. Man, however, was not so created and much less after the type of
          an inferior creature. With respect to him God said, "Let us make man
          in our image, after our likeness. " We shall see what this implies,
          when we discuss the original condition of man, and merely call
          attention to it here, in order to bring out the fact that in the
          narrative of creation the creation of man stands out as something
          distinctive.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE TWO DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF HUMAN NATURE ARE CLEARLY
          DISTINGUISHED. In Gen_2:7 a clear distinction is made between the
          origin of the body and that of the soul. The body was formed out of
          the dust of the ground; in the production of it God made use of
          pre-existing material. In the creation of the soul, however, there was
          no fashioning of pre-existing materials, but the production of a new
          substance. The soul of man was a new production of God in the strict
          sense of the word. Jehovah "breathed into his (man's) nostrils the
          breath of life; and man became a living soul." In these simple words
          the twofold nature of man is clearly asserted, and their teaching is
          corroborated by other passages of Scripture, such as, Ecc_12:7;
          Mat_10:28; Luk_8:55; 2Co_5:1-8; Php_1:22-24; Heb_12:9. The two
          elements are the body and the breath or spirit of life breathed into
          it by God, and by the combination of the two man became "a living
          soul," which means in this connection simply "a living being."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. MAN IS AT ONCE PLACED IN AN EXALTED POSITION. Man is represented as
          standing at the apex of all the created orders. He is crowned as king
          of the lower creation, and is given dominion over all the inferior
          creatures. As such it was his duty and privilege to make all nature
          and all the created beings that were placed under his rule,
          subservient to his will and purpose, in order that he and his whole
          glorious dominion might magnify the almighty Creator and Lord of the
          universe, Gen_1:28; Psa_8:4-9.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.</p>
        <p>
          Among the various theories that have been broached to explain the
          origin of man, the theory of evolution at present holds the field, and
          therefore deserves brief consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. STATEMENT OF THE THEORY. The theory of evolution is not always
          stated in the same form. It is sometimes represented as if man is a
          direct descendant of one of the species of anthropoid apes now in
          existence, and then again, as if man and the higher apes have a common
          ancestry. But whatever difference of opinion there may be on this
          point, it is certain that, according to thorough-going naturalistic
          evolution, man descended from the lower animals, body and soul, by a
          perfectly natural process, controlled entirely by inherent forces. One
          of the leading principles of the theory is that of strict continuity
          between the animal world and man. It cannot allow for discontinuity
          anywhere along the line, for every break is fatal to the theory.
          Nothing that is absolutely new and unpredictable can appear in the
          process. What is now found in man must have been potentially present
          in the original germ out of which all things developed. And the whole
          process must be controlled from start to finish by inherent forces.
          Theistic evolution, which seems more acceptable to many theologians,
          simply regards evolution as God's method of working. It is sometimes
          represented in a form in which God is merely called in to bridge the
          gaps between the inorganic and the organic, and between the irrational
          and the rational, creation. But to the extent to which a special
          operation of God is assumed, gaps are admitted which evolution cannot
          bridge, and something new is called into being, the theory naturally
          ceases to be a pure theory of evolution. It is sometimes held that
          only the body of man is derived by a process of evolution from the
          lower animals, and that God endowed this body with a rational soul.
          This view meets with considerable favor in Roman Catholic circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY. Several objections can be raised against
          the theory of the evolutionary descent of man from the lower animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. From the point of view of the theologian the greatest objection to
          this theory is, of course, that it is contrary to the explicit
          teachings of the Word of God. The Bible could hardly teach more
          clearly than it does that man is the product of a direct and special
          creative act of God, rather than of a process of development out of
          the simian stock of animals. It asserts that God formed man out of the
          dust of the ground, Gen_2:7. Some theologians, in their eagerness to
          harmonize the teachings of Scripture with the theory of evolution,
          suggest that this may be interpreted to mean that God formed the body
          of man out of the body of the animals, which is after all but dust.
          But this is entirely unwarranted, since no reason can be assigned why
          the general expression "of the dust of the ground" should be used
          after the writer had already described the creation of the animals and
          might therefore have made the statement far more specific. Moreover,
          this interpretation is also excluded by the statement in Gen_3:19, "In
          the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
          ground: for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto
          dust shalt thou return." This certainly does not mean that man shall
          return to his former animal state. Beast and man alike return again to
          the dust. Ecc_3:19-20. Finally, we are told explicitly in 1Co_15:39
          that "All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men,
          and another flesh of beasts." As to the spirit of man the Bible
          teaches explicitly that it came directly from God, Gen_2:7, and
          therefore cannot be regarded as a natural development of some
          previously existing substance. In perfect harmony with this Elihu
          says, "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
          giveth me life," Job_33:4. Furthermore, Scripture also teaches that
          man was at once separated from the lower creation by an enormous
          chasm. He at once stood on a high intellectual, moral, and religious
          level, as created in the image of God and was given dominion over the
          lower creation, Gen_1:26-27; Gen_1:31; Gen_2:19-20; Psa_8:5-8. By his
          fall in sin, however, he fell from his high estate and became subject
          to a process of degeneration which sometimes results in bestiality.
          This is quite the opposite of what the evolutionary hypothesis teaches
          us. According to it man stood on the lowest level at the beginning of
          his career, but slightly removed from the brute, and has been rising
          to higher levels ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The second great objection is that the theory has no adequate basis
          in well established facts. It should be borne in mind that, as was
          pointed out before, the evolutionary theory in general, though often
          represented as an established doctrine, is up to the present time
          nothing but an unproved working hypothesis, and a hypothesis that has
          not yet given any great promise of success in demonstrating what it
          set out to prove. Many of the most prominent evolutionists frankly
          admit the hypothetical character of their theory. They still avow
          themselves to be firm believers in the doctrine of descent, but do not
          hesitate to say that they cannot speak with any assurance of its
          method of operation. When Darwin published his works, it was thought
          that the key to the process was found at last, but in course of time
          it was found that the key did not fit the lock. Darwin truly said that
          his theory depended entirely on the possibility of transmitting
          acquired characteristics, and it soon became one of the corner-stones
          of Weismann's biological theory that acquired characteristics are not
          inherited. His opinion received abundant confirmation by the later
          study of genetics. On the basis of the assumed transmission of
          acquired characteristics, Darwin spoke with great assurance of the
          transmutation of species and envisaged a continuous line of
          development from the primordial cell to man; but the experiments of De
          Vries, Mendel, and others tended to discredit his view. The gradual
          and imperceptible changes of Darwin made place for the sudden and
          unexpected mutations of De Vries. While Darwin assumed endless
          variation in several directions, Mendel pointed out that the
          variations or mutations never take the organism outside of the species
          and are subject to a definite law. And modern cytology in its study of
          the cell, with its genes and chromosones as the carriers of the
          inherited characters, confirmed this idea. The so-called new species
          of the evolutionists were proved to be no true species at all, but
          only varietal species, that is varieties of the same species.
          Nordenskioeld in his History of Biology quotes the following sentence
          from a popular account of the results of heredity research, as
          reflecting the true state of affairs: "For the very reason of the
          great number of facts that modern heredity-research has brought to
          light, chaos prevails at present in regard to the views on the
          formation of species," p. 613. Prominent evolutionists now frankly
          admit that the origin of species is a complete mystery to them. And as
          long as that is so, there is not much chance of their explaining the
          origin of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Darwin in his attempt to prove the descent of man from a species of
          anthropoid apes relied on (1) the argument from the structural
          similarity between man and the higher animals; (2) the embryological
          argument; and (3) the argument from rudimentary organs. To these three
          were added later on, (4) the argument derived from blood tests; and
          (5) the palaeontological argument. But none of these arguments furnish
          the desired proof. The argument from structural likeness unwarrantably
          assumes that the similarity can be explained in only one way. Yet it
          can very well be accounted for by the assumption that God in creating
          the animal world made certain typical forms basic throughout, so as to
          have unity in variety, just as a great musician builds up his mighty
          composition on a single theme, which is repeated time and again, and
          at each repetition introduces new variations. The principle of
          preformation gives an adequate explanation of the similarities under
          consideration. The embryological similarity, such as it is, can be
          explained on the same principle. Moreover recent biological studies
          would seem to indicate that no structural similarity but only a
          genetic relationship can prove affinity or descent. As far as the
          rudimentary organs are concerned, more than one scientist has
          expressed doubt as to their vestigial character. Instead of being the
          useless remains of animal organs, it may very well be that they serve
          a definite purpose in the human organism. The blood tests in their
          original form, while pointing to a certain likeness between the blood
          of animals and man, do not prove genetic relationship, since in these
          tests only part of the blood, the sterile serum which contains no
          living matter, was used, while it is an established fact that the
          solid portion of the blood, containing the red and white cells, is the
          carrier of hereditary factors. Later tests, in which the spectroscope
          was called into use and the entire blood was examined, proved
          conclusively that there is an essential difference between the blood
          of animals and that of man. The palaeontological argument is equally
          inconclusive. If man really descended from the anthropoid apes, it
          might be expected that the intermediate forms would be in existence
          somewhere. But Darwin was not able to find this missing link any more
          than the thousands of missing links between the various species of
          animals. We are told that the early progenitors of man have long since
          died out. This being so, it was still possible that they might be
          found among the fossil remains. And to-day scientists actually claim
          that they have found some bones of very ancient men. They have
          reconstructed these men for us, and we can now enjoy looking at the
          imaginary photos of the reconstructed Java man (Pithecanthropus
          erectus), the Heidelberg man (Homo Heidelbergensis), the Neanderthal
          man (Homo Neanderthalensis), the Cro-Magnon, the Piltdown man, and
          others. These reconstructions seem to be taken seriously by some, but
          really have very little value. Since only a few bones were found of
          each, and even these were scattered in some cases, so that it is not
          certain that they belong to the same body, they merely testify to the
          ingenuity of the scientists who reconstructed them. In some cases the
          specialists are by no means agreed as to whether the bones in question
          belonged to a man or to an animal. Dr. Wood, professor of anatomy in
          the University of London, says in a booklet on the Ancestry of Man: "I
          find no occupation less worthy of the science of Anthropology than the
          not unfashionable business of modelling, painting, or drawing these
          nightmare pictures of the imagination, and lending them in the
          process, an utterly false value of apparent reality."2 Fleming, one of
          the most prominent present day scientists, says: "The upshot of it all
          is that we cannot arrange all the known fossil remains of supposed
          'man' in a lineal series gradually advancing in type or form from that
          of any anthropoid ape, or other mammal, up to the modern and now
          existing types of true man. Any supposition or statement that it can
          be done, and is true, is certainly incorrect. It is certainly
          misleading and unspeakably pernicious to put forward in popular
          magazines or other publications read by children pictures of gorillas
          or chimpanzees labelled 'Man's cousin' or 'Man's nearest relative,' or
          to publish perfectly imaginary and grotesque pictures of a supposed
          'Java man' with brutish face as an ancestor of modern man, as is
          occasionally done. Those who do such things are guilty of ignorance or
          deliberate mis-representation. Neither is it justifiable for preachers
          in the pulpit to tell their congregations that there is general
          agreement among scientific men as to the evolutionary origin of Man
          from an animal ancestor."3 But the body of man does not even present
          the greatest difficulties to the evolutionist. These arise from the
          consideration of the spiritual element in man, or what is usually
          called "the origin of mind." It is at this point that his helplessness
          becomes most painfully apparent. In spite of all his attempts, he has
          signally failed to give a plausible explanation of the origin of the
          human mind, or intelligence (progressiveness), language, conscience,
          and religion. This might be pointed out in detail, but we do not deem
          it necessary. There are many who, like Dennert and Batison, still
          profess to believe in the doctrine of descent, but disown the
          Darwinian method of evolution and regard it as a well-nigh complete
          failure. Yet they know of no other method which might take its place.
          This means that for them evolution has ceased to be a science, and has
          become once more a mere philosophical theory. Batison said: "We read
          his (Darwin's) scheme of evolution as we would those of Lucretius or
          of Lamarck. . . . We are just about where Boyle was in the seventeenth
          century." The testimony of Dr. D. H. Scott is very similar. In a
          presidential address before the British Association for the
          Advancement of Science he made the following statements: "All is again
          in the melting-pot. . . . Is evolution, then, not a scientifically
          established fact? No, it is not . . . It is an act of faith â€”
          because there is no alternative." Creation, of course, is not to be
          thought of. He further said that there is in natural science "a return
          to pre-Darwinian chaos." Dr. Fleischmann of Erlangen writes: "The
          Darwinian theory has not a single fact to support it . . . is purely
          the product of the imagination." Even stronger is the assertion of Dr.
          B. Kidd: "Darwinism is a compound of astonishing presumption and
          incomparable ignorance."4 Such scientists as Fleming, Dawson, Kelly,
          and Price do not hesitate to reject the theory of evolution and to
          accept the doctrine of creation. Respecting the origin of man, Sir
          William Dawson says: "I know nothing about the origin of man, except
          what I am told in the Scripture â€” that God created him. I do not
          know anything more than that, and I do not know of anyone who does."5
          Fleming says: "All that science can say at present in the light of
          definitely ascertained and limited human knowledge is that it does not
          know, and has no certain proof how, where, and when man was
          originated. If any true knowledge of it is to come to us, it must come
          from some source other than present modern anthropology."6

        <p>D. THE ORIGIN OF MAN AND THE UNITY OF THE ROCE.</p>
        <p>
          1. SCRIPTURE TESTIMONY TO THE UNITY OF THE RACE. Scripture teaches
          that the whole human race descended from a single pair. This is the
          obvious sense of the opening chapters of Genesis. God created Adam and
          Eve as the beginning of the human species, and commanded them to be
          fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth. Moreover, the
          subsequent narrative in Genesis clearly shows that the following
          generations down to the time of the flood stood in unbroken genetic
          relation with the first pair, so that the human race constitutes not
          only a specific unity, a unity in the sense that all men share the
          same human nature, but also a genetic or genealogical unity. This is
          also taught by Paul in Act_17:26, "And God made of one every nation of
          man to dwell on all the face of the earth." The same truth is basic to
          the organic unity of the human race in the first transgression, and of
          the provision for the salvation of the race in Christ, Rom_5:12;
          Rom_5:19; 1Co_15:21-22. This unity of the race is not to be understood
          realistically, as it is represented by Shedd, who says: "Human nature
          is a specific or general substance created in and with the first
          individuals of a human species, which is not yet individualized, but
          which by ordinary generation is subdivided into parts, and those parts
          are formed into distinct and separate individuals of the species. The
          one specific substance, by propagation, is metamorphosed into millions
          of individual substances, or persons. An individual is a fractional
          part of human nature separated from the common mass, and constituted a
          particular person, having all the essential properties of human
          nature."7The objections to this view will be stated in another
          connection.

          2. THE TESTIMONY OF SCIENCE TO THE UNITY OF THE RACE. Science in
          various ways confirms the testimony of Scripture as to the unity of
          the human race. Scientific men have not always believed in this. The
          ancient Greeks had their theory of autochtonism, to the effect that
          men sprang from the earth by a sort of spontaneous generation, a
          theory that has no solid foundation whatever, since spontaneous
          generation has never been proved but rather discredited. Agassiz
          propounded the theory of the Coadamites, which assumes that there were
          different centers of creation. As early as 1655 Peyrerius developed
          the theory of the Preadamites, which proceeds on the assumption that
          there were men before Adam was created. This theory was revived by
          Winchell, who did not deny the unity of the race, but regarded Adam as
          the first ancestor of the Jews rather than as the head of the human
          race. And in recent years Fleming, without being dogmatic in the
          matter, says that there are reasons to assume that there were inferior
          races of man preceding the appearance of Adam on the scene about 5500
          B.C. While inferior to the Adamites, they already had powers distinct
          from those of the animals. The later Adamic man was endowed with
          greater and nobler powers and probably destined to bring the whole of
          the other existing humanity into allegiance to the Creator. He failed
          to preserve his own allegiance to God, and therefore God provided for
          the coming of a descendant who was human and yet far more than man, in
          order that He might accomplish what the Adamic man failed to do. The
          view which Fleming has been led to hold is "that the unquestionably
          Caucasian branch is alone the derivation by normal generation from the
          Adamic race, namely, from the God-worshipping members of the Adamic
          race which survived the flood â€” Noah and his sons and daughters."88
          But these theories, one and all, find no support in Scripture, and are
          contrary to Act_17:26 and to all that the Bible teaches concerning the
          apostasy and deliverance of man. Moreover, science presents several
          arguments in favor of the unity of the human race, such as:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The argument from history. The traditions of the race of men point
          decisively to a common origin and ancestry in Central Asia. The
          history of the migrations of man tends to show that there has been a
          distribution from a single center.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The argument from philology. The study of the languages of mankind
          indicates a common origin. The Indo-Germanic languages are traced to a
          common primitive tongue, an old remnant of which still exists in the
          Sanskrit language. Moreover, there is evidence which goes to show that
          the old Egyptian is the connecting link between the Indo-European and
          the Semitic tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The argument from psychology. The soul is the most important part
          of the constitutional nature of man, and psychology clearly reveals
          the fact that the souls of all men, to whatever tribes or nations they
          may belong, are essentially the same. They have in common the same
          animal appetites, instincts, and passions, the same tendencies and
          capacities, and above all the same higher qualities, the mental and
          moral characteristics that belong exclusively to man.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The argument from natural science or physiology. It is now the
          common judgment of comparative physiologists that the human race
          constitutes but a single species. The differences that exist between
          the various families of mankind are regarded simply as varieties of
          this one species. Science does not positively assert that the human
          race descended from a single pair, but nevertheless demonstrates that
          this may have been the case and probably is.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What can be said against the view that we
          have in Gen_1:1-31, Gen_2:1-25 two different and more or less
          contradictory accounts of creation? Does it seem reasonable to think
          that the world existed millions of years before man appeared on the
          scene? Is the hypothesis of theistic evolution in harmony with the
          Scriptural account of the origin of man? Is the notion that the body
          of man at least is derived from the animals tenable in the light of
          Scripture? Has evolution established its case on this point? What has
          it proved in connection with the far more difficult question of the
          derivation of the human soul? What becomes of the doctrine of the fall
          in the theory of evolution? What is the theological significance of
          the doctrine of the unity of the human race?
