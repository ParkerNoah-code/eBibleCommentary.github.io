        <p>Introduction</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the application of the merits of Christ naturally
          leads on to the doctrine of the Church, for the Church consists of
          those who are partakers of Christ and of the blessings of salvation
          that are in Him. The Reformed conception is that Christ, by the
          operation of the Holy Spirit, unites men with Himself, endows them
          with true faith, and thus constitutes the Church as His body, the
          communio fidelium or sanctorum. In Roman Catholic theology, however,
          the discussion of the Church takes precedence over everything else,
          preceding even the discussion of the doctrine of God and of divine
          revelation. The Church, it is said, has been instrumental in producing
          the Bible and therefore takes precedence over it; it is moreover the
          dispenser of all supernatural graces. It is not Christ that leads us
          to the Church, but the Church that leads us to Christ. All the
          emphasis falls, not on the invisible Church as the communio fidelium,
          but on the visible Church as the mater fidelium. The Reformation broke
          with this Roman Catholic view of the Church and centered attention
          once more on the Church as a spiritual organism. It emphasized the
          fact that there is no Church apart from the redemptive work of Christ
          and from the renewing operations of the Holy Spirit; and that,
          therefore, the discussion of these logically precedes the
          consideration of the doctrine of the Church.

          It seems rather peculiar that practically all the outstanding
          Presbyterian dogmaticians of our country, such as the two Hodges, H.
          B. Smith, Shedd, and Dabney, have no separate locus on the Church in
          their dogmatical works and, in fact, devote very little attention to
          it. Only the works of Thornwell and Breckenridge form an exception to
          the rule. This might create the impression that, in their opinion, the
          doctrine of the Church should not have a place in dogmatics. But this
          is extremely unlikely, since none of them raise a single objection to
          its inclusion. Moreover, Turretin and their Scottish forbears, on
          whose foundation they are building, devote a great deal of attention
          to the Church. Walker says: "There is perhaps no country in the world
          in which all kinds of Church questions have been so largely discussed
          as in our own."1 And, finally, Dr. A. A. Hodge informs us that his
          father lectured to his various classes on the subjects of
          Ecclesiology, practically covered the entire ground, and intended to
          complete his Systematic Theology by the publication of a fourth volume
          on the Church; but was prevented by the infirmities incident to his
          advanced age.2 Dabney says that he omitted the doctrine of the Church,
          because this was ably treated in another department of the Seminary in
          which he labored.3 Shedd in giving his scheme asserts that the Church
          comes into consideration in connection with the means of grace.4
          However, he devotes very little attention to the means of grace and
          does not discuss the doctrine of the Church. And the editor of Smith's
          System of Christian Theology incorporated into this work the author's
          views on the Church, as expressed in other works.5
