        <p>II. The Immortality of the Soul</p>
        <p>
          In the preceding it was pointed out that physical death is the
          separation of body and soul and marks the end of our present physical
          existence. It necessarily involves and results in the decomposition of
          the body. It marks the end of our present life and the end of the
          "natural body." But now the question arises, What becomes of the soul:
          does physical death bring its life to a close, or does it continue to
          exist and live on after death? It has always been the firm conviction
          of the Church of Jesus Christ that the soul continues to live even
          after its separation from the body. This doctrine of the immortality
          of the soul calls for brief consideration at this point.
        </p>
        <p>DIFFERENT CONNOTATIONS OF THE TERM "IMMORTALITY."</p>
        <p>
          In a discussion of the doctrine of immortality it should be borne in
          mind that the term "immortality" is not always used in the same sense.
          There are certain distinctions that are quite essential, in order to
          prevent confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the most absolute sense of the word immortality is ascribed only
          to God. Paul speaks of Him in 1Ti_6:15-16 as "the blessed and only
          Potentate, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, who only hath
          immortality." This does not mean that none of His creatures are
          immortal in any sense of the word. Understood in that unrestricted
          sense, this word of Paul would also teach that the angels are not
          immortal, and this is certainly not the intention of the apostle. The
          evident meaning of his statement is that God is the only being who
          possesses immortality "as an original, eternal, and necessary
          endowment." Whatever immortality may be ascribed to some of His
          creatures, is contingent on the divine will, is conferred upon them,
          and therefore had a beginning. God, on the other hand, is necessarily
          free from all temporal limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Immortality in the sense of continuous or endless existence is also
          ascribed to all spirits, including the human soul. It is one of the
          doctrines of natural religion or philosophy that, when the body is
          dissolved, the soul does not share in its dissolution, but retains its
          identity as an individual being. This idea of the immortality of the
          soul is in perfect harmony with what the Bible teaches about man, but
          the Bible, religion, and theology, are not primarily interested in
          this purely quantitative and colourless immortality, â€” the bare
          continued existence of the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, the term "immortality" is used in theological language to
          designate that state of man in which he is entirely free from the
          seeds of decay and death. In this sense of the word man was immortal
          before the fall. This state clearly did not exclude the possibility of
          man's becoming subject to death. Though man in the state of rectitude
          was not subject to death, yet he was liable to it. It was entirely
          possible that through sin he would become subject to the law of death;
          and as a matter of fact he did fall a victim to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Finally, the word "immortality" designates, especially in
          eschatological language, that state of man in which he is impervious
          to death and cannot possibly become its prey. Man was not immortal in
          this highest sense of the word in virtue of his creation, even though
          he was created in the image of God. This immortality would have
          resulted if Adam had complied with the condition of the covenant of
          works, but can now only result from the work of redemption as it is
          completed in the consummation.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. TESTIMONY OF GENERAL REVELATION TO THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.
        </p>
        <p>The question of Job, "If a man die, shall he live again?" (</p>
        <p>
          Job_14:14) is one of perennial interest. And with it the question
          constantly recurs, whether the dead still live. The answer to this
          question has practically always been an affirmative one. Though
          evolutionists cannot admit that faith in the immortality of the soul
          is an original endowment of man, yet it cannot be denied that this
          faith is all but universal, and is found even in the lowest forms of
          religion. Under the influence of materialism many have been inclined
          to doubt and even to deny the future life of man. Yet this negative
          attitude is not the prevailing one. In a recent Symposium on
          "Immortality," containing the views of about a hundred representative
          men, the opinions are practically unanimous in favour of a future
          life. The historical and philosophical arguments for the immortality
          of the soul are not absolutely conclusive, but certainly are important
          testimonies to the continued personal and conscious existence of man.
          They are the following.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE HISTORICAL ARGUMENT. The consensus gentium is just as strong in
          connection with the immortality of the soul, as it is with reference
          to the existence of God. There always have been unbelieving scholars
          who denied the continued existence of man, but in general it may be
          said that belief in the immortality of the soul is found among all
          races and nations, no matter what their stage of civilization may be.
          And it would seem that a notion so common can only be regarded as a
          natural instinct or as something involved in the very constitution of
          human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENT. This argument is based on the simplicity
          of the human soul, and infers from this its indissolubility. In death
          matter is dissolved into its parts. But the soul as a spiritual entity
          is not composed of various parts, and is therefore incapable of
          division or dissolution. Consequently, the decomposition of the body
          does not carry with it the destruction of the soul. Even when the
          former perishes, the latter remains intact. This argument is very old
          and was already used by Plato.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT. Human beings seem to be endowed with
          almost infinite capabilities, which are never fully developed in this
          life. It seems as if most men only just begin to accomplish some of
          the great things to which they aspire. There are ideals that fall far
          short of realization, appetites and desires that are not satisfied in
          this life, yearnings and aspirations that are disappointed. Now it is
          argued that God would not have conferred upon men such abilities and
          talents, only to make them fail in their achievements, would not have
          filled the heart with such desires and aspirations, only to disappoint
          them. He must have provided a future existence, in which human life
          will come to fruition.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE MORAL ARGUMENT. The human conscience testifies to the existence
          of a moral Ruler of the universe who will exercise justice. Yet the
          demands of justice are not met in this present life. There is a very
          unequal and seemingly unjust distribution of good and evil. The wicked
          often prosper, increase in riches, and have an abundant share of the
          joys of life, while the pious frequently live in poverty, meet with
          painful and humiliating reverses, and suffer many afflictions. Hence
          there must be a future state of existence, in which justice will reign
          supreme, and the inequalities of the present will be adjusted.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. TESTIMONY OF SPECIAL REVELATION TO THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.
        </p>
        <p>
          The historical and philosophical proofs for the survival of the soul
          are not absolutely demonstrative, and therefore do not compel belief.
          For greater assurance in this matter, it is necessary to direct the
          eye of faith to Scripture. Here, too, we must rely on the voice of
          authority. Now the position of Scripture with respect to this matter
          may at first seem somewhat dubious. It speaks of God as the only one
          who hath immortality (1Ti_6:15), and never predicates this of man.
          There is no explicit mention of the immortality of the soul, and much
          less any attempt to prove it in a formal way. Hence the Russellites or
          Millennial Dawnists often challenge theologians to point to a single
          passage in which the Bible teaches that the soul of man is immortal.
          But even if the Bible does not explicitly state that the soul of man
          is immortal, and does not seek to prove this in a formal way, any more
          than it seeks to present formal proof for the existence of God, this
          does not mean that Scripture denies or contradicts or even ignores it.
          It clearly assumes in many passages that man continues his conscious
          existence after death. In fact, it treats the truth of the immortality
          of man very much as it does that of the existence of God, that is, it
          assumes this as an undisputed postulate.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE DOCTRINE OF IMMORTALITY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. The assertion has
          been made repeatedly that the Old Testament, and particularly the
          Pentateuch, does not teach in any way the immortality of the soul. Now
          it is perfectly true that this great truth is revealed less clearly in
          the Old than in the New Testament; but the facts in the case do not
          warrant the assertion that it is absent from the Old Testament
          altogether. It is a well-known and generally recognized fact that
          God's revelation in Scripture is progressive and gradually increases
          in clearness; and it stands to reason that the doctrine of immortality
          in the sense of a blessed eternal life, could only be revealed in all
          its bearings after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who "brought life
          and immortality to light," 2Ti_1:10. But while all this is true, it
          cannot be denied that the Old Testament implies the continued
          conscious existence of man, either in the sense of a bare immortality
          or survival of the soul, or of a blessed future life, in several ways.
          This is implied:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In its doctrine of God and man. The very root of Israel's hope of
          immortality was found in its belief in God as its Creator and
          Redeemer, its covenant God, who would never fail them. He was to them
          the living, the eternal, the faithful God, in whose fellowship they
          found joy, life, peace, and perfect satisfaction. Would they have
          panted after Him as they did, have entrusted themselves to Him
          completely in life and death, and have sung of Him as their portion
          forever, if they felt that all He offered them was but for a brief
          span of time? How could they derive real comfort from the promised
          redemption of God, if they regarded death as the end of their
          existence? Moreover, the Old Testament represents man as created in
          the image of God, created for life and not for mortality. In
          distinction from the brute, he possesses a life that transcends time
          and already contains within itself a pledge of immortality. He is made
          for communion with God, is but little lower than the angels, and God
          has set eternity in his heart, Ecc_3:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In its doctrine of sheol. We are taught in the Old Testament that
          the dead descend into sheol. The discussion of this doctrine belongs
          to the following chapter. But whatever may be the proper
          interpretation of the Old Testament sheol, and whatever may be said of
          the condition of those who have descended into it, this is certainly
          represented as a state of more or less conscious existence, though not
          one of bliss. Man enters upon the state of perfect bliss only by a
          deliverance from sheol. In this deliverance we reach the real core of
          the Old Testament hope of a blessed immortality. This is clearly
          taught in several passages, such as Psa_16:10; Psa_49:14-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In its frequent warnings against consulting the dead or "familiar
          spirits " that is, persons who were able to summon the spirits of the
          dead and to convey their messages to the inquirers, Lev_19:31;
          Lev_20:27; Deu_18:11; Isa_8:19; Isa_29:4. Scripture does not say that
          it is impossible to consult the dead, but rather seems to presuppose
          the possibility while it condemns the practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. In its teachings respecting the resurrection of the dead. This
          doctrine is not explicitly taught in the earlier books of the Old
          Testament. Christ points out, however, that it was taught by
          implication in the statement, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of
          Isaac, and the God of Jacob," Mat_22:32, cf. Exo_3:6, and chides the
          Jews for not understanding the Scriptures on this point. Moreover, the
          doctrine of the resurrection is explicitly taught in such passages as
          Job_19:23-27; Psa_16:9-11; Psa_17:15; Psa_49:15; Psa_73:24; Isa_26:19;
          Dan_12:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. In certain striking Old Testament passages which speak of the
          believer's enjoyment in communion with God after death. These are in
          the main identical with the passages referred to in the preceding,
          namely, Job_19:25-27; Psa_16:9-11; Psa_17:15; Psa_73:23-24; Psa_73:26.
          They breathe the confident expectation of pleasures in the presence of
          Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE DOCTRINE OF IMMORTALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. In the New
          Testament, after Christ has brought life and immortality to light, the
          proofs naturally multiply. The passages that contain these may again
          be divided into various classes, as referring:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. To the survival of the soul. A continued existence of both the
          righteous and the wicked is clearly taught. That the souls of
          believers survive, appears from such passages as Mat_10:28; Luk_23:43;
          Joh_11:25 f; Joh_14:3; 2Co_5:1; and several other passages make it
          quite evident that the same can be said of the souls of the wicked,
          Mat_11:21-24; Mat_1:1; Rom_2:5-11; 2Co_5:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. To the resurrection by which the body is also made to share in the
          future existence. For believers the resurrection means the redemption
          of the body and entrance into the perfect life in communion with God,
          the full blessedness of immortality. This resurrection is taught in
          Luk_20:35-36; Joh_5:25-29; 1Co_15:1-581Th_4:16; Php_3:21, and other
          passages. For the wicked the resurrection will also mean a renewed and
          continued existence of the body, but this can hardly be called life.
          Scripture calls it eternal death. The resurrection of the wicked is
          mentioned in Joh_5:29; Act_24:15; Rev_20:12-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. To the blessed life of believers i; n communion with God. There are
          numerous passages in the New Testament which stress the fact that the
          immortality of believers is not a bare endless existence, but a
          rapturous life of bliss in communion with God and with Jesus Christ,
          the full fruition of the life that is implanted in the soul while
          still on earth. This is clearly emphasized in such passages as
          Mat_13:43; Mat_25:34; Rom_2:7; Rom_2:10; 1Co_15:49; Php_3:21; 2Ti_4:8;
          Rev_21:4; Rev_22:3-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          D. OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF PERSONAL IMMORTALITY AND MODERN
          SUBSTITUTES FOR IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE MAIN OBJECTION TO IT. Belief in the immortality of the soul for
          a time suffered a decline under the influence of a materialistic
          philosophy. The main argument against it was forged in the workshop of
          physiological psychology, and runs somewhat as follows: The mind or
          the soul has no independent substantial existence, but is simply a
          product or function of brain activity. The brain of man is the
          producing cause of mental phenomena, just as the liver is the
          producing cause of bile. The function cannot persist when the organ
          decays. When the brain ceases to operate, the stream of mental life
          comes to a stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. SUBSTITUTES FOR THE DOCTRINE OF PERSONAL IMMORTALITY. The desire
          for immortality is so deeply implanted in the human soul that even
          those who accept the dicta of a materialistic science, seek some sort
          of substitute for the discarded notion of the personal immortality of
          the soul. Their hope for the future assumes one of the following
          forms:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Racial immortality. There are those who comfort themselves with the
          idea that the individual will continue to live on this earth in his
          posterity, in his children and grandchildren, to endless generations.
          The individual seeks compensation for his lack of hope in a personal
          immortality in the notion that he contributes his share to the life of
          the race and will continue to live on in that. But the idea that a man
          lives on in his progeny, whatever modicum of truth it may contain, can
          hardly serve as a substitute for the doctrine of personal immortality.
          It certainly does not do justice to the data of Scripture, and does
          not satisfy the deepest longings of the human heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Immortality of commemoration. According to Positivism this is the
          only immortality we should desire and look for. Everyone should aim at
          doing something to establish a name for himself, which will go down in
          the annals of history. If he does this, he will continue to live in
          the hearts and minds of a grateful posterity. This also falls far
          short of the personal immortality which Scripture leads us to expect.
          Moreover, it is an immortality in which only a few will share. The
          names of most men are not recorded on the pages of history, and many
          of those who are so recorded are soon forgotten. And to a great extent
          it may be said that the best and the worst share it alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Immortality of in fl uence. This is very closely related to the
          preceding. If a man makes his mark in life, and accomplishes something
          that is of enduring value, his influence will continue long after he
          is gone. Jesus and Paul, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, Luther and
          Calvin, â€” they are all very much alive in the influence which they
          exercise up to the present time. While this is perfectly true, this
          immortality of influence is but a poor substitute for personal
          immortality. All the objections that were raised against the
          immortality of commemoration, also apply in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE RECOVERY OF FAITH IN IMMORTALITY. At the present time the
          materialistic interpretation of the universe is making way for a more
          spiritual interpretation; and as a result faith in personal
          immortality is once more gaining favor. Dr. William James, while
          subscribing to the formula, "Thought is a function of the brain,"
          denies that this logically compels us to disbelieve the doctrine of
          immortality. He maintains that this conclusion of the scientists is
          based on the mistaken notion that the function of which the formula
          speaks is necessarily a productive function, and points out that it
          may also be a permissive or transmissive function. The brain may
          merely transmit, and in the transmission colour, thought, just as a
          coloured glass, a prism, or a refracting lens, may transmit light and
          at the same time determine its colour and direction. The light exists
          independent of the glass or lens; so thought also exists independent
          of the brain. He comes to the conclusion that one can, in strict
          logic, believe in immortality. Some evolutionists now base the
          doctrine of conditional immortality on the struggle for existence. And
          such scientists as William James, Sir Oliver Lodge, and James H.
          Hyslop, attach great significance to reputed communications with the
          dead. On the basis of psychic phenomena the first was inclined to
          believe in immortality, while the other two embraced it as an
          established fact.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: Is the doctrine of immortality found in
          the Pentateuch? What accounts for the comparative scarcity of proofs
          for it in the Old Testament? On what did Plato base his belief in the
          immortality of the soul? How did Kant judge of the usual natural
          arguments for the doctrine of immortality? Is there any place for
          belief in personal immortality in either Materialism or Pantheism? Why
          does the doctrine of so-called "social immortality" fail to satisfy?
          Is the immortality of the soul in the philosophical sense the same as
          eternal life? How should we judge of the reputed spiritualistic
          communications with the dead?
