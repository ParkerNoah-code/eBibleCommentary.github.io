        <p>II. Predestination</p>
        <p>
          In passing from the discussion of the divine decree to that of
          predestination, we are still dealing with the same subject, but are
          passing from the general to the particular. The word "predestination"
          is not always used in the same sense. Sometimes it is employed simply
          as a synonym of the generic word "decree." In other cases it serves to
          designate the purpose of God respecting all His moral creatures. Most
          frequently, however, it denotes "the counsel of God concerning fallen
          men, including the sovereign election of some and the righteous
          reprobation of the rest. In the present discussion it is used
          primarily in the last sense, though not altogether to the exclusion of
          the second meaning.
        </p>
        <p>THE DOCTRINE OF PREDESTINATION IN HISTORY</p>
        <p>
          Predestination does not form an important subject of discussion in
          history until the time of Augustine. Earlier Church Fathers allude to
          it, but do not as yet seem to have a very clear conception of it. On
          the whole they regard it as the prescience of God with reference to
          human deeds, on the basis of which He determines their future destiny.
          Hence it was possible for Pelagius to appeal to some of those early
          Fathers. "According to Pelagius," says Wiggers, "foreordination to
          salvation or to damnation, is founded on prescience. Consequently he
          did not admit an 'absolute predestination,' but in every respect a
          'conditional predestination'."46 At first, Augustine himself was
          inclined to this view, but deeper reflection on the sovereign
          character of the good pleasure of God led him to see that
          predestination was in no way dependent on God's foreknowledge of human
          actions, but was rather the basis of the divine foreknowledge. His
          representation of reprobation is not as unambiguous as it might be.
          Some of his statements are to the effect that in predestination God
          foreknows what He will Himself do, while He is also able to foreknow
          what He will not do, as all sins; and speak of the elect as subjects
          of predestination, and of the reprobate as subjects of the divine
          foreknowledge.47 In other passages, however, he also speaks of the
          reprobate as subjects of predestination, so that there can be no doubt
          about it that he taught a double predestination. However, he
          recognized their difference, consisting in this that God did not
          predestinate unto damnation and the means unto it in the same way as
          He did to salvation, and that predestination unto life is purely
          sovereign, while predestination unto eternal death is also judicial
          and takes account of man's sin.48
        </p>
        <p>
          Augustine's view found a great deal of opposition, particularly in
          France, where the semi-Pelagians, while admitting the need of divine
          grace unto salvation, reasserted the doctrine of a predestination
          based on foreknowledge. And they who took up the defense of Augustine
          felt constrained to yield on some important points. They failed to do
          justice to the doctrine of a double predestination. Only Gottschalk
          and a few of his friends maintained this, but his voice was soon
          silenced, and Semi-Pelagianism gained the upper hand at least among
          the leaders of the Church. Toward the end of the Middle Ages it became
          quite apparent that the Roman Catholic Church would allow a great deal
          of latitude in the doctrine of predestination. As long as its teachers
          maintained that God willed the salvation of all men, and not merely of
          the elect, they could with Thomas Aquinas move in the direction of
          Augustinianism in the doctrine of predestination, or with Molina
          follow the course of Semi-Pelagianism, as they thought best. This
          means that even in the case of those who, like Thomas Aquinas,
          believed in an absolute and double predestination, this doctrine could
          not be carried through consistently, and could not be made
          determinative of the rest of their theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Reformers of the sixteenth century all advocated the strictest
          doctrine of predestination. This is even true of Melanchton in his
          earliest period. Luther accepted the doctrine of absolute
          predestination, though the conviction that God willed that all men
          should be saved caused him to soft-pedal the doctrine of
          predestination somewhat later in life. It gradually disappeared from
          Lutheran theology, which now regards it either wholly or in part
          (reprobation) as conditional. Calvin firmly maintained the Augustinian
          doctrine of an absolute double predestination. At the same time he, in
          his defense of the doctrine against Pighius, stressed the fact that
          the decree respecting the entrance of sin into the world was a
          permissive decree, and that the decree of reprobation should be so
          construed that God was not made the author of sin nor in any way
          responsible for it. The Reformed Confessions are remarkably consistent
          in embodying this doctrine, though they do not all state it with equal
          fulness and precision. As a result of the Arminian assault on the
          doctrine, the Canons of Dort contain a clear and detailed statement of
          it. In churches of the Arminian type the doctrine of absolute
          predestination has been supplanted by the doctrine of conditional
          predestination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the days of Schleiermacher the doctrine of predestination
          received an entirely different form. Religion was regarded as a
          feeling of absolute dependence, a Hinneigung zum Weltall, a
          consciousness of utter dependence on the causality that is proper to
          the natural order with its invariable laws and second causes, which
          predetermine all human resolves and actions. And predestination was
          identified with this predetermination by nature or the universal
          causal connection in the world. The scathing denunciation of this view
          by Otto is none too severe: "There can be no more spurious product of
          theological speculation, no more fundamental falsification of
          religious conceptions than this; and it is certainly not against this
          that the Rationalist feels an antagonism, for it is itself a piece of
          solid Rationalism, but at the same time a complete abandonment of the
          real religious idea of 'predestination'."49 In modern liberal theology
          the doctrine of predestination meets with little favor. It is either
          rejected or changed beyond recognition. G. B. Foster brands it as
          determinism; Macintosh represents it as a predestination of all men to
          be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ; and others reduce it to a
          predestination to certain offices or privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our day Barth has again directed attention to the doctrine of
          predestination, but has given a construction of it which is not even
          distantly related to that of Augustine and Calvin. With the Reformers
          he holds that this doctrine stresses the sovereign freedom of God in
          His election, revelation, calling, and so on.50 At the same time he
          does not see in predestination a predetermined separation of men, and
          does not understand election like Calvin as particular election. This
          is evident from what he says on page 332 of his Roemerbrief. Camfield
          therefore says in his Essay in Barthian Theology, entitled Revelation
          and the Holy Spirit51 "It needs to be emphasized that predestination
          does not mean the selection of a number of people for salvation and
          the rest for damnation according to the determination of an unknown
          and unknowable will. That idea does not belong to predestination
          proper." Predestination brings man into crisis in the moment of
          revelation and decision. It condemns him in the relation in which he
          stands to God by nature, as sinner, and in that relation rejects him,
          but it chooses him in the relation to which he is called in Christ,
          and for which he was destined in creation. If man responds to God's
          revelation by faith, he is what God intended him to be, an elect; but
          if he does not respond, he remains a reprobate. But since man is
          always in crisis, unconditional pardon and complete rejection continue
          to apply to every one simultaneously. Esau may become Jacob, but Jacob
          may also become once more Esau. Says McConnachie: "For Barth, and as
          he believes, for St. Paul, the individual is not the object of
          election or reprobation, but rather the arena of election or
          reprobation. The two decisions meet within the same individual, but in
          such a way that, seen from the human side, man is always reprobate,
          but seen from the divine side, he is always elect. . . . The ground of
          election is faith. The ground of reprobation is want of faith. But who
          is he who believes? And who is he who disbelieves? Faith and unbelief
          are grounded in God. We stand at the gates of mystery."52
        </p>
        <p>B. SCRIPTURAL TERMS FOR PREDESTINATION</p>
        <p>The following terms come into consideration here:</p>
        <p>
          1. THE HEBREW WORD yada' AND THE GREEK WORDSginoskein, proginoskein,
          AND prognosis. The word yada' may simply mean "to know" or "to take
          cognizance" of someone or something, but may also be used in the more
          pregnant sense of "taking knowledge of one with loving care," or
          "making one the object of loving care or elective love." In this sense
          it serves the idea of election, Gen_18:19; Amo_3:2; Hos_13:5. The
          meaning of the words proginoskein and prognosis in the New Testament
          is not determined by their usage in the classics, but by the special
          meaning of yada'. They do not denote simple intellectual foresight or
          prescience, the mere taking knowledge of something beforehand, but
          rather a selective knowledge which regards one with favor and makes
          one an object of love, and thus approaches the idea of foreordination,
          Act_2:23 (comp. Act_4:28); Rom_8:29; Rom_11:2; 1Pe_1:2. These passages
          simply lose their meaning, if the words be taken in the sense of
          simply taking knowledge of one in advance, for God foreknows all men
          in that sense. Even Arminians feel constrained to give the words a
          more determinative meaning, namely, to foreknow one with absolute
          assurance in a certain state or condition. This includes the absolute
          certainty of that future state, and for that very reason comes very
          close to the idea of predestination. And not only these words, but
          even the simple ginoskein has such a specific meaning in some cases,
          1Co_8:3; Gal_4:9; 2Ti_2:19. 53
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE HEBREW WORD bachar AND THE GREEK WORDS eklegesthai AND ekloge.
          These words stress the element of choice or selection in the decree of
          God respecting the eternal destiny of sinners, a choice accompanied
          with good pleasure. They serve to indicate the fact that God selects a
          certain number of the human race and places them in a special relation
          to Himself. Sometimes they include the idea of a call to a certain
          privilege, or of the call to salvation; but it is a mistake to think,
          as some do, that this exhausts their meaning. It is perfectly evident
          that they generally refer to a prior and eternal election, Rom_9:11;
          Rom_11:5; Eph_1:4; 2Th_2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE GREEK WORDS proorizein AND proorismos. These words always refer
          to absolute predestination. In distinction from the other words, they
          really require a complement. The question naturally arises,
          Foreordained unto what? The words always refer to the foreordination
          of man to a certain end, and from the Bible it is evident that the end
          may be either good or bad, Act_4:28; Eph_1:5. However, the end to
          which they refer is not necessarily the final end, but is even more
          frequently some end in time, which is in turn a means to the final
          end, Act_4:28; Rom_8:29; 1Co_2:7; Eph_1:5; Eph_1:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE GREEK WORDS protithenai AND prothesis. In these words attention
          is directed to the fact that God sets before Him a definite plan to
          which He steadfastly adheres. They clearly refer to God's purpose of
          predestinating men unto salvation in Rom_8:29; Rom_9:11; Eph_1:9;
          Eph_1:11; 2Ti_1:9.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE AUTHOR AND OBJECTS OF PREDESTINATION</p>
        <p>
          1. THE AUTHOR. The decree of predestination is undoubtedly in all its
          parts the concurrent act of the three persons in the Trinity, who are
          one in their counsel and will. But in the economy of salvation, as it
          is revealed in Scripture, the sovereign act of predestination is more
          particularly attributed to the Father, Joh_17:6; Joh_17:9; Rom_8:29;
          Eph_1:4; 1Pe_1:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE OBJECTS OF PREDESTINATION. In distinction from the decree of
          God in general, predestination has reference to God's rational
          creatures only. Most frequently it refers to fallen men. Yet it is
          also employed in a wider sense, and we use it in the more inclusive
          sense here, in order to embrace all the objects of predestination. It
          includes all God's rational creatures, that is:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. All men, both good and evil. These are included not merely as
          groups, but as individuals, Act_4:28; Rom_8:29-30; Rom_9:11-13;
          Eph_1:5; Eph_1:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The angels, both good and evil. The Bible speaks not only of holy
          angels, Mar_8:38; Luk_9:26, and of wicked angels, which kept not their
          first estate, 2Pe_2:4; Jud_1:6; but also makes explicit mention of
          elect angels, 1Ti_5:21, thereby implying that there were also
          non-elect angels. The question naturally arises, How are we to
          conceive of the predestination of angels? According to some it simply
          means that God determined in general that the angels which remained
          holy would be confirmed in a state of bliss, while the others would be
          lost. But this is not at all in harmony with the Scriptural idea of
          predestination. It rather means that God decreed, for reasons
          sufficient unto Himself, to give some angels, in addition to the grace
          with which they were endowed by creation and which included ample
          power to remain holy, a special grace of perseverance; and to withhold
          this from others. There are points of difference between the
          predestination of men and that of the angels: (1) While the
          predestination of men may be conceived of as infralapsarian, the
          predestination of the angels can only be understood as supralapsarian.
          God did not choose a certain number out of the fallen mass of angels.
          (2) The angels were not elected or predestined in Christ as Mediator,
          but in Him as Head, that is, to stand in a ministerial relation to
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Christ as Mediator. Christ was the object of predestination in the
          sense that (1) a special love of the Father, distinct from His usual
          love to the Son, rested upon Him from all eternity, 1Pe_1:20; 1Pe_2:4;
          (2) in His quality as Mediator he was the object of God's good
          pleasure, 1Pe_2:4; (3) as Mediator He was adorned with the special
          image of God, to which believers were to be conformed, Rom_8:29; and
          (4) the Kingdom with all its glory and the means leading to its
          possession were ordained for Him, that He might pass these on to
          believers, Luk_22:29.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE PARTS OF PREDESTINATION</p>
        <p>
          Predestination includes two parts, namely, election and reprobation,
          the predetermination of both the good and the wicked to their final
          end, and to certain proximate ends which are instrumental in the
          realization of their final destiny.
        </p>
        <p>1. ELECTION.</p>
        <p>
          a.The Biblical Idea of Election. The Bible speaks of election in more
          than one sense. There is (1) the election of Israel as a people for
          special privileges and for special service, Deu_4:37; Deu_7:6-8;
          Deu_10:15; Hos_13:5. (2) The election of individuals to some office,
          or to the performance of some special service, as Moses, Exo_3:1-22,
          the priests, Deu_18:5; the kings, 1Sa_10:24; Psa_78:70, the prophets,
          Jer_1:5, and the apostles, Joh_6:70; Act_9:15. (3) The election of
          individuals to be children of God and heirs of eternal glory,
          Mat_22:14; Rom_11:5; 1Co_1:27-28; Eph_1:4; 1Th_1:4; 1Pe_1:2; 2Pe_1:10.
          The last is the election that comes into consideration here as a part
          of predestination. It may be defined as that eternal act of God
          whereby He, in His sovereign good pleasure, and on account of no
          foreseen merit in them, chooses a certain number of men to be the
          recipients of special grace and of eternal salvation. More briefly it
          may be said to be God's eternal purpose to save some of the human race
          in and by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The characteristics of election. The characteristics of election
          are identical with the characteristics of the decrees in general. The
          decree of election: (1) Is an expression of the sovereign will of God,
          His divine good pleasure. This means among other things that Christ as
          Mediator is not the impelling, moving, or meritorious cause of
          election, as some have asserted. He may be called the mediate cause of
          the realization of election, and the meritorious cause of the
          salvation unto which believers are elected, but He is not the moving
          or meritorious cause of election itself. This is impossible, since He
          is Himself an object of predestination and election, and because, when
          He took His mediatorial work upon Him in the Counsel of Redemption,
          there was already a fixed number that was given unto Him. Election
          logically precedes the Counsel of Peace. The elective love of God
          precedes the sending of the Son, Joh_3:16; Rom_5:8; 2Ti_1:9; 1Jn_4:9.
          By saying that the decree of election originates in the divine good
          pleasure the idea is also excluded that it is determined by anything
          in man, such as foreseen faith or good works, Rom_9:11; 2Ti_1:9. (2)
          It is immutable, and therefore renders the salvation of the elect
          certain. God realizes the decree of election by His own efficiency, by
          the saving work which He accomplishes in Jesus Christ. It is His
          purpose that certain individuals should believe and persevere unto the
          end, and He secures this result by the objective work of Christ and
          the subjective operations of the Holy Spirit, Rom_8:29-30; Rom_11:29;
          2Ti_2:19. It is the firm foundation of God which standeth, "having
          this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His." And as such it is the
          source of rich comfort for all believers. Their final salvation does
          not depend on their uncertain obedience, but has its guarantee in the
          unchangeable purpose of God. (3) It is eternal, that is, from
          eternity. This divine election should never be identified with any
          temporal selection, whether it be for the enjoyment of the special
          grace of God in this life, for special privileges and responsible
          services, or for the inheritance of glory hereafter, but must be
          regarded as eternal, Rom_8:29-30; Eph_1:4-5. (4) It is unconditional.
          Election does not in any way depend on the foreseen faith or good
          works of man, as the Arminians teach, but exclusively on the sovereign
          good pleasure of God, who is also the originator of faith and good
          works, Rom_9:11; Act_13:48; 2Ti_1:9; 1Pe_1:2. Since all men are
          sinners and have forfeited the blessings of God, there is no basis for
          such a distinction in them; and since even the faith and good works of
          the believers are the fruit of the grace of God, Eph_2:8; Eph_2:10;
          2Ti_2:21, even these, as foreseen by God, could not furnish such a
          basis. (5) It is irresistible. This does not mean that man cannot
          oppose its execution to a certain degree, but it does mean that his
          opposition will not prevail. Neither does it mean that God in the
          execution of His decree overpowers the human will in a manner which is
          inconsistent with man's free agency. It does mean, however, that God
          can and does exert such an influence on the human spirit as to make it
          willing, Psa_110:3; Php_2:13. (6) It is not chargeable with injustice.
          The fact that God favors some and passes by others, does not warrant
          the charge that He is guilty of injustice. We can speak of injustice
          only when one party has a claim on another. If God owed the
          forgiveness of sin and eternal life to all men, it would be an
          injustice if He saved only a limited number of them. But the sinner
          has absolutely no right or claim on the blessings which flow from
          divine election. As a matter of fact he has forfeited these blessings.
          Not only have we no right to call God to account for electing some and
          passing others by, but we must admit that He would have been perfectly
          just, if He had not saved any, Mat_20:14-15; Rom_9:14-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The purpose of election. The purpose of this eternal election is
          twofold: (1) The proximate purpose is the salvation of the elect. That
          man is chosen or elected unto salvation is clearly taught in the Word
          of God, Rom_11:7-11; 2Th_2:13. (2) The final aim is the glory of God.
          Even the salvation of men is subordinate to this. That the glory of
          God is the highest purpose of the electing grace is made very emphatic
          in Eph_1:6; Eph_1:12; Eph_1:14. The social gospel of our day likes to
          stress the fact that man is elected unto service. In so far as this is
          intended as a denial of man's election unto salvation and unto the
          glory of God, it plainly goes contrary to Scripture. Taken by itself,
          however, the idea that the elect are predestined unto service or good
          works is entirely Scriptural, Eph_2:10; 2Ti_2:21; but this end is
          subservient to the ends already indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. REPROBATION. Our confessional standards speak not only of election,
          but also of reprobation.54 Augustine taught the doctrine of
          reprobation as well as that of election, but this "hard doctrine" met
          with a great deal of opposition. Roman Catholics, the great majority
          of Lutherans, Arminians, and Methodists, generally reject this
          doctrine in its absolute form. If they still speak of reprobation, it
          is only of a reprobation based on foreknowledge. That Calvin was
          deeply conscious of the seriousness of this doctrine, is perfectly
          evident from the fact that he speaks of it as a " decretum horribile "
          (dreadful decree).55 Nevertheless, he did not feel free to deny what
          he regarded as an important Scriptural truth. In our day some scholars
          who claim to be Reformed balk at this doctrine. Barth teaches a
          reprobation which is dependent on man's rejection of God's revelation
          in Christ. Brunner seems to have a more Scriptural conception of
          election than Barth, but rejects the doctrine of reprobation entirely.
          He admits that it logically follows from the doctrine of election, but
          cautions against the guidance of human logic in this instance, since
          the doctrine of reprobation is not taught in Scripture.56
        </p>
        <p>
          a.Statement of the doctrine. Reprobation may be defined as that
          eternal decree of God whereby He has determined to pass some men by
          with the operations of His special grace, and to punish them for their
          sins, to the manifestation of His justice. The following points
          deserve special emphasis: (1) It contains two elements. According to
          the most usual representation in Reformed theology the decree of
          reprobation comprises two elements, namely, preterition or the
          determination to pass by some men; and condemnation (sometimes called
          precondemnation ) or the determination to punish those who are passed
          by for their sins. As such it embodies a twofold purpose: (a) to pass
          by some in the bestowal of regenerating and saving grace; and (b) to
          assign them to dishonor and to the wrath of God for their sins. The
          Belgic Confession mentions only the former, but the Canons of Dort
          name the latter as well. Some Reformed theologians would omit the
          second element from the decree of reprobation. Dabney prefers to
          regard the condemnation of the wicked as the foreseen and intended
          result of their preterition, thus depriving reprobation of its
          positive character; and Dick is of the opinion that the decree to
          condemn ought to be regarded as a separate decree, and not as a part
          of the decree of reprobation. It seems to us, however, that we are not
          warranted in excluding the second element from the decree of
          reprobation, nor to regard it as a different decree. The positive side
          of reprobation is so clearly taught in Scripture as the opposite of
          election that we cannot regard it as something purely negative,
          Rom_9:21-22; Jud_1:4. However, we should notice several points of
          distinction between the two elements of the decree of reprobation: (a)
          Preterition is a sovereign act of God, an act of His mere good
          pleasure, in which the demerits of man do not come into consideration,
          while precondemnation is a judicial act, visiting sin with punishment.
          Even Supralapsarians are willing to admit that in condemnation sin is
          taken into consideration. (b) The reason for preterition is not known
          by man. It cannot be sin, for all men are sinners. We can only say
          that God passed some by for good and wise reasons sufficient unto
          Himself. On the other hand the reason for condemnation is known; it is
          sin. (c) Preterition is purely passive, a simple passing by without
          any action on man, but condemnation is efficient and positive. Those
          who are passed by are condemned on account of their sin. (2) We should
          guard against the idea, however, that as election and reprobation both
          determine with absolute certainty the end unto which man is
          predestined and the means by which that end is realized, they also
          imply that in the case of reprobation as well as in that of election
          God will bring to pass by His own direct efficiency whatsoever He has
          decreed. This means that, while it can be said that God is the author
          of the regeneration, calling, faith, justification, and
          sanctification, of the elect, and thus by direct action on them brings
          their election to realization, it cannot be said that He is also the
          responsible author of the fall, the unrighteous condition, and the
          sinful acts of the reprobate by direct action on them, and thus
          effects the realization of their reprobation. God's decree undoubtedly
          rendered the entrance of sin into the world certain, but He did not
          predestinate some unto sin, as He did others unto holiness. And as the
          holy God He cannot be the author of sin. The position which Calvin
          takes on this point in his Institutes is clearly indicated in the
          following deliverances found in Calvin's Articles on Predestination:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Although the will of God is the supreme and first cause of all things
          and God holds the devil and all the impious subject to His will, God
          nevertheless cannot be called the cause of sin, nor the author of
          evil, neither is He open to any blame.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Although the devil and reprobates are God's servants and instruments
          to carry out His secret decisions, nevertheless in an incomprehensible
          manner God so works in them and through them as to contract no stain
          from their vice, because their malice is used in a just and righteous
          way for a good end, although the manner is often hidden from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They act ignorantly and calumniously who say that God is made the
          author of sin, if all things come to pass by His will and ordinance;
          because they make no distinction between the depravity of men and the
          hidden appointments of God."57 (3) It should be noted that that with
          which God decided to pass some men by, is not His common but his
          special, His regenerating, grace, the grace that changes sinners into
          saints. It is a mistake to think that in this life the reprobate are
          entirely destitute of God's favor. God does not limit the distribution
          of His natural gifts by the purpose of election. He does not even
          allow election and reprobation to determine the measure of these
          gifts. The reprobate often enjoy a greater measure of the natural
          blessings of life than the elect. What effectively distinguishes the
          latter from the former is that they are made recipients of the
          regenerating and saving grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.Proof for the doctrine of reprobation. The doctrine of reprobation
          naturally follows from the logic of the situation. The decree of
          election inevitably implies the decree of reprobation. If the all-wise
          God, possessed of infinite knowledge, has eternally purposed to save
          some, then He ipso facto also purposed not to save others. If He has
          chosen or elected some, then He has by that very fact also rejected
          others. Brunner warns against this argument, since the Bible does not
          in a single word teach a divine predestination unto rejection. But it
          seems to us that the Bible does not contradict but justifies the logic
          in question. Since the Bible is primarily a revelation of redemption,
          it naturally does not have as much to say about reprobation as about
          election. But what it says is quite sufficient, cf. Mat_11:25-26;
          Rom_9:13; Rom_9:17-18; Rom_9:21-22; Rom_11:7; Jud_1:4; 1Pe_2:8.
        </p>
        <p>E. SUPRA- AND INFRALAPSARIANISM</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of predestination has not always been presented in
          exactly the same form. Especially since the days of the Reformation
          two different conceptions of it gradually emerged, which were
          designated during the Arminian controversy as Infra- and
          Supralapsarianism. Already existing differences were more sharply
          defined and more strongly accentuated as the results of the
          theological disputes of that day. According to Dr. Dijk the two views
          under consideration were in their original form simply a difference of
          opinion respecting the question, whether the fall of man was also
          included in the divine decree. Was the first sin of man, constituting
          his fall, predestinated, or was this merely the object of divine
          foreknowledge? In their original form Supralapsarianism held the
          former, and Infralapsarianism, the latter. In this sense of the word
          Calvin was clearly a Supralapsarian. The later development of the
          difference between the two began with Beza, the successor of Calvin at
          Geneva. In it the original point in dispute gradually retires into the
          background, and other differences are brought forward, some of which
          turn out to be mere differences of emphasis. Later Infralapsarians,
          such as Rivet, Walaeus, Mastricht, Turretin, Ã  Mark, and de Moor, all
          admit that the fall of man was included in the decree; and of the
          later Supralapsarians, such as Beza, Gomarus, Peter Martyr, Zanchius,
          Ursinus, Perkins, Twisse, Trigland, Voetius, Burmannus, Witsius and
          Comrie, at least some are quite willing to admit that in the decree of
          Reprobation God in some way took sin into consideration. We are
          concerned at present with Supra- and Infralapsarianism in their more
          developed form.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE EXACT POINT AT ISSUE. It is quite essential to have a correct
          view of the exact point or points at issue between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Negatively, the difference is not found: (1) In divergent views
          respecting the temporal order of the divine decrees. It is admitted on
          all hands that the decree of God is one and in all its parts equally
          eternal, so that it is impossible to ascribe any temporal succession
          to the various elements which it includes. (2) In any essential
          difference as to whether the fall of man was decreed or was merely the
          object of divine foreknowledge. This may have been, as Dr. Dijk says,
          the original point of difference; but, surely, anyone who asserts that
          the fall was not decreed but only foreseen by God, would now be said
          to be moving along Arminian rather than Reformed lines. Both Supra-
          and Infralapsarians admit that the fall is included in the divine
          decree, and that preterition is an act of God's sovereign will. (3) In
          any essential difference as to the question, whether the decree
          relative to sin is permissive. There is some difference of emphasis on
          the qualifying adjective. Supralapsarians (with few exceptions) are
          willing to admit that the decree relative to sin is permissive, but
          hasten to add that it nevertheless makes the entrance of sin into the
          world a certainty. And Infralapsarians (with few exceptions) will
          admit that sin is included in God's decree, but hasten to add that the
          decree, in so far as it pertains to sin, is permissive rather than
          positive. The former occasionally over-emphasize the positive element
          in the decree respecting sin, and thus expose themselves to the charge
          that they make God the author of sin. And the latter sometimes
          over-emphasize the permissive character of the decree, reducing it to
          a bare permission, and thus expose themselves to the charge of
          Arminianism. As a whole, however, Supralapsarians emphatically
          repudiate every interpretation of the decree that would make God the
          author of sin; and Infralapsarians are careful to point out explicitly
          that the permissive decree of God relative to sin makes sin certainly
          future. (4) In any essential difference as to the question, whether
          the decree of reprobation takes account of sin. It is sometimes
          represented as if God destined some men for eternal destruction,
          simply by an act of His sovereign will, without taking account of
          their sin; as if, like a tyrant, He simply decided to destroy a large
          number of His rational creatures, purely for the manifestation of His
          glorious virtues. But Supralapsarians abhor the idea of a tyrannical
          God, and at least some of them explicitly state that, while
          preterition is an act of God's sovereign will, the second element of
          reprobation, namely, condemnation, is an act of justice and certainly
          takes account of sin. This proceeds on the supposition that logically
          preterition precedes the decree to create and to permit the fall,
          while condemnation follows this. The logic of this position may be
          questioned, but it at least shows that the Supralapsarians who assume
          it, teach that God takes account of sin in the decree of reprobation.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Positively, the difference does concern: (1) The extent of
          predestination. Supralapsarians include the decree to create and to
          permit the fall in the decree of predestination, while Infralapsarians
          refer it to the decree of God in general, and exclude it from the
          special decree of predestination. According to the former, man appears
          in the decree of predestination, not as created and fallen, but as
          certain to be created and to fall; while according to the latter, he
          appears in it as already created and fallen. (2) The logical order of
          the decrees. The question is, whether the decrees to create and to
          permit the fall were means to the decree of redemption.
          Supralapsarians proceed on the assumption that in planning the
          rational mind passes from the end to the means in a retrograde
          movement, so that what is first in design is last in accomplishment.
          Thus they determine upon the following order: (a) The decree of God to
          glorify Himself, and particularly to magnify His grace and justice in
          the salvation of some and the perdition of other rational creatures,
          which exist in the divine mind as yet only as possibilities. (b) The
          decree to create those who were thus elected and reprobated. (c) The
          decree to permit them to fall. (d) The decree to justify the elect and
          to condemn the non-elect. On the other hand the Infralapsarians
          suggest a more historical order: (a) The decree to create man in
          holiness and blessedness. (b) The decree to permit man to fall by the
          self-determination of his own will. (c) The decree to save a certain
          number out of this guilty aggregate. (d) The decree to leave the
          remainder in their self-determination in sin, and to subject them to
          the righteous punishment which their sin deserves. (3) The extension
          of the personal element of predestination to the decrees to create and
          to permit the fall. According to Supralapsarians God, even in the
          decree to create and permit the fall, had His eye fixed on His elect
          individually, so that there was not a single moment in the divine
          decree, when they did not stand in a special relation to God as His
          beloved ones. Infralapsarians, on the other hand, hold that this
          personal element did not appear in the decree till after the decree to
          create and to permit the fall. In these decrees themselves the elect
          are simply included in the whole mass of humanity, and do not appear
          as the -special objects of God's love.
        </p>
        <p>2. THE SUPRALAPSARIAN POSITION.</p>
        <p>
          a. Arguments in favor of it: (1) It appeals to all those passages of
          Scripture which emphasize the absolute sovereignty of God, and more
          particularly His sovereignty in relation to sin, such as Psa_115:3;
          Pro_16:4; Isa_10:15; Isa_45:9; Jer_18:6; Mat_11:25-26; Mat_20:15;
          Rom_9:17; Rom_9:19-21. Special emphasis is laid on the figure of the
          potter, which is found in more than one of these passages. It is said
          that this figure not merely stresses the sovereignty of God in
          general, but more especially His sovereignty in determining the
          quality of the vessels at creation. This means that Paul in Rom_9:1-33
          speaks from a pre- creation standpoint, an idea that is favored (a) by
          the fact that the potter's work is frequently used in Scripture as a
          figure of creation; and (b) by the fact that the potter determines
          each vessel for a certain use and gives it a corresponding quality,
          which might cause the vessel to ask, though without any right, Why
          didst Thou make me thus? (2) Attention is called to the fact that some
          passages of Scripture suggest that the work of nature or of creation
          in general was so ordered as to contain already illustrations of the
          work of redemption. Jesus frequently derives His illustrations for the
          elucidation of spiritual things from nature, and we are told in
          Mat_13:35 that this was in fulfilment of the words of the prophet, "I
          will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world." Comp.
          Psa_78:2. This is taken to mean that they were hidden in nature, but
          were brought to light in the parabolic teachings of Jesus. Eph_3:9 is
          also considered as an expression of the idea that the design of God in
          the creation of the world was directed to the manifestation of His
          wisdom, which would issue in the New Testament work of redemption. But
          the appeal to this passage seems, to say the least, very doubtful. (3)
          The order of the decrees, as accepted by the Supralapsarians, is
          regarded as the more ideal, the more logical and unified of the two.
          It clearly exhibits the rational order which exists between the
          ultimate end and the intermediate means. Therefore the Supralapsarians
          can, while the Infralapsarians cannot, give a specific answer to the
          question why God decreed to create the world and to permit the fall.
          They do full justice to the sovereignty of God and refrain from all
          futile attempts to justify God in the sight of men, while the
          Infralapsarians hesitate, attempt to prove the justice of God's
          procedure, and yet in the end must come to the same conclusion as the
          Supralapsarians, namely, that, in the last analysis, the decree to
          permit the fall finds its explanation only in the sovereign good
          pleasure of God.58 (4) The analogy of the predestination of the angels
          would seem to favor the Supralapsarian position, for it can only be
          conceived as supralapsarian. God decreed, for reasons sufficient to
          Himself, to grant some angels the grace of perseverance and to
          withhold this from others; and to connect with this righteously the
          confirmation of the former in a state of glory, and the eternal
          perdition of the latter. This means, therefore, that the decree
          respecting the fall of the angels forms a part of their
          predestination. And it would seem impossible to conceive of it in any
          other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Objections to it: Notwithstanding its seeming pretensions, it does
          not give a solution of the problem of sin. It would do this, if it
          dared to say that God decreed to bring sin into the world by His own
          direct efficiency. Some Supralapsarians, it is true, do represent the
          decree as the efficient cause of sin, but yet do not want this to be
          interpreted in such a way that God becomes the author of sin. The
          majority of them do not care to go beyond the statement that God
          willed to permit sin. Now this is no objection to the Supralapsarian
          in distinction from the Infralapsarian, for neither one of them solves
          the problem. The only difference is that the former makes greater
          pretensions in this respect than the latter. (2) According to its
          representations man appears in the divine decree first as creabilis et
          labilis (certain to be created and to fall). The objects of the decree
          are first of all men considered as mere possibilities, as non-
          existent entities. But such a decree necessarily has only a
          provisional character, and must be followed by another decree. After
          the election and reprobation of these possible men follows the decree
          to create them and to permit them to fall, and this must be followed
          by another decree respecting these men whose creation and fall have
          now been definitely determined, namely, the decree to elect some and
          to reprobate the rest of those who now appear in the divine purpose as
          real men. Supralapsarians claim that this is no insuperable objection
          because, while it is true that on their position the actual existence
          of men has not yet been determined when they are elected and
          reprobated, they do exist in the divine idea. (3) It is said that
          Supralapsarianism makes the eternal punishment of the reprobate an
          object of the divine will in the same sense and in the same manner as
          the eternal salvation of the elect; and that it makes sin, which leads
          to eternal destruction, a means unto this end in the same manner and
          in the same sense as the redemption in Christ is a means unto
          salvation. If consistently carried through, this would make God the
          author of sin. It should be noted, however, that the Supralapsarian
          does not, as a rule, so represent the decree, and explicitly states
          that the decree may not be so interpreted as to make God the author of
          sin. He will speak of a predestination unto the grace of God in Jesus
          Christ, but not of a predestination unto sin. (4) Again, it is
          objected that Supralapsarianism makes the decree of reprobation just
          as absolute as the decree of election. In other words, that it regards
          reprobation as purely an act of God's sovereign good pleasure, and not
          as an act of punitive justice. According to its representation sin
          does not come into consideration in the decree of reprobation. But
          this is hardly correct, though it may be true of some Supralapsarians.
          In general, however, it may be said that, while they regard
          preterition as an act of God's sovereign good pleasure, they usually
          regard precondemnation as an act of divine justice which does take sin
          into consideration. And the Infralapsarian himself cannot maintain the
          idea that reprobation is an act of justice pure and simple, contingent
          on the sin of man. In the last analysis, he, too, must declare that it
          is an act of God's sovereign good pleasure, if he wants to avoid the
          Arminian camp. (5) Finally, it is said that it is not possible to
          construe a serviceable doctrine of the covenant of grace and of the
          Mediator on the basis of the Supralapsarian scheme. Both the covenant
          and the Mediator of the covenant can only be conceived as
          infralapsarian. This is frankly admitted by some Supralapsarians.
          Logically, the Mediator appears in the divine decree only after the
          entrance of sin; and this is the only point of view from which the
          covenant of grace can be construed. This will naturally have an
          important bearing on the ministry of the Word.

        <p>3. THE INFRALAPSARIAN POSITION.</p>
        <p>
          a.Arguments in favor of it. (1) Infralapsarians appeal more
          particularly to those passages of Scripture in which the objects of
          election appear as in a condition of sin, as being in close union with
          Christ, and as objects of God's mercy and grace, such as Mat_11:25-26;
          Joh_15:19; Rom_8:28, Rom_8:30; Rom_9:15-6; Eph_1:4-12; 2Ti_1:9. These
          passages would seem to imply that in the thought of God the fall of
          man preceded the election of some unto salvation. (2) It also calls
          attention to the fact that in its representation the order of the
          divine decrees is less philosophical and more natural than that
          proposed by Supralapsarians. It is in harmony with the historical
          order in the execution of the decrees, which would seem to reflect the
          order in the eternal counsel of God. Just as in the execution, so
          there is in the decree a causal order. It is more modest to abide by
          this order, just because it reflects the historical order revealed in
          Scripture and does not pretend to solve the problem of God's relation
          to sin. It is considered to be less offensive in its presentation of
          the matter and to be far more in harmony with the requirements of
          practical life.59 (3) While Supralapsarians claim that their
          construction of the doctrine of the decrees is the more logical of the
          two, Infralapsarians make the same claim for their position. Says
          Dabney: "The Supralapsarian (scheme) under the pretense of greater
          symmetry, is in reality the more illogical of the two."60 It is
          pointed out that the supralapsarian scheme is illogical in that it
          makes the decree of election and preterition refer to non-entities,
          that is, to men who do not exist, except as bare possibilities, even
          in the mind of God; who do not yet exist in the divine decree and are
          therefore not contemplated as created, but only as creatable. Again,
          it is said that the supralapsarian construction is illogical in that
          it necessarily separates the two elements in reprobation, placing
          preterition before, and condemnation after, the fall. (4) Finally,
          attention is also called to the fact that the Reformed Churches in
          their official standards have always adopted the infralapsarian
          position, even though they have never condemned, but always tolerated,
          the other view. Among the members of the Synod of Dort and of the
          Westminster Assembly there were several Supralapsarians who were held
          in high honour (the presiding officer in both cases belonging to the
          number), but in both the Canons of Dort and the Westminster Confession
          the infralapsarian view finds expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.Objections to it. The following are some of the most important
          objections raised against Infralapsarianism: (1) It does not give, nor
          does it claim to give a solution of the problem of sin. But this is
          equally true of the other view, so that, in a comparison of the two,
          this cannot very well be regarded as a real objection, though it is
          sometimes raised. The problem of the relation of God to sin has proved
          to be insoluble for the one as well as for the other. (2) While
          Infralapsarianism may be actuated by the laudable desire to guard
          against the possibility of charging God with being the author of sin,
          it is, in doing this, always in danger of overshooting the mark, and
          some of its representatives have made this mistake. They are averse to
          the statement that God willed sin, and substitute for it the assertion
          that He permitted it. But then the question arises as to the exact
          meaning of this statement. Does it mean that God merely took
          cognizance of the entrance of sin, without in any way hindering it, so
          that the fall was in reality a frustration of His plan? The moment the
          Infralapsarian answers this question in the affirmative, he enters the
          ranks of the Arminians. While there have been some who took this
          stand, the majority of them feel that they cannot consistently take
          this position, but must incorporate the fall in the divine decree.
          They speak of the decree respecting sin as a permissive decree, but
          with the distinct understanding that this decree rendered the entrance
          of sin into the world certain. And if the question be raised, why God
          decreed to permit sin and thus rendered it certain, they can only
          point to the divine good pleasure, and are thus in perfect agreement
          with the Supralapsarian. (3) The same tendency to shield God reveals
          itself in another way and exposes one to a similar danger.
          Infralapsarianism really wants to explain reprobation as an act of
          God's justice. It is inclined to deny either explicitly or implicitly
          that it is an act of the mere good pleasure of God. This really makes
          the decree of reprobation a conditional decree and leads into the
          Arminian fold. But infralapsarians on the whole do not want to teach a
          conditional decree, and express themselves guardedly on this matter.
          Some of them admit that it is a mistake to consider reprobation purely
          as an act of divine justice. And this is perfectly correct. Sin is not
          the ultimate cause of reprobation any more than faith and good works
          are the cause of election, for all men are by nature dead in sin and
          trespasses. When confronted with the problem of reprobation,
          Infralapsarians, too, can find the answer only in the good pleasure of
          God. Their language may sound more tender than that of the
          Supralapsarians, but is also more apt to be misunderstood, and after
          all proves to convey the same idea. (4) The Infralapsarian position
          does not do justice to the unity of the divine decree, but represents
          the different members of it too much as disconnected parts. First God
          decrees to create the world for the glory of His name, which means
          among other things also that He determined that His rational creatures
          should live according to the divine law implanted in their hearts and
          should praise their Maker. Then He decreed to permit the fall, whereby
          sin enters the world. This seems to be a frustration of the original
          plan, or at least an important modification of it, since God no more
          decrees to glorify Himself by the voluntary obedience of all His
          rational creatures. Finally, there follow the decrees of election and
          reprobation, which mean only a partial execution of the original plan.

        <p>
          4. From what was said it would seem to follow that we cannot regard
          Supra- and Infralapsarianism as absolutely antithetical. They consider
          the same mystery from different points of view, the one fixing its
          attention on the ideal or teleological; the other, on the historical,
          order of the decrees. To a certain extent they can and must go hand in
          hand. Both find support in Scripture. Supralapsarianism in those
          passages which stress the sovereignty of God, and Infralapsarianism in
          those which emphasize the mercy and justice of God, in connection with
          election and reprobation. Each has something in its favor: the former
          that it does not undertake to justify God, but simply rests in the
          sovereign and holy good pleasure of God; and the latter, that it is
          more modest and tender, and reckons with the demands and requirements
          of practical life. Both are necessarily inconsistent; the former
          because it cannot regard sin as a progression, but must consider it as
          a disturbance of creation, and speaks of a permissive decree; and the
          latter, since in the last analysis it must also resort to a permissive
          decree, which makes sin certain. But each one of them also emphasizes
          an element of truth. The true element in Supralapsarianism is found in
          its emphasis on the following: that the decree of God is a unit; that
          God had one final aim in view; that He willed sin in a certain sense;
          and that the work of creation was immediately adapted to the
          recreative activity of God. And the true element in Infralapsarianism
          is, that there is a certain diversity in the decrees of God; that
          creation and fall cannot be regarded merely as means to an end, but
          also had great independent significance; and that sin cannot be
          regarded as an element of progress, but should rather be considered as
          an element of disturbance in the world. In connection with the study
          of this profound subject we feel that our understanding is limited,
          and realize that we grasp only fragments of the truth. Our
          confessional standards embody the infralapsarian position, but do not
          condemn Supralapsarianism. It was felt that this view was not
          necessarily inconsistent with Reformed theology. And the conclusions
          of Utrecht, adopted in 1908 by our Church, state that, while it is not
          permissible to represent the supralapsarian view as the doctrine of
          the Reformed churches in the Netherlands, it is just as little
          permissible to molest any one who cherishes that view for himself.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. Is a foreknowledge of future events which
          is not based on the decree possible in God? What is the inevitable
          result of basing God's decree on His foreknowledge rather than vice
          versa his foreknowledge on His decree? How does the doctrine of the
          decrees differ from fatalism and from determinism? Does the decree of
          predestination necessarily exclude the possibility of a universal
          offer of salvation? Are the decrees of election and reprobation
          equally absolute and unconditional or not? Are they alike in being
          causes from which human actions proceed as effects? How is the
          doctrine of predestination related to the doctrine of the divine
          sovereignty;â€” to the doctrine of total depravity;â€”to the doctrine
          of the atonement;â€”to the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints?
          Do the Reformed teach a predestination unto sin?
