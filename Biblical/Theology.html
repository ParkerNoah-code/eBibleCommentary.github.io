      <h2>What is Theology?</h2>
      <p>
        The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
        displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation, and
        other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from the
        vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range of
        topics like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
      </p>
      <p>
        Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and the
        creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it reveals the
        underlying ground which all other sciences require for their complete
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
        aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> Theology has to do with the good, the
        truth, and the beautiful. It involves the whole of the believer: the
        head, the heart, and the hands (what we think, how we feel, and what we
        do). It's goal is to allow us to know and serve God, to meet the
        spiritual needs of his people and the world, and to promote godliness.
      </p>

          (Downers Grove: Tyndale, 2001). This book is very introductory. It
          could be helpful for quickly referencing or familiarizing oneself with
          theological terms.

            >Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</a
          >
          (Phillipsburg: P&R, 2013). This book is a good introduction with more
          depth and breadth. It lays out theology using straightforward
          interpretations of Scripture and explains technical terms.

          it is very well written and understandable. It interacts significantly
          with modern philosophical thought and culture.

      <h2>Scriptures</h2>
      <p>
        "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for
        reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that each
        person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every
        good work" (2 Tim 3:16-17).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s
        press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from
        dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying
        on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. This
        will we do, if God permits" (Heb 6:1-3).
      </p>
      <p>
        "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are
        revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all
        the words of this law" (Deut 29:29).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason
        concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, having a
        good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they
        may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ" (1 Pet
        3:15-16).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord
        that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of
        those who hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a
        workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of
        Truth. But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
        and those words will consume like gangrene" (2 Tim 2:14-17).
      </p>

      <h2>Methodological Points</h2>
      <p>
        Theology must be centered on the Bible and its application. Adequate
        theological arguments must show their biblical basis to be persuasive
        and authoritative within the Christian community. Without this
        connection, theological ideas risk becoming disconnected from the
        foundational truths of the Christian faith. Biblical application
        involves discerning how biblical truths speak to contemporary issues,
        guide moral decisions, and shape Christian living.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Bible is the primary source for Christian theology,
        understanding it fully often requires insights from various other fields
        of knowledge. For example, knowledge of the biblical languages (Hebrew,
        Aramaic, and Greek) is significant for accurate interpretation of the
        biblical texts. Similarly, understanding the cultural and historical
        context of the Bible enhances our ability to grasp its meaning. Creeds
        and confessions are distilled reflections of centuries of theological
        thought and debate. Fields such as psychology, sociology, politics, and
        the natural sciences provide insights into the human condition and the
        world that can inform how theology is applied today
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent times, there has been a tendency in theological scholarship to
        prioritize historical and philosophical analysis over direct engagement
        with Scripture. This shift has led to a form of theology that is more
        concerned with understanding past theological thought or engaging with
        contemporary philosophical ideas than with directly applying biblical
        truths to life. Theologians should ensure that they remain rooted and
        grounded in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current system for training theologians, particularly in liberal
        universities, emphasizes autonomous reasoning over the application of
        Scripture, leading to a disconnect between academic theology and the
        needs of the church. Evangelical theologians who are trained in such
        environments may struggle to reconcile their academic training with the
        expectations of the church. This tension can contribute to doctrinal
        drift within evangelical institutions, as the pressures to conform to
        secular academic norms may overshadow the commitment to biblical
        fidelity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evangelical institutions should develop new methods for training
        theologians which prioritize deep engagement with the Bible. This would
        involve a shift away from the current focus on auxiliary disciplines and
        toward a more Scripture-centered approach. To achieve this, evangelical
        institutions may need to distance themselves from the secular academic
        establishment, including potentially rejecting the standards and
        accreditation systems that require conformity to secular academic norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, while academic rigor is important in theology, it is not
        sufficient on its own. The task of applying Scripture requires more than
        intellectual ability; it demands a personal relationship with Jesus
        Christ, characterized by love, devotion, and a desire to follow Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        A theologian must also possess a prayerful spirit, meaning they should
        approach their work with humility and dependence on God, seeking His
        guidance in understanding and applying His Word. Additionally, they must
        be attuned to the needs of the people they serve, understanding the
        real-life issues and struggles that believers face.
      </p>
      <p>
        This holistic approach to theology recognizes that true wisdom comes
        from both the mind and the heart and leads to action. The best
        theological work is done by those who not only understand the Bible
        intellectually but who also live out its teachings in their own lives
        and seek to help others do the same. This ensures that theology remains
        relevant and practical, serving the church and its mission in the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Endnotes</h2>
      <p>
        1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology
        is based on the work of John Frame in
        <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
        (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to
        discourage the notion that theology is 'properly' something theoretical,
        something academic, as opposed to the practical teaching that goes on in
        preaching, counselling, and Christian friendship,”
        <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
        1987), pp. 81-85.
