      <h2>What is Theology?</h2>
      <p>
        The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
        displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation, and
        other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from the
        vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range of
        topics like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
      </p>
      <p>
        Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and the
        creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it reveals the
        underlying ground which all other sciences require for their complete
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
        aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> Theology has to do with the good, the
        truth, and the beautiful. It involves the whole of the believer: the
        head, the heart, and the hands (what we think, how we feel, and what we
        do). It's goal is to allow us to know and serve God, to meet the
        spiritual needs of his people and the world, and to promote godliness.

      <h2>Scriptures</h2>
      <p>
        "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for
        reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that each
        person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every
        good work" (2 Tim 3:16-17).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s
        press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from
        dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying
        on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. This
        will we do, if God permits" (Heb 6:1-3).
      </p>
      <p>
        "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are
        revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all
        the words of this law" (Deut 29:29).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason
        concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, having a
        good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they
        may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ" (1 Pet
        3:15-16).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord
        that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of
        those who hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a
        workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of
        Truth. But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
        and those words will consume like gangrene" (2 Tim 2:14-17).
      </p>

        1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology
        is based on the work of John Frame in
        <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
        (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to
        discourage the notion that theology is 'properly' something theoretical,
        something academic, as opposed to the practical teaching that goes on in
        preaching, counselling, and Christian friendship,”
        <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
        1987), pp. 81-85.
