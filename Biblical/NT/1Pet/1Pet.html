  <h2>Location of Writing</h2>
  <p>
    As to the place from which he wrote, all do not agree. There is, however, no
    reason that I see why we should doubt that he was then at Babylon, as he
    expressly declares. But as the persuasion had prevailed, that he had moved
    from Antioch to Rome, and that he died at Rome, the ancients, led by this
    sole argument, imagined that Rome is here allegorically called Babylon. But
    as without any probable conjecture they rashly believed what they have said
    of the Roman episcopate of Peter, so also this allegorical figment ought to
    be regarded as nothing. It is indeed much more probable that Peter,
    according to the character of his apostleship, traveled over those parts in
    which most of the Jews resided; and we know that a great number of them were
    in Babylon and in the surrounding countries.

  <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
  <p>
    The design of Peter in this Epistle is to exhort the faithful to a denial of
    the world and a contempt of it, so that being freed from carnal affections
    and all earthly hindrances, they might with their whole soul aspire after
    the celestial kingdom of Christ, that being elevated by hope, supported by
    patience, and fortified by courage and perseverance, they might overcome all
    kinds of temptations, and pursue this course and practice throughout life.
