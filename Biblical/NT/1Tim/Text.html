      <p>
        1.1-2. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of
        God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope, to Timothy, my true
        child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ
        Jesus our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.3-7. As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus
        that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
        and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause
        disputes rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith. But the goal
        of this command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and
        sincere faith, from which things some, having missed the mark, have
        turned away to vain talking, desiring to be teachers of the law, though
        they understand neither what they say nor about what they strongly
        affirm.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.8-11. But we know that the law is good if a person uses it lawfully,
        as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for
        the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the
        unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,
        for manslayers, for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for
        slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing
        contrary to the sound doctrine, according to the Good News of the glory
        of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.12-17. I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he
        counted me faithful, appointing me to service, although I used to be a
        blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy
        because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. The grace of our Lord abounded
        exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. The saying is
        faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the
        world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. However, for this cause I
        obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his
        patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for
        eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who
        alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.18-20. I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according
        to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may
        wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, which some
        having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith, of whom are
        Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they might be
        taught not to blaspheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.1-7. I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
        intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men, for kings and
        all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life
        in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the
        sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and come to
        full knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator
        between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom
        for all, the testimony at the proper time, to which I was appointed a
        preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a
        teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.8-15. I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up
        holy hands without anger and doubting. In the same way, that women also
        adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not
        with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing, but with good
        works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness. Let a woman
        learn in quietness with full submission. But I don’t permit a woman to
        teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness. For
        Adam was formed first, then Eve. Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman,
        being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; but she will be saved
        through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness
        with sobriety.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1-7. This is a faithful saying: someone who seeks to be an overseer
        desires a good work. The overseer therefore must be without reproach,
        the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good
        at teaching; not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but
        gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; one who rules his own house well,
        having children in subjection with all reverence; (for how could someone
        who doesn’t know how to rule his own house take care of God’s assembly?)
        not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same
        condemnation as the devil. Moreover he must have good testimony from
        those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of
        the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.8-13. Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued,
        not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money, holding the mystery of
        the faith in a pure conscience. Let them also first be tested; then let
        them serve if they are blameless. Their wives in the same way must be
        reverent, not slanderers, temperate, and faithful in all things. Let
        servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own
        houses well. For those who have served well gain for themselves a good
        standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.14-16. These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly, but
        if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in
        God’s house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and
        ground of the truth. Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is
        great:
      </p>
      <p>
        God was revealed in the flesh,
        <br />
        justified in the spirit,
        <br />
        seen by angels,
        <br />
        preached among the nations,
        <br />
        believed on in the world,
        <br />
        and received up in glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.1-5. But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall
        away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines
        of demons, through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their
        own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding marriage and commanding to
        abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by
        those who believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good,
        and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. For
        it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.6-11. If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good
        servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith and of the
        good doctrine which you have followed. But refuse profane and old wives’
        fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness. For bodily exercise has some
        value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the
        life which is now and of that which is to come. This saying is faithful
        and worthy of all acceptance. For to this end we both labor and suffer
        reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the
        Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. Command and teach
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.12-16. Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who
        believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and
        in purity. Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and
        to teaching. Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to
        you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Be
        diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your
        progress may be revealed to all. Pay attention to yourself and to your
        teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both
        yourself and those who hear you.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.1-8. Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the
        younger men as brothers; the elder women as mothers; the younger as
        sisters, in all purity. Honor widows who are widows indeed. But if any
        widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety
        toward their own family and to repay their parents, for this is
        acceptable in the sight of God. Now she who is a widow indeed and
        desolate, has her hope set on God and continues in petitions and prayers
        night and day. But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she
        lives. Also command these things, that they may be without reproach. But
        if anyone doesn’t provide for his own, and especially his own household,
        he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.9-10. Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having
        been the wife of one man, being approved by good works, if she has
        brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has
        washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she
        has diligently followed every good work.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.11-16. But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton
        against Christ, they desire to marry, having condemnation, because they
        have rejected their first pledge. Besides, they also learn to be idle,
        going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and
        busybodies, saying things which they ought not. I desire therefore that
        the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no
        occasion to the adversary for insulting. For already some have turned
        away after Satan. If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them
        relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened, that it might
        relieve those who are widows indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.17-18. Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
        especially those who labor in the word and in teaching. For the
        Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the
        grain.” And, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”
      </p>
      <p>
        5.19-22. Don’t receive an accusation against an elder except at the word
        of two or three witnesses. Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all,
        that the rest also may be in fear. I command you in the sight of God,
        and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that you observe these
        things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality. Lay hands hastily
        on no one. Don’t be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep yourself
        pure.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.23. Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for
        your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.24-25. Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and
        some also follow later. In the same way also there are good works that
        are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.1-2. Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own
        masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not
        be blasphemed. Those who have believing masters, let them not despise
        them because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because
        those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and
        exhort these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3-5. If anyone teaches a different doctrine and doesn’t consent to
        sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine
        which is according to godliness, he is conceited, knowing nothing, but
        obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come
        envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions, constant friction of people of
        corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is
        a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.6-10. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought
        nothing into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out. But
        having food and clothing, we will be content with that. But those who
        are determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many
        foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.
        For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led
        astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves
        through with many sorrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.11-16. But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after
        righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
        Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which
        you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of
        many witnesses. I command you before God who gives life to all things,
        and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate testified the good
        confession, that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless until
        the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which at the right time he will
        show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of
        lords. He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom
        no man has seen nor can see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.17-19. Charge those who are rich in this present age that they not be
        arrogant, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on
        the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy; that
        they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to
        distribute, willing to share; laying up in store for themselves a good
        foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.20-21. Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away
        from the empty chatter and oppositions of what is falsely called
        knowledge, which some profess, and thus have wandered from the faith.
      </p>
      <p>Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
