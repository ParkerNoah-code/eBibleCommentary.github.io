      <h1>2 Corinthians</h1>
      <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
      <p>
        The ancient Church was unanimous in accepting the Epistle as a part of
        the Word of God. Of the apostolic fathers Polycarp plainly quotes it.
        Marcion included it in his canon, and it is also named in the Muratorian
        Fragment. The Syriac and old Latin Versions contain it, and the three
        great witnesses of the end of the second century quote it by name.
      </p>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        This Epistle too has permanent value for the Church of God. It is
        inseparably connected with I Corinthians, and as such also brings out
        that it is not the wisdom of the world but the foolishness of the cross
        that saves; and sheds further light on the application of Christian
        principles to social relations. More than any other Epistle it reveals
        to us the apostles personality, and is therefore a great psychological
        aid in the interpretation of his writings. It also has considerable
        doctrinal interest in that it exhibits a part of the apostles
        eschatology, 4:16—5:8; brings out the contrast between the letter and
        the spirit, 3:6-18; describes the beneficent influence of the glory of
        Christ, 3:18—A:6; and contains an explicit statement of the
        reconciliation and renovation wrought by Christ, 5:17-21.
