    <h2>H. Faith: Passed Down (11:17-22)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 17.
      <em

    <p>
      1. God alone knows how to ascribe work and duty proportionate unto the
      strength of grace received.
    </p>
    <p>2. Ofttimes God reserves great trials for a well-exercised faith.</p>
    <p>
      3. Faith must be tried, and of all graces it is most suited unto trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. God proportions trials for the most part unto the strength of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Great trials in believers are an evidence of great faith in them,
      though not understood either by themselves or others before such trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Trials are the only touchstone of faith, without which men must want
      the best evidence of its sincerity and efficacy, and the best way of
      testifying it unto others.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. We ought not to be afraid of trials, because of the admirable
      advantages of faith in and by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Let them be jealous over themselves who have had no especial instances
      of the trial of their faith.
    </p>
    <p>9. True faith being tried will in the issue be victorious.</p>
    <p>
      10. Where there is a divine command, evidencing itself to our consciences
      so to be, it is the wisdom and duty of faith to close its eyes against
      whatsoever seems insuperable in difficulties or inextricable in
      consequents.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Divine revelations did give such an evidence of their being
      immediately from God to those who received them, that though in all things
      they contradicted their reason and interest, yet they received them
      without any hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The great glory and commendation of the faith of Abraham consisted in
      this, that without all dispute, hesitation, or rational consideration of
      objections to the contrary, by a pure act of his will he complied with the
      authority of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. It is a privilege and advantage to have an offering of price to offer
      to God if he call for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Obedience begun in faith, without any reserves, but with a sincere
      intention to fulfill the whole work of it, is accepted with God as if it
      were absolutely complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The power of faith in its conflict with and conquest over natural
      affections, when their unavoidable bent and inclinations are contrary to
      the will of God, whereby they are exposed to receive impressions from
      temptations, is an eminent part of its glory, and a blessed evidence of
      its sincerity.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 18.
      <em
        >to whom it was said, “Your offspring will be accounted as from
        Isaac,”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. In great and inextricable difficulties, it is the duty, wisdom, and
      nature of faith, to fix itself on the immense properties of the divine
      nature, whereby it can effect things inconceivable and incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. God may justly require the assent and confidence of faith unto all
      things which infinite power and wisdom can effect, though we can neither
      see, nor understand, nor comprehend the way whereby it may be
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. God’s dealings with his church sometimes are such as that, unless we
      shut our eyes and stop our ears unto all objections and temptations
      against his promises, opening them only unto divine sovereignty, wisdom,
      and veracity, we can never abide in a comfortable course of obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. This is the glory of faith, that it can spiritually compose the soul in
      the midst of all storms and temptations, under darkness as unto events.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In any surprisal with seemingly insuperable difficulties, it is our
      duty immediately to set faith at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There may sometimes, through God’s providential disposal of all things,
      be an appearance of such an opposition and inconsistency between his
      commands and promises as nothing but faith bowing the soul unto divine
      sovereignty can reconcile.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 19.
      <em
        >concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead.
        Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is good for us to have our faith firmly built on the fundamental
      articles of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. We ought to remember the privileges and advantages that Abraham
      obtained on the trial, exercise, and victory of his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Faith obtaining the victory in great trials (as suffering for the
      truth), and carrying us through difficult duties of obedience, shall have
      a reward even in this life in many unspeakable spiritual privileges and
      advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The example of Abraham was peculiarly cogent unto the Hebrews, who
      gloried in being the children of Abraham, from whom they derived all their
      privileges and advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. If we are children of Abraham, we have no reason to expect an exemption
      from the greatest trials.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 20.
      <em
        >By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to
        come.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The failure, error, or mistake, of any one leading person, with respect
      unto divine promises and their accomplishment, may be of dangerous
      consequence unto others.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 21.
      <em
        >By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph,
        and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is an eminent mercy when faith not only holds out to the end, but
      waxeth strong towards the last conflict with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is so also to be able by faith, in the close of our pilgrimage, to
      recapitulate all the passages of our lives in mercies, trials,
      afflictions, so as to give glory to God with respect to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That which enlivens and encourageth faith as to all other things is a
      peculiar respect to the Angel, the Redeemer, by whom all grace and mercy
      is communicated to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It is our duty so to live in the constant exercise of faith, as that we
      may be ready and strong in it when we are dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Though we should die daily, yet there is a peculiar dying season, when
      death is in its near approach, which requires peculiar actings of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. In all acts of divine worship, whether solemn or occasional, it is our
      duty to dispose our bodies into such a posture of reverence as may
      represent the inward frame of our minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There is an allowance for the infirmities of age and sickness in our
      outward deportment in divine worship, so as that there be no indulgence to
      sloth or custom, but that an evidence of a due reverence of God and holy
      things be preserved.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 22.
      <em
        >By faith Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure
        of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his
        bones.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. It is of great use unto the edification of the church, that such
      believers as have been eminent in profession should at their dying testify
      their faith in the promises of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Joseph, after his trial of all that this world could afford, when he
      was dying, chose the promise for his lot and portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No interposition of difficulties ought to weaken our faith as unto the
      accomplishment of the promises of God.
