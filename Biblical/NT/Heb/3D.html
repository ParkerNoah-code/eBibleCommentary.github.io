    <h2>D. A More Excellent Ministry (8:1-6)</h2>
    <h2>
      Ver 1.
      <em
        >Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this: we have
        such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the
        Majesty in the heavens,</em

    <p>
      1. When the nature and weight of the matter treated of, or the variety of
      arguments wherein it is concerned, do require that our discourse of it
      should be drawn forth to a length more than ordinary, it is useful to
      refresh the minds and relieve the memories of our hearers by a brief
      recapitulation of the things insisted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When doctrines are important, and such as the eternal welfare of the
      souls of men are immediately concerned in, we are by all means to endeavor
      an impression of them on the minds of our hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The principal glory of the priestly office of Christ depends on the
      glorious exaltation of his person.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 2.
      <em>
        a servant of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord
        pitched, not man.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The Lord Christ, in the height of his glory, condescends to discharge
      the office of a public minister in the behalf of the church.
    </p>
    <p>2. All spiritually sacred and holy things are laid up in Christ.</p>
    <p>
      3. He hath the ministrations of all these holy things committed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The human nature of Christ is the only true tabernacle wherein God
      would dwell personally and substantially.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The church hath lost nothing by the removal of the old tabernacle and
      temple, all being supplied by the sanctuary, true tabernacle, and minister
      thereof.
    </p>
    <p>6. We are to look for the gracious presence of God in Christ only.</p>
    <p>
      7. It is by Christ alone that we can make our approach unto God in his
      worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It was an institution of God, that the people in all their distresses
      should look into, and make their supplications towards, the tabernacle or
      holy temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. If any one else can offer the body of Christ, he also is the minister
      of the true tabernacle.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 3.
      <em
        >For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.
        Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to
        offer.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God’s ordination or appointment gives rules, measures, and ends, unto
      all sacred offices and employments.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. There is no approach unto God without continual respect unto sacrifice
      and atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There was no salvation to be had for us, no, not by Jesus Christ
      himself, without his sacrifice and oblation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. As God designed unto the Lord Christ the work which he had to do, so he
      provided for him, and furnished him with whatever was necessary thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Christ being to save the church in the way of office, he was
      not to be spared in any thing necessary thereunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Whatever state or condition we are called unto, what is necessary unto
      that state is indispensably required of us.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 4.
      <em
        >For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there
        are priests who offer the gifts according to the law,</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>1. God’s institution, rightly stated, do never interfere.</p>
    <p>
      2. The discharge of all the parts and duties of the priestly office of
      Christ, in their proper order, was needful unto the salvation of the
      church.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was
        warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said,
        “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown
        to you on the mountain.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God alone limits the signification and use of all his own institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It is an honor to be employed in any sacred service that belongs unto
      the worship of God, though it be of an inferior nature unto other parts of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. So great was the glory of the heavenly ministration in the mediation of
      Jesus Christ, that God would not at once bring it forth in the church,
      until he had prepared the minds of men, by types, shadows, examples, and
      representations of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Our utmost care and diligence in the consideration of the mind of God
      is required in all that we do about his worship.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6.
      <em
        >But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is
        also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has
        been given as law.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. God, in his infinite wisdom, give proper times and seasons to all his
      dispensations to and towards the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The whole office of Christ was designed to the accomplishment of the
      will and dispensation of the grace of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The condescension of the Son of God to undertake the office of the
      ministry on our behalf is unspeakable, and for ever to be admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Lord Christ, by undertaking this office of the ministry, hath
      consecrated and made honorable that office unto all that are rightly
      called unto it, and do rightly discharge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The exaltation of the human nature of Christ unto the office of this
      glorious ministry depended solely on the sovereign wisdom, grace, and love
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It is our duty and our safety to acquiesce universally and absolutely
      in the ministry of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The provision of a mediator between God and man was an effect of
      infinite wisdom and grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. There is infinite grace in every divine covenant, inasmuch as it is
      established on promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The promises of the covenant of grace are better than those of any
      other covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Although one state of the church hath had great advantages and
      privileges above another, yet no state had whereof to complain, while they
      observed the terms prescribed unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The state of the gospel, or of the church under the new testament, is
      accompanied with the highest spiritual privileges and advantages that it
      is capable of in this world.
