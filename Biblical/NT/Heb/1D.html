      This is the great privilege of the church of the gospel, that, in the
      things of the worship of God, it is made subject unto and immediately
      depends upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and not any other, angels or men.
    </p>
    <p>1. That the Lord Christ is our head.</p>
    <p>2. That he is our only head.</p>

      Ver 6-9.

        >But one has somewhere testified, saying, “What is man, that you think

        put all things in subjection under his feet.” For in that he subjected
        all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now
        we don’t yet see all things subjected to him. But we see him who has
        been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the
        suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of
        God he should taste of death for everyone.</em

      The consideration of the infinitely glorious excellencies of the nature of
      God, manifesting themselves in his works, doth greatly set out his
      condescension and grace in his regard and respect to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The respect, care, love, and grace of God unto mankind, expressed in
      the person and mediation of Jesus Christ, is a matter of singular and
      eternal admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That such was the inconceivable love of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
      unto the souls of men, that he was free and willing to condescend unto any
      condition for their good and salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The blessed issue of the abasement of Jesus Christ, in his exaltation
      unto glory and honor, is an assured pledge of the final glory and
      blessedness of all that believe in him, whatever difficulties and dangers
      they may be exercised withal in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Jesus Christ, as the mediator of the new covenant, hath absolute and
      supreme authority given unto him over all the works of God in heaven and
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only Lord of the gospel state of the
      church, called under the old testament “The world to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Lord Jesus Christ in his death did undergo the penal sentence of
      the law, in the room and stead of them for whom he died.

    <h2>D. Everything in Subjection to Him (2:5-9)</h2>
    <p>
      John Owen: In the midst of his reasonings and testimonies for the
      explanation or confirmation of what he delivers dogmatically, he lays hold
      on some occasion or other to press his exhortations unto faith, obedience,
      with constancy and perseverance in the profession of the gospel. And in
      the arguments which he interweaveth, and testimonies which he produceth
      for the enforcement of his exhortations, something still offers itself,
      which accordingly he lays hold upon, leading him to some further
      explication of the doctrine which he had in hand; so insensibly passing
      from one thing unto another, that he might at the same time inform the
      minds and work upon the affections of them with whom he dealt. All which
      will appear in our ensuing exposition of these verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. W. Pink: The scope, the order of thought, and the logical bearings of
      our present passage are not so easily discerned as those we have already
      gone over. That it, the first part at least, picks up the thread dropped
      in Hebrews 1:14 and continues to exhibit the superiority of Christ over
      angels, is clear from verse 5; but when we reach verse 9 we read of Jesus
      being "made a little lower than the angels." At first glance this seems to
      present a real difficulty, but, as is generally the case with such
      passages, in reality verse 9, taken as a whole, supplies the key to our
      present portion.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 5.
      <em
        >For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to
        angels.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Calvin: I indeed allow that man was at first put in possession of the
      world, that he might rule over all the works of God; but by his own
      defection he deserved the loss of his dominion, for it was a just
      punishment for ingratitude as to one thus favored, that the Lord, whom he
      refused to acknowledge and faithfully to worship, should have deprived him
      of a right previously granted to him. As soon, then, as Adam alienated
      himself from God through sin, he was justly deprived of the good things
      which he had received; not that he was denied the use of them, but that he
      would have had no right to them after he had forsaken God...
    </p>
    <p>
      We found at the beginning of this epistle that Christ has been appointed
      by the Father the heir of all things. Doubtless, as he ascribes the whole
      inheritance to one, he excludes all others as aliens, and justly too, for
      we are all become exiles from God's kingdom... But Christ, by whom we are
      admitted into this family, at the same time admits us into a participation
      of this right, so that we may enjoy the whole world, together with the
      favor of God. Hence Paul teaches us that Abraham was by faith made an heir
      of the world, that is, because he was united to the body of Christ (Rom
      4:13). If men, then, are precluded from all God's bounty until they
      receive a right to it through Christ, it follows that the dominion
      mentioned in the Psalm was lost to us in Adam, and that on this account it
      must again be restored as a donation. Now, the restoration begins with
      Christ as the head. There is, then, no doubt but that we are to look to
      him whenever the dominion of man over all creatures is spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the reference is made when the Apostle mentions the world to come,
      or the future world, for he understands by it the renovated world. To make
      the thing clearer, let us suppose two worlds, -- the first the old,
      corrupted by Adam's sin; the other, later in time, as renewed by Christ.
      The state of the first creation has become wholly decayed, and with man
      has fallen as far as man himself is concerned. Until, then, a new
      restitution be made by Christ, this Psalm will not be fulfilled. It hence
      now appears that here the world to come is not that which we hope for
      after the resurrection, but that which began at the beginning of Christ's
      kingdom; but it will no doubt have its full accomplishment in our final
      redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. W. Pink: The objection may be framed thus: How could supremacy be
      predicated of One who became Man, and died? As we have shown in a previous
      article, the Jews actually regarded the angels with a higher veneration
      than the greatest of the "fathers"—Abraham, Moses, Joshua, and David. And
      rightly so; their own Scriptures declared that they "excel in strength."
      Thus a real difficulty was presented to them, in the fact that He whom the
      apostle affirmed had, by inheritance, obtained "a more excellent name"
      than angels, was known to them as "the Son of man," for man was a creature
      inferior to angels. Moreover, angels do not die, Christ had; how, then,
      could He be their superior?
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 6-8a.
      <em
        >But one has somewhere testified, saying, “What is man, that you think
        of him? Or the son of man, that you care for him? You made him a little
        lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor. You have
        put all things in subjection under his feet.”</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      A. W. Pink: He shows (in verse 9) that so far from the humiliation and
      suffering endured by Christ tarnishing His glory, they were the
      meritorious cause of His exaltation. In support of this a remarkable
      quotation is made from the 8th Psalm to prove that God has placed man, and
      not angels, at the head of the future economy—the "world to come." The
      design of God in that economy is to raise "man" to the highest place of
      all among His creatures, and that design has been secured by Christ's
      becoming Man and dying, and thus obtaining for Himself and His people that
      state of transcendent dignity and honor which the Psalmist prophesied
      should be possessed by man in the Age to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew Poole: Or the Son of man: this is the peculiar title of the Second
      Adam. Adam was a man, but not the son of man, but of God by creation (Lk
      3:38); but the Spirit testifieth this of Christ (Dan 7:13); Lord of the
      sabbath (Luke 6:5); God-man (Jn 3:13; 5:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet; the impartial,
      righteous Jehovah the Father, is the relation in the Trinity, spoken of in
      the relative Thou, throughout these verses. He is God’s King; for his
      personal worth and excellencies, preferred before principalities and
      powers, and every name; before all persons, things, and places, the world
      to come as well as this: all angels, as well as men; all creatures
      wherever, in heaven, earth, sea, or hell; are under his sovereign
      dominion, they all lie at his feet, to dispose of as he pleaseth; they are
      all set in subjection to him by the ordination of his Father: (see Ps
      8:6-8; 1 Cor 15:24-29; Eph 1:20-22; Php 2:9,10; Col 2:10).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 8b.
      <em
        >For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not
        subject to him. But now we don’t yet see all things subjected to
        him.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Gill: for in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing
      that is not put under him; there is no one person or thing that is not
      subject to Christ; the subjection is the most universal, either voluntary
      or involuntary; whether they will or not, they are, and must be subject;
      God has left nothing but what he has put under his power:
    </p>
    <p>
      but now we see not yet all things put under him; this seems to be an
      objection, and even a contradiction to what is before said; which may be
      removed by observing, that though this general subjection is not seen by
      us, it does not follow that it is not; and though it is not as yet
      visible, yet it will be: and besides, the apostle's sense may be, that no
      such general subjection to any mere man has ever been seen and known; as
      not to Solomon, nor Ahasuerus, nor Cyrus, nor Alexander the great, nor
      Julius, nor Augustus Caesar, nor any other; and this he may observe, to
      show the non-application of this passage to any but to Jesus Christ; and
      this sense is confirmed by what follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew Poole: But now we see not yet all things put under him; it is
      evident to our sense and experience, that though he hath obtained this
      sovereign dominion over all on his ascension, yet he hath not exerted his
      power in utterly subjecting and triumphing over his enemies at present,
      nor in reducing all his own people to subjection to him; yet this shall be
      gradually done in every age, and completely when he shall come to be
      glorified in his saints, to punish his enemies with everlasting
      destruction (1 Cor 15:24,26; 2 Thes 1:7-10 Rev 20:11-15).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Ver 9.
      <em
        >But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus,
        because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by
        the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.</em
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Gill: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man;
      that is, Christ was made a little lower than the angels by becoming man,
      and assuming a body frail and mortal, that he might die for his church and
      people: to "taste death", is a Jewish phrase, often to be met with in
      Rabbinical writings... and signifies the truth and reality of his death,
      and the experience he had of the bitterness of it, it being attended with
      the wrath of God, and curse of the law; though he continued under it but
      for a little while, it was but a taste; and it includes all kinds of
      death, he tasted of the death of afflictions, being a man of sorrows all
      his days, and a corporeal death, and what was equivalent to an eternal
      one...
    </p>
    <p>
      what moved God to make him lower than the angels, and deliver him up to
      death, was not any anger towards him, any disregard to him, or because he
      deserved it, but his "grace", free favour, and love to men; this moved him
      to provide him as a ransom; to preordain him to be the Lamb slain; to send
      him in the fulness of time, and give him up to justice and death... Christ
      died, not merely as an example, or barely for the good of men, but as a
      surety, in their room and stead, and that not for every individual of
      mankind; for there are some he knows not; for some he does not pray; and
      there are some who will not be saved...
    </p>
    <p>
      "for the whole"; that is, the whole body, the church for whom Christ gave
      himself, and is the Saviour of; or distributively, and be translated, "for
      everyone"; for everyone of the sons God brings to glory (Heb 2:10), for
      everyone of the "brethren", whom Christ sanctifies, and he is not ashamed
      to own, and to whom he declares the name of God (Heb 2:11), for everyone
      of the members of the "church", in the midst of which he sung praise (Heb
      2:12), for every one of the "children" God has given him, and for whose
      sake he took part of flesh and blood (Heb 2:13), and for everyone of the
      "seed" of Abraham, in a spiritual sense, whose nature he assumed (Heb
      2:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      James Haldane: That he by the grace of God should taste death for every
      man.—Here we are taught the object of the death of Christ. A multitude
      whom no man shall be able to number were chosen in, and given to Christ.
      They came under the curse of the broken law, and by the grace of God He
      laid down His life for them, that He might redeem them from death, might
      ransom them from the power of the grave, and swallow up death in victory.
      Adam was the source or fountain of their natural life, but it was dried
      up, the streams, consequently, all failed; but Jesus said, "Lo, I come to
      do thy will, O God" (Heb 10:9). "By the which will we are sanctified
      through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (Heb
      10:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Having risen from the dead to die no more, He is to all His people the
      fountain of eternal life; because I live, ye shall live also.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tasted death for every one of the "many sons" whom He brings to glory.
      Here the expression imports that Christ died for each of His people; he
      died for them (as Israel is to be gathered) "one by one"... He tasted
      death for every one of the sanctified (v. 11). For every one of his
      brethren (v. 11, 12); for every one of the Church, for which He gave
      Himself (Eph 5:23; Heb 2:12). For every one of the children whom God gave
      unto Him (v. 13). For every one of the seed of Abraham. "And if ye be
      Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise"
      (Gal 3:29). So far from dying for all, Christ will say to many, "I never
      knew you." He prays for the men whom His Father had given Him out of the
      world, while He expressly states He prays not for the world (Jn 17:6-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, the greater part of mankind have never heard of a
      Savior, and are not only living without God, but without hope in the
      world. If Christ died for all, no man is saved by His death. But perhaps
      it is said, that they are saved by faith in His death. Still, faith is the
      gift of God, which, like every other gift, is imparted to sinners through
      the atonement by which God's righteousness in the remission of sins is
      manifested...
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from no defect in the value of Christ's blood, that His
      <em>sacrifice</em> is <em>efficacious</em> only for the salvation of the
      elect. But it can hardly be said, without an abuse of words, that there is
      an actual <em>atonement</em>, or reconciliation, accomplished for those
      who are lost. "No man cometh unto me except the Father draw him" are the
      words of Christ Himself. "But why are not all drawn? Ask not the reason
      why," says Benedict Pictet. "It is secret, but not unjust." All true
      Christians agree that the value of Christ's <em>sacrifice</em> was
      infinite. All who receive the doctrines of grace through the electing love
      of God, believe that the <em>atonement</em> purchased by that sacrifice is
      efficacious only for the elect given to Christ in covenant by the
      Father...
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>sacrifice</em> was infinite in value, but limited in its effects;
      for, unless we adopt the fatal error of universal pardon, it will be
      admitted that it is the procuring cause of an <em>atonement</em> only for
      the saved who are reconciled to God by the priceless blood of His beloved
      Son. Here there is no fetter on the free proclamation of the Gospel.
      Salvation is proclaimed to all who will believe in Christ, to all who will
      come to Christ, to all who will trust the promise that He is able and
      willing to save. It is not for us to try to reconcile God's sovereignty
      with man's undoubted responsibility, by bending the truths of revelation
      either to the one side or the other...
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bible the sacrifice of Christ is always represented as a price paid
      to Divine Justice (Rev 5:9)... Scripture and all orthodox creeds represent
      the Godhead as acting in unison from the Councils of Eternity. The Father,
      in his boundless love for the world, sends the Son to shed his blood and
      offer a sacrifice, as an atonement for all who believe (Rom 5:11)...
    </p>
    <p>
      Many suppose that in preaching the Gospel it is necessary to tell every
      man that Christ died for him, and that if Christ did not actually atone
      for the sins of every individual, the Gospel cannot be preached at all.
      But this is very erroneous. The Gospel declares that Christ died for the
      guilty, and that the most guilty who believe it shall be saved...
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gospel does not tell every individual to whom it is addressed, that
      Christ died for him, but that if he believes he shall be saved. This is a
      warrant to preach the Gospel unto all men; and it is only as he is a
      believer that it is known to any man that Christ died for him
      individually.
