      <h1>2 Peter</h1>
      <h2>Author</h2>
      <p>
        Challenges: Some scholars believe 2 Peter used Jude as a source,
        suggesting it was written some time after Jude and therefore not by
        Peter. The letter's vocabulary and concepts are considered too Greek for
        a Galilean fisherman like Peter. Stylistic and theological differences
        to 1 Peter are used to raise doubts about a common author. False
        teachers described in the letter are seen by some as second-century
        Gnostics, suggesting a later date. Peter's appeal to Paul's letters as
        Scripture is argued to be a post-Pauline development during the time
        when the letters were collected and canonized. 2 Peter is not widely
        cited in the early church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pseudepigraphy: Bauckham argues that 2 Peter belongs to the "testament"
        genre, a farewell speech written after the speaker's death. He believes
        readers would have recognized the letter as fictional in nature, not
        believing Peter actually wrote it. The shift between future and present
        tenses is explained as providing a literary purpose, not implying actual
        future events. Bauckham suggests a late first-century date, before
        Paul's letters became widely known, and the author was not Peter, but a
        colleague who knew Peter's writings and messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Response: The differences in style between 1 and 2 Peter can be
        explained by the different situations addressed and the possibility of
        different secretaries, but the similarities between 1 and 2 Peter
        suggest a common author. Peter's use of Greek terms can be explained by
        his exposure to Hellenistic culture and the need to communicate
        effectively with his audience. Peter's reference to Paul's letters as
        Scripture does not require a late date for 2 Peter. The letter's
        eschatology and ethics are compatible with Petrine authorship. While the
        letter could be interpreted as a testament, this was not a recognized
        genre by earlier scholars and 2 Peter lacks usual features of a
        testament. No evidence suggests early Christians accepted pseudonymous
        documents as Scripture. 2 Peter does not advance new or esoteric
        teachings, a common motive for pseudepigraphy, so there is no clear
        motive for using a pseudonym.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internal evidence: The letter explicitly claims to be written by Peter
        (1:1). It uses the Hebraic form of his name, Simeon Peter, which is
        unique to this letter and Acts 15:14. The author claims to be an
        eyewitness of the transfiguration of Jesus (1:16-18). Paul is referred
        to as a "beloved brother" and the author knows about the wisdom of God
        granted to Paul (3:15-16). It also claims to be the second letter
        written by Peter (3:1).
      </p>
      <p>
        External evidence: The Muratorian Canon does not mention 2 Peter, but
        neither does it mention 1 Peter. Possible allusions to 2 Peter exist in
        the Apostolic Fathers (e.g., Epistle of Barnabas, 2 Clement). Origen
        cited 2 Peter six times, suggesting he accepted its authenticity. Even
        though Eusebius mentions that 2 Peter was disputed, he notes that most
        accepted it. 2 Peter is included in the Bodmer papyrus (ùîì72) from the
        third century and other early codices.
      </p>
      <h2>Date and Destination</h2>
      <p>
        This depends on ones views of authorship and the date of Peter's death.
        The most likely date falls between A.D. 60 and 68, and the most probable
        destination is Asia Minor if 2 Peter refers to 1 Peter.
      </p>
      <h2>Occasion and Background</h2>
      <p>
        Peter warns that danger was approaching from false teachers who would
        spread impious inventions. Identifying the precise theological identity
        of the opponents remains challenging. While Gnosticism and Epicureanism
        offer some potential connections, the evidence is inconclusive. We are
        left with a general picture of false teachers within the church who
        denied the parousia and future judgment, advocated for a libertine
        lifestyle, and misused Paul's writings. He describes the character and
        manners of those who would, by their corruptions, pollute Christianity.
        He especially draws his pen against Lucianic men, who abandon themselves
        to every wickedness, and take a profane license to show contempt to God,
        and treat with ridicule the hope of a better life.
      </p>
      <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
      <p>
        The design is to show, that those who have once professed the true faith
        of Christ, ought to respond to their calling to the last. After having
        then extolled, in high terms, the grace of God, he recommends to them
        holiness of life, because God usually punishes in hypocrites a false
        profession of his name, with dreadful blindness, and on the other hand
        he increases his gifts to those who truly and from the heart embrace the
        doctrine of religion. He, therefore, exhorts them to prove their calling
        by a holy life. And, to give a greater weight to his admonitions, he
        says that he is already near his end, and at the same time, excuses
        himself that he so often repeated the same things, his object being that
        they who should remain alive on the earth after his death, might have
        what he, when alive, wrote, more deeply fixed in their minds.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Themes</h2>
      <p>
        Historicity of the Gospel: As the foundation of true religion is the
        certainty and truth of the gospel, he shows, first, how indubitable is
        its truth by this fact, that he himself had been an eyewitness of all
        things which it contains, and especially that he had heard Christ
        proclaimed from heaven to be the Son of God; and, in the second place,
        it was God's will that it should be borne witness to, and approved by
        the oracles of the prophets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspiration: The infallibility and divine authority of the Scriptures
        are due to the fact that they are the word of God; and they are the word
        of God because they were given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost:
        "For no prophecy ever came by the will of man, but holy men of God
        spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit" (2 Pet 1:21). It is God speaking
        to man, God speaking by man, God speaking as man, God speaking for man!
      </p>
      <p>
        Second coming: He exhorts the faithful, not only to look always for the
        coming of Christ with suspended and expectant minds, but also to regard
        that day as present before their eyes, and in the meantime to keep
        themselves unpolluted for the Lord: in which doctrine he makes Paul as
        his associate and approver; and to defend his writings from the
        calumnies of the ungodly, he severely reproves all those who pervert
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repentance: The covenant of works allowed no repentance; there it was:
        sin and die. Repentance came in by the gospel. Christ has purchased us
        with his blood so that repenting sinners shall be saved. The law
        required personal, perfect, and perpetual obedience. It cursed all who
        could not come up to this: ‚ÄúCursed is everyone that does not continue to
        do all things which are written in the book of the law‚Äù (Gal 3:10). It
        does not say, ‚ÄúHe that does not obey all things, let him repent;‚Äù
        instead, it says ‚Äúlet him be cursed.‚Äù Thus repentance is a doctrine that
        has been brought to light only by the gospel.
