      <h1>Acts</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Luke wrote The Gospel According to Luke and The Acts of the Apostles as
        a two volume work. As such, it should be read it in light of Luke's
        Gospel and the four Gospels as a whole. Acts describes the history of
        Christianity after Jesus' death and resurrection, beginning with Jesus'
        ascension into heaven and the sending of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost.
        Acts ends with Paul under house arrest in Rome with the last line, "Paul
        stayed two whole years in his own rented house and received all who were
        coming to him, preaching God's Kingdom and teaching the things
        concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance."
        (Acts 28:30-31).
      </p>
      <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
      <p>
        The place of Acts in the canon of Holy Scripture has never been disputed
        by the early Church, except by such heretical sects as the Marcionites,
        the Ebionites and the Manichaeans, and then only on dogmatical grounds.
        Traces of acquaintance with it are found in the apostolic fathers, as
        also in Justin and Tatian. Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria and
        Tertullian frequently quote from this book. It is named in the
        Muratorian canon, and is also contained in the Syriac and old Latin
        Versions. These testimonies are quite sufficient to show that it was
        generally accepted.
      </p>
      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        As an integral part of Scripture it is inseparably connected with the
        Gospels, and reveals to us, how the Gospel was embodied in the life and
        institution of the Church. We here see that the sowing of the precious
        seed that was entrusted to the apostles resulted in the planting and
        extension of the Church from three great racial centers of the world,
        from Jerusalem, the center of the Jewish Theocracy, from Antioch, the
        center of Greek culture, and from Rome, the capital of the world. The
        Gospels contain a revelation of what Jesus began to do and to teach; the
        book of Acts shows us what he continued to do and to teach through the
        ministry of men.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an evident advance in the teaching of the apostles; they have
        learnt to understand much that was once a mystery to them. In the
        Gospels we find that they are forbidden to tell anyone that Jesus is the
        Messiah; here we read repeatedly that they preach Christ and the
        resurrection. They now exhibit Christ in his true character as the
        Prince of Life and as the King of Glory. And the effect of their
        teaching was such as to bear striking evidence to the regenerating power
        of Him, who by the resurrection from the dead was powerfully declared to
        be the Son of God.
