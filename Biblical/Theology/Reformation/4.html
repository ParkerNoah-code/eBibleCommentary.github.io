          of the Word of God above Tradition</em

      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;You have made the commandment of God of no effect by your
        tradition.&quot; Matthew 15:6
      </p>
      <p>
        Every reform in religion presupposes the existence of errors, evil in
        their tendencies and results, which have gradually crept into
        ecclesiastical organizations, and which need to be removed in order that
        such organizations may become pure and scriptural. A reform is not the
        introduction of a new system of religion, but rather the revival of the
        old system, and the assertion of its supremacy over the innovations of
        men. It is not a movement based on the pretended reception of a new
        revelation, conflicting with previous ones from an unchanging Jehovah,
        but it is the enforcement of the commands and precepts which have
        already been revealed, but which have been obscured, and invalidated,
        and made of no effect by human tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus it was with the Great Reform introduced by Jesus Christ. He
        declared that he came &quot;not to destroy the law, but to fulfill
        it.&quot; In the prosecution of his mission, he utterly disregarded the
        religious rites which owed their origin to mere human invention, and, by
        a studied non-observance of the traditions of the Jewish elders, he
        constantly exhibited his disapprobation of them. At the same time, he
        taught principles, which, if carried out, would restore the supremacy of
        God&#x27;s law, and effectually remove every vestige of this usurpation
        of authority by man.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course brought down upon him the displeasure of those who were
        wedded to the rites of tradition, while they neglected the more
        important commands of God. They therefore came to expostulate with him
        in reference to the course pursued by him, saying, &quot;Why do your
        disciples transgress the traditions of the elders?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        But Jesus, in reply, asked them a far more pertinent and weighty
        question: &quot;Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by
        your tradition?&quot; And then, after citing a case in point, he charged
        them, in the words of the text, with making void the law of God, by
        substituting their unscriptural observances for his divine commands:
        &quot;Thus have you made the commandment of God of no effect by your
        tradition.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        There exists today a body of Christians, who are laboring to effect the
        same kind of reforrn as that in which the blessed Savior was engaged,
        more than eighteen hundred years ago. That body, though designated since
        the days of Christ by various names, is known, at the present time, by
        the name of Baptists. The theme of this, and several succeeding Lectures
        will be: The distinguishing features of that reform in which Baptists
        are engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many persons suppose, that the only difference between Baptists and
        other evangelical denominations, is respecting the mode and subjects of
        baptism. This is, indeed, the principal external difference; but this
        difference exhibits the adherence, on the part of Baptists, to a great
        and important principle, which is involved in their action, and which
        they believe to be violated by those who differ from them in this
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        An illustration of their position is found in the text and its
        connection. The washing of a person&#x27;s hands before eating, was, in
        itself, a small matter; but it involved, in this instance, a sinful
        obtruding of human tradition in the place of divine commands. This is
        just the principle that is involved in the practice of infant baptism.
        We announce, then, as the First Feature of the reform in which Baptists
        are engaged,
      </p>
      <p>
        The Exaltation of the Word of God above Tradition, in All Matters of
        Religious Duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        There has always been a conflict between Divine revelation and human
        tradition; and yet the advocates of the latter have almost invariably
        endeavored to reconcile it with the former, and thus the Word of God is
        often distorted in vain efforts to make it support that which is of
        merely human origin. The ultimate effect of these efforts is to divide
        the Bible against itself, and to cause it to be utterly disregarded as
        the standard of appeal in matters of religious duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was thus with the traditions of the Jewish elders. Those who followed
        them and practiced their rites, ceased to regard the Scriptures which
        they possessed as the standard of duty; they became a dead letter, and
        the tradition of the elders—not the Scriptures—was the authority they
        cited for the support of their rites.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;For God commanded, saying, &#x27;Honor your father and your
        mother&#x27;; and, &#x27;He who curses father or mother, let him be put
        to death.&#x27;
      </p>
      <p>
        But you say, &#x27;Whoever says to his father or mother, &quot;Whatever
        profit you might have received from me is a gift to God&quot;—then he
        need not honor his father or mother.&#x27;
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your
        tradition.&quot; Matthew 15:4-6
      </p>
      <p>
        The same result followed, when the disciples listened to the voice of
        tradition. On one occasion Christ said, in reference to John, &quot;If I
        will that he tarries until I come, what is that to you?&quot; Tradition
        immediately distorted the question into an assertion: &quot;Then that
        saying went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not
        die.&quot; Here tradition uttered a falsehood, and taught as usual a
        lie.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is thus, also, in reference to the Church of Rome. Tradition after
        tradition has been received, until it becomes dangerous to the interests
        of that church to permit her deluded members to read God&#x27;s Word—so
        directly are her traditions opposed to that Word. And, in order to
        sustain herself, she vainly arrogates to herself infallibility, and
        exalts herself above the Bible, and makes the commandment of God of no
        effect by her tradition. The will of the Pope and the decisions of
        councils, are made the standards of appeal—and the Bible is a dead
        letter. And yet this same church, in all her corruption, endeavors to
        reconcile her traditions, in some instances, with the Bible; but, in
        order to do it, she distorts and invents Scripture to suit herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        On what does the Papacy rest to support its penances, and image-worship,
        and prayers to the saints, and priestly absolutions, and, in short, its
        very existence? I reply in one word, Tradition! Let the Bible become her
        standard, and she would cease to exist. She has made almost every
        commandment of God of no effect by her tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus it is, also, with Protestant Paedobaptist churches. Tradition is
        the basis on which infant baptism rests. We look in vain for any command
        in reference to it in the Bible; the Scriptures utter not a word in
        support of it. The most able Paedobaptists have themselves admitted
        this. Says Dr. Leonard Woods, an eminent Paedobaptist: &quot;Whatever
        may have been the precepts of Christ, or his apostles, to those who
        enjoyed their personal instructions, it is plain there is no express
        precept respecting infant baptism in our sacred writings. The proof,
        then, that infant baptism is a divine institution, must be made out some
        other way.&quot; He says further: &quot;The want of an express, positive
        command of Scripture that infants should be baptized, is not to be
        considered as a valid objection against infant baptism.&quot; (Lectures
        on Infant Baptism, pages 10, 11, 17)
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here plainly admitted that there is no command for infant baptism
        in the Word of God. But we do not need these admissions to substantiate
        our assertion. We simply appeal to the Bible itself. If it was there, we
        could see it for ourselves. We ask any one to show us the first instance
        of the sprinkling of an infant, or any command to administer baptism to
        infants. It cannot be found. Thousands of dollars have been offered for
        the production of a single text, authorizing the practice; but these
        premiums have never been claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        On what, then, does it rest? I reply, on TRADITION. Dr. Woods says that
        authority for it, &quot;may be afforded particularly by an unwritten
        tradition.&quot; Infant baptism is a human invention, having no higher
        authority than that of man. It is one of the traditions which the
        Protestant Reformers brought from Rome. Infant baptism is the main
        &quot;pillar&quot; on which Popery rests; for, if you take away the
        baptism of infants, Rome would soon fall. Its defense necessitates
        Romish arguments; and instances are not wanting where Paedobaptists in
        combating Romanists, have either been compelled to use arguments fatal
        to their own practices, or else be defeated. It is a matter of history,
        that Protestant arguments against Baptists have often been used by
        Romanists against Protestants themselves. A forcible proof of this is
        seen in the following extract from the Roman Catholic Catechism:
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: Can Protestants prove to Baptists, that the baptism of infants
        is good and useful?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: No; they cannot; because, according to Protestant principles,
        such baptism is useless.
      </p>
      <p>Question: Why do you say this?</p>
      <p>
        Answer: One of the Protestant principles is, that no human being can be
        justified except by an act of faith in Jesus Christ; but no infant is
        capable of making this act of faith; therefore, upon Protestant
        principles, the baptism of infants is useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: Can you draw the same consequence from any other principle?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: Yes; their first principle is, that nothing is to be practiced
        which is not authorized by Scriptural example; but it does not appear
        from Scripture, that even one infant was ever baptized; therefore
        Protestants should reject, on their own principle, infant baptism as an
        unscriptural usage.
      </p>
      <p>Question: How do Baptists treat other Protestants?</p>
      <p>
        Answer: They boast that the Scripture is evidently for Baptist
        practice—that other Protestants hold traditional doctrines, like the
        Catholics. They quote Matthew chapter 28: &#x27;Go teach all nations,
        baptizing them,&#x27; from which they say it is clear that teaching
        should go before baptism; hence they conclude that as infants cannot be
        taught, so neither should they be baptized, until they are capable of
        teaching or instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: What use do they make of Mark, chapter 10: &#x27;He who
        believes and is baptized shall be saved?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: They say it is evident that belief or faith must precede
        baptism; but they add infants are not capable of believing; therefore
        neither are they capable of being baptized.
      </p>
      <p>Question: What can Protestants reply to this Baptist reasoning?</p>
      <p>
        Answer: They may give these passages another meaning; but they can never
        prove that their interpretation is better than that of the Baptists,
        because they themselves give every one a right to interpret Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>Question: How do Catholics prove that infants ought to be baptized?</p>
      <p>
        Answer: Not from Scripture alone, which is not very clear on this
        subject, but from the Scripture illustrated by the constant tradition of
        the church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: Can Protestants use this argument of tradition against the
        Baptists?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: No; they have no right to use it in this matter, where it would
        serve them, since they reject it in every question where it is opposed
        to their novel and lately invented doctrines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Says the President of the famous Council of Trent, a Roman Catholic
        Cardinal, speaking of the Baptists: &quot;And surely, how many soever
        have written against this heresy, whether they were Catholics or
        Reformers, they were able to overthrow it, not so much by the testimony
        of the Scriptures, as by the authority of the Church.&quot; And Bayle,
        in his Critical Dictionary, says that the Protestants were obliged to
        meet the Baptists with arguments which were turned against them by the
        papists. Dr. Woods furnishes us an illustration of this assertion. He
        says: &quot;It is unquestionable, that the knowledge of some
        extraordinary events of providence, or of some divine injunctions, may
        be as truly and as certainly communicated in this way, [by an unwritten
        tradition,] as in others; and we should in many cases, consider a man
        who should refuse to admit the truth and authority of a tradition, to be
        as unreasonable, as if he should refuse to admit the authority of
        written or printed records.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I ask if this is not giving up to Rome all she claims? &quot;We
        should consider a man who should refuse to admit the authority of
        tradition, to be as unreasonable as if he should refuse to admit the
        authority of written or printed records!&quot; Will not Popery heartily
        endorse this doctrine?
      </p>
      <p>
        Now on what kind of traditionary authority does infant baptism rest?
        Why, upon the same as every other corruption of Rome; and if Romish
        tradition be followed in this case, why not in all others? Thus, we have
        shown that infant baptism requires Romish arguments. Now, the simple
        reason of this is, that, like the other rites of Popery, it is founded
        in tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, the commandment of God is made of none effect by this
        tradition. God has given express and plain commands, in reference to
        every duty and ordinance. He has commanded believers to be baptized; He
        has extended the command to none others. Those baptized in infancy, in a
        multitude of cases, grow up in unbelief, and never become believers. But
        where they do become converts, they are taught, by the tradition of the
        church, that their infant baptism is sufficient, and they are not
        expected to be baptized after believing. And even when persons sprinkled
        in infancy are led, by the study of the Bible, to desire baptism after
        they have believed, strong efforts are always made to dissuade them from
        it, and they are often compelled to go to the Baptists in order to be
        baptized. These things are of such common occurrence, that it is
        unnecessary to relate instances in proof. Thus the Word of God is made
        of no effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, Paedobaptists, like the Jewish elders, endeavor to reconcile
        their tradition with the Word of God. Look at their reasoning:
        &quot;Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift by
        whatever you might be profited by me, and honor not his father or his
        mother, he shall be free.&quot; Paedobaptists say: &quot;If any persons
        be sprinkled in infancy, and be not baptized after they believe, it is
        sufficient.&quot; There is an exact parallel. Here you perceive the
        reasonings of men, in both instances, though opposed to the express
        command of God, are made the standard, instead of his Word. Would it not
        sound strange to hear a Paedobaptist minister urge his people to simply
        follow the teaching and example of Christ, in reference to baptism? Yet
        this is right; but this comes directly in contact with their tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Baptists are opposed to tradition, anywhere and everywhere; whether
        they find it in the Church of Rome, or in Protestant churches. They aim
        to elevate the Word of God above tradition, as the standard of duty in
        all places. It is professedly the grand doctrine of Protestantism, which
        Protestants themselves have abandoned—that Baptists steadily maintain.
        They aim to bring all to this standard. They, themselves, have always
        adhered to the Bible. Did anyone ever hear of Baptists being charged
        with following tradition? The charge would be ridiculously absurd; for
        they have always opposed tradition as a guide in matters of religious
        duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        From these remarks, it will be perceived, that while the subjects and
        mode of baptism is the external ground of difference between Baptists
        and others, that difference involves a great principle; and the primary
        question is not, Shall infants be baptized? But, whether God&#x27;s Word
        or tradition shall be our guide. God has uttered his will in the matter.
        That will we follow, as we find it in his Word. Those who oppose us, by
        their own showing, follow tradition. We are laboring to effect a reform.
        In doing so we refer all to the Bible. We assert its supremacy above all
        human teaching, our own, as well as that of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, then, is a prominent feature of the reform in which Baptists are
        engaged. And I observe it is most important and necessary. Especially is
        it necessary,
      </p>
      <p>
        1. In COMBATING ERROR. If tradition is allowed in one particular, who
        will prohibit it in another? Romanism is gaining ground in this country;
        it is a religion of tradition. Who will oppose it? Those who are
        themselves trammeled by tradition? To every argument, they can retort,
        as they have done, &quot;Where do you get your infant baptism?&quot; The
        most staunch Romanist asks nothing more than the adoption of the
        principle, contained in the language already quoted, of a Protestant
        Paedobaptist in support of infant baptism: &quot;We should consider a
        man who should refuse to admit the truth and authority of tradition, to
        be as unreasonable as if he should refuse to admit the truth, of written
        or printed records.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        No Paedobaptist can consistently oppose Romanism. There is no consistent
        position between the Romish and the Baptist church. Tradition leads to
        the one—the Word of God to the other. Infidelity and Rationalism, also,
        are rearing their heads in our midst, and who shall meet them? Their cry
        is, &quot;Priestcraft, and ministerial dictation!&quot; Who shall meet
        them? Those who allow their ministers to tell them what to believe, and
        to dictate whether they shall investigate a subject or not? No! but
        those who are prepared, by an independent investigation, and a manly
        appeal to the Bible, to show the falsity of their charges. This feature
        of reform is necessary,
      </p>
      <p>
        2. To the PURITY OF THE CHURCH. No organization can be pure, without a
        pure standard. Tradition is liable to perversion; there is no certainty
        about it. Today it assumes one position, tomorrow an opposite one. Thus
        it has ever been. The Church of Rome, though claiming infallibility, has
        constantly changed her ground of action, because governed by the
        variable standard of tradition. This is no less true of Protestant
        Paedobaptism. Today, infants are sprinkled on one ground; tomorrow that
        ground is abandoned, and another, directly opposite to it, is urged, as
        a reason for administering the rite. Anon, both these are abandoned, and
        a new position, with a new set of arguments is introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is strikingly illustrated in the experience of Simon Menno, a
        Romish priest, who in 1580 was converted to Christ and to Baptist
        sentiments, by reading the New Testament. He says:
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I examined the Scriptures with diligence and meditated on them
        earnestly, but could find in them no authority for infant baptism. As I
        remarked this, I spoke of it to my pastor, and after several
        conversations he acknowledged that infant baptism had no ground in the
        Scriptures. Yet I dare not trust so much to my understanding. I
        consulted some ancient authors, who taught me that children must, by
        baptism, be washed from their original sin. This I compared with the
        Scriptures and perceived that it set at naught the blood of Christ.
        Afterward I went to Luther, and would gladly have known from him the
        ground; and he taught me that we must baptize children on their own
        faith, because they are holy. This also I saw was not according to
        God&#x27;s Word. In the third place I went to Brucer, who taught me that
        we should baptize children in order to be able the more diligently to
        take care of them, and bring them up in the ways of the Lord. But, this
        too, I saw, was a groundless representation. In the fourth place I had
        recourse to Bullinger, who pointed me to the covenant of circumcision;
        but I found as before, that, according to Scripture, the practice could
        not stand. As I now on every side observed that the writers stood on
        grounds so very different, and each followed his own reason, I saw
        clearly that we were deceived with infant baptism.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Can the church be pure with such a contradictory guide as tradition?
        Never!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I inquire, Does the charge of the text lie against any of my
        Christian brethren? If you have neglected baptism since you believed,
        because you were sprinkled in infancy, it most assuredly does. Your
        infant baptism rests on tradition. The Bible says, &quot;He who believes
        and is baptized, shall be saved.&quot; &quot;Repent and be baptized,
        every one of you.&quot; If, because sprinkled in infancy, you refuse now
        to obey Christ, we say to you, in His own truthful language, &quot;Thus
        have you made the commandment of God of no effect by your
        tradition!&quot;
