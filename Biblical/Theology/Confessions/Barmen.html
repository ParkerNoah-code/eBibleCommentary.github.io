      <p>
        In view of the errors of the “German Christians” and of the present
        Reich Church Administration, which are ravaging the Church and at the
        same time also shattering the unity of the German Evangelical Church, we
        confess the following evangelical truths:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> “I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the
        Father except through me.” John 14:6
      </p>
      <p>
        “Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through
        the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. I am the
        gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved.” John 10:1,9
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, as he is attested to us in Holy Scripture, is the one Word
        of God whom we have to hear, and whom we have to trust and obey in life
        and in death.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that the Church could and should recognize
        as a source of its proclamation, beyond and besides this one Word of
        God, yet other events, powers, historic figures and truths as God’s
        revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> “Jesus Christ has been made wisdom and righteousness and
        sanctification and redemption for us by God.” 1 Cor. 1:30
      </p>
      <p>
        As Jesus Christ is God’s comforting pronouncement of the forgiveness of
        all our sins, so, with equal seriousness, he is also God’s vigorous
        announcement of his claim upon our whole life. Through him there comes
        to us joyful liberation from the godless ties of this world for free,
        grateful service to his creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that there could be areas of our life in
        which we would not belong to Jesus Christ but to other lords, areas in
        which we would not need justification and sanctification through him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> “Let us, however, speak the truth in love, and in every
        respect grow into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole
        body is joined together.” Eph. 4:15-16
      </p>
      <p>
        The Christian Church is the community of brethren in which, in Word and
        Sacrament, through the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ acts in the present as
        Lord. With both its faith and its obedience, with both its message and
        its order, it has to testify in the midst of the sinful world, as the
        Church of pardoned sinners, that it belongs to him alone and lives and
        may live by his comfort and under his direction alone, in expectation of
        his appearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that the Church could have permission to
        hand over the form of its message and of its order to whatever it itself
        might wish or to the vicissitudes of the prevailing ideological and
        political convictions of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them,
        and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will not be so among you;
        but whoever wishes to have authority over you must be your servant.”
        Matt. 20:25-26
      </p>
      <p>
        The various offices in the Church do not provide a basis for some to
        exercise authority over others but for the ministry [lit., “service”]
        with which the whole community has been entrusted and charged to be
        carried out.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that, apart from this ministry, the Church
        could, and could have permission to, give itself or allow itself to be
        given special leaders [Führer] vested with ruling authority.
      </p>
      <p><b>5.</b> “Fear God. Honor the Emperor.” 1 Pet. 2:17</p>
      <p>
        Scripture tells us that by divine appointment the State, in this still
        unredeemed world in which also the Church is situated, has the task of
        maintaining justice and peace, so far as human discernment and human
        ability make this possible, by means of the threat and use of force. The
        Church acknowledges with gratitude and reverence toward God the benefit
        of this, his appointment. It draws attention to God’s Dominion [Reich],
        God’s commandment and justice, and with these the responsibility of
        those who rule and those who are ruled. It trusts and obeys the power of
        the Word, by which God upholds all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that beyond its special commission the
        State should and could become the sole and total order of human life and
        so fulfil the vocation of the Church as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that beyond its special commission the
        Church should and could take on the nature, tasks and dignity which
        belong to the State and thus become itself an organ of the State.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6.</b> “See, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Matt.
        28:20 “God’s Word is not fettered.” 2 Tim. 2:9
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church’s commission, which is the foundation of its freedom,
        consists in this: in Christ’s stead, and so in the service of his own
        Word and work, to deliver all people, through preaching and sacrament,
        the message of the free grace of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reject the false doctrine that with human vainglory the Church could
        place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of self-chosen
        desires, purposes and plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Confessing Synod of the German Evangelical Church declares that it
        sees in the acknowledgment of these truths and in the rejection of these
        errors the indispensable theological basis of the German Evangelical
        Church as a confederation of Confessing Churches. It calls upon all who
        can stand in solidarity with its Declaration to be mindful of these
        theological findings in all their decisions concerning Church and State.
        It appeals to all concerned to return to unity in faith, hope and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Verbum Dei manet in aeternum.</em>
        <br />
        The Word of God will last for ever.
