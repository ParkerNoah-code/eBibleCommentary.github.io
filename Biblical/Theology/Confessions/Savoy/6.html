<h2>5. Of Providence</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God, the great Creator of all things, doth uphold,<sup>a</sup>
          direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things,<sup>b</sup>
          from the greatest even to the least,<sup>c</sup> by his most wise and
          holy providence,<sup>d</sup> according to his infallible
          fore-knowledge<sup>e</sup> and the free and immutable counsel of his
          own will,<sup>f</sup> to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power,
          justice, goodness, and mercy.<sup>g</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Hebrews 1:3
          <br/>
          b: Psalm 135:6, Daniel 4:34-35, Acts 17:25-26, Acts 17:28, Job 38-41
          <br/>
          c: Matthew 10:29-31
          <br/>
          d: Psalm 104:24, Psalm 145:17, Proverbs 15:3
          <br/>
          e: Psalm 94:8-11, Acts 15:18
          <br/>
          f: Psalm 33:10-11, Ephesians 1:11
          <br/>
          g: Genesis 45:7, Psalm 145:7, Isaiah 63:14, Romans 9:17, Ephesians
          3:10
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Although in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God,
          the first cause, all things come to pass immutably and infallibly,<sup>a</sup>
          yet by the same providence he ordereth them to fall out, according to
          the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or
          contingently.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Acts 2:23
          <br/>

          b: Genesis 8:22, Exodus 21:13, Deuteronomy 19:5, 1 Kings 22:28, 1
          Kings 22:34, Isaiah 10:6-7, Jeremiah 31:35
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> God, in his ordinary providence, maketh use of means,<sup>a</sup>
          yet is free to work without,<sup>b</sup> above,<sup>c</sup> and
          against them,<sup>d</sup> at his pleasure.
        </p>
<p>
          a: Isaiah 55:10-11, Hosea 2:21-22, Acts 27:31, Acts 27:44
          <br/>
          b: Job 34:10, Hosea 1:7, Matthew 4:4
          <br/>
          c: Romans 4:19-21
          <br/>
          d: 2 Kings 6:6, Daniel 3:27
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> The almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite
          goodness of God so far manifest themselves in his providence, in that
          his determinate counsel extendeth itself even to the first fall, and
          all other sins of angels and men,<sup>a</sup> and that not by a bare
          permission,<sup>b</sup> which also he most wisely and powerfully
          boundeth, and otherwise ordereth and governeth in a manifold
          dispensation, to his own holy ends;<sup>d</sup> yet so as the
          sinfulness thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from
          God; who, being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the
          author or approver of sin.<sup>e</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 2 Samuel 16:10, 2 Samuel 24:1, 1 Chronicles 21:1, 1 Kings 22:22-23,
          1 Chronicles 10:4, 1 Chronicles 10:13-14, Acts 2:23, Acts 4:27-28,
          Romans 11:32-34

          <br/>
          b: Acts 14:16
          <br/>
          c: 2 Kings 19:28, Psalm 76:10
          <br/>
          d: Genesis 50:20, Isaiah 10:6-7, Isaiah 10:12
          <br/>
          e: Psalm 50:21, James 1:13-14, James 1:17, 1 John 2:16
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The most wise, righteous, and gracious God doth oftentimes
          leave for a season his own children to manifold temptations and the
          corruption of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former
          sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption and
          deceitfulness of their hearts, that they be humbled;<sup>a</sup> and
          to raise them to a more close and constant dependence for their
          support unto himself, and to make them more watchful against all
          future occasions of sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 2 Samuel 24:1, 2 Chronicles 32:25-26, 2 Chronicles 32:31
          <br/>

          b: Psalm 73, Psalm 77:1-10, Psalm 77:12, Mark 14:66-72, John 21:15-17,
          2 Corinthians 12:7-9
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as a righteous
          judge, for former sins, doth blind and harden,<sup>a</sup> from them
          he not only withholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been
          enlightened in their understandings and wrought upon in their
          hearts,<sup>b</sup> but sometimes also withdraweth the gifts which
          they had,<sup>c</sup> and exposeth them to such objects as their
          corruption makes occasion of sin;<sup>d</sup> and withal, gives them
          over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power
          of Satan;<sup>e</sup> whereby it comes to pass that they harden
          themselves, even under those means which God useth for the softening
          of others.<sup>f</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 1:24, Romans 1:26, Romans 1:28, Romans 11:7-8
          <br/>
          b: Deuteronomy 29:4
          <br/>
          c: Matthew 13:12, Matthew 25:29
          <br/>
          d: Deuteronomy 2:30, 2 Kings 8:12-13
          <br/>
          e: Psalm 81:11-12, 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12
          <br/>
          f: Exodus 7:3, Exodus 8:15, Exodus 8:32, Isaiah 6:9-10, Acts 28:26-27,
          Isaiah 8:14, 2 Corinthians 2:15-16, 1 Peter 2:7-8
        </p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> As the providence of God doth, in general, reach to all
          creatures, so, after a most special manner, it taketh care of his
          Church, and disposeth all things to the good thereof.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Isaiah 43:3-5, Isaiah 43:14, Amos 9:8-9, Romans 8:28, 1 Timothy
          4:10
        </p>
