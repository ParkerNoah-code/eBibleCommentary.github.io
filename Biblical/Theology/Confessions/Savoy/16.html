<h2>15. Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Such of the elect as are converted at riper years, having
          sometime lived in the state of nature, and therein served divers lusts
          and pleasures, God in their effectual calling giveth them repentance
          unto life.
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Whereas there is none that doth good and sinneth not, and
          the best of men may, through the power and deceitfulness of their
          corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall
          into great sins and provocations; God hath, in the covenant of grace,
          mercifully provided that believers so sinning and falling be renewed
          through repentance unto salvation.
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> This saving repentance is an evangelical grace, whereby a
          person, being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils
          of his sin, doth, by faith in Christ, humble himself for it with godly
          sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon and
          strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavour, by supplies of the
          Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in all things.
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> As repentance is to be continued through the whole course of
          our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions
          thereof, so it is every man's duty to repent of his particular
          known sins particularly.
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Such is the provision which God hath made through Christ in
          the covenant of grace for the preservation of believers unto
          salvation; that although there is no sin so small but it deserves
          damnation; yet there is no sin so great that it shall bring damnation
          on them that repent; which makes the constant preaching of repentance
          necessary.
