<h2>10. Of Effectual Calling</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those
          only, he is pleased, in his appointed and accepted time, effectually
          to call,<sup>a</sup> by his Word and Spirit,<sup>b</sup> out of that
          state of sin and death, in which they are by nature, to grace and
          salvation by Jesus Christ;<sup>c</sup> enlightening their minds,
          spiritually and savingly, to understand the things of God;<sup>d</sup>
          taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of
          flesh;<sup>e</sup> renewing their wills, and by his almighty power
          determining them to that which is good,<sup>f</sup> and effectually
          drawing them to Jesus Christ;<sup>g</sup> yet so as they come most
          freely, being made willing by his grace.<sup>h</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 8:30, Romans 11:7, Ephesians 1:10-11
          <br/>
          b: 2 Corinthians 3:3, 2 Corinthians 3:6, 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14
          <br/>
          c: Romans 8:2, Ephesians 2:1-5, 2 Timothy 1:9-10
          <br/>

          d: Acts 26:18, 1 Corinthians 2:10, 1 Corinthians 2:12, Ephesians
          1:17-18

          <br/>
          e: Ezekiel 36:26
          <br/>
          f: Deuteronomy 30:6, Ezekiel 11:19, Ezekiel 36:27, Philippians 2:13
          <br/>
          g: John 6:44-45, Ephesians 1:19
          <br/>
          h: Psalm 110:3, Song of Solomon 1:4, John 6:37, Romans 6:16-18
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> This effectual call is of God's free and special grace
          alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man;<sup>a</sup> who is
          altogether passive therein, until, being quickened and renewed by the
          Holy Spirit,<sup>b</sup> he is thereby enabled to answer this call,
          and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 9:11, Ephesians 2:4-5, Ephesians 2:8-9, 2 Timothy 1:9, Titus
          3:4-5

          <br/>
          b: Romans 8:7, 1 Corinthians 2:14, Ephesians 2:5
          <br/>
          c: Ezekiel 36:27, John 5:25, John 6:37
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved
          by Christ through the Spirit,<sup>a</sup> who worketh when, and where,
          and how he pleaseth.<sup>b</sup> So also are all other elect persons
          who are incapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the
          Word.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Luke 18:15-16, John 3:3, John 3:5, Acts 2:38-39, Romans 8:9, 1 John
          5:12

          <br/>
          b: John 3:8
          <br/>
          c: Acts 4:12, 1 John 5:12
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Others, not elected, although they may be called by the
          ministry of the Word,<sup>a</sup> and may have some common operations
          of the Spirit,<sup>b</sup> yet not being effectually drawn by the
          Father, they neither do nor can come unto Christ, and therefore cannot
          be saved:<sup>c</sup> much less can men, not professing the Christian
          religion, be saved in any other way whatsoever, be they never so
          diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature and the
          law of that religion they do profess;<sup>d</sup> and to assert and
          maintain that they may is very pernicious, and to be detested.<sup>e</sup>

          a: Matthew 22:14
          <br/>
          b: Matthew 7:22, Matthew 13:20-21, Hebrews 6:4-5
          <br/>
          c: John 6:64-66, John 8:24
          <br/>
          d: John 4:22, John 14:6, John 17:3, Acts 4:12, Ephesians 2:12
          <br/>
          e: 1 Corinthians 16:22, Galatians 1:6-8, 2 John 1:9-11
