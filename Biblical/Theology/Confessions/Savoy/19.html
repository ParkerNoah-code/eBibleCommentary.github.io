<h2>18. Of The Assurance of Grace and Salvation</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Although temporary believers and other unregenerate men may
          vainly deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of
          being in the favour of God and estate of salvation,<sup>a</sup> which
          hope of theirs shall perish:<sup>b</sup> yet such as truly believe in
          the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all
          good conscience before him, may in this life be certainly assured that
          they are in a state of grace,<sup>c</sup> and may rejoice in the hope
          of the glory of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Deuteronomy 29:19, Job 8:13-14, Micah 3:11, John 8:41
          <br/>
          b: Matthew 7:22-23
          <br/>

          c: 1 John 2:3, 1 John 3:14, 1 John 3:18-19, 1 John 3:21, 1 John 3:24,
          1 John 5:13

          <br/>
          d: Romans 5:2, Romans 5:5
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable
          persuasion, grounded upon a fallible hope;<sup>a</sup> but an
          infallible assurance of faith, founded upon the divine truth of the
          promises of salvation,<sup>b</sup> the inward evidence of those graces
          unto which these promises are made,<sup>c</sup> the testimony of the
          Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the
          children of God:<sup>d</sup> which Spirit is the earnest of our
          inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.<sup>e</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Hebrews 6:11, Hebrews 6:19
          <br/>
          b: Hebrews 6:17-18
          <br/>

          c: 2 Corinthians 1:12, 2 Peter 1:4-5, 2 Peter 1:10-11, 1 John 2:3, 1
          John 3:14

          <br/>
          d: Romans 8:15-16
          <br/>
          e: Ephesians 1:13-14, Ephesians 4:30, 2 Corinthians 1:21-22
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence
          of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with
          many difficulties before he be partaker of it:<sup>a</sup> yet, being
          enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of
          God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of
          ordinary means, attain thereunto.<sup>b</sup> And therefore it is the
          duty of everyone to give all diligence to make his calling and
          election sure;<sup>c</sup> that thereby his heart may be enlarged in
          peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and
          in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience,<sup>d</sup>
          the proper fruits of this assurance: so far is it from inclining men
          to looseness.<sup>e</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Psalm 88, Psalm 77:1-12, Isaiah 50:10, Mark 9:24, 1 John 5:13
          <br/>

          b: 1 Corinthians 2:12, Ephesians 3:17-19, Hebrews 6:11-12, 1 John 4:13

          <br/>
          c: 2 Peter 1:10
          <br/>

          d: Romans 5:1-2, Romans 5:5, Romans 14:17, Romans 15:13, Ephesians
          1:3-4, Psalm 4:6-7, Psalm 119:32

          <br/>

          e: Psalm 130:4, Romans 6:1-2, Romans 8:1, Romans 8:12, 2 Corinthians
          7:1, Titus 2:11-12, Titus 2:14, 1 John 1:6-7, 1 John 2:1-2, 1 John
          3:2-3
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> True believers may have the assurance of their salvation
          divers ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in
          preserving of it; by falling into some special sin, which woundeth the
          conscience, and grieveth the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement
          temptation; by God's withdrawing the light of his countenance,
          and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no
          light:<sup>a</sup> yet are they neither utterly destitute of that seed
          of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that
          sincerity of heart and conscience of duty, out of which, by the
          operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be
          revived,<sup>b</sup> and by the which, in the meantime, they are
          supported from utter despair.<sup>c</sup>
