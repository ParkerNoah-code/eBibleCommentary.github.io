<h2>26. Of The Church</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The catholic or universal Church, which is invisible,
          consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or
          shall be gathered into one, under Christ the head thereof; and is the
          spouse, the body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Ephesians 1:10, Ephesians 1:22-23, Ephesians 5:23, Ephesians 5:27,
          Ephesians 5:32, Colossians 1:18
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The whole body of men throughout the world, professing the
          faith of the gospel and obedience unto God by Christ according to it,
          not destroying their own profession by any errors everting the
          foundation, or unholiness of conversation, are, and may be called the
          visible catholic church of Christ; although as such it is not
          entrusted with the administration of any ordinances, or have any
          officers to rule or govern in, or over the whole body.
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The purest churches under heaven are subject both to mixture
          and error, and some have so degenerated as to become no churches of
          Christ, but synagogues of Satan: nevertheless Christ always hath had,
          and ever shall have, a visible kingdom in this world, to the end
          thereof, of such as believe in him, and make profession of his name.
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> There is no other Head of the Church but the Lord Jesus
          Christ; nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is
          that antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth
          himself in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God, whom
          the Lord shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> As the Lord in his care and love towards his Church, hath in
          his infinite wise providence exercised it with great variety in all
          ages, for the good of them that love him, and his own glory; so
          according to his promise, we expect that in the latter days,
          antichrist being destroyed, the Jews called, and the adversaries of
          the kingdom of his dear Son broken, the churches of Christ being
          enlarged, and edified through a free and plentiful communication of
          light and grace, shall enjoy in this world a more quiet, peaceable and
          glorious condition than they have enjoyed.
