<h2>8. Of Christ the Mediator</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain
          the Lord Jesus, his only-begotten Son, according to a covenant made
          between them both, to be the Mediator between God and man,<sup>a</sup>
          the Prophet,<sup>b</sup> Priest,<sup>c</sup> and King;<sup>d</sup> the
          Head and Saviour of his Church,<sup>e</sup> the Heir of all
          things,<sup>f</sup> and Judge of the world;<sup>g</sup> unto whom he
          did, from all eternity, give a people to be his seed,<sup>h</sup> and
          to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and
          glorified.<sup>i</sup>

        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very
          and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, did,
          when the fulness of time was come, take upon him man's
          nature,<sup>a</sup> with all the essential properties and common
          infirmities thereof, yet without sin:<sup>b</sup> being conceived by
          the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin Mary, of her
          substance.<sup>c</sup> So that two whole, perfect, and distinct
          natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together
          in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion.<sup>d</sup>
          Which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only
          mediator between God and man.<sup>e</sup>

        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the
          divine in the Person of the Son, was sanctified and anointed with the
          Holy Spirit above measure;<sup>a</sup> having in him all the treasures
          of wisdom and knowledge,<sup>b</sup> in whom it pleased the Father
          that all fulness should dwell;<sup>c</sup> to the end that, being
          holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth,<sup>d</sup> he
          might be thoroughly furnished to execute the office of a mediator and
          surety.<sup>e</sup> Which office he took not unto himself, but was
          thereunto called by his Father,<sup>f</sup> who put all power and
          judgment into his hand, and gave him commandment to execute the
          same.<sup>g</sup>

          g: Matthew 28:18, John 5:22, John 5:27, Acts 2:36
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake,<sup>a</sup>
          which, that he might discharge, he was made under the law,<sup>b</sup>
          and did perfectly fulfill it;<sup>c</sup> and underwent the punishment
          due to us, which we should have borne and suffered, being made sin and
          a curse for us enduring most grievous torments immediately from God in
          his soul,<sup>d</sup> and most painful sufferings in his body;<sup>e</sup>
          was crucified, and died;<sup>f</sup> was buried, and remained under
          the power of death, yet saw no corruption.<sup>g</sup> On the third
          day he arose from the dead,<sup>h</sup> with the same body in which he
          suffered;<sup>i</sup> with which also he ascended into heaven, and
          there sitteth at the right hand of his Father,<sup>k</sup> making
          intercession;<sup>l</sup> and shall return to judge men and angels at
          the end of the world.<sup>m</sup>

        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of
          himself, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God,
          hath fully satisfied the justice of God,<sup>a</sup> and purchased not
          only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of
          heaven, for all those whom the Father hath given unto him.<sup>b</sup>

        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Although the work of redemption was not actually wrought by
          Christ till after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and
          benefits thereof were communicated to the elect, in all ages
          successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those
          promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was revealed, and
          signified to be the seed of the woman which should bruise the
          serpent's head, and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the
          world, being yesterday and today the same, and forever.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Genesis 3:15, Galatians 4:4-5, Hebrews 13:8, Revelation 13:8</p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both
          natures; by each nature doing that which is proper to itself;<sup>a</sup>
          yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one
          nature is sometimes, in Scripture, attributed to the person
          denominated by the other nature.<sup>b</sup>

        </p>
<p>
<b>8.</b> To all those for whom Christ hath purchased redemption he
          doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same;<sup>a</sup>
          making intercession for them,<sup>b</sup> and revealing unto them, in
          and by the Word, the mysteries of salvation;<sup>c</sup> effectually
          persuading them by his Spirit to believe and obey; and governing their
          hearts by his Word and Spirit;<sup>d</sup> overcoming all their
          enemies by his almighty power and wisdom, in such manner and ways as
          are most consonant to his most wonderful and unsearchable
          dispensation.<sup>e</sup>
