<h2>2. Of God and of the Holy Trinity</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> There is but one only<sup>a</sup> living and true God,<sup>b</sup>
          who is infinite in being and perfection,<sup>c</sup> a most pure
          spirit,<sup>d</sup> invisible,<sup>e</sup> without body, parts,<sup>f</sup>
          or passions,<sup>g</sup> immutable,<sup>h</sup> immense,<sup>i</sup>
          eternal,<sup>k</sup> incomprehensible,<sup>l</sup> almighty,<sup>m</sup>
          most wise,<sup>n</sup> most holy,<sup>o</sup> most free,<sup>p</sup>
          most absolute,<sup>q</sup> working all things according to the counsel
          of his own immutable and most righteous will,<sup>r</sup> for his own
          glory;<sup>s</sup> most loving,<sup>t</sup> gracious, merciful,
          long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity,
          transgression, and sin;<sup>u</sup> the rewarder of them that
          diligently seek him;<sup>w</sup> and withal most just and terrible in
          his judgments;<sup>x</sup> hating all sin,<sup>y</sup> and who will by
          no means clear the guilty.<sup>z</sup>

<b>2.</b> God hath all life,<sup>a</sup> glory,<sup>b</sup>
          goodness,<sup>c</sup> blessedness,<sup>d</sup> in and of himself; and
          is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of
          any creatures which he hath made,<sup>e</sup> nor deriving any glory
          from them,<sup>f</sup> but only manifesting his own glory in, by,
          unto, and upon them: he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom,
          through whom, and to whom are all things;<sup>g</sup> and hath most
          sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them
          whatsoever himself pleaseth.<sup>h</sup> In his sight all things are
          open and manifest;<sup>i</sup> his knowledge is infinite, infallible,
          and independent upon the creature;<sup>k</sup> so as nothing is to him
          contingent or uncertain.<sup>l</sup> He is most holy in all his
          counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands.<sup>m</sup> To
          him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever
          worship, service, or obedience, as creatures, they owe unto the
          Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.<sup>n</sup>

<b>3.</b> In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one
          substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God
          the Holy Ghost.<sup>a</sup> The Father is of none, neither begotten
          nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father;<sup>b</sup>
          the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son.<sup>c</sup>
          Which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion
          with God, and comfortable dependence upon him.
