<h2>21. Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under
          the gospel consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the
          condemning wrath of God, the rigor and the curse of the law;<sup>a</sup>
          and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to
          Satan, and dominion of sin,<sup>b</sup> from the evil of afflictions,
          the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting
          damnation;<sup>c</sup> as also in their free access to God,<sup>d</sup>
          and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a
          child-like love and willing mind.<sup>e</sup> All which were common
          also to believers under the law for the substance of them;<sup>f</sup>
          but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further
          enlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, the
          whole legal administration of the covenant of grace, to which the
          Jewish Church was subjected;<sup>g</sup> and in greater boldness of
          access to the throne of grace,<sup>h</sup> and in fuller
          communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law
          did ordinarily partake of.<sup>i</sup>

        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> God alone is Lord of the conscience,<sup>a</sup> and hath
          left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in
          anything contrary to his Word, not contained in it; so that to believe
          such doctrines, or to obey such commands out of conscience, is to
          betray true liberty of conscience;<sup>c</sup> and the requiring of an
          implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy
          liberty of conscience, and reason also.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 14:4, James 4:12
          <br/>

          c: Psalm 5:1, Galatians 1:10, Galatians 2:4-5, Galatians 5:1,
          Colossians 2:20-23

          <br/>

          d: Isaiah 8:20, Jeremiah 8:9, Hosea 5:11, John 4:22, Acts 17:11,
          Romans 10:17, Romans 14:23, Revelation 13:12, Revelation 13:16-17
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> They who, upon pretense of Christian liberty, do practice
          any sin, or cherish any lust, as they do thereby pervert the main
          design of the grace of the gospel to their own destruction; so they
          wholly destroy the end of Christian liberty; which is, that, being
          delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord
          without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days
          of our life.<sup>a</sup>

          a: Luke 1:74-75, John 8:34, Galatians 5:13, 1 Peter 2:16, 2 Peter 2:19
