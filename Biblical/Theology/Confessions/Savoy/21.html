<h2>20. Of the Gospel, and of the Extent of the Grace Thereof</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The covenant of works being broken by sin, and made
          unprofitable unto life, God was pleased to give unto the elect the
          promise of Christ, the seed of the woman, as the means of calling
          them, and begetting in them faith and repentance: in this promise the
          gospel, as to the substance of it, was revealed, and was therein
          effectual for the conversion and salvation of sinners.
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed
          only in and by the Word of God; neither do the works of creation or
          providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of
          grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way; much less that
          men destitute of the revelation of him by the promise or gospel,
          should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or repentance.
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The revelation of the gospel unto sinners, made in divers
          times, and by sundry parts, with the addition of promises and precepts
          for the obedience required therein, as to the nations and persons to
          whom it is granted, is merely of the sovereign will and good pleasure
          of God, not being annexed by virtue of any promise to the due
          improvement of men's natural abilities, by virtue of common light
          received without it, which none ever did make or can so do. And
          therefore in all ages the preaching of the gospel hath been granted
          unto persons and nations, as to the extent or straitening of it, in
          great variety, according to the counsel of the will of God.
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Although the gospel be the only outward means of revealing
          Christ and saving grace, and is as such abundantly sufficient
          thereunto; yet that men who are dead in trespasses, may be born again,
          quickened or regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual,
          irresistible work of the Holy Ghost upon the whole soul, for the
          producing in them a new spiritual life, without which no other means
          are sufficient for their conversion unto God.
