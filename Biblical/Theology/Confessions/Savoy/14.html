<h2>13. Of Sanctification</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> They that are united to Christ, effectually called and
          regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them,
          through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection, are also
          further sanctified really and personally through the same virtue, by
          his Word and Spirit dwelling in them;<sup>b</sup> the dominion of the
          whole body of sin is destroyed,<sup>c</sup> and the several lusts
          thereof are more and more weakened and mortified,<sup>d</sup> and they
          more and more quickened and strengthened, in all saving graces,<sup>e</sup>
          to the practice of true holiness, without which no man shall see the
          Lord.<sup>f</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Acts 20:32, Romans 6:5-6, 1 Corinthians 6:11, Philippians 3:10
          <br/>
          b: John 17:17, Ephesians 5:26, 2 Thessalonians 2:13
          <br/>
          c: Romans 6:6, Romans 6:14
          <br/>
          d: Romans 8:13, Galatians 5:24
          <br/>
          e: Ephesians 3:16-19, Colossians 1:11
          <br/>
          f: 2 Corinthians 7:1, Hebrews 12:14
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> This sanctification is throughout in the whole man,<sup>a</sup>
          yet imperfect in this life; there abideth still some remnants of
          corruption in every part,<sup>b</sup> whence ariseth a continual and
          irreconcilable war, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the
          spirit against the flesh.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Thessalonians 5:23
          <br/>
          b: Romans 7:18, Romans 7:23, Philippians 3:12, 1 John 1:10
          <br/>
          c: Galatians 5:17, 1 Peter 2:11
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time
          may much prevail,<sup>a</sup> yet, through the continual supply of
          strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part
          doth overcome;<sup>b</sup> and so the saints grow in grace,<sup>c</sup>
          perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<sup>d</sup>

          b: Romans 6:14, Ephesians 4:15-16, 1 John 5:4
          <br/>
          c: 2 Corinthians 3:18, 2 Peter 3:18
          <br/>
          d: 2 Corinthians 7:1
