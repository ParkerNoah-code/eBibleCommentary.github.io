<h2>6. Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> God having made a covenant of works and life, thereupon,
          with our first parents and all their posterity in them, they being
          seduced by the subtlety and temptation of Satan did wilfully
          transgress the law of their creation, and break the covenant in eating
          the forbidden fruit.
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> By this sin they, and we in them, fell from their original
          righteousness and communion with God,<sup>a</sup> and so became dead
          in sin,<sup>b</sup> and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts
          of soul and body.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 3:6-8, Ecclesiastes 7:29, Romans 3:23
          <br/>
          b: Genesis 2:17, Ephesians 2:1
          <br/>
          c: Genesis 6:5, Jeremiah 17:9, Romans 3:10-19, Titus 1:15
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> They being the root, and by God's appointment standing
          in the room and stead of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was
          imputed,<sup>a</sup> and the same death in sin and corrupted nature
          conveyed to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary
          generation.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 1:27-28, Genesis 2:16-17, Acts 17:26, Romans 5:12, Romans
          5:15-19, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 1 Corinthians
          15:49

          <br/>
          b: Genesis 5:3, Job 14:4, Job 15:14, Psalm 51:5
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly
          indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good,<sup>a</sup> and
          wholly inclined to all evil,<sup>b</sup> do proceed all actual
          transgressions.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 5:6, Romans 7:18, Romans 8:7, Colossians 1:21
          <br/>
          b: Genesis 6:5, Genesis 8:21, Romans 3:10-12
          <br/>
          c: Matthew 15:19, Ephesians 2:2-3, James 1:14-15
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> This corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in
          those that are regenerated;<sup>a</sup> and although it be through
          Christ pardoned and mortified, yet both itself and all the motions
          thereof are truly and properly sin.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Proverbs 20:9, Ecclesiastes 7:20, Romans 7:14, Romans 7:17-18,
          Romans 7:23, James 3:2, 1 John 1:8, 1 John 1:10

          <br/>
          b: Romans 7:5, Romans 7:7-8, Romans 7:25, Galatians 5:17
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Every sin, both original and actual, being a transgression
          of the righteous law of God, and contrary thereunto,<sup>a</sup> doth,
          in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner,<sup>b</sup> whereby he
          is bound over to the wrath of God<sup>c</sup> and curse of the
          law,<sup>d</sup> and so made subject to death,<sup>e</sup> with all
          miseries spiritual,<sup>f</sup> temporal,<sup>g</sup> and eternal.<sup>h</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 John 3:4
          <br/>
          b: Romans 2:15, Romans 3:9, Romans 3:19
          <br/>
          c: Ephesians 2:3
          <br/>
          d: Galatians 3:10
          <br/>
          e: Romans 6:23

          f: Ephesians 4:18
          <br/>
          g: Lamentations 3:39, Romans 8:20
          <br/>
          h: Matthew 25:41, 2 Thessalonians 1:9
