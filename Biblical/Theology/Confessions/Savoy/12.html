<h2>11. Of Justification</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Those whom God effectually calleth he also freely
          justifieth;<sup>a</sup> not by infusing righteousness into them, but
          by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons
          as righteous: not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but
          for Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing faith itself, the act of
          believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their
          righteousness; but by imputing Christ's active obedience to the
          whole law, and passive obedience in his death for their whole and sole
          righteousness,<sup>b</sup> they receiving and resting on him and his
          righteousness by faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it is
          the gift of God.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 3:24, Romans 8:30
          <br/>

          b: Jeremiah 23:6, Romans 3:22, Romans 3:24-25, Romans 3:27-28, Romans
          4:5-8, Romans 5:17-19, 1 Corinthians 1:30-31, 2 Corinthians 5:19, 2
          Corinthians 5:21, Ephesians 1:7, Titus 3:5, Titus 3:7

          <br/>

          c: Acts 10:44, Acts 13:38-39, Galatians 2:16, Ephesians 2:7-8,
          Philippians 3:9
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his
          righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification;<sup>a</sup>
          yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied
          with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by
          love.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 1:12, Romans 3:28, Romans 5:1
          <br/>
          b: Galatians 5:6, James 2:17, James 2:22, James 2:26
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the
          debt of all those that are thus justified, and did by the sacrifice of
          himself, in the blood of his cross, undergoing in their stead the
          penalty due unto them make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to
          God's justice in their behalf.<sup>a</sup> Yet inasmuch as he was
          given by the Father for them,<sup>b</sup> and his obedience and
          satisfaction accepted in their stead,<sup>c</sup> and both freely, not
          for anything in them, their justification is only of free grace;<sup>d</sup>
          that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified
          in the justification of sinners.<sup>e</sup>

<p>
<b>4.</b> God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the
          elect,<sup>a</sup> and Christ did, in the fulness of time, die for
          their sins, and rise again for their justification:<sup>b</sup>
          nevertheless, they are not justified personally until the Holy Spirit
          doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Romans 8:30, Galatians 3:8, 1 Peter 1:2, 1 Peter 1:19-20
          <br/>
          b: Romans 4:25, Galatians 4:4, 1 Timothy 2:6
          <br/>
          c: Galatians 2:16, Colossians 1:21-22, Titus 3:4-7
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are
          justified;<sup>a</sup> and although they can never fall from the state
          of justification,<sup>b</sup> yet they may by their sins fall under
          God's fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his
          countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess
          their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Matthew 6:12, 1 John 1:7, 1 John 1:9, 1 John 2:1-2

          b: Luke 22:32, John 10:28, Hebrews 10:14

          1:20, 1 Corinthians 11:30, 1 Corinthians 11:32
        </p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> The justification of believers under the Old Testament was,
          in all these respects, one and the same with the justification of
          believers under the New Testament.<sup>a</sup>
