<h2>7. Of Godâ€™s Covenant with Man</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The distance between God and the creature is so great that
          although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their
          Creator, yet they could never have attained the reward of life but by
          some voluntary condescension on God's part, which he hath been
          pleased to express by way of covenant.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: 1 Samuel 2:25, Job 9:32-33, Job 22:2-3, Job 35:7-8, Psalm 100:2-3,
          Psalm 113:5-6, Isaiah 40:13-17, Luke 17:10, Acts 17:24-25
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The first covenant made with man was a covenant of
          works,<sup>a</sup> wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to
          his posterity,<sup>b</sup> upon condition of perfect and personal
          obedience.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Galatians 3:12
          <br/>
          b: Romans 5:12-20, Romans 10:5
          <br/>
          c: Genesis 2:17, Galatians 3:10
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by
          that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second,<sup>a</sup>
          commonly called the covenant of grace: wherein he freely offered unto
          sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in
          him that they may be saved,<sup>b</sup> and promising to give unto all
          those that are ordained unto life his Holy Spirit, to make them
          willing and able to believe.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Genesis 3:15, Isaiah 42:6, Romans 3:20-21, Romans 8:3, Galatians
          3:21

          <br/>
          b: Mark 16:15-16, John 3:16, Romans 10:6, Romans 10:9, Galatians 3:11
          <br/>
          c: Ezekiel 36:26-27, John 6:44-45
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in the
          Scripture by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of
          Jesus Christ the testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with
          all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Luke 22:20, 1 Corinthians 11:25, Hebrews 7:22, Hebrews 9:15-17</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Although this covenant hath been differently and variously
          administered in respect of ordinances and institutions in the time of
          the law, and since the coming of Christ in the flesh; yet for the
          substance and efficacy of it, to all its spiritual and saving ends, it
          is one and the same; upon the account of which various dispensations,
          it is called the Old and New Testament.
