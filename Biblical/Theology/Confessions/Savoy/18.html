<h2>17. Of The Perseverance of The Saints</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> They whom God hath accepted in his Beloved, effectually
          called and sanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally nor finally
          fall away from the state of grace; but shall certainly persevere
          therein to the end, and be eternally saved.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: John 10:28-29, Philippians 1:6, 1 Peter 1:5, 1 Peter 1:9, 2 Peter
          1:10, 1 John 3:9
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> This perseverance of the saints depends, not upon their own
          free will, but upon the immutability of the decree of election,
          flowing from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father;<sup>a</sup>
          upon the efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ, and
          union with him; the oath of God;<sup>b</sup> the abiding of the Spirit
          and of the seed of God within them;<sup>c</sup> and the nature of the
          covenant of grace:<sup>d</sup> from all which ariseth also the
          certainty and infallibility thereof.<sup>e</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Jeremiah 31:3, 2 Timothy 2:18-19
          <br/>

          b: Luke 22:32, John 17:11, John 17:24, Hebrews 7:25, Hebrews 9:12-15,
          Hebrews 10:10, Hebrews 10:14, Hebrews 13:20-21, Romans 8:33-39

          <br/>
          c: John 14:16-17, 1 John 2:27, 1 John 3:9
          <br/>
          d: Jeremiah 32:40
          <br/>
          e: John 10:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:3, 1 John 2:19
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> And though they may, through the temptations of Satan and of
          the world, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the
          neglect of the means of their preservation, fall into grievous
          sins;<sup>a</sup> and for a time continue therein:<sup>b</sup> whereby
          they incur God's displeasure,<sup>c</sup> and grieve his Holy
          Spirit;<sup>d</sup> come to have their graces and comforts impaired;
          have their hearts hardened,<sup>f</sup> and their consciences
          wounded;<sup>g</sup> hurt and scandalize others,<sup>h</sup> and bring
          temporal judgments upon themselves;<sup>i</sup> yet they are and shall
          be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.
