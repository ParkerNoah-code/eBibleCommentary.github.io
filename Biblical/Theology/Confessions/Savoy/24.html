<h2>23. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows</h2>
<p>
<b>1.</b> A lawful oath is a part of religious worship,<sup>a</sup>
          wherein the person swearing in truth, righteousness and judgment,
          solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserteth or promiseth; and to
          judge him according to the truth or falsehood of what he sweareth.<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Deuteronomy 10:20
          <br/>

          b: Exodus 20:7, Leviticus 19:12, 2 Chronicles 6:22-23, 2 Corinthians
          1:23
        </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear,
          and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence;<sup>a</sup>
          therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful
          name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be
          abhorred.<sup>b</sup> Yet as, in matters of weight and moment, an oath
          is warranted by the Word of God, under the New Testament, as well as
          under the Old,<sup>c</sup> so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful
          authority, in such matters ought to be taken.<sup>d</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Deuteronomy 6:13
          <br/>
          b: Exodus 20:7, Jeremiah 5:7, Matthew 5:34, Matthew 5:37, James 5:12
          <br/>
          c: Isaiah 65:16, 2 Corinthians 1:23, Hebrews 6:16
          <br/>
          d: 1 Kings 8:31, Ezra 10:25, Nehemiah 13:25
        </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Whosoever taketh an oath, warranted by the Word of God,
          ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and
          therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully persuaded is the
          truth.<sup>a</sup> Neither may any man bind himself by oath to
          anything but what is good and just, and what he believeth so to be,
          and what he is able and resolved to perform.<sup>b</sup> Yet it is a
          sin to refuse an oath touching anything that is good and just, being
          imposed by lawful authority.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Exodus 20:7, Jeremiah 4:2
          <br/>
          b: Genesis 24:2-3, Genesis 24:5-6, Genesis 24:8-9
          <br/>
          c: Exodus 22:7-11, Numbers 5:19, Numbers 5:21, Nehemiah 5:12
        </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the
          words, without equivocation or mental reservation.<sup>a</sup> It
          cannot oblige to sin; but in anything not sinful, being taken, it
          binds to performance, although to a man's own hurt:<sup>b</sup>
          nor is it to be violated, although made to heretics or infidels.<sup>c</sup>
</p>
<p>
          a: Psalm 24:4, Jeremiah 4:2
          <br/>
          b: 1 Samuel 25:22, 1 Samuel 25:32-34, Psalm 15:4
          <br/>
          c: Ezekiel 17:16, Ezekiel 17:18-19, Joshua 9:18-19, 2 Samuel 21:1
        </p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> A vow which is of the like nature with a promissory oath,
          and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed
          with the like faithfulness.<sup>a</sup>
</p>
<p>a: Isaiah 19:21, Psalm 61:8, Psalm 66:13-14, Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Popish monastical vows of perpetual single life, professed
          poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of
          higher perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in
          which no Christian may entangle himself.
