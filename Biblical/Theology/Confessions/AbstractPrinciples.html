          >When the original charter of The Southern Baptist Theological
          Seminary was adopted in 1858, it contained the following statement
          which continues as a part of the “fundamental laws.”</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Every professor of the institution shall be a member of a regular
        Baptist church; and all persons accepting professorships in this
        seminary shall be considered, by such acceptance, as engaging to teach
        in accordance with, and not contrary to, the Abstract of Principles
        hereinafter laid down, a departure from which principles on his part
        shall be considered grounds for his resignation or removal by the
        Trustees, to wit:
      </p>
      <h2>I. The Scriptures</h2>
      <p>
        The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration
        of God, and are the only sufficient, certain and authoritative rule of
        all saving knowledge, faith and obedience.
      </p>
      <h2>II. God</h2>
      <p>
        There is but one God, the Maker, Preserver and Ruler of all things,
        having in and of Himself, all perfections, and being infinite in them
        all; and to Him all creatures owe the highest love, reverence and
        obedience.
      </p>
      <h2>III. The Trinity</h2>
      <p>
        God is revealed to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit each with distinct
        personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence or being.
      </p>
      <h2>IV. Providence</h2>
      <p>
        God from eternity, decrees or permits all things that come to pass, and
        perpetually upholds, directs and governs all creatures and all events;
        yet so as not in any wise to be the author or approver of sin nor to
        destroy the free will and responsibility of intelligent creatures.
      </p>
      <h2>V. Election</h2>
      <p>
        Election is God’s eternal choice of some persons unto everlasting
        life-not because of foreseen merit in them, but of His mere mercy in
        Christ-in consequence of which choice they are called, justified and
        glorified.
      </p>
      <h2>VI. The Fall of Man</h2>
      <p>
        God originally created Man in His own image, and free from sin; but,
        through the temptation of Satan, he transgressed the command of God, and
        fell from his original holiness and righteousness; whereby his posterity
        inherit a nature corrupt and wholly opposed to God and His law, are
        under condemnation, and as soon as they are capable of moral action,
        become actual transgressors.
      </p>
      <h2>VII. The Mediator</h2>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, is the divinely appointed
        mediator between God and man. Having taken upon Himself human nature,
        yet without sin, He perfectly fulfilled the law; suffered and died upon
        the cross for the salvation of sinners. He was buried, and rose again
        the third day, and ascended to His Father, at whose right hand He ever
        liveth to make intercession for His people. He is the only Mediator, the
        Prophet, Priest and King of the Church, and Sovereign of the Universe.
      </p>
      <h2>VIII. Regeneration</h2>
      <p>
        Regeneration is a change of heart, wrought by the Holy Spirit, who
        quickeneth the dead in trespasses and sins enlightening their minds
        spiritually and savingly to understand the Word of God, and renewing
        their whole nature, so that they love and practice holiness. It is a
        work of God’s free and special grace alone.
      </p>
      <h2>IX. Repentance</h2>
      <p>
        Repentance is an evangelical grace, wherein a person being by the Holy
        Spirit, made sensible of the manifold evil of his sin, humbleth himself
        for it, with godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrence, with
        a purpose and endeavor to walk before God so as to please Him in all
        things.
      </p>
      <h2>X. Faith</h2>
      <p>
        Saving faith is the belief, on God’s authority, of whatsoever is
        revealed in His Word concerning Christ; accepting and resting upon Him
        alone for justification and eternal life. It is wrought in the heart by
        the Holy Spirit, and is accompanied by all other saving graces, and
        leads to a life of holiness.
      </p>
      <h2>XI. Justification</h2>
      <p>
        Justification is God’s gracious and full acquittal of sinners, who
        believe in Christ, from all sin, through the satisfaction that Christ
        has made; not for anything wrought in them or done by them; but on
        account of the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, they receiving and
        resting on Him and His righteousness by faith.
      </p>
      <h2>XII. Sanctification</h2>
      <p>
        Those who have been regenerated are also sanctified by God’s word and
        Spirit dwelling in them. This sanctification is progressive through the
        supply of Divine strength, which all saints seek to obtain, pressing
        after a heavenly life in cordial obedience to all Christ’s commands.
      </p>
      <h2>XIII. Perseverance of the Saints</h2>
      <p>
        Those whom God hath accepted in the Beloved, and sanctified by His
        Spirit, will never totally nor finally fall away from the state of
        grace, but shall certainly persevere to the end; and though they may
        fall through neglect and temptation, into sin, whereby they grieve the
        Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, bring reproach on the Church,
        and temporal judgments on themselves, yet they shall be renewed again
        unto repentance, and be kept by the power of God through faith unto
        salvation.
      </p>
      <h2>XIV. The Church</h2>
      <p>
        The Lord Jesus is the head of the Church, which is composed of all His
        true disciples, and in Him is invested supremely all power for its
        government. According to His commandment, Christians are to associate
        themselves into particular societies or churches; and to each of these
        churches He hath given needful authority for administering that order,
        discipline and worship which He hath appointed. The regular officers of
        a Church are Bishops or Elders, and Deacons.
      </p>
      <h2>XV. Baptism</h2>
      <p>
        Baptism is an ordinance of the Lord Jesus, obligatory upon every
        believer, wherein he is immersed in water in the name of the Father, and
        of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, as a sign of his fellowship with the
        death and resurrection of Christ, of remission of sins, and of giving
        himself up to God, to live and walk in newness of life. It is
        prerequisite to church fellowship, and to participation in the Lord’s
        Supper.
      </p>
      <h2>XVI. The Lord’s Supper</h2>
      <p>
        The Lord’s Supper is an ordinance of Jesus Christ, to be administered
        with the elements of bread and wine, and to be observed by His churches
        till the end of the world. It is in no sense a sacrifice, but is
        designed to commemorate His death, to confirm the faith and other graces
        of Christians, and to be a bond, pledge and renewal of their communion
        with Him, and of their church fellowship.
      </p>
      <h2>XVII. The Lord’s Day</h2>
      <p>
        The Lord’s Day is a Christian institution for regular observance, and
        should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both
        public and private, resting from worldly employments and amusements,
        works of necessity and mercy only excepted.
      </p>
      <h2>XVIII. Liberty of Conscience</h2>
      <p>
        God alone is Lord of the conscience; and He hath left it free from the
        doctrines and commandments of men, which are in anything contrary to His
        word, or not contained in it. Civil magistrates being ordained of God,
        subjection in all lawful things commanded by them ought to be yielded by
        us in the Lord, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
      </p>
      <h2>XIX. The Resurrection</h2>
      <p>
        The bodies of men after death return to dust, but their spirits return
        immediately to God-the righteous to rest with Him; the wicked, to be
        reserved under darkness to the judgment. At the last day, the bodies of
        all the dead, both just and unjust, will be raised.
      </p>
      <h2>XX. The Judgment</h2>
      <p>
        God hath appointed a day, wherein He will judge the world by Jesus
        Christ, when every one shall receive according to his deeds; the wicked
        shall go into everlasting punishment; the righteous, into everlasting
        life.
