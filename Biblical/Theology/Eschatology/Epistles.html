      <h1>Pauline Epistles</h1>
      <h2>Romans 6:23 // 1:32 // 5:21 // 8:13 // John 6:50 // 11:25-26</h2>
      <p>
        "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life
        in Christ Jesus our Lord."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill
          the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body
          in Gehenna." (Mat 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone turns
          him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of
          his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of
          sins" (Jam 5:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is the second death, the lake of fire. If anyone was not found
          written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire." (Rev
          20:14-15).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The first death refers to physical death. Man can physically kill you,
        but your spirit lives on. The second death refers to spiritual death,
        death of body and soul. Only God can finally put someone to death in
        that ultimate way.
      </p>

      <h2>Romans 9:22-23</h2>
      <p>
        "What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known,
        endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
        and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of
        mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory"

      <h2>1 Corinthians 15:23-26</h2>
      <p>
        "But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are
        Christ’s at his coming. Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the
        Kingdom to God the Father, when he will have abolished all rule and all
        authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies
        under his feet. The last enemy that will be abolished is death."
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument has been made that because death is "swallowed up in
        victory" when the dead are raised, everyone must raised be immortal.
        This flies in the face of Revelation 20:14 in which God's enemies suffer
        the second death on judgment day. If all death is destroyed, then there
        can be no eternal punishment and all must be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this misses the distinction between the first and second death.
        The traditionalist interprets the first death as separation of soul from
        body and the second death as separation of soul and body from God. The
        conditionalist interprets the first death as death of body and the
        second death as death of soul and body. It follows that 1 Corinthians
        15:26 is only about the abolishment of the first death so the
        unrighteous will still face the second death or else one must deny the
        second death and therefore deny eternal punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also not necessary to see the chronology this way. It is
        reasonable to assume that God could destroy the last enemy at the second
        coming when the dead are raised, the saints are made immortal, and God's
        enemies are judged. When the last enemy is defeated, God's enemies are
        gone and no more death will take place. Then death will have been
        defeated. After all, these events are all happening on judgment day.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should also be noted that God's enemies and death suffer the same
        fate of the second death in the lake of fire. We know that death is
        abolished, destroyed, and annihilated, so God's enemies will be
        abolished, destroyed, and annihilated.

      <h2>Philippians 3:19 // 1:28</h2>
      <p>
        "whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in
        their shame, who think about earthly things."
      </p>

      <h2>2 Thessalonians 1:9 // 2:8</h2>
      <p>
        "who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord
        and from the glory of his might"
      </p>
      <p>
        Verses 7-8 provide important context: "when the Lord Jesus is revealed
        from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, punishing those who
        don’t know God." This is a clear reference to Isaiah 66:15: "For,
        behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the
        whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with
        flames of fire." It goes on to say, "For Yahweh will execute judgment by
        fire and by his sword on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be
        many." (Isa 66:16).
      </p>
      <p>
        Eternal indicates that this destruction will never be reversed. The
        unrighteous will be eternally destroyed. Whether this destruction arises
        directly from an act of the Lord as this verse seems to indicate, or
        whether it stems from a definitive and complete separation from God, the
        fountain of life, the outcome is the same; the result is that "Yahweh
        will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh; and those
        slain by Yahweh will be many... They will go out, and look at the dead
        bodies of the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will
        not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to
        all mankind." (Isa 66:16, 24).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "A senseless man doesn’t know, neither does a fool understand this:
          though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers
          flourish, they will be destroyed forever. But you, Yahweh, are on high
          forever more. For behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for behold, your
          enemies shall perish." (Ps 92:6-9).

        future punishment. There is no other death which the soul is in danger
        of dying... This passage proves, then, that there is a death which the
        soul may die; that there is a condition which may properly be called
        death as a consequence of sin; and that the soul will suffer that unless
        it is converted."

        (1882), James 5:20: "The soul is obviously that of the sinner who is
        converted. Death, bodily and spiritual, would be the outcome of the
        error if he were left alone, and in being rescued from the error he is
        therefore saved also from death."

      <h2>2 Peter 2:5 // Jude 1:5</h2>

        "and didn’t spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven

        world of the ungodly,"
      </p>
      <p>
        The flood which destroyed the whole world and killed everyone in it
        except Noah and his family is given as an example of the final judgment.
        God destroys sinners and annihilates their way of life. In the
        traditional view, God makes sinners immortal and allows them to sin for
        eternity. In the conditionalist view, sinners and all of their works of
        wickness will be destroyed and perish. God puts a full end to sin and
        evil.

        that means 'ashes'. <em>tefroo</em> means to 'ashify', or to put it into
        more normal English, 'to turn something into ashes'... The use of the
        words <em>katakaio</em>, <em>tefroo</em>, and similar words is not at

        In the parallel passage, Peter uses the word Tartarus, the equivalent of

        being held in Tartarus for the judgment day. This verse says nothing
        about the final judgment itself, and it isn't even about humans.

        fire functions as an example because it is a type or anticipation of
        what is to come for all those who reject God. The destruction of Sodom
        and Gomorrah is not merely a historical curiosity; it functions
        typologically as a prophecy of what is in store for the rebellious. The
