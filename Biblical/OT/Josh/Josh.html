  <h1>Joshua</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Book of Joshua is the sixth book in the Old Testament, immediately
    following the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible). It chronicles
    the Israelites' conquest of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, Moses'
    successor. The book begins with God's command to Joshua to lead the people
    across the Jordan River and into the Promised Land, and it details the
    various battles and challenges the Israelites faced as they sought to claim
    the territory God had promised them. Throughout the book, themes of
    obedience, faith, and God's faithfulness to His promises are emphasized, as
    the Israelites learn to trust in God's power and provision. The book
    concludes with the division of the conquered land among the tribes of Israel
    and Joshua's final exhortations to the people to remain faithful to God.
