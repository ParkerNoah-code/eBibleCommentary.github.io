        <h1>Incarnation</h1>
        <h2>God Sent His Son to Save Us</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospel of John encapsulates the mystery and majesty of the
          Incarnation: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We
          have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the
          Father, full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). This verse affirms the
          core Christian belief that Jesus Christ is both fully divine and fully
          human, bridging the infinite gap between God and humanity to bring
          redemption.
        </p>

        <h2>The Trinity and Incarnation</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation are inseparably
          linked. The Trinity reveals that Jesus, as the Son, is fully divine,
          while the Incarnation asserts that this divine Son also became fully
          human. Together, these doctrines affirm the complete reality of Jesus
          Christ as Savior. He came from the Father to bear the sins of humanity
          on the cross, fulfilling the Father's will (Matt. 20:28; John 3:13–17;
          Rom. 5:8; Phil. 2:5–8).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Church's understanding of these doctrines developed over
          centuries. The Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325) affirmed the full divinity
          of Jesus by declaring Him "of one substance" with the Father. This
          countered the Arian heresy, which viewed Jesus as a created being. The
          Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) later clarified the doctrine of the
          Incarnation, rejecting both Nestorianism, which saw Jesus as two
          persons, and Eutychianism, which conflated His divine and human
          natures. The Chalcedonian formula established that Jesus is one person
          with two distinct natures—divine and human—united without confusion or
          division.
        </p>

        <h2>The Witness of the New Testament</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament presents the Incarnation as the central miracle of
          Christianity. Eight of its nine authors, all steeped in the Jewish
          belief in one God, proclaim that Jesus is both God and man. They
          depict Him as the Messiah, fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies
          (Isa. 11:1–5), and as Prophet, Priest, and King—roles that define His
          mission to teach, atone, and reign.
        </p>
        <p>
          John's Gospel emphasizes Jesus' deity with its prologue, declaring Him
          as the eternal Word (Logos), the agent of creation, and the source of
          grace and truth (John 1:1–18). The "I am" statements of Jesus echo the
          divine name revealed in Exodus 3:14, underscoring His claim to
          divinity (e.g., John 6:35; 8:58; 11:25). Thomas's confession, "My Lord
          and my God" (John 20:28), serves as a climactic acknowledgment of
          Jesus' divine nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Paul's Theology of the Incarnation</h2>
        <p>
          Paul provides profound insights into the Incarnation, describing Jesus
          as the image of the invisible God and the agent of creation (Col.
          1:15–17). He asserts that the "fullness of the Deity" dwells in Christ
          bodily (Col. 2:9) and that Jesus humbled Himself to take on human
          nature and die on the cross (Phil. 2:5–8). Paul also acknowledges
          Jesus as "God over all" (Rom. 9:5) and "our great God and Savior"
          (Titus 2:13), affirming His divine identity and redemptive mission.
        </p>

        <h2>The Writer to the Hebrews</h2>
        <p>
          The author of Hebrews emphasizes the dual nature of Christ in the
          context of His high priesthood. He is fully divine, sustaining the
          universe by His power, and fully human, sharing in our weaknesses and
          temptations (Heb. 1:3; 2:14–17). The union of divinity and humanity in
          Jesus is essential for His role as mediator, making His priesthood
          unique and effective (Heb. 7:13–28).
        </p>

        <h2>Peter's Testimony</h2>
        <p>
          Peter echoes the high Christology of the New Testament, applying Old
          Testament references to Yahweh directly to Jesus. For instance, he
          exhorts believers to "set apart Christ as Lord" (1 Pet. 3:15),
          aligning with Isaiah's command to honor the Lord as holy (Isa.
          8:12–13). This identification of Jesus with Yahweh highlights the
          early church's conviction of His divine nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Worship and the Incarnation</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament consistently forbids the worship of angels and
          emphasizes that worship belongs solely to Jesus Christ, the
          divine-human Savior (Col. 2:18; Rev. 22:8–9). Faith, hope, and love
          are centered on Him as the proper object of devotion. Any religion
          that neglects these truths about Jesus falls outside the bounds of
          authentic Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incarnation remains a profound mystery, yet it is the cornerstone
          of the Christian faith. It reveals God's love and commitment to redeem
          humanity by sending His Son to dwell among us, full of grace and
          truth.
