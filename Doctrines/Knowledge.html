        <h1>The Nature of True Knowledge of God</h1>
        <h2>False Knowledge and Gnosticism</h2>
        <p>
          In 1 Timothy 6:20–21, Paul warns against “what is falsely called
          knowledge,” a reference to proto-Gnostic teachings that emerged fully
          in the second century A.D. These teachings urged believers to move
          beyond their Christian faith toward an esoteric “knowledge” that
          promised spiritual enlightenment. However, such knowledge devalued the
          material world, regarded the body as a prison for the soul, and
          offered mystical practices and secret insights as the path to
          spiritual fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gnostic teachers redefined Jesus as merely a supernatural teacher,
          denying both His Incarnation and His Atonement. They replaced His call
          to holy living with either asceticism or licentiousness. Paul’s
          letters to Timothy, along with writings by Jude, Peter, and John,
          explicitly reject these heretical beliefs and practices (e.g., 1 Tim.
          4:1–7; Jude 4, 8–19; 2 Peter 2; 1 John 4:1–6). These epistles affirm
          the centrality of Christ’s person and work, the integrity of creation,
          and the transformative power of true faith.
        </p>

        <h2>Knowing God Through Faith</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture presents “knowing” God as the ideal for the spiritual
          person. This knowledge arises from a faith-relationship that brings
          salvation, eternal life, and produces love, hope, obedience, and joy.
          As Jeremiah 9:24 states, true boasting lies in understanding and
          knowing God, who delights in kindness, justice, and righteousness.
          Knowing God involves intellectual, volitional, and moral dimensions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Intellectual:</strong> Understanding the truth about God’s
            nature and works (Deut. 7:9; Ps. 100:3).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Volitional:</strong> Trusting, obeying, and worshiping God
            based on that truth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Moral:</strong> Living out justice, love, and righteousness
            in one’s life (Jer. 22:16; 1 John 4:7–8).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Faith-knowledge centers on Jesus Christ, the incarnate God and
          mediator between humanity and the Father. Through Christ, believers
          come to know God as their Father, seeking deeper knowledge of Christ
          and His power (John 14:6; Phil. 3:8–14).
        </p>

        <h2>The Fruit of Regeneration and Illumination</h2>
        <p>
          True knowledge of God is the fruit of regeneration, in which God
          bestows a new heart (Jer. 24:7; 1 John 5:20), and illumination by the
          Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 4:6; Eph. 1:17). This knowledge creates a
          reciprocal relationship between God and His people: we know God as our
          own because He knows us as His (John 10:14; Gal. 4:9; 2 Tim. 2:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          All Scripture has been given to facilitate this knowledge-relationship
          with God. Believers are called to labor in studying and applying
          Scripture to grow in their understanding of and communion with God,
          fulfilling its ultimate purpose.
