        <h1>General Revelation: God's Power and Majesty Made Known</h1>
        <h2>The Evident Reality of the Creator</h2>
        <p>
          The natural world is not a barrier obscuring God’s existence but a
          vivid declaration of His power and majesty. As Psalm 19:1 states, “The
          heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His
          hands.” This truth is further affirmed by Paul in Romans 1:19–21,
          where he declares that God’s eternal power and divine nature are
          clearly seen in creation, leaving humanity without excuse. In Acts
          17:28, Paul even cites a Greek poet to emphasize humanity’s divine
          origin. Moreover, God’s goodness is evident in His providential care
          (Acts 14:17; Romans 2:4), while His moral law is inscribed on every
          human conscience (Romans 2:14–15). Even the certainty of future
          judgment is universally known (Romans 1:32). These truths constitute
          the essence of general revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          General revelation, so called because it is universally available, has
          been present since the beginning of human history. Every human being
          receives this revelation simply by existing in God’s world. It reveals
          God’s power, praiseworthiness, and moral authority, leaving no one
          with a valid excuse for failing to acknowledge and serve Him.
          According to Paul’s indictment in Romans 1:18–3:19, the entire human
          race is guilty before God for willfully suppressing this truth in
          unrighteousness.
        </p>

        <h2>From General Revelation to Special Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          While general revelation declares God’s existence and moral claim, it
          is limited in scope. God has provided a fuller revelation of Himself
          as the Savior of sinners through Jesus Christ. This special or
          specific revelation is given in historical events, recorded in
          Scripture, and centers on the redemptive work of Christ. Special
          revelation not only reiterates the truths found in general revelation
          but also expands upon them, offering explicit teachings about God’s
          nature, purposes, and plan for salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special revelation enables believers to recognize God’s glory in the
          natural order, historical events, and human existence. As John Calvin
          aptly described, the world becomes a "theatre of the glory of God,"
          where every aspect of creation points to its Creator. Special
          revelation, therefore, opens the eyes of believers to see the fullness
          of God’s majesty, which is evident yet veiled in general revelation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Implications of General Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          General revelation holds profound theological significance. It
          underscores humanity’s accountability before God, as every individual
          possesses an innate awareness of His power and moral authority.
          Denials of this knowledge, according to Scripture, are insincere and
          self-deceptive. This universal revelation forms the foundation for
          God’s judgment, as it demonstrates that humanity’s failure to honor
          and thank the Creator is willful rebellion against clear evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, general revelation is not sufficient for salvation. Its
          purpose is to reveal God’s existence, power, and moral claims,
          preparing the way for the acceptance of special revelation through the
          Gospel. Only in Christ is the full knowledge of God’s grace and the
          way of salvation revealed, offering hope to a world otherwise
          condemned by its rejection of general revelation.
