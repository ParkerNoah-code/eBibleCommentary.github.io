        <h1>We Are Not Set Free to Sin</h1>
        <h2>The Concept of Antinomianism</h2>
        <p>
          Antinomianism, meaning "anti-law," refers to several views that deny
          the direct authority of God’s law in the lives of Christians. This
          theological stance has manifested in various forms throughout history,
          each presenting a different view on how or whether God’s moral law
          should apply to believers. Some argue that the law no longer applies
          at all, while others distort the concept of freedom in Christ, leading
          to the false belief that Christians are free to live in sin without
          consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          John’s epistle directly counters antinomianism by stressing that “he
          who does what is right is righteous, just as he [Christ] is righteous”
          (1 John 3:7). This clearly indicates that a life of righteousness,
          characterized by obedience to God’s law, is the mark of a true
          believer. Those who claim to be in Christ but continue in sin are
          deceiving themselves. True salvation in Christ results in a
          transformed life, one that strives to live according to God’s moral
          law, not to dismiss it.
        </p>

        <h2>Forms of Antinomianism</h2>
        <p>
          Several forms of antinomianism have emerged, each with a different
          interpretation of the relationship between grace, salvation, and the
          law.
        </p>
        <h3>Dualistic Antinomianism</h3>
        <p>
          Dualistic antinomianism is the belief that salvation is solely for the
          soul, with the physical body and behavior being irrelevant to God.
          This view, espoused by Gnostic heretics as condemned by Jude and Peter
          (Jude 4–19; 2 Pet. 2), allows for sinful behavior without moral
          consequence, arguing that bodily actions are separate from spiritual
          health. This view directly contradicts biblical teaching, which holds
          that both the soul and body are to be redeemed and transformed.
        </p>

        <h3>Spirit-Centered Antinomianism</h3>
        <p>
          Spirit-centered antinomianism emphasizes the internal prompting of the
          Holy Spirit, leading to the belief that the law is unnecessary as a
          guide for Christian conduct. This view assumes that freedom from the
          law as a means of salvation also frees believers from the moral
          directives of the law. However, the Bible clearly teaches that the
          Spirit guides believers to live in accordance with God’s revealed
          will, which is contained in Scripture (1 Cor. 14:37).
        </p>

        <h3>Christ-Centered Antinomianism</h3>
        <p>
          Christ-centered antinomianism teaches that because believers are in
          Christ, who has kept the law on their behalf, they need not concern
          themselves with obedience to the law. The logic is that Christ’s
          righteousness is imputed to them, and therefore their actions do not
          matter as long as they continue to believe. However, 1 John 3:4–10
          refutes this, teaching that those who are truly in Christ will not
          continue to live in sin. The evidence of salvation is not just belief,
          but a transformed life marked by righteousness.
        </p>

        <h3>Dispensational Antinomianism</h3>
        <p>
          Dispensational antinomianism teaches that the moral law is no longer
          necessary for Christians since they live under a dispensation of grace
          rather than the law. This view undermines the continuity of God’s
          moral law across dispensations, but the New Testament clearly affirms
          that law-keeping remains a responsibility of Christians (Romans 3:31;
          1 Cor. 6:9–11). Paul explicitly states that he is not free from God’s
          law but is under Christ’s law (1 Cor. 9:21).
        </p>

        <h3>Dialectical Antinomianism</h3>
        <p>
          Dialectical antinomianism, advanced by theologians like Barth and
          Brunner, denies that biblical law is a direct command of God,
          suggesting that the imperative statements in Scripture are merely
          triggers for the Holy Spirit's present-day utterances. This view
          diminishes the authority of Scripture as God's inspired word,
          undermining the reliability of the Bible’s moral law as a guide for
          Christian living.
        </p>

        <h3>Situationist Antinomianism</h3>
        <p>
          Situationist antinomianism argues that the only requirement for
          Christians is to act out of love, with the belief that the specific
          commands of Scripture, including the Ten Commandments, are flexible
          rules that can be disregarded if love calls for it. However, Romans
          13:8–10 teaches that love fulfills the law, not by disregarding it,
          but by fulfilling its commands in the right spirit. The view that the
          law is optional leads to a misunderstanding of love and a lack of
          respect for God's moral guidelines.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of the Moral Law</h2>
        <p>
          The moral law, as expressed in the Ten Commandments and throughout
          Scripture, is one coherent law, intended to be a guide for God’s
          people in every age. Repentance involves not only turning from sin but
          also a commitment to follow God's law with the help of the Holy
          Spirit. The Spirit empowers believers to keep God’s law and become
          more like Christ, the perfect law-keeper (Matt. 5:17). Scripture holds
          that salvation is not for those who live in sin but for those who are
          committed to turning from sin and seeking righteousness (1 Cor.
          6:9–11; Rev. 21:8).
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Importance of Law in Christian Life</h2>
        <p>
          While believers are saved by grace and not by works, this grace does
          not free them from the responsibility of obeying God's law. Salvation
          brings a new heart that desires to live according to God's will, and
          the law is a necessary guide in that process. Antinomianism, in all
          its forms, distorts the freedom that Christ offers by excusing sin and
          neglecting the call to holiness. True Christian freedom is the freedom
          to live in obedience to God, empowered by the Holy Spirit, and
          reflecting Christ’s righteousness in all aspects of life.
