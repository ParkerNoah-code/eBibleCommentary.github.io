        <h1>Salvation is by Grace Through Faith</h1>
        <h2>The Doctrine of Justification</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrine of justification is central to the Christian faith,
          particularly in the teachings of the Apostle Paul. For Paul,
          justification is not merely a theological idea but the very heart of
          the gospel. In his letters, especially in Romans and Galatians, Paul
          emphasizes that justification is God's act of declaring sinners
          righteous, not on the basis of their works but through faith in Jesus
          Christ (Rom. 3:21–5:21; Gal. 2:15–5:1). This doctrine was the
          cornerstone of the Reformation, shaping both the theology and life of
          countless Christians for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justification is a judicial act by God in which He pardons sinners,
          accepts them as just, and restores their estranged relationship with
          Himself. This act is a gift from God, made possible through the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ. Paul speaks of this gift of
          righteousness as something that is bestowed upon believers because of
          Jesus' obedience and His sacrificial death on their behalf (2 Cor.
          5:21). Justification, therefore, is not based on human merit but on
          Christ's merit alone.
        </p>

        <h2>The Basis of Justification: The Righteousness of Christ</h2>
        <p>
          At first glance, the concept of God declaring sinners righteous might
          seem unjust, as it appears to contradict God's own law, which demands
          justice and punishment for sin (Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15). However,
          God's declaration of righteousness is entirely just because it is
          grounded in the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Jesus, as the "last
          Adam" (1 Cor. 15:45), fulfilled the law perfectly on behalf of
          humanity and endured the punishment for sin that humanity deserved.
          This is what Paul refers to as the "merit" of Christ's work—His
          righteousness is credited to those who have faith in Him (Rom.
          5:18–19).
        </p>
        <p>
          This concept of justification is not merely a future event but is
          applied in the present. It is as though the final judgment of God,
          where our eternal destiny is determined, is brought into the present
          moment. Once declared justified, believers are eternally secure in
          their relationship with God. This judgment, which is final and
          unchangeable, ensures that the believer's salvation is secure (Rom.
          5:1–5; 8:30).
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of Faith in Justification</h2>
        <p>
          The means by which justification is received is faith in Jesus Christ.
          As Paul teaches in Romans 4:23–25, justification is through faith in
          the crucified and risen Christ. It is not by works or human effort but
          by placing personal faith in Christ that believers are justified
          before God. This faith is not a passive acknowledgment of facts but an
          active, trustful reliance on Christ's finished work on the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          The act of faith can be understood as "closing with Christ," where a
          believer embraces Jesus as both Savior and Lord. In doing so, they
          receive the righteousness of Christ, and through this divine exchange,
          they are pardoned and accepted by God (Gal. 2:15–16; 3:24). Faith,
          therefore, is the instrumental cause of justification, the means
          through which God's grace is applied to the individual.
        </p>

        <h2>The Catholic View of Justification</h2>
        <p>
          Official Roman Catholic theology, in contrast, defines justification
          as a process rather than a one-time event. It teaches that
          justification is not only a declaration of righteousness but also
          includes sanctification, which is an ongoing transformation in the
          life of the believer. While faith is seen as necessary for
          justification, Catholicism asserts that works of satisfaction and
          merit, such as those achieved through the sacraments (especially
          baptism and penance), contribute to a person's justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Catholic understanding of justification involves a system of
          "congruous merit," wherein works done in cooperation with God's grace
          are deemed fitting for God to reward with further grace. In this view,
          believers do not have absolute assurance of salvation and must
          continually seek to earn God's grace through participation in the
          sacramental system of the Church. This teaching stands in stark
          contrast to Paul's gospel of grace alone through faith alone, which
          assures believers that salvation is entirely the work of Christ and
          cannot be earned or merited by human effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Justification by Grace Alone</h2>
        <p>
          In summary, the doctrine of justification affirms that salvation is a
          gift from God, granted through faith in Jesus Christ. This
          justification is based entirely on Christ's righteousness and is
          received by faith alone. It is not a process or something that can be
          earned through works, but rather a declaration by God that the
          believer is in right standing with Him. This doctrine is the
          foundation of the Christian hope, ensuring that believers are
          eternally secure in their relationship with God, all because of
          Christ's finished work on their behalf. The contrasting view of
          justification, as taught by the Roman Catholic Church, fundamentally
          changes the nature of the gospel and introduces uncertainty into the
          believer's relationship with God. For Paul and for the Reformation,
          the gospel is clear: salvation is by grace through faith alone.
