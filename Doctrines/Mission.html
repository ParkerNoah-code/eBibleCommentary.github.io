        <h1>Christ Sends the Church Into the World</h1>
        <h2>The Command to Go</h2>
        <p>
          In John 20:21, Jesus declares, "Peace be with you! As the Father has
          sent me, I am sending you." This statement captures the essence of the
          Christian mission: the church is sent into the world to fulfill a
          purpose that aligns with Christ’s own mission. The Latin word
          "missio," meaning "sending," forms the foundation for the Christian
          concept of mission. Just as the Father sent Jesus into the world to
          reveal His truth and offer salvation, so too are believers called to
          carry that message to the world. Every Christian, every local
          congregation, and the universal church are all part of this divine
          sending and have a role to play in God's plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The task entrusted to the church is twofold: it involves both
          proclamation and compassionate action. The church is to bear witness
          to Christ and His redemptive work in the world, and it is also called
          to engage in acts of mercy and neighbor-love, demonstrating the power
          of the gospel through tangible deeds of kindness.
        </p>

        <h2>Proclaiming the Gospel: The First Task</h2>
        <p>
          The primary responsibility of the church is to make disciples of all
          nations, to baptize them, and to teach them to obey everything Christ
          has commanded (Matt. 28:19–20). This charge includes spreading the
          good news of Jesus Christ, proclaiming His identity as the incarnate
          Son of God, Lord, and Savior, and inviting all people to turn to
          Christ in repentance and faith. The gospel message is to be preached
          everywhere, offering God’s invitation to find life in Jesus. This is
          the central task of the church, modeled by the Apostle Paul in his own
          ministry of evangelism and church planting across the Roman world
          (Rom. 1:14; 1 Cor. 9:19–23).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus, while anticipating a global mission, also focused His earthly
          ministry on "the lost sheep of Israel" (Matt. 15:24). His message
          began with the Jewish people, but it was always intended to extend to
          the Gentiles. The Apostle Paul, in fulfilling his calling as the
          apostle to the Gentiles, first went to the Jews in every city where he
          preached, underscoring the importance of sharing the gospel with the
          Jewish people (Acts 13:5, 42–48; 14:1–7; 16:13; Rom. 1:16).
        </p>

        <h2>Mercy and Compassion: The Second Task</h2>
        <p>
          Alongside the proclamation of the gospel, Christians are called to
          practice mercy and compassion toward others. This neighbor-love, as
          demonstrated by Jesus in His own ministry, is an integral part of the
          mission. Jesus healed the sick, fed the hungry, and showed compassion
          for the marginalized (Matt. 9:36; 15:32; Mark 1:41; Luke 7:13). As
          followers of Christ, Christians are called to emulate this example by
          responding to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of those
          around them. Acts of mercy serve as a powerful witness to the
          transformative power of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This dual mission of word and deed is essential. The church must
          proclaim the message of salvation and live out that message through
          loving actions. If Christians fail to live out the love they proclaim,
          the credibility of the gospel is undermined. However, when Christians
          demonstrate Christ’s love through compassionate actions, it gives
          credibility to their words and leads others to glorify God (Matt.
          5:16; 1 Pet. 2:11–12). Good works should be visible and reflect the
          grace that has been shown to them.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mission of the Church: A Global Task</h2>
        <p>
          The mission of the church is universal in scope, intended for all
          peoples. While Jesus' ministry was focused on Israel, He also
          envisioned the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles (Matt. 24:14; John
          10:16; 12:32). The church’s mission continues to be global in its
          reach. However, this global mission must also honor the divine
          appointment of the Jewish people as the first recipients of the
          gospel. Christian Jews, while freed from ceremonial law, retain their
          cultural heritage and should not be expected to abandon their Jewish
          identity. The belief that Jewish Christians should forgo their
          Jewishness in favor of a purely Gentile identity is a cultural
          prejudice with no biblical foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Fulfilling the Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The church is sent into the world on the king’s business, with the
          charge to make disciples, to proclaim Christ, and to demonstrate His
          love through acts of mercy and compassion. Both aspects of this
          mission—evangelism and service—are essential in fulfilling the Great
          Commission. Christians are called to be faithful witnesses of the
          gospel, showing through their lives the power of Christ to transform
          the world. As they fulfill this mission, they participate in the
          ongoing work of God's kingdom, bringing glory to His name.
