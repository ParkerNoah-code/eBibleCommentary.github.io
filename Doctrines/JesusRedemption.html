        <h1>Jesus Christ Died for God’s Elect</h1>
        <h2>The Doctrine of Definite Redemption</h2>
        <p>
          Definite redemption, also known as “particular redemption” or “limited
          atonement,” articulates the purpose and scope of Christ’s sacrificial
          death. This Reformed doctrine holds that Christ’s death effectively
          and decisively atoned for the sins of God’s elect, ensuring their
          salvation through faith, regeneration, and glorification. While it
          affirms the infinite worth of Christ’s sacrifice and the universal
          offer of the Gospel (Rev. 22:17), definite redemption emphasizes that
          the atonement was intended to be efficacious specifically for those
          chosen by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine stands in contrast to two alternative views:
          universalism, which claims that Christ’s death guarantees salvation
          for all, and hypothetical universalism, which posits that Christ’s
          death made salvation possible for everyone but requires a response of
          faith that is not guaranteed. Definite redemption asserts an atonement
          of unlimited efficacy but limited extent, in line with scriptural
          testimony.
        </p>

        <h2>Biblical Basis for Definite Redemption</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture consistently portrays God as having chosen a particular
          people for salvation and sending Christ to redeem them (John 6:37–40;
          Rom. 8:28–39; Eph. 1:3–14; 1 Pet. 1:20). Jesus’ death is frequently
          described in terms that emphasize its particularity and efficacy. For
          instance, Jesus declared, “I lay down my life for the sheep” (John
          10:14–15), highlighting His intentional sacrifice for those given to
          Him by the Father. Similarly, passages such as Romans 5:8–10 and
          Galatians 2:20 affirm that Christ’s death secured the salvation of
          specific individuals and groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus’ high priestly prayer in John 17 further supports this view.
          There, Jesus explicitly prays for those the Father has given Him, not
          for the whole world (John 17:9, 20). This selective intercession
          aligns with the doctrine of definite redemption, as it would be
          inconceivable for Christ to refrain from praying for any whom He
          intended to save through His death.
        </p>

        <h2>The Universal Offer of the Gospel</h2>
        <p>
          Definite redemption does not contradict the universal proclamation of
          the Gospel. Scripture affirms that all who come to Christ in faith
          will be saved (John 6:35; Rom. 10:8–13). The Gospel invitation is
          genuine and is extended to all people, urging them to repent and
          believe in Christ. However, the doctrine recognizes that the ability
          to respond in faith is the result of God’s sovereign grace and
          effectual calling, which flow from Christ’s atoning work (John
          6:37–39; Eph. 2:8–10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who reject the Gospel do so of their own free will, bearing full
          responsibility for their unbelief (Matt. 22:1–7; John 3:18).
          Conversely, those who respond in faith owe their salvation entirely to
          God’s grace and Christ’s sacrifice, which guarantees their redemption
          and secures their place in God’s eternal plan.
        </p>

        <h2>The Centrality of the Cross</h2>
        <p>
          Definite redemption underscores the centrality of the cross in God’s
          plan of salvation. By His death, Christ accomplished a complete and
          effective atonement for the sins of the elect, overcoming the barriers
          of guilt, wrath, and estrangement. This atonement is not hypothetical
          but actual, securing reconciliation and eternal life for all whom the
          Father has given to the Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          For believers, the doctrine inspires profound gratitude and worship.
          Those who are saved recognize that their salvation is entirely the
          result of God’s sovereign grace, planned and accomplished through the
          cross. This realization fosters humility, dependence on Christ, and a
          deeper commitment to proclaiming the Gospel to all.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrine of definite redemption highlights the sovereign purpose
          of God in the atonement. Christ’s death was not a general provision
          but a specific, effective act of redemption for God’s elect. While the
          Gospel is proclaimed universally, its efficacy is rooted in Christ’s
          accomplishment on the cross, ensuring the salvation of those whom the
          Father has chosen. This doctrine not only affirms the sufficiency and
          effectiveness of Christ’s work but also calls believers to a life of
          gratitude, faith, and obedience, centered on the finished work of
          Jesus.
