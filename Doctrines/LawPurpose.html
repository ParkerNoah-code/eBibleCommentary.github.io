        <h1>God’s Moral Law Has Three Purposes</h1>
        <h2>The Mirror: Revealing Sin and Righteousness</h2>
        <p>
          In Romans 7:7, Paul writes, "I would not have known what sin was
          except through the law." This highlights the law’s first purpose: to
          act as a mirror reflecting God’s perfect righteousness while exposing
          human sinfulness and shortcomings. The law’s standard reveals the
          moral gap between humanity and God’s holiness, driving individuals to
          recognize their need for divine grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Augustine expressed this function eloquently, noting that the law
          leads us, in our weakness, to seek God’s help. By making sin evident
          (Rom. 3:20; 4:15; 5:13), the law alerts us to our peril of judgment
          and directs us to repentance and faith in Christ (Gal. 3:19–24). It
          functions as an indispensable tool for conviction, urging humanity to
          seek redemption through God’s provision.
        </p>

        <h2>The Restraint: Inhibiting Evil</h2>
        <p>
          The second purpose of God’s law is to restrain evil and promote civil
          order. While the law cannot transform the heart, its threats of
          judgment and enforcement through civil governance serve to inhibit
          lawlessness. Scripture highlights this function in passages such as
          Deuteronomy 13:6–11 and Romans 13:3–4, where the law’s role in
          maintaining justice and protecting the righteous is evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          By curbing human tendencies toward sin, the law creates an environment
          of relative stability and justice, reflecting God’s concern for order
          and the protection of the vulnerable. Though imperfect, this function
          underscores the value of law in shaping societal behavior and
          restraining the effects of sin on a communal level.
        </p>

        <h2>The Guide: Leading the Regenerate</h2>
        <p>
          The law’s third purpose is to guide believers in the way of
          righteousness. For those redeemed by Christ, the law serves as a
          family code, detailing the behaviors that please their heavenly
          Father. Jesus emphasized this role when He taught that His disciples
          must obey His commands as a demonstration of their love for Him (John
          14:15). The law provides a roadmap for living out the good works that
          God has prepared for His people (Eph. 2:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Christians are no longer under the law as a system of salvation (Rom.
          6:14; 7:4, 6) but are instead "under Christ’s law" as a rule of life
          (1 Cor. 9:21; Gal. 6:2). This freedom from the law’s condemnation
          transforms obedience into an act of love and gratitude rather than a
          burden. Through the Spirit’s empowerment, believers are enabled to
          fulfill the law’s righteous requirements as part of their sanctified
          lives.
        </p>

        <h2>The Threefold Unity of the Law</h2>
        <p>
          The three purposes of God’s law—revealing sin, restraining evil, and
          guiding the regenerate—work together to accomplish His redemptive
          purposes. As a mirror, the law brings conviction and drives humanity
          to Christ. As a restraint, it preserves societal order and protects
          against chaos. As a guide, it shapes the lives of believers into a
          reflection of God’s holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This threefold use of the law, articulated by Calvin, remains a
          cornerstone of Christian theology. It demonstrates that while the law
          cannot save, it plays a vital role in God’s plan of redemption,
          pointing sinners to Christ and instructing His followers in the path
          of obedience.
