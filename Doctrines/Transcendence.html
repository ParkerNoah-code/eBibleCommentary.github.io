        <h1>God’s Nature is Spiritual</h1>
        <h2>The Spiritual Nature of God</h2>
        <p>
          Isaiah 66:1 declares, “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
          footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my
          resting place be?” This verse underscores the transcendent nature of
          God, whose existence and presence are not confined by physical space
          or human constructs. Jesus’ words to the Samaritan woman, “God is
          spirit” (John 4:24), further emphasize that God’s being is not
          physical but fully spiritual, distinct from the material limitations
          of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          While God is personal and relational, He does not inhabit a body as we
          do. His spirituality signifies that He is not bound by the physical
          dimensions of space and time, nor does He experience the effects of
          sin that disrupt human concentration and control. God’s infinite
          nature elevates Him beyond human comprehension, yet His personal
          attributes allow for genuine interaction with His creation.
        </p>

        <h2>God’s Freedom from Limits</h2>
        <p>
          God’s transcendence is expressed in His immensity and infinity. He is
          present in His fullness everywhere at all times, unhindered by spatial
          or temporal limitations (1 Kings 8:27; Isaiah 40:12–26). Unlike humans
          who are confined to specific moments and locations, God exists outside
          time, perceiving past, present, and future simultaneously. This
          omnipresence enables Him to uphold and sustain all creation while
          orchestrating His sovereign plan for every person and event (Daniel
          4:34–35; Ephesians 1:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          Theologians often describe God’s transcendence as a hallmark of His
          greatness, distinguishing Him as the Creator who is above and beyond
          all He has made. His perspective encompasses the entirety of creation,
          ensuring that nothing is outside His attention or care.
        </p>

        <h2>The Immutability of God</h2>
        <p>
          God’s immutability reflects His perfect consistency. He does not
          change, for He is perfect in His nature and character (Malachi 3:6;
          James 1:16–18). Unlike created beings who evolve and adapt, God is
          timeless and unchanging. Yet this immutability does not imply
          detachment or inactivity. On the contrary, God is continually at work
          in His creation, bringing new things into existence and fulfilling His
          purposes (Isaiah 42:9; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Revelation 21:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s steadfast nature assures His faithfulness to His promises and
          His responsiveness to humanity. When people change their attitude
          toward Him, His attitude toward them adjusts accordingly, as seen in
          narratives like Jonah’s mission to Nineveh (Jonah 3:10). His
          immutability guarantees the reliability of His word and the stability
          of His covenantal love.
        </p>

        <h2>God’s Emotions and Impassibility</h2>
        <p>
          While God experiences emotions such as joy, sorrow, and love, these
          feelings are always under His sovereign control. Theological
          discussions of God’s impassibility clarify that His emotions are
          deliberate, purposeful, and integral to His infinite being. Unlike
          humans, who are often at the mercy of uncontrollable emotions, God
          feels and acts in perfect harmony with His will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scriptures affirm the reality of God’s emotional engagement with His
          creation, showcasing His delight in righteousness, sorrow over sin,
          and love for His people. However, His emotions transcend human
          experience, reflecting His divine nature and purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>The Simplicity and Integration of God</h2>
        <p>
          God’s simplicity refers to the integration and unity of His being.
          Unlike humans, whose fragmented attention and divided motives stem
          from sin, God is wholly and undividedly present in all His thoughts
          and actions. He gives complete and simultaneous attention to every
          aspect of His creation, from the smallest details to the grandest
          designs (Matthew 10:29–30).
        </p>
        <p>
          This simplicity highlights the marvel of God’s transcendent nature.
          While humans struggle to focus on one thing at a time, God
          effortlessly sustains and governs all things, demonstrating His
          unparalleled wisdom and power.
        </p>

        <h2>Worshiping God in Spirit and Truth</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus taught that true worship must be “in spirit and in truth” (John
          4:24). This means worship arises from a heart renewed by the Holy
          Spirit and is grounded in the truth of God’s self-revelation. Rituals
          and external forms of worship are meaningless without genuine
          engagement of the heart, which only the Spirit can produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worshiping “in truth” involves aligning our understanding with God’s
          revelation, particularly as seen in Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word.
          Through Him, we recognize our need for redemption and the glory of
          God’s grace. This worship transcends physical locations, for God’s
          presence is universally accessible through the Spirit (Hebrews
          12:22–24). As Psalm 145:18 assures, “The LORD is near to all who call
          on him, to all who call on him in truth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This global availability of God’s presence is a profound benefit of
          the gospel, inviting all people to experience the nearness and love of
          the transcendent God.
