        <h1>God Governs This World</h1>
        <h2>The Meaning of Providence</h2>
        <p>
          Providence refers to God’s ongoing activity in preserving, governing,
          and directing all things according to His sovereign will. As stated in
          the Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q.11), “God’s works of providence
          are his most holy, wise, and powerful preserving and governing all his
          creatures, and all their actions.” This doctrine underscores that
          God’s rule is not passive or detached but involves a continuous
          exercise of His divine power to sustain creation and direct it toward
          His intended purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If creation was a unique act of divine energy, providence is the
          ongoing application of that energy. Through providence, God (a) keeps
          all creatures in existence, (b) involves Himself in all events, and
          (c) directs all things to their ultimate end. This “hands-on” control
          demonstrates God’s total sovereignty over the universe. While His hand
          may sometimes appear hidden, His rule remains absolute, encompassing
          both grand cosmic events and the smallest details of life (Prov.
          16:33).
        </p>

        <h2>Biblical Testimony to Providence</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture provides abundant evidence of God’s providential control
          over all aspects of creation and history. It affirms His rule (1) over
          the universe at large (Ps. 103:19; Eph. 1:11), (2) over the physical
          world (Job 37; Matt. 5:45), (3) over the animal kingdom (Ps. 104:21;
          Matt. 6:26), (4) over the affairs of nations (Job 12:23; Acts 17:26),
          and (5) over individual human lives (Ps. 139:16; Gal. 1:15–16). Even
          seemingly insignificant events, such as the casting of lots or the
          numbering of hairs on one’s head, fall under His sovereign control
          (Prov. 16:33; Matt. 10:30).
        </p>
        <p>
          Providence also extends to spiritual realities, including (6) the
          protection of the righteous (Ps. 121:3; Rom. 8:28), (7) the provision
          of needs (Gen. 22:14; Phil. 4:19), (8) the answering of prayer (Ps.
          65:2; Matt. 7:7), and (9) the punishment of the wicked (Ps. 7:12; Rom.
          1:26–32). These examples reveal the comprehensiveness of God’s
          providence and His intimate involvement in the details of His
          creation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Paradox of Human Agency and Divine Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          The interplay between God’s sovereignty and human free agency is a
          profound mystery, yet Scripture presents these truths as
          complementary. Human actions, natural events, and even Satanic
          opposition are all under God’s sovereign control. The book of Esther
          illustrates this principle: though God’s name is not mentioned, His
          providential guidance is evident throughout the story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, acts that contravene God’s moral will often fulfill His
          sovereign purposes. For example, Joseph’s brothers intended evil in
          selling him into slavery, yet God used their actions to preserve many
          lives (Gen. 50:20). Likewise, the crucifixion of Christ, though a
          heinous act of sin, was ordained by God as the means of redemption
          (Acts 2:23; 4:27–28). These examples demonstrate that God’s
          providential rule does not negate human responsibility but ensures
          that all things work toward His ultimate glory and purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem of Evil</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most challenging aspects of providence is the existence of
          evil. Scripture teaches that God permits evil (Acts 14:16), uses it to
          accomplish His purposes (Gen. 50:20; 1 Cor. 2:7–8), and ultimately
          brings good out of it (Rom. 8:28). He also uses trials to test and
          refine His people, as seen in the temptation of Christ (Matt. 4:1–11)
          and the discipline described in Hebrews 12:4–14.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, God is never the author of sin (James 1:13–17). Instead, He
          remains its righteous judge. Ultimately, God’s providence assures
          believers that evil will not have the final word. Revelation 21:27 and
          22:14–15 promise a future where God’s people are redeemed from the
          power and presence of sin forever.
        </p>

        <h2>The Comfort of Providence</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrine of providence offers profound comfort to believers. It
          teaches that no event occurs by chance or blind fate but is part of
          God’s sovereign plan. Romans 8:28 assures Christians that “in all
          things God works
