        <h1>The Fall</h1>
        <h2>The First Human Couple Sinned</h2>
        <p>
          Genesis recounts the pivotal moment of human disobedience: "When the
          woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to
          the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate
          it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate
          it" (Gen. 3:6). This act of rebellion initiated humanity's fall from
          God's intended state of harmony and obedience, ushering in sin and its
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle Paul, in the New Testament, elaborates on the gravity of
          this moment. He emphasizes that all humanity is implicated in the
          guilt and power of sin, subjected to the reign of death, and placed
          under God's wrath (Rom. 3:9, 19; 5:17, 21; 1:18–19). Paul traces the
          origin of this condition to the sin of Adam, whom he identifies as
          humanity's common ancestor (Rom. 5:12–14; Acts 17:26; cf. 1 Cor.
          15:22). Through Paul's writings, we gain an apostolic interpretation
          of Genesis 3, which underscores the theological significance of the
          Fall as the entry point of sin into the human story.
        </p>

        <h2>The Covenant of Works</h2>
        <p>
          According to Paul's interpretation, God established Adam as the
          representative of all his descendants, a role echoed in Christ's
          representation of God's elect (Rom. 5:15–19; 8:29–30). This
          arrangement, often referred to as the "covenant of works," highlights
          Adam's responsibility to secure blessing for his posterity through
          obedience. Like a national leader whose decisions impact the entire
          nation, Adam's actions would determine the destiny of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam was placed in a state of happiness, entrusted with a mandate of
          perfect obedience, and warned against eating from the tree of the
          knowledge of good and evil. This tree symbolized a choice: to trust
          God's definition of good and evil or to usurp that authority by making
          such determinations independently. By consuming the fruit, Adam and
          Eve rejected God's authority, choosing self-determination over divine
          direction.
        </p>

        <h2>The Consequences of Disobedience</h2>
        <p>
          Adam and Eve's rebellion unleashed profound consequences. First, their
          anti-God mindset became ingrained in human nature, perpetuating sin
          across generations (Gen. 6:5; Rom. 3:9–20). Second, guilt and shame
          replaced their innocence, estranging them from God and fostering fear
          in His presence. Third, pain, toil, and death became integral to human
          existence, culminating in their expulsion from Eden. Yet, amidst
          judgment, God extended mercy by clothing them in garments of skin and
          promising redemption through the woman's offspring—a foreshadowing of
          Christ's victory over Satan.
        </p>

        <h2>The Historical and Theological Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Genesis presents the Fall as a historical event, linking Adam to the
          patriarchs and positioning him as a real figure within the human
          lineage (Gen. 5, 10, 11). The narrative's insistence on the
          universality of sin aligns with Paul's declaration: "In Adam all die"
          (1 Cor. 15:22). This coherence between Genesis and the New Testament
          reinforces the doctrine of original sin as a vital explanation for
          humanity's moral and spiritual brokenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blaise Pascal insightfully observed that while original sin challenges
          human reason, its acceptance elucidates the human condition with
          unparalleled clarity. The Fall narrative, though often resisted,
          offers a compelling framework for understanding the pervasive
          corruption and suffering in the world, grounding hope in the
          redemptive promise of Christ.
