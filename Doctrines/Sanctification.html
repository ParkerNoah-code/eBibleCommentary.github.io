        <h1>The Christian Grows in Grace</h1>
        <h2>The Doctrine of Sanctification</h2>
        <p>
          Sanctification, according to the Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q.35),
          is "the work of God’s free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole
          man after the image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto
          sin, and live unto righteousness." This process represents the
          transformation of a believer’s character through the ongoing work of
          the Holy Spirit, as they grow in holiness and reflect the moral image
          of Christ. Sanctification is not about the complete eradication of sin
          in this life, but rather the progressive renewal of the believer's
          heart, mind, and actions, leading them away from sinful habits and
          toward Christlike virtues.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practical terms, sanctification is both a relational and moral
          process. Relationally, it means being permanently set apart for God’s
          purposes, a status secured by the cross of Christ, where believers are
          purchased and claimed as God’s own (Acts 20:28; Heb. 10:10). Morally,
          sanctification involves a gradual transformation, wherein the believer
          is increasingly shaped into the likeness of Christ through the
          indwelling power of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:13; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph.
          4:22–24). God calls His children to holiness, and He gives them the
          strength to obey His commands and live in accordance with His will (1
          Thess. 4:4; 5:23).
        </p>

        <h2>Regeneration and Sanctification: Birth and Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Regeneration is a one-time, monergistic (God-alone) act where God
          quickens the spiritually dead, giving them new life. Sanctification,
          however, is an ongoing, synergistic process in which the believer
          cooperates with the Holy Spirit in their spiritual growth. While
          regeneration implants new desires for God and holiness, sanctification
          involves the believer actively working out these desires, “working out
          salvation” in their daily life through sustained obedience (Phil.
          2:12–13). The process is one of gradual transformation, with the
          believer becoming increasingly Christlike as the virtues of the fruit
          of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22–25) are formed in them (2 Cor. 3:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          As Christians grow in sanctification, they are conformed more and more
          to the moral profile of Christ. Paul views this transformation as a
          process of glorification that begins in sanctification. The believer’s
          character, gradually shaped to reflect Christ’s love, humility, and
          patience, is the beginning of the eternal glory that will one day be
          fully realized when they receive a transformed body like Christ’s
          (Phil. 3:20–21; 1 Cor. 15:49–53).
        </p>

        <h2>God-Dependent Effort</h2>
        <p>
          The process of sanctification is not a matter of mere self-effort but
          is God-dependent. While believers are called to exert themselves in
          obedience, they must recognize that it is only through Christ’s
          enabling power that they can grow in holiness (Phil. 4:13). This
          cooperative effort between the believer and the Holy Spirit is neither
          passive nor self-reliant but requires active dependence on God. The
          believer is encouraged to “abide in Christ” (John 15:5), relying on
          the Spirit’s power for all that they do in their pursuit of holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard by which sanctification is measured is the revealed moral
          law of God, exemplified by Christ’s own life. Believers are called to
          imitate Christ’s love, humility, and obedience in all their
          relationships and actions (Eph. 5:2; Phil. 2:5–11; 1 Pet. 2:21). This
          Christlike attitude is part of what it means to fulfill the law in a
          way that pleases God.
        </p>

        <h2>The Battle Between Spirit and Flesh</h2>
        <p>
          While sanctification is a transformative process, believers still
          struggle with the remnants of their old nature—the "flesh" (Gal.
          5:16–17). Though the power of sin has been broken, fallen human
          desires and instincts continue to wage war against the believer's new
          nature. Paul poignantly describes this internal conflict in Romans
          7:14–25, where he expresses his frustration with the ongoing struggle
          to do what is good and resist sin. However, the believer is not left
          without hope; by the Spirit’s power, they are able to "mortify" (i.e.,
          weaken and ultimately kill) particular sinful habits, growing in
          victory over them (Rom. 8:13; Col. 3:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          Christians will never be free from the struggle with sin while they
          are in this body, but through the Holy Spirit’s work, they experience
          moments of victory and deliverance from temptation. Importantly, no
          temptation is beyond what believers can resist with God’s help, for He
          provides the strength and escape from all temptation (1 Cor. 10:13).
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Ongoing Process of Sanctification</h2>
        <p>
          Sanctification is a lifelong process that leads believers from their
          initial justification to their ultimate glorification. It is God’s
          work in the believer’s life, transforming them into the image of
          Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit. While believers still
          face struggles with sin and moral imperfection, they are not left to
          fight alone. The Holy Spirit empowers them to grow in holiness,
          producing the fruit of the Spirit in their lives, and enabling them to
          live more fully in alignment with God's will. Sanctification is not
          only about moral change but also about deepening one’s relationship
          with God, living in the freedom of His grace, and becoming
          increasingly conformed to the image of Christ.
