        <h1>A Christian Lives to Please God</h1>
        <h2>The Calling to Glorify God</h2>
        <p>
          It is a central tenet of the Christian faith that every believer’s
          ultimate purpose is to glorify God. This calling shapes every aspect
          of the Christian life—how we speak, what we do, how we interact with
          others, and how we use the gifts and opportunities that God has given
          us. Every relationship, every action, every decision must be made with
          the intention to honor and praise God for His goodness and grace. As 1
          Corinthians 10:31 instructs, "So whether you eat or drink or whatever
          you do, do it all for the glory of God." Similarly, Matthew 5:16 and
          Colossians 3:17 emphasize that our actions should point others toward
          God’s glory, serving as a testimony of His love and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          This calling to glorify God is not optional or secondary for
          Christians; it is foundational to the very essence of the Christian
          life. We are to live in such a way that everything we do—whether in
          times of prosperity or hardship—reflects God’s goodness and draws
          attention to His greatness. Our lives are meant to be a continual act
          of worship, glorifying God in all things.
        </p>

        <h2>The Christian's Full-Time Employment: To Please God</h2>
        <p>
          Equally significant is the truth that every Christian’s personal
          calling is to please God in everything. Just as Jesus lived to please
          His Father, Christians are called to follow His example. John 8:29 and
          Romans 15:1–3 both affirm that Jesus did not seek to please Himself,
          but rather to do the will of the Father. In the same way, believers
          are called to live with the singular aim of pleasing God in every
          aspect of their lives. This involves not only outward obedience but
          also a heart that desires to honor and please God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pleasing God requires a life marked by faith (Heb. 11:5–6), praise
          (Ps. 69:30–31), generosity (Phil. 4:18; Heb. 13:16), obedience to
          authority (Col. 3:20), and wholehearted service (2 Tim. 2:4). This
          lifestyle is not self-generated; it is empowered by God’s grace.
          Hebrews 13:21 and Philippians 2:12–13 teach that God both commands and
          enables the believer to live in a way that pleases Him, delighting in
          the results of His sovereign work in us.
        </p>

        <h2>Godliness: Relational and Creative</h2>
        <p>
          True godliness is relational—it involves a deep, personal relationship
          with God, who is not only our Father but also our Friend. In the
          Bible, Abraham is called a friend of God (2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8;
          James 2:23), and Jesus calls His disciples friends (John 15:14). The
          Christian life is, at its core, a love affair with God, and godliness
          is about expressing that love by seeking to please Him, just as a
          spouse seeks to please their partner out of love. The measure of
          godliness is not found in mere obedience but in a heart that longs to
          please God in all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creativity, being part of God’s image in humanity, is also an
          essential aspect of this relationship. Just as God is the Creator, He
          calls His people to express their gratitude to Him in creative ways,
          actively looking for opportunities to serve and please Him. Love for
          God naturally leads to a desire to give more, serve more, and be more
          generous, looking for ways to bless others and reflect God's love.
        </p>

        <h2>Enterprise in the Christian Life</h2>
        <p>
          A Christian’s life is one of enterprise—taking initiative and being
          proactive in showing gratitude to God through action. This enterprise
          involves thinking about how we can serve God more effectively, how we
          can bless others, and how we can live in a way that honors Him. Love
          will always ask, "Can I do more to please God? Can I show more love,
          more service, more generosity?" This mindset shapes the Christian’s
          approach to all aspects of life, making service to God and others
          central to their daily actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if our plans for pleasing God involve taking risks, we
          can take comfort in the parable of the talents. In this story, Jesus
          commends those who risked their resources to do something with them,
          while condemning the one who buried his talent in fear of failure
          (Matt. 25:14–30). Christian enterprise is not marked by fear or
          inaction but by a willingness to step out in faith, trusting God with
          the results.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Living to Please God</h2>
        <p>
          The Christian life is a life lived with the ultimate goal of pleasing
          God in everything. This is our calling, both in a general sense as
          those who glorify God with all our actions and in a personal sense as
          we strive to please Him in all the details of our daily lives.
          Pleasing God is not just about obedience but about a
          relationship—loving God as our Father and Friend, seeking to express
          our gratitude through creative and active service. Christians are
          called to live with purpose, looking for ways to serve others and show
          God's love, with an attitude of faith, courage, and risk-taking,
          knowing that God delights in our efforts to please Him.
