        <h1>Jesus Rescues His People from Sin</h1>
        <h2>Salvation: A Central Theme</h2>
        <p>
          The overarching message of the Christian gospel is salvation. The term
          itself evokes imagery of deliverance—rescue from danger and misery
          into a state of safety and security. Scripture affirms that the same
          God who saved Israel from Egyptian bondage, Jonah from the fish’s
          belly, the psalmist from death, and Paul and his companions from
          shipwreck, now offers salvation from sin and its dire consequences to
          all who place their trust in Christ (Exod. 15:2; Jon. 2:9; Ps. 116:6;
          Acts 27:31).
        </p>
        <p>
          These earthly deliverances highlight a fundamental truth: salvation is
          entirely God’s work. Human effort contributes nothing to the saving
          process. As the Apostle Paul declares, “For it is by grace you have
          been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift
          of God” (Eph. 2:8). Similarly, Jonah’s declaration, “Salvation comes
          from the LORD” (Jon. 2:9), underscores the divine initiative and
          provision at the heart of redemption.
        </p>

        <h2>What Believers Are Saved From</h2>
        <p>
          Salvation delivers believers from a host of spiritual dangers. Chief
          among these is the wrath of God, under which all humanity naturally
          resides due to sin (Rom. 1:18; 3:9). It also frees them from the
          dominion of sin, the tyranny of death, and enslavement to worldly,
          fleshly, and satanic influences (John 8:23–24; Rom. 8:7–8; 1 John
          5:19). Furthermore, salvation liberates believers from the fears and
          destructive habits that once characterized their lives (Rom. 8:15; 2
          Tim. 1:7; Heb. 2:14–15; Eph. 4:17–24).
        </p>
        <p>
          This comprehensive deliverance transforms not only the eternal destiny
          of believers but also their present reality, reshaping their character
          and conduct to reflect God’s redemptive work.
        </p>

        <h2>How Believers Are Saved</h2>
        <p>
          Salvation is entirely centered on Christ. It is through his life,
          death, and resurrection that believers are redeemed and restored. The
          Father’s purpose in salvation includes exalting the Son as the Savior
          and Redeemer (John 5:19–23; Phil. 2:9–11). Christ’s work on the cross
          is twofold: he died for believers, bearing the penalty of their sins,
          and he lives in them, sustaining their union with him through the Holy
          Spirit (John 15:4; Col. 1:27).
        </p>
        <p>
          This union with Christ is both covenantal and vital. Covenantal union
          refers to God’s eternal election of believers in Christ (Eph. 1:4–6),
          while vital union signifies the ongoing spiritual connection sustained
          by faith and the Spirit’s power (Rom. 6:3–10). Through this dual
          aspect, salvation becomes a holistic experience encompassing
          justification, sanctification, and eventual glorification.
        </p>

        <h2>What Believers Are Saved For</h2>
        <p>
          Salvation is not merely about deliverance from sin and death; it is
          also about living for God in love and worship, both now and for
          eternity. Believers are saved to know, love, and glorify God—Father,
          Son, and Spirit—and to love their neighbors as themselves. This life
          of love reflects the transformative power of God’s redeeming love (1
          John 4:19–21).
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s purpose in salvation is to continually express his love to
          believers in Christ. In response, the life of the saved is marked by
          worship, service, and adoration of the triune God. This life of love
          is the essence of salvation, the hope of glory, and the source of
          eternal joy and fulfillment.
