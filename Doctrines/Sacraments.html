        <h1>Christ Instituted Two Seals of God’s Covenant</h1>
        <h2>Biblical Foundation of the Sacraments</h2>
        <p>
          In Romans 4:11, Paul describes the covenantal sign of circumcision,
          stating, "[Abraham] … received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
          righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised."
          This verse underscores the concept of a covenant seal, which points to
          a broader biblical framework that includes the two sacraments
          instituted by Christ: baptism and the Lord’s Supper. These rites,
          essential to Christian faith, signify God's covenant with His people,
          offering both initiation into the faith and ongoing remembrance of the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ instituted baptism as a once-for-all rite of initiation (Matt.
          28:19; Gal. 3:27) and the Lord’s Supper as a regular rite of
          remembrance (1 Cor. 11:23–26). These rites, referred to as
          "sacraments" in the Western church, "mysteries" in the Eastern
          Orthodox tradition, and "ordinances" by some Protestant groups, are
          critical elements of the Christian faith. While the Bible does not
          offer a single term for these acts, their Old Testament
          counterparts—circumcision and the Passover—serve as analogous rites
          that reinforce God's covenant relationship with His people (Gen.
          17:9–14; Exod. 12:1–27).
        </p>

        <h2>The Meaning of Sacraments</h2>
        <p>
          The term "sacrament" comes from the Latin word *sacramentum*, which
          originally referred to a soldier's sacred oath of allegiance but later
          came to signify any holy rite. The sacraments, in their biblical
          context, are outward signs that convey spiritual grace. They are
          actions instituted by Christ that use visible elements—such as water,
          bread, and wine—to communicate the invisible blessings of God's
          covenant. Through these signs, God affirms His promises to believers,
          confirming their participation in the covenant and their allegiance to
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sacraments serve to distinguish the church from the world and
          engage believers in a deeper commitment to God's service. The
          Westminster Confession of Faith states that the sacraments "put a
          visible difference between those that belong unto the church and the
          rest of the world, and solemnly to engage them to the service of God
          in Christ, according to his word." This idea reinforces the notion
          that sacraments not only symbolize God's promises but also serve as a
          sign of the believer's response to those promises.
        </p>

        <h2>Distinguishing Sacraments from Other Rites</h2>
        <p>
          While the medieval church mistakenly classified five other
          rites—confirmation, penance, marriage, ordination, and extreme
          unction—as sacraments, the biblical understanding restricts the term
          "sacrament" to baptism and the Lord’s Supper. These two rites are
          unique in that they serve as seals of a covenant relationship with
          God, offering tangible signs of God's grace. The other rites, although
          significant in the Christian tradition, lack the same biblical
          foundation as covenant seals. They do not have the same visible signs
          or ceremonies ordained by God, which is why they are not classified as
          sacraments (Thirty-Nine Articles XXV).
        </p>

        <h2>The Means of Grace Through Sacraments</h2>
        <p>
          The sacraments are rightly viewed as "means of grace," as they are
          instruments through which God strengthens and deepens a believer's
          faith. Their efficacy does not depend on the minister’s personal
          virtue but on God’s faithfulness to fulfill His promises. Christ and
          the apostles often speak of the sacramental signs as though they are
          the things they symbolize. For example, in Matthew 26:26–28 and 1
          Corinthians 10:15–21, Christ’s body and blood are represented by the
          bread and wine, and receiving these elements is equated with receiving
          Christ Himself. This highlights the deep spiritual significance of the
          sacraments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sacraments make the gospel visible, just as the preaching of the
          Word makes it audible. Through these rituals, God stirs up faith,
          reinforcing the believer's confidence in His promises. The Heidelberg
          Catechism illustrates this in its answer to Question 75, where it
          states that Christ has given assurance through the bread and wine,
          offering a visible guarantee of His sacrifice and the nourishment of
          the soul to eternal life. The visible elements—bread and wine—become
          tokens of Christ's body and blood, affirming the believer's
          participation in His redemptive work.
        </p>

        <h2>Seeing Is Believing</h2>
        <p>
          The sacraments operate on the principle that "seeing is believing." As
          the believer physically sees and tastes the bread and wine, they are
          reminded of the invisible spiritual realities they signify. These
          visible signs connect Christian beliefs with the testimony of the
          senses, allowing the believer to engage their faith in a deeply
          personal and experiential way. The sacraments thus serve as means of
          grace, strengthening the believer's faith by correlating the spiritual
          truth of God's covenant with tangible experiences.
