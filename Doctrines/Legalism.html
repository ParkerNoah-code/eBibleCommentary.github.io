        <h1>Working for God’s Favor Forfeits It</h1>
        <h2>The Distortion of Obedience in Legalism</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament presents Christian obedience as the practice of good
          deeds, which are to be done according to the right standard, with the
          right motive, and for the right purpose. Christians are called to be
          "rich in good deeds" (1 Tim. 6:18), as this reflects the regenerated
          heart that loves God and others and seeks to honor Him through acts of
          service. However, legalism distorts obedience by making good works
          into a means of earning God’s favor, turning what should be an
          expression of gratitude and love into a way to gain or maintain God's
          approval.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legalism has several faults: first, it skews the motives behind good
          works, making them about earning favor rather than responding to God's
          grace. Second, it fosters arrogance, as those who believe their works
          merit God’s favor often look down on others who do not perform the
          same actions. Third, legalism breeds lovelessness, as the
          self-centered nature of working for God’s approval can squeeze out
          genuine compassion and humility.
        </p>

        <h2>The Pharisees and Judaizers: Examples of Legalism</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament presents two main forms of legalism: Pharisaic and
          Judaizing. The Pharisees believed that their strict adherence to the
          law and their status as children of Abraham earned them God’s favor.
          They focused on the outward performance of rituals and commandments,
          even down to the most minute details, while neglecting the deeper
          aspects of the law such as justice, mercy, and faithfulness (Matt.
          23:23–24). They were outwardly righteous but inwardly full of
          hypocrisy, seeking the approval of men rather than God (Matt. 6:1–8;
          23:2–7).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Judaizers, in contrast, taught that Gentile converts to
          Christianity must also follow Jewish customs, such as circumcision and
          observing the Jewish festivals, in order to be fully accepted by God.
          They propagated a "Christ-plus" message, suggesting that Christ’s work
          was insufficient for salvation and that additional works were
          necessary for completeness (Gal. 3:1–3; Col. 2:8–23). Paul vehemently
          opposed this idea, arguing that it undermined the sufficiency of
          Christ’s sacrifice (Gal. 5:2–6).
        </p>

        <h2>The Faults of Legalism</h2>
        <p>
          The Pharisees’ legalism focused on the externals of religious
          observance while disregarding the heart's intent and the true purpose
          of God’s law. They treated man-made traditions as binding and elevated
          them to the same level as God’s commandments (Mark 7:1–8). Jesus
          rebuked them for this, pointing out their hypocrisy and calling them
          to a deeper righteousness that came from the heart, not just outward
          appearances (Matt. 15:3–9; 23:16–24).
        </p>
        <p>
          Legalism, whether Pharisaic or Judaizing, focuses on external
          obedience and human performance rather than the heart's transformation
          through grace. It turns religion into a system of works righteousness,
          where God’s approval is based on human effort rather than Christ’s
          completed work. Paul’s letters, particularly in Galatians and
          Colossians, emphasize that salvation is through Christ alone, and that
          any attempt to add works to the gospel diminishes the grace of God and
          insults the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice.
        </p>

        <h2>The Dangers of Legalism</h2>
        <p>
          Far from enriching a believer’s relationship with God, legalism
          destroys it. It shifts the focus away from Christ and the gospel,
          directing it instead towards human effort and performance. This
          fosters pride and self-reliance, and ultimately leads to spiritual
          stagnation, as the soul is starved by a lack of true reliance on God’s
          grace. Legalistic religion may look pious on the surface, but it is
          devoid of the love and humility that should characterize a true
          follower of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legalism also leads to the danger of spiritual burnout. Constantly
          striving to earn God's favor through self-effort and rule-keeping can
          be exhausting and ultimately fruitless. It is a path that leads to
          despair rather than joy, as the legalist finds themselves constantly
          falling short of the standard they have set for themselves.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Avoiding Legalism</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament calls believers to avoid legalism and to instead
          live by grace. Salvation is a gift from God, not something that can be
          earned by human effort (Eph. 2:8–9). Good works are the fruit of
          salvation, not its cause, and they should flow from a heart of
          gratitude for the grace of God (Titus 3:8). Believers are called to
          walk in the freedom of Christ, knowing that they are accepted by God
          because of what Christ has done, not because of what they have done.
          Legalism, in all its forms, must be rejected because it perverts the
          gospel and prevents believers from enjoying the full richness of God’s
          grace.
