        <h1>God Is Surpassingly Great</h1>
        <h2>The Greatness of God</h2>
        <p>
          Scripture repeatedly affirms the surpassing greatness of God. Passages
          like 1 Chronicles 29:11 proclaim, “Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and
          the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for
          everything in heaven and earth is yours.” God’s greatness is not only
          vast but also incomprehensible, transcending human understanding (Ps.
          145:3; Deut. 7:21; Dan. 9:4). Theology describes this as God’s
          “incomprehensibility,” meaning that while we can know true things
          about God, we can never fully grasp the entirety of His being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imagery of God dwelling in “thick darkness” (Ps. 97:2) and
          “unapproachable light” (1 Tim. 6:16) highlights the same reality: God
          is infinitely above His creation. Though we are made in His image and
          can know Him relationally, our finite minds cannot contain the
          fullness of His infinite nature. This reality should inspire both
          humility and awe in those who seek to know Him.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mystery of God</h2>
        <p>
          The term “mystery” in this context refers to aspects of God’s nature
          and works that are beyond human comprehension. Unlike the biblical use
          of the word to signify truths once hidden but now revealed (e.g., Eph.
          3:2–6), this use of “mystery” acknowledges the limits of human
          understanding in grasping the infinite. For example, the Trinity, the
          Incarnation, the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, and the
          inspiration of Scripture are truths revealed by God but not fully
          explainable by human reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we cannot know all there is to know about God, we can trust what
          He has revealed about Himself in Scripture. His self-disclosure
          provides a genuine, though partial, understanding of His nature. The
          analogy of a parent’s baby talk to a young child is helpful here:
          though limited in scope, it communicates real truths and fosters trust
          and love. Similarly, God “accommodates” His revelation to human
          capacity so that we might know and relate to Him as Creator, Redeemer,
          and Father.
        </p>

        <h2>Anthropomorphic Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          God often presents Himself in Scripture using anthropomorphic
          language—descriptions of human traits or actions applied to God. For
          example, He is said to have a face (Exod. 33:11), hands (1 Sam. 5:11),
          and feet (Nah. 1:3). He is depicted as sitting on a throne (1 Kings
          22:19) or flying on the wind (Ps. 18:10). These images do not describe
          God as He is in Himself but illustrate His actions and relationship
          with His creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such descriptions serve to bridge the gap between the Creator and His
          creatures, enabling humans to understand and relate to Him. They
          remind us that God is both transcendent—infinitely greater than us—and
          immanent—personally involved in our lives. These anthropomorphic
          expressions draw us into worship, trust, and love for a God who is
          both near and unfathomably great.
        </p>

        <h2>Worshiping the Surpassingly Great God</h2>
        <p>
          The ultimate response to the mystery and greatness of God is worship.
          Theology, rightly understood, leads to doxology—a response of praise
          and adoration. As 1 Corinthians 13:12 reminds us, we currently “see
          only a reflection as in a mirror” and “know in part,” but this partial
          knowledge should not deter our worship. Instead, it should deepen our
          reverence and gratitude for a God who reveals Himself to us in ways we
          can understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recognition of God’s greatness and our own limitations should
          inspire humility and trust. Knowing that His plans and purposes are
          far beyond our comprehension (Rom. 11:33) encourages us to depend on
          His wisdom and submit to His will. Worshiping God for His
          incomprehensibility affirms our faith in His infinite power, goodness,
          and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every act of worship, whether through prayer, song, or obedience,
          we echo the words of 1 Chronicles 29:11: “Yours, O LORD, is the
          greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the
          splendor.” Such worship not only honors God but also aligns our hearts
          with His, fostering a deeper relationship with the One who is
          surpassingly great.
