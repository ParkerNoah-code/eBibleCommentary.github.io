        <h1>God Has a Purpose</h1>
        <h2>The Sovereign Purpose of God</h2>
        <p>
          Malachi 1:2–3 states, “‘I have loved you,’ says the LORD. But you ask,
          ‘How have you loved us?’ ‘Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?’ the LORD
          says. ‘Yet I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated.’” This passage
          encapsulates the biblical theme of God’s sovereign purpose in
          creation, redemption, and history. God’s purpose is rooted in His
          desire for an eternal relationship of love with His creatures, a plan
          disrupted by sin but being restored through His redemptive work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors of Scripture viewed themselves and their readers as part
          of this divine purpose. They reflected on God’s mighty acts of
          redemption, culminating in the ultimate renewal of creation, where the
          earth will be transformed into unimaginable glory (Isaiah 65:17–25; 2
          Peter 3:10–13; Revelation 21:1–22:5). This vision of restoration
          underscores God’s unwavering control over history, ensuring the
          fulfillment of His plan for a redeemed people to love, worship, and
          serve Him in everlasting fellowship.
        </p>

        <h2>The Doctrine of Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          Predestination refers to God’s eternal decision regarding the final
          destiny of individuals, made before the world and its inhabitants
          existed. In the New Testament, predestination is closely tied to
          election, describing God’s choice of certain individuals for salvation
          and eternal life (Romans 8:29; Ephesians 1:4–5, 11). This divine
          decision underscores God’s sovereignty in salvation, affirming that He
          initiates and accomplishes the work of redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Protestant theology, predestination encompasses both election and
          reprobation—the decision to save some and to leave others to their
          deserved condemnation for sin. Scriptures such as Romans 9:6–29 and 1
          Peter 2:8 support this dual aspect of God’s decree. While this
          teaching may challenge human understanding, it highlights God’s
          justice and mercy in working out His redemptive plan.
        </p>

        <h2>The Basis of God’s Choice</h2>
        <p>
          Some argue that God’s choice is based on His foreknowledge of who
          would choose Christ in response to the gospel. However, this view
          misinterprets the biblical meaning of foreknowledge. In passages like
          Romans 8:29 and 1 Peter 1:2, foreknow signifies “fore-love” or
          “fore-appoint,” emphasizing God’s proactive choice rather than passive
          observation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Scripture teaches that sinners, being spiritually dead, are
          incapable of coming to faith without God’s intervention. Ephesians
          2:4–10 highlights that salvation is entirely by grace, as God
          regenerates hearts and enables faith. Jesus affirms this in John 6:65:
          “No one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.” Therefore,
          sinners choose Christ only because God has first chosen them, renewing
          their hearts and drawing them to Himself.
        </p>

        <h2>Human Freedom and Divine Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          While human actions are self-determined and morally accountable, they
          are not free from God’s sovereign control. God’s eternal purpose and
          foreordination encompass all human choices, yet He works through these
          choices to fulfill His will. This coexistence of divine sovereignty
          and human responsibility remains a mystery, yet it is affirmed
          throughout Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          God often accomplishes His purposes without miraculous intervention,
          allowing events to unfold naturally. This highlights His wisdom in
          orchestrating all things according to His perfect plan, ensuring that
          His glory is displayed in every circumstance.
        </p>

        <h2>Living in Light of Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          For Christians, the doctrine of predestination inspires gratitude and
          trust. Believers recognize that their salvation is entirely by God’s
          grace, leading them to thank Him for their conversion and depend on
          Him for perseverance in faith. This assurance fosters confidence in
          God’s sovereign care and hope in His ultimate triumph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding predestination also deepens the believer’s humility and
          worship. Recognizing that God’s choice is based on His mercy, not
          human merit, leads to awe and reverence for His grace. Furthermore, it
          motivates believers to share the gospel, trusting that God’s
          redemptive purpose will be accomplished through their witness.
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s predestination reveals His sovereign love and unshakable
          commitment to His plan of redemption. As part of this divine purpose,
          Christians are called to live in worship, trust, and obedience, secure
          in the knowledge that the God who began a good work in them will carry
          it to completion (Philippians 1:6).
