        <h1>A Christian Changes Radically</h1>
        <h2>The Nature of Repentance</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament presents repentance as a profound and radical change
          in one's life. The term "repentance" itself means a complete
          transformation in one’s mind and life. This change involves a shift in
          views, values, goals, and behaviors, affecting the mind, judgment,
          will, affections, and actions. Repentance is not merely an outward
          modification but an inward revolution that compels a person to live in
          a completely new way. As stated in Acts 26:20, repentance involves a
          turning to God and proving that change by one’s deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repentance was central to the message of the New Testament, being
          proclaimed by John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2), Jesus (Matt. 4:17), and
          the apostles (Mark 6:12; Acts 2:38). It is also the consistent theme
          of the Old Testament prophets, who called Israel to return to God
          after their waywardness (Jer. 23:22; Zech. 1:3–6). Repentance is
          always presented as the path to the forgiveness of sins and
          reconciliation with God, while impenitence is shown as leading to
          spiritual destruction (Luke 13:1–8).
        </p>

        <h2>Repentance as the Fruit of Faith</h2>
        <p>
          Repentance and faith are inseparable in the Christian life. While
          faith is the positive aspect of turning to Christ, repentance is the
          negative aspect, which involves turning away from sin and turning
          toward God. True repentance is a necessary expression of genuine
          faith. The idea that one can have faith without repentance or accept
          Christ as Savior without submitting to Him as Lord is a dangerous
          misconception. To acknowledge Christ as Savior is to recognize Him as
          Lord as well, and true saving faith involves both aspects. Without
          repentance, faith becomes incomplete and ineffective, as it fails to
          involve a total commitment to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Westminster Confession of Faith articulates repentance as a deep
          sorrow and grief for sin, born not merely from the fear of punishment
          but from a recognition of the offensiveness of sin against God’s holy
          nature and righteous law. Genuine repentance involves a sincere desire
          to turn away from sin and live in obedience to God's commandments.
          This is not just a momentary feeling of remorse but a permanent and
          active turning toward God.
        </p>

        <h2>Attrition vs. Contrition</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of "attrition" refers to a sorrow for sin that stems from
          fear of punishment rather than a true hatred of sin itself. This kind
          of repentance is insufficient because it does not involve a commitment
          to forsake sin and live according to God's will. In contrast,
          "contrition" is a deeper, more genuine form of repentance. It is
          characterized by a heartfelt sorrow for sin and a firm purpose to sin
          no more. This is the repentance modeled by King David in Psalm 51,
          where he expresses his deep regret for his actions and his resolve to
          live in alignment with God's will. True repentance is evidenced by a
          changed life—a life that strives to practice the virtues opposed to
          the sins repented of. As John the Baptist preached in Luke 3:8, and as
          Paul affirmed in Acts 26:20, repentance must be demonstrated by a
          transformed life.
        </p>

        <h2>Repentance and New Life</h2>
        <p>
          Repentance is not simply a matter of feeling sorry for past actions;
          it involves a radical shift in one's entire life direction. To repent
          is to turn away from sin and pursue righteousness, to forsake former
          ways and adopt a lifestyle that reflects one's new identity in Christ.
          This change is not merely external but internal, affecting one's
          desires, thoughts, and actions. Repentance, therefore, is not a
          one-time event but a continual turning toward God, a commitment to
          live in His light and according to His will.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Necessity of True Repentance</h2>
        <p>
          In summary, repentance is a vital and transformative part of the
          Christian faith. It involves a radical reorientation of one's life,
          turning from sin and self-centeredness to God and His righteousness.
          While faith is the means by which we are justified, repentance is the
          evidence of genuine faith. It is the heart’s response to God’s mercy,
          acknowledging our sin and seeking His forgiveness. True repentance
          leads to a new life, characterized by obedience to God’s commands and
          a desire to live according to His will. Without repentance, faith is
          incomplete, for it is in repentance that faith is truly expressed and
          proven genuine.
