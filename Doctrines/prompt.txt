Make sure the responses are comprehensive and follow these guidelines:

Paraphrasing: Use language that rephrases and clarifies the original text without changing its meaning.
Expansion: Add context, examples, and interpretations to flesh out the ideas.
Organization: Structure responses into clear sections with subheadings for better readability.
Exegesis: Include a detailed analysis of the key texts, unpacking meanings, and drawing connections to broader themes or historical contexts.
HTML Format: Present responses in the provided HTML structure for seamless integration into your document.
Content: Should be detailed. Most subheadings should have multiple paragraphs. Try not to use lists.
Here is how this might look in a practical example:

Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../Style.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <header>
        <h1>Short Title</h1>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="index.html">About</a> | <a href="Misc.html"> Misc</a> |
          <a href="OT.html"> Old Testament</a> |
          <a href="NT.html"> New Testament</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section>
