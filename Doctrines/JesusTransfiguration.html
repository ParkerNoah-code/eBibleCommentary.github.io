        <h1>How Jesus Christ’s Glory Was Revealed</h1>
        <h2>The Event of the Transfiguration</h2>
        <p>
          The Transfiguration of Jesus, recorded in Matthew 17:1–8, Mark 9:2–8,
          and Luke 9:28–36, reveals a pivotal moment where Christ’s divine glory
          was momentarily unveiled. As described in Mark: "After six days Jesus
          took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain,
          where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. His
          clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could
          bleach them. And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were
          talking with Jesus" (Mark 9:2–4). This dramatic event underscores
          Jesus' divine identity and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus’ purpose in bringing Peter, James, and John was deliberate. He
          intended for them to witness this event and later testify to its
          significance (Matt. 17:9; cf. 2 Pet. 1:16–18; John 1:14). Through this
          revelation, they glimpsed a foretaste of the glory that Christ would
          fully reveal at His return and the transformation believers will
          experience in the resurrection (Phil. 3:20–21).
        </p>

        <h2>The Glory of Christ Revealed</h2>
        <p>
          The Transfiguration revealed Jesus as "the radiance of God’s glory"
          (Heb. 1:3). As Jesus prayed (Luke 9:29), His appearance changed, and a
          bright light emanated from Him, even through His clothing. This light
          was the intrinsic glory of the divine Son, temporarily unveiled to His
          closest disciples. It highlighted Jesus' identity as the Son of God
          and His unique role in God’s redemptive plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          A voice from the cloud declared, "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen
          to him!" (Mark 9:7). This divine proclamation affirmed Jesus’ divine
          identity and authority, reinforcing the visual manifestation of His
          glory. The disciples were given not only a glimpse of Christ’s majesty
          but also a confirmation of His mission and their calling to trust Him.
        </p>

        <h2>Moses and Elijah: The Law and the Prophets</h2>
        <p>
          The appearance of Moses and Elijah alongside Jesus carries deep
          symbolic meaning. Moses, representing the Law, and Elijah,
          representing the Prophets, testified to Jesus as the fulfillment of
          God’s covenant promises. Their presence affirmed that the Law and the
          Prophets pointed forward to Christ and that His mission would
          supersede their roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversation between Jesus, Moses, and Elijah about His
          "departure" (Greek: exodos) (Luke 9:31) referred to His impending
          death, resurrection, and ascension. Just as Moses led Israel in the
          exodus from Egypt, redeeming them from slavery, Jesus' exodus would
          redeem humanity from the bondage of sin. His departure was not merely
          a physical leaving of the world but the climactic act of salvation
          history.
        </p>

        <h2>Return to Ministry and the Path to Calvary</h2>
        <p>
          Following the Transfiguration, Jesus once again veiled His glory and
          descended the mountain to continue His ministry. The disciples, still
          grappling with what they had witnessed, were instructed not to speak
          of it until after the resurrection (Matt. 17:9). This veil of secrecy
          reflected Jesus' focus on fulfilling His mission as the suffering
          Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          F. B. Meyer poignantly observes, “The door through which Moses and
          Elijah had come stood open, and by it our Lord might have returned.
          But he could never, under those circumstances, have been the Saviour
          of mankind. He knew this, so he set his face toward Calvary.” Jesus'
          choice to remain on the path to the cross underscores His commitment
          to His redemptive mission. The Transfiguration provided a momentary
          glimpse of His divine majesty but also pointed forward to the
          suffering and victory that would achieve salvation for humanity.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Transfiguration of Jesus is a profound revelation of His divine
          glory and the fulfillment of Old Testament promises. It serves as a
          foretaste of the glory to be revealed in His second coming and the
          transformation awaiting believers in the resurrection. Through the
          presence of Moses and Elijah, the Transfiguration unites the Law, the
          Prophets, and the Gospel in a singular testimony to Jesus as the
          Messiah. Above all, it highlights Jesus’ unwavering commitment to His
          mission, setting His face toward Calvary to accomplish redemption for
          humanity.
