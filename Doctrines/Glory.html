        <h1>God’s Glory-Showing Requires Glory-Giving</h1>
        <h2>The Purpose of God’s Glory</h2>
        <p>
          God’s goal is His glory, a purpose often misunderstood as divine
          egoism but better understood as an expression of divine love. God
          desires to be praised for His praiseworthiness, to be exalted for His
          greatness and goodness, and to be appreciated for who He is. However,
          this glory is not self-serving but relational, involving a twofold
          dynamic: God reveals His glory to His creatures, and they respond by
          giving Him glory. This interplay of revelation and adoration fulfills
          the purpose for which humanity and angels were created and, for fallen
          humans, redeemed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fellowship created by this exchange of glory is at the heart of
          human fulfillment. As we see and celebrate God’s glory, we experience
          the joy of communion with Him. This joy is mutual, bringing delight to
          both God and His people (Zeph. 3:14–17). In this way, God’s glory is
          both the source and the goal of the love relationship between Creator
          and creation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Revelation of God’s Glory</h2>
        <p>
          In the Old Testament, “glory” conveys ideas of weight, worth,
          splendor, and dignity. When God reveals His glory, it is often
          accompanied by awe-inspiring physical manifestations, such as the
          Shekinah—a radiant, cloud-like presence symbolizing God’s active
          involvement in the world. For example, God’s glory appeared to Moses
          in response to his plea, proclaimed through His name and characterized
          by His nature, power, and mercy (Exod. 33:18–34:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shekinah is a recurring feature of significant biblical moments,
          signifying God’s presence and majesty (Exod. 40:34–35; 1 Kings
          8:10–11; Ezek. 1:28). In the New Testament, God’s glory is revealed in
          its fullness in the person of Jesus Christ. John 1:14 declares, “The
          Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his
          glory, the glory of the one and only Son.” Through Christ’s life,
          death, and resurrection, the glory of God’s nature, character, and
          redemptive purpose is made visible (2 Cor. 4:3–6; Heb. 1:1–3).
        </p>

        <h2>Responding to God’s Glory</h2>
        <p>
          The proper response to the revelation of God’s glory is to give Him
          glory. This includes verbal praise, as exemplified in Revelation 4:9
          and 19:7, where heavenly beings extol God’s greatness and goodness. It
          also involves practical expressions of worship, as believers dedicate
          their entire lives to honoring and pleasing God. Paul exhorts
          Christians to “do it all for the glory of God” in every activity (1
          Cor. 10:31).
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s insistence on receiving exclusive glory underscores His unique
          role as Creator and Redeemer. Isaiah 42:8 declares, “I will not yield
          my glory to another or my praise to idols.” In salvation, God alone
          deserves credit, as He accomplishes it entirely by His grace. Human
          beings contribute nothing but their need for redemption, a truth
          emphasized by the Reformation principle of “Glory to God alone” (<em
            >soli Deo gloria</em
          >). This principle remains essential today, reminding us that our
          worship must reflect an acknowledgment of God’s sovereign grace at
          every stage of salvation.
        </p>

        <h2>Glory as a Source of Joy</h2>
        <p>
          The exchange of glory between God and His creatures is not a
          burdensome obligation but a source of profound joy. As we behold God’s
          glory, we are transformed and fulfilled, experiencing the ultimate
          purpose for which we were created. This joy is not limited to
          individual experiences but extends to the corporate worship of God’s
          people, reflecting the unity and diversity of His creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophetic vision of God’s glory in Ezekiel 1:28, described as the
          radiance of a rainbow, serves as a reminder of God’s faithfulness and
          beauty. It invites believers to marvel at His majesty and to join in
          the eternal praise of the One who is worthy of all honor and glory.
          This reciprocal relationship of seeing and giving glory brings both
          delight to God and wholeness to humanity, showcasing the depth of His
          love and the purpose of His creation.
