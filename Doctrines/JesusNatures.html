        <h1>Two Natures</h1>
        <h2>Jesus Christ Is Fully Human</h2>
        <p>
          The Apostle John warns of those who deny the humanity of Christ: "Many
          deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh,
          have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the
          antichrist" (2 John 7). This strong condemnation targets the heretical
          teachings of the Docetists, who argued that Jesus only appeared human,
          denying the reality of His Incarnation. Such views undermine the core
          of Christian belief—that Jesus, the Son of God, became fully human to
          redeem humanity.
        </p>

        <h2>Jesus' Genuine Human Experience</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospels provide ample evidence of Jesus' humanity. He experienced
          physical limitations like hunger (Matt. 4:2) and weariness (John 4:6).
          He displayed emotions, such as grief at Lazarus' death (John 11:35),
          and endured profound suffering, particularly in Gethsemane (Mark
          14:32–42) and on the cross. The author of Hebrews emphasizes that
          Jesus’ human experiences qualify Him to serve as a compassionate
          helper and mediator. "Because he himself suffered when he was tempted,
          he is able to help those who are being tempted" (Heb. 2:18). His
          humanity assures believers that He understands and empathizes with
          their struggles.
        </p>

        <h2>Christians and the Minimization of Christ's Humanity</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout history, some Christians, focusing on Jesus’ divinity, have
          minimized His humanity. Early heresies like Monophysitism denied that
          Jesus had two distinct natures, instead asserting He possessed only a
          divine nature. Modern interpretations sometimes suggest that Jesus’
          hunger, weariness, or ignorance were merely pretenses, attributing
          omniscience and omnipotence to Him at all times. However, these views
          distort the Incarnation, which teaches that Jesus fully embraced human
          experience while remaining divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incarnation means that Jesus lived a divine-human life through His
          human mind and body. He did not always exercise divine omniscience or
          omnipotence, instead relying on the Father’s will and drawing on
          divine resources only as needed. This complete identification with
          humanity allowed Him to experience life as we do, maximizing His
          empathy and solidarity with those He came to save.
        </p>

        <h2>The Unity of Two Natures</h2>
        <p>
          The union of Jesus' two natures—divine and human—cannot be understood
          as alternating states, as if He sometimes acted in His humanity and
          other times in His divinity. Every action, including His sufferings on
          the cross, was carried out by His unified divine-human person. This
          does not contradict the doctrine of divine impassibility, which holds
          that God experiences all things—including distress—by His own will and
          foreordaining decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being divine, Jesus was impeccable, meaning He could not sin. However,
          this did not render Him immune to temptation. Satan's temptations,
          such as those in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1–11), and the constant pull
          to avoid the cross (Matt. 16:23; Luke 22:28), were genuine struggles.
          Yet, as the Son of God, it was His nature to obey the Father,
          resisting temptation until victory was achieved.
        </p>

        <h2>Christ's Temptations and Victory</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospels and Epistles provide glimpses into the intensity of
          Christ’s struggles with temptation. In Gethsemane, He faced an
          unparalleled spiritual battle, praying with such agony that His sweat
          fell like drops of blood (Luke 22:44). Despite the weight of these
          trials, His divine will to fulfill the Father’s purpose remained
          unshaken. His triumph over temptation serves as a source of hope and
          strength for believers facing their own challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hebrews captures the profound significance of Christ's humanity: "For
          we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our
          weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as
          we are—yet he did not sin" (Heb. 4:15). His sinlessness amidst
          temptation assures believers of His ability to guide and sustain them
          in their own journeys of faith.
        </p>

        <h2>The Significance of Christ’s Humanity</h2>
        <p>
          The full humanity of Jesus is essential to Christian theology and
          devotion. It means that He shared in our weaknesses and limitations,
          providing a model of obedience and faithfulness. It also ensures that
          He is a sympathetic high priest, intimately acquainted with the human
          condition and fully equipped to intercede on our behalf. By embracing
          His humanity, Jesus became the perfect mediator, bridging the gap
          between God and humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Jesus, believers find both divine power and human empathy. His
          life, death, and resurrection demonstrate that the Word truly became
          flesh, dwelling among us to redeem and restore all who trust in Him.
