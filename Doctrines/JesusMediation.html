        <h1>Jesus Christ Is the Mediator Between God and Man</h1>
        <h2>The Role of a Mediator</h2>
        <p>
          The saving work of Jesus Christ is encapsulated in His role as the
          “mediator between God and men” (1 Tim. 2:5). A mediator bridges the
          gap between two estranged parties, facilitating reconciliation.
          Humanity, estranged from God due to sin, is described in Scripture as
          “hostile to God” (Rom. 8:7), standing under His wrath for its
          rebellion (Rom. 1:18; 2:5–9). The role of a mediator requires a deep
          connection with both parties, enabling the mediator to represent their
          interests and foster reconciliation. In the Old Testament, Moses
          served as a mediator between God and Israel, communicating God’s law
          and interceding on behalf of the people (Exod. 20:18–21; 32:9–33:17;
          Gal. 3:19). However, Christ fulfills this role on a cosmic and eternal
          scale.
        </p>

        <h2>Christ’s Work of Reconciliation</h2>
        <p>
          Reconciliation between humanity and God required addressing two
          critical barriers: God’s wrath against sin and humanity’s anti-God
          nature. In an act of mercy, the Father sent the Son to bring about
          this reconciliation. It was not a case of a benevolent Son pacifying a
          harsh Father; instead, the Father’s initiative flowed from His love,
          even for those under His judgment. As John 3:16 declares, “For God so
          loved the world, that he gave his only Son.” Christ carried out this
          mission in perfect obedience to the Father’s will.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the cross, Jesus achieved reconciliation through penal
          substitution, bearing the punishment for humanity’s sins (Gal. 3:13).
          By His sacrificial death, He absorbed God’s wrath, satisfied divine
          justice, and made peace for sinners (Eph. 2:16; Col. 1:20). This peace
          means the removal of hostility and guilt, granting believers pardon
          and permanent acceptance before God. Those who, through faith, receive
          this reconciliation are justified and enjoy peace with God (Rom. 5:1,
          10).
        </p>

        <h2>Jesus as Mediator of the New Covenant</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus is described as “the mediator of a new covenant” (Heb. 9:15;
          12:24), establishing a relationship of peace between God and humanity
          that surpasses the Old Testament system. Unlike the sacrificial
          system, which was limited and temporary, Christ’s sacrifice is
          once-for-all, permanently dealing with sin and its consequences (Heb.
          9:11–10:18). As mediator of the new covenant, Jesus initiates and
          sustains a transformative relationship between believers and God,
          characterized by forgiveness, peace, and spiritual renewal.
        </p>

        <h2>The Threefold Office of Christ</h2>
        <p>
          John Calvin highlighted the New Testament’s teaching that Christ’s
          mediatorial work is expressed through three distinct yet unified
          offices: prophet, priest, and king. In His prophetic office, Jesus
          proclaims the Word of God, revealing God’s truth and will. As priest,
          He offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sin and continues to
          intercede for believers before the Father. As king, He reigns with
          sovereign authority over all creation, guiding His church and
          advancing His kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          These three roles converge uniquely in Jesus. Whereas in the Old
          Testament, prophets, priests, and kings were distinct roles held by
          different individuals, Jesus embodies all three offices in one person.
          In Hebrews, we see this multifaceted role clearly: Jesus is the
          exalted king seated at God’s right hand (Heb. 1:3, 13; 2:9), the great
          High Priest who offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice (Heb. 2:17;
          7–10), and the prophet-apostle who proclaims God’s truth (Heb. 3:1;
          2:3).
        </p>

        <h2>The Call to Follow the Mediator</h2>
        <p>
          Believers are called to respond to Christ’s mediatorial work by
          aligning their lives with His offices. We are to learn from Him as our
          prophet, trusting in His Word and guidance. We rely on Him as our
          priest, drawing near to God through His sacrifice and intercession.
          Finally, we submit to Him as our king, seeking to obey His commands
          and participate in His kingdom work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comprehensive view of Christ’s mediation is central to authentic
          Christianity. It reminds us that Jesus is not only the means of
          reconciliation but also the source of life, truth, and hope. To center
          one’s faith on Him in His fullness is to grasp the heart of the Gospel
          and to live as His disciple.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ’s role as mediator is the foundation of the Christian
          faith. By reconciling humanity to God through His sacrifice, He
          fulfilled the ultimate requirement for peace with God. His mediatorial
          ministry, expressed through His offices of prophet, priest, and king,
          demonstrates His sufficiency as Savior. Believers are called to trust,
          follow, and worship Him in response to His unparalleled work of
          mediation, finding their hope and identity in Him alone.
