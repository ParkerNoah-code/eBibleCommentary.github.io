        <h1>Fallen Angels Have a Leader</h1>
        <h2>The Identity of Satan</h2>
        <p>
          Satan, the leader of the fallen angels, is introduced in the Old
          Testament as the adversary of God and His people (Job 1:6; Zech.
          3:1–2). His name, which means “adversary,” reflects his role as an
          opponent of all that is good and holy. In the New Testament, Satan’s
          character and mission are further revealed through a series of titles:
          “devil” (accuser), “Apollyon” (destroyer), “the tempter,” “the evil
          one,” “prince of this world,” and “god of this age” (Rev. 12:9–10;
          Matt. 4:3; 1 John 5:19; 2 Cor. 4:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus identified Satan as the father of lies, the original deceiver
          who led humanity astray in the Garden of Eden (John 8:44; Rev. 12:9).
          These titles paint a portrait of malice, cunning, and unrelenting
          hostility toward God, His truth, and those who belong to Him. Satan’s
          mission is to oppose God’s kingdom, spread falsehood, and harm the
          people of God.
        </p>

        <h2>Satan’s Nature and Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Satan is depicted as a being of immense cunning and ferocity. Paul
          warns that he disguises himself as an angel of light, making evil
          appear good (2 Cor. 11:14). Peter likens him to a roaring lion seeking
          to devour (1 Pet. 5:8), while Revelation describes him as a dragon,
          emphasizing his destructive power (Rev. 12:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          As the sworn enemy of Christ (Matt. 4:1–11; John 14:30), Satan now
          targets Christians, probing for weaknesses, distorting strengths, and
          undermining faith and character. His tactics include temptation,
          deception, and spiritual warfare (Luke 22:32; Eph. 6:16). Yet
          believers are assured that they can resist him through the resources
          Christ provides, such as prayer, faith, and the armor of God (Eph.
          6:10–13; James 4:7).
        </p>

        <h2>The Defeat of Satan</h2>
        <p>
          Although Satan wields significant power, he is ultimately a defeated
          enemy. Christ triumphed over him through His life, death, and
          resurrection (Matt. 12:29; Col. 2:15). For believers, this victory
          means that “the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in
          the world” (1 John 4:4). While Satan’s influence persists, his power
          is limited by God’s sovereign control. He cannot act beyond the
          boundaries set by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan’s defeat is not only a present reality but also a future
          certainty. Revelation 20:10 declares that he will be cast into the
          lake of fire, where he will face eternal judgment. This assurance
          provides hope and confidence for believers, knowing that evil will not
          have the final word.
        </p>

        <h2>Satan’s Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Though formidable, Satan is a created being and does not possess
          divine attributes. He is neither omniscient, omnipresent, nor
          omnipotent. His power, though significant, is finite and subject to
          God’s authority. As Martin Luther famously stated, “The devil is God’s
          devil,” highlighting Satan’s inability to operate outside of God’s
          sovereign will.
        </p>
        <p>
          This understanding prevents a dualistic view of good and evil as equal
          forces in opposition. Instead, Satan’s rebellion and activity are
          framed within the overarching plan of God, who uses even opposition to
          accomplish His purposes and glorify His name.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Implications for Believers</h2>
        <p>
          Believers are called to take Satan’s reality seriously without
          succumbing to fear. Awareness of his strategies equips Christians to
          stand firm in faith, resisting his attacks through reliance on God’s
          Word, prayer, and the power of the Holy Spirit. Paul’s exhortation to
          put on the full armor of God (Eph. 6:10–18) emphasizes the need for
          spiritual readiness in the face of ongoing opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confidence in Christ’s victory allows believers to live boldly,
          knowing that Satan’s schemes cannot ultimately prevail. By remaining
          steadfast in faith and trusting in God’s sovereignty, Christians
          participate in the triumph of Christ over the powers of darkness,
          awaiting the day when Satan’s defeat is fully realized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the believer’s posture toward Satan is one of vigilance
          and confidence. As Scripture assures, God’s power is greater than any
          force of evil, and His purposes for His people will stand unshaken for
          eternity.

        <h1>God Made Human Beings in His Image</h1>
        <h2>The Meaning of God’s Image</h2>
        <p>
          The opening chapters of Genesis declare the unique dignity and purpose
          of humanity, stating that God made human beings in His own image (Gen.
          1:26–27). This concept, echoed throughout Scripture (Gen. 5:1; 9:6;
          James 3:9), highlights the distinctiveness of humans among God’s
          creation. To be made in God’s image means to reflect and represent God
          on earth, mirroring His holy ways and acting as His deputies over
          creation. This calling defines the essence of humanity; to the extent
          that we fulfill it, we fulfill our true purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of God (Latin: *imago Dei*) in humans encompasses qualities
          that reflect God’s nature: rationality, creativity, moral uprightness,
          relational capacity, and dominion over creation. Genesis 1:1–25
          portrays God as personal, intelligent, purposeful, and good, and these
          characteristics are reflected in humanity’s design. Humans were
          created to communicate with God and one another, to rule creation
          responsibly, and to embody God’s moral excellence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Components of God’s Image</h2>
        <p>God’s image in humanity can be understood through several facets:</p>
        <p>
          (a) **Spiritual Nature**: Humans are “living beings” (Gen. 2:7;
          Eccles. 12:7), endowed with self-consciousness, intellect, and will.
          This spiritual nature allows for knowledge, thought, and deliberate
          action, reflecting God’s rational and purposeful character.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) **Moral Uprightness**: Humanity was created morally upright,
          capable of living in holiness and reflecting God’s moral purity. While
          the Fall corrupted this capacity, it is progressively restored in
          believers through Christ (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) **Dominion Over Creation**: Humanity was given the role of
          stewarding the earth, exercising dominion as God’s representatives
          (Gen. 1:28–30). This responsibility highlights humanity’s unique
          authority and accountability in relation to other creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) **Immortality**: The human soul, unlike other creatures, possesses
          immortality. This capacity for eternal existence underscores
          humanity’s enduring significance in God’s plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) **The Body**: While God is spirit and does not have a body, the
          human body is integral to expressing and experiencing God-like
          activities, such as exercising dominion and forming relationships. The
          incarnation and resurrection of Jesus Christ affirm the enduring
          importance of the human body, both now and in eternity.
        </p>

        <h2>The Impact of the Fall</h2>
        <p>
          The Fall of Adam and Eve profoundly marred the image of God in
          humanity. While the structural aspects of the image—humanity’s
          intellectual and relational capacities—remain intact, the functional
          aspects were corrupted. Humans became slaves to sin, unable to reflect
          God’s holiness or fulfill their calling as His representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, the image of God is not entirely erased. It persists as
          a testament to humanity’s unique relationship with God, even in a
          fallen state (Gen. 9:6). The work of Christ begins the process of
          restoring the image of God in believers, a process that will be
          completed in sanctification and glorification. Paul describes this
          restoration as being conformed to the image of Christ, who perfectly
          embodies the image of God (Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:15).
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of Christ in Restoring God’s Image</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ, as the incarnate Son of God, is the perfect image of God
          (Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3). His life, death, and resurrection provide the
          means by which believers are renewed in God’s image. Through union
          with Christ, believers are empowered to reflect God’s holiness,
          righteousness, and love in increasing measure (2 Cor. 3:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          The resurrection of Christ also affirms the enduring significance of
          the human body. Just as Christ’s glorified body represents the
          fullness of redeemed humanity, so too will believers share in this
          glorification, living as embodied beings in the new creation (1 Cor.
          15:42–49).
        </p>

        <h2>Living as God’s Image-Bearers</h2>
        <p>
          To live as God’s image-bearers is to fulfill the purpose for which
          humanity was created: to reflect God’s character and represent His
          rule on earth. This involves worship, stewardship, and relationships
          that honor God and serve His creation. In Christ, believers are
          empowered to live out this calling, demonstrating the transformative
          power of the gospel in every aspect of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the image of God will not be perfectly restored until the final
          redemption, every step of growth in holiness and love reflects God’s
          work of renewal. Believers can look forward with hope to the day when
          they will fully bear the image of the glorified Christ, perfectly
          reflecting God’s character and glory for eternity.
