        <h1>The Holy Spirit Equips the Church</h1>
        <h2>The Role of Spiritual Gifts in the Church</h2>
        <p>
          In Ephesians 4:7, 11–12, the Apostle Paul writes, “But to each one of
          us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.… He … gave some to
          be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to
          be pastors and teachers, to prepare God’s people for works of service,
          so that the body of Christ may be built up.” These verses highlight
          the essential role that spiritual gifts play in the life of the
          church. The Holy Spirit equips believers with gifts, enabling them to
          serve God and each other in ways that strengthen the body of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual gifts are not just for personal edification but are given
          for the benefit of the whole church. Paul stresses that each member of
          the church has a role to play, with the goal being to build up the
          church and bring it to maturity in Christ (Eph. 4:16). The gifts, both
          formal and informal, are given so that the church can grow in faith,
          love, and service. This growth occurs as every member contributes
          their unique gifts to the work of the body.
        </p>

        <h2>The Nature of Spiritual Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          The term “gift” in the New Testament refers to a “donation,” an
          expression of grace. Spiritual gifts are not earned or deserved but
          are given by Christ to His church. Paul explains in Ephesians 4 that
          these gifts include leadership roles such as apostles, prophets,
          evangelists, and pastors-teachers, who prepare God’s people for works
          of service. These gifts are given by the ascended Christ and are
          essential for the functioning and health of the church. The church’s
          leaders are called to equip others, ensuring that every believer
          understands and fulfills their calling to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gifts of the Holy Spirit are often referred to by two terms in the
          New Testament: "charismata" (gifts of grace) and "pneumatika"
          (spiritual gifts). Both terms underscore that these abilities are
          manifestations of God’s grace and the power of the Holy Spirit at work
          in the lives of believers (1 Cor. 12:4–1). Despite the complexities
          and debates surrounding the nature of specific gifts, three
          certainties stand out in understanding spiritual gifts.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Characteristics of Spiritual Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          First, spiritual gifts are abilities given to believers to express,
          celebrate, and display Christ. These gifts are intended to help build
          up others in the faith and communicate the truth of the gospel. The
          exercise of spiritual gifts is meant to reveal Christ in a way that
          strengthens the church and advances God’s kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, spiritual gifts can be divided into two categories: gifts of
          speech and gifts of loving, practical helpfulness. Gifts of speech,
          such as prophecy, teaching, and exhortation, involve communicating
          God’s truth to others. Gifts of helpfulness, such as serving, giving,
          leading, and showing mercy, involve meeting the practical and
          emotional needs of others. These categories are not meant to elevate
          one type of gift over another, but rather to highlight the diversity
          of gifts within the church. Both categories are essential for the
          church’s growth and health. No matter the gift, it must be used to
          build up the body of Christ and fulfill the mission of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, every Christian has been given at least one spiritual gift. No
          one is without a gift, and it is each believer’s responsibility to
          discover, develop, and fully utilize the gifts God has entrusted to
          them (1 Cor. 12:7; Eph. 4:7). Spiritual gifts are not to be hoarded or
          ignored but used for the common good of the church. Every member plays
          a vital role in the body of Christ, contributing to the church’s
          growth and the advancement of God’s kingdom.
        </p>

        <h2>The Church and Spiritual Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament presents the church as a community where every
          member is called to serve and contribute to the whole. Spiritual gifts
          are given not only for personal edification but for the building up of
          the entire body. The ideal is for all believers to be engaged in
          ministry, using their gifts in cooperation with one another. Church
          leaders, such as elders and deacons, play a vital role in facilitating
          and overseeing this ministry, ensuring that all gifts are used
          properly and in an orderly manner (Eph. 4:11–13).
        </p>
        <p>
          The body of Christ grows as each part does its work (Eph. 4:16).
          Spiritual gifts are meant to be exercised in a spirit of love and
          humility, with the goal of glorifying God and serving others. When
          each believer faithfully uses their gifts, the church becomes a
          vibrant and mature community of faith, fulfilling its mission in the
          world. Spiritual gifts are not just for the church’s benefit but also
          for the world, as the church demonstrates the love and power of Christ
          through its actions.
