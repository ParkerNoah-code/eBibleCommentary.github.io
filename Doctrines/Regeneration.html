        <h1>The Christian Is Born Again</h1>
        <h2>The Concept of Regeneration</h2>
        <p>
          Regeneration is a profound New Testament doctrine, first introduced by
          Jesus in his conversation with Nicodemus. In John 3:3, Jesus states,
          “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is
          born again.” This concept highlights the necessity of a spiritual
          transformation that transcends mere external adherence to religious
          practices. Even for a devout Jew like Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized that
          entering the kingdom of God required an inward renewal wrought by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus likened this transformation to being “born again,” a metaphor
          that vividly illustrates the comprehensive and foundational nature of
          the change. It signifies a divine renovation of the heart, where a new
          disposition is implanted—one characterized by godly desires,
          intentions, and actions that lead to a life aligned with the gospel.
          This new birth results in a positive response to Jesus as Savior and
          Lord, marking the beginning of eternal life.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of Water and the Spirit</h2>
        <p>
          In John 3:5, Jesus elaborates on the nature of regeneration, saying,
          “No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and
          the Spirit.” This statement recalls Ezekiel 36:25–27, where God
          promises to cleanse his people from sin’s defilement (symbolized by
          water) and to give them a new heart by placing his Spirit within them.
          This Old Testament prophecy finds its fulfillment in the new birth,
          which cleanses and renews the individual, enabling them to live in
          obedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus reproaches Nicodemus for his lack of understanding, pointing out
          that as a teacher of Israel, he should have recognized the scriptural
          foundation of spiritual renewal. This underscores the importance of
          recognizing regeneration as a divine act, essential for true faith and
          discipleship.
        </p>

        <h2>The Evidence of Regeneration</h2>
        <p>
          Regeneration is not merely a theoretical concept; it manifests
          tangibly in the lives of believers. According to John’s epistles,
          belief in Jesus’ incarnation and atonement, accompanied by faith,
          love, holiness, and righteousness, are all fruits and evidences of
          being born of God (1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4). These traits
          demonstrate the transformative power of regeneration, confirming the
          presence of new spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This connection between new birth and conversion is inseparable. While
          regeneration is a sovereign work of God, it invariably leads to a
          conscious turning to Christ in faith and repentance. Conversely,
          genuine conversion is impossible without the preceding work of
          regeneration.
        </p>

        <h2>Regeneration and Effectual Calling</h2>
        <p>
          Regeneration is closely linked to the doctrine of effectual calling.
          In most cases, the new birth occurs in the context of hearing and
          understanding the gospel, as the Holy Spirit illuminates its truth and
          relevance. This illumination draws individuals to recognize their sin
          and embrace Christ as their Savior, marking the decisive moment of
          spiritual awakening.
        </p>
        <p>
          While infant regeneration is a possibility when God so wills (as
          evidenced in Luke 1:15, 41–44), the typical experience of regeneration
          aligns with the gospel call and its Spirit-enabled reception. In this
          sense, regeneration is the decisive element in effectual calling,
          bringing the spiritually dead to life in Christ (Eph. 2:1–10).
        </p>

        <h2>The Sovereign Work of God</h2>
        <p>
          Regeneration is entirely the work of God, accomplished by the Holy
          Spirit. It is monergistic, meaning that it is solely initiated and
          performed by God without any contribution from human effort or will.
          This divine act raises the elect from spiritual death to spiritual
          life, making faith in Christ its immediate fruit rather than its
          cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Augustine described it, regeneration is an act of “prevenient
          grace”—the grace that precedes and enables human responsiveness to
          God. This foundational work ensures that salvation is wholly of grace,
          highlighting God’s initiative and glory in the redemption of sinners.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Regeneration is the cornerstone of the Christian life, marking the
          transition from spiritual death to life in Christ. It is a sovereign
          work of God, effecting an inward renewal that manifests in faith,
          obedience, and a transformed character. As Jesus declared, no one can
          see the kingdom of God without this new birth, for it is the beginning
          of a life reconciled to God and aligned with his eternal purposes.
