        <h1>The Final Judgment</h1>
        <h2>The Certainty of Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the final judgment is a central and unavoidable truth
          in Scripture, firmly framing the message of God's grace. Paul
          emphasizes the certainty of this judgment throughout his letters,
          particularly in Romans, where he discusses God's righteous wrath
          against sin (Rom. 2:5–16). He underscores that Jesus Christ saves
          believers from the coming wrath, a judgment that will be revealed in
          full on the "day of God’s wrath" (1 Thess. 1:10; Rom. 2:5; Eph. 5:6).
          The New Testament constantly affirms that all will face judgment,
          whether they are believers or not, and this judgment will be carried
          out by Jesus Christ on behalf of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ returns, all people, living and dead, will be raised for
          judgment (Matt. 13:40–43; John 5:22–30; 2 Cor. 5:10). This event will
          be beyond human comprehension, but it is certain, as Scripture
          consistently points to the truth that all humans will give an account
          of themselves before God. The judgment will reveal the deeds of every
          individual and assign them their eternal destiny based on their
          actions and the state of their hearts (Rom. 2:6–11).
        </p>

        <h2>The Basis of Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          The final judgment will be based on two key principles: the deeds of
          individuals and the righteousness of Christ. For those who are in
          Christ, their sins have been atoned for, and they will be judged
          according to the righteousness of Christ. As servants of Christ, they
          have learned to love righteousness and will be rewarded for their
          faithful lives (Rom. 2:6). For those who reject Christ, they will face
          judgment based on their demerit, the evil they have chosen, and their
          rejection of God's grace (Rom. 2:6–11). How much they knew of God's
          will and how they responded to it will also be part of their judgment
          (Matt. 11:20–24).
        </p>
        <p>
          The judgment will be a public demonstration of God's perfect justice.
          In a world rife with sin and suffering, questions often arise about
          whether God can be both sovereign and just. The final judgment will
          answer these questions, as God's righteous judgment will be made
          manifest for all to see. In this moment, God will vindicate His
          justice, showing that His wrath is not arbitrary but a response to the
          rejection of His holiness (Ps. 50:16–21; Rev. 6:10; 16:5–7).
        </p>

        <h2>The Judgment of Those Who Profess Faith</h2>
        <p>
          For those who profess faith in Christ, the judgment will reveal the
          true nature of their faith. Jesus Himself taught that actions reveal
          the authenticity of one’s faith (Matt. 12:36–37). If someone's faith
          is genuine, it will be evidenced by a life transformed by the Holy
          Spirit, marked by a hatred of sin and a commitment to loving service
          toward God and others (Matt. 7:21–23). Those who profess faith but do
          not live according to Christ’s teachings will be exposed as
          hypocrites. Their failure to live a transformed life will prove that
          their profession was not the fruit of a regenerated heart (Matt.
          12:33–35).
        </p>
        <p>
          The judgment will expose all things, and each person will receive from
          God according to their true character (1 Cor. 4:5). Even the most
          hidden aspects of a person’s life—words, thoughts, and actions—will be
          laid bare. Those whose faith was not sincere, whose lives were marked
          by sin and selfishness, will face the consequences of their choices
          (Matt. 18:23–35; 25:34–46; James 2:14–26). The judgment will be the
          ultimate revelation of who truly belongs to Christ and who does not.
        </p>

        <h2>The Judgment of Fallen Angels</h2>
        <p>
          The final judgment is not limited to humans alone. Fallen angels, or
          demons, will also be judged on the last day (Matt. 8:29; Jude 6).
          While Scripture does not provide many details about the exact role
          believers will play in the judgment of angels, Paul makes it clear
          that the saints will be involved in the judgment process (1 Cor. 6:3).
          This involvement signifies that the victory of Christ over evil is
          complete and that His people will share in His triumph.
        </p>

        <h2>The Call to Repentance</h2>
        <p>
          The certainty of future judgment should serve as a call to present
          repentance. The only way to be prepared for the judgment is through
          repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The New Testament repeatedly
          warns that only those who have turned from sin and trusted in Christ
          for salvation will be ready for the coming judgment (Acts 17:30–31;
          Matt. 25:1–13). Judgment is not just a future event to be feared; it
          is a present reality that demands a response. Those who repent now,
          seeking forgiveness through Christ, will be prepared when the judgment
          seat is revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For believers, the final judgment will be a moment of vindication,
          when they are rewarded for their faithfulness and welcomed into
          eternal life with Christ. For those who reject Christ, it will be a
          moment of eternal separation from God, the ultimate consequence of
          their refusal to repent and accept the grace freely offered through
          Jesus Christ.
