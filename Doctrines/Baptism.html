        <h1>This Rite Exhibits Union with Christ</h1>
        <h2>The Biblical Meaning of Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          In Romans 6:3–4, Paul beautifully articulates the significance of
          baptism: "Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into
          Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried
          with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was
          raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live
          a new life." Baptism, therefore, is not just a symbolic act but a
          profound declaration of union with Christ in His death, burial, and
          resurrection. Through this sacrament, believers are not only publicly
          identified with Christ but also experience the transformative power of
          His resurrection life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptism serves as a sign from God that signifies several key elements
          of salvation. It symbolizes inward cleansing and the remission of sins
          (Acts 22:16; 1 Cor. 6:11; Eph. 5:25–27), the regenerative work of the
          Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5), and the guarantee of the believer's security
          in Christ through the presence of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13; Eph.
          1:13–14). Most fundamentally, baptism points to union with Christ,
          which is the source of all salvation. This union assures believers of
          God's gift of new life in Christ, and it commits them to live in a
          manner worthy of this calling, as faithful disciples of Jesus.
        </p>

        <h2>The Trinitarian Nature of Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          Christ’s instruction to baptize "in the name of the Father, the Son,
          and the Holy Spirit" (Matt. 28:19) highlights the Trinitarian
          foundation of baptism. This formula signifies the believer’s entry
          into a covenant relationship with the triune God, marked by
          acceptance, communion, and commitment to each Person of the Godhead.
          Baptism thus represents not only union with Christ but also the
          believer's submission to the direction and leadership of God Himself,
          symbolized by the immersion into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul’s reference to the Israelites being “baptized into Moses” (1 Cor.
          10:2) illustrates the concept of being placed under the leadership of
          a covenant representative. In the New Testament, baptism into the name
          of the triune God signifies submission to the authority and governance
          of God. It is a ritual act that formalizes one's inclusion in the
          covenant community of God’s people, ensuring that the believer is now
          guided by God’s will.
        </p>

        <h2>The Significance of Baptism as a Once-for-All Event</h2>
        <p>
          Baptism, as a sign of a one-time, transformative event, is to be
          administered only once. It symbolizes a decisive break with the old
          life of sin and a new beginning in Christ. While the outward sign of
          baptism does not automatically effect the inward change, it is an act
          of obedience that reflects the believer’s faith. Even if a person’s
          profession of faith turns out to be insincere, as was the case with
          Simon Magus in Acts 8:13–24, the baptism remains valid. If such an
          individual later comes to genuine faith, they need not be rebaptized.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the mode of baptism, the New Testament does not prescribe
          a specific method. Baptism may be carried out by immersion, dipping,
          or sprinkling, as all three methods meet the requirements of the Greek
          verb *baptizo*, which means "to immerse" or "to wash." The essential
          symbolism is that baptism involves the believer passing through
          cleansing water and emerging from it, signifying purification and new
          life.
        </p>

        <h2>The Debate Over Infant Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most significant theological debates surrounding baptism
          concerns the practice of infant baptism. Historically, most Christian
          traditions have practiced infant baptism, viewing it as a continuation
          of the covenantal principle established in the Old Testament, where
          infants were circumcised as a sign of their inclusion in God’s
          covenant (Gen. 17:9–14). The practice of infant baptism is rooted in
          the belief that the coming of Christ did not abolish the principle of
          family solidarity in the covenant community. As such, infants of
          believers should receive baptism as a sign of their inclusion in God’s
          covenant and community.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Baptist churches, which emphasize believer’s baptism, argue
          that baptism should only be administered to those who have personally
          professed faith. From their perspective, infant baptism is not valid
          because it does not align with the New Testament’s emphasis on
          personal faith preceding baptism. Baptists view baptism as a public
          declaration of personal faith, and since infants cannot make such a
          declaration, they believe that infant baptism does not fulfill the
          biblical mandate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Reformed tradition rejects this Baptist perspective, affirming
          that the New Covenant includes the principle of household inclusion,
          meaning that children of believing parents are rightful members of the
          covenant community. Baptism, in this sense, serves as a sign of the
          child’s covenant status, much like circumcision did in the Old
          Testament. This theological difference highlights the ongoing debate
          between Baptist and Paedobaptist (infant-baptizing) traditions.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of Baptism in the Christian Life</h2>
        <p>
          Despite these differences, both Baptist and Paedobaptist communities
          agree that baptism is an essential rite in the Christian faith. It
          represents a new identity in Christ, marking a believer’s entry into
          the body of Christ. Baptism serves not only as a sign of God's
          promises but also as a call to live a transformed life in obedience to
          Christ. Whether administered to infants or adults, baptism signifies a
          profound shift in the believer’s identity and calls for a new way of
          living that is centered on the gospel of Jesus Christ.
