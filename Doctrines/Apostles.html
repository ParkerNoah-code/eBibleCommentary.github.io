        <h1>Jesus' Representatives Exercised His Authority</h1>
        <h2>The Role and Authority of the Apostles</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament distinguishes between the terms “disciples” and
          “apostles.” While both refer to individuals closely associated with
          Jesus, their roles differ significantly. A disciple is a “pupil” or
          “learner” who follows a teacher to be instructed, while an apostle is
          an “emissary” or “representative,” one who is sent out with full
          authority from the sender. In this sense, the apostles were not just
          followers of Jesus but were divinely appointed representatives sent to
          spread His teachings and establish His church. Just as Jesus was sent
          by the Father, the apostles were sent by Jesus, carrying His authority
          and message (Mark 3:14; 1 Pet. 1:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostles were given a unique role in the New Testament narrative,
          functioning as evangelists, church planters, and pastors. In these
          roles, they carried forward the work that Jesus had initiated during
          His earthly ministry. Jesus, as God’s Son, claimed divine authority
          for His words (John 12:49–50), and the apostles, as His
          representatives, also claimed Christ's divine authority for their own
          words (1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Thess. 3:6). This connection between Christ's
          authority and the apostles' authority was crucial in establishing the
          foundation for the early church's beliefs and practices.
        </p>

        <h2>The Appointment of Matthias and the Role of Paul</h2>
        <p>
          In Acts 1:15–26, we see the apostles before Pentecost praying and
          casting lots to choose a successor to Judas. This process of casting
          lots may seem unusual, but it was seen as a way of seeking divine
          guidance. The question of whether Matthias was truly Christ's intended
          replacement for Judas, or whether Paul, as the “apostle to the
          Gentiles” (Romans 11:13; Galatians 2:8), was the legitimate thirteenth
          apostle, remains an open question. Paul himself, however, insisted
          that his apostleship was authentic because he had encountered the
          risen Christ on the road to Damascus and was personally commissioned
          by Him (Acts 26:16–18).
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul’s apostleship was affirmed by James, Peter, and John, who
          accepted him as a fellow apostle (Gal. 2:9). Furthermore, God
          confirmed Paul’s apostolic authority through signs and wonders (2 Cor.
          12:12) and the success of his ministry (1 Cor. 9:2). This indicates
          that Paul’s apostleship was as legitimate as that of the original
          twelve, despite the unusual circumstances surrounding his calling.
        </p>

        <h2>The Apostles as Agents of Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          The apostles played a crucial role in the unfolding of God’s
          revelation. They were not just leaders of the early church but also
          agents of divine revelation, conveying truths that would become the
          foundation of Christian belief and practice. As Jesus' appointed
          representatives, they had the authority to speak and teach in His
          name. This authority was recognized in the early church and was
          integral to the establishment of Christian doctrine and practice (2
          Cor. 10:8; 13:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are no apostles today, the apostolic ministry continues
          through the writings of the apostles, which form the core of the
          Christian Scriptures. The teachings of the apostles, preserved in the
          New Testament, continue to hold authoritative weight in the life of
          the church. The absence of new apostles does not place the
          contemporary church at a disadvantage because the Holy Spirit
          continues to apply the apostolic teachings through the Scriptures. The
          Christian community today is still guided by the teachings that were
          given by the apostles, who spoke with the authority of Christ.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The apostles were foundational to the early church, not only as
          witnesses of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection but also as divinely
          appointed representatives who exercised Christ’s authority in
          spreading the gospel and establishing the church. Their unique role as
          bearers of God’s revelation and as the first leaders of the Christian
          movement has left an indelible mark on the church’s history. While
          there are no apostles today, the apostolic teachings continue to guide
          the church through the Scriptures, and the Holy Spirit continues to
          apply these teachings to God’s people.
