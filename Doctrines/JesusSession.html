        <h1>Jesus Reigns in Heaven</h1>
        <h2>The Heavenly Session of Christ</h2>
        <p>
          The present reign of Jesus Christ in heaven, commonly called His
          "heavenly session," is foundational to understanding His role as Lord
          and mediator. The term "session," derived from the Latin *sessio*
          (meaning "sitting"), refers to Jesus’ position at the right hand of
          the Father, as described in Hebrews 1:3: "After he had provided
          purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in
          heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          While Jesus is sometimes portrayed as standing, walking among His
          people, or riding to battle (Acts 7:56; Rev. 2:1; 19:11–16), the image
          of His sitting signifies authority rather than inactivity. It reflects
          His sovereign reign over all creation, accomplished through His
          redemptive work and ascension.
        </p>

        <h2>Christ as King and Priest</h2>
        <p>
          Psalm 110 provides a foundational picture of the Messiah’s dual role
          as king and priest. The psalm proclaims that God has set the Messiah
          at His right hand to rule as king, subduing all enemies, and to serve
          as priest, channeling God’s grace eternally (vv. 1, 4). The New
          Testament applies this imagery to Jesus Christ, highlighting His
          ongoing reign since the Ascension (Acts 2:34–35; Heb. 1:13; 10:12;
          Matt. 22:44).
        </p>
        <p>
          As king, Christ exercises authority over all realms, both angelic and
          human (Matt. 28:18; 1 Pet. 3:22). As priest, He intercedes for His
          people and ensures the application of His redemptive work. This dual
          role guarantees that Jesus not only rules but also ministers grace and
          mercy to His followers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Kingdom of Christ</h2>
        <p>
          Christ’s kingdom is manifest most directly in the church, which He
          heads as His body (Eph. 1:22–23). He governs the church by His Word
          and Spirit, guiding it in truth and empowering it for service. Unlike
          the Old Testament kingdom, which involved theocratic rule, the New
          Testament church operates without the sword. Jesus declared, "My
          kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36), emphasizing that His rule
          is spiritual rather than enforced by earthly power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, Christ also reigns over secular authorities, using them
          to maintain civil peace and order. While the church and state function
          in separate spheres, believers are called to submit to governing
          authorities (Rom. 13:1–7) and to live as witnesses to Christ’s
          lordship in every area of life. This dual reality reminds Christians
          that all people, whether rulers or citizens, will ultimately answer to
          Christ as Judge (Matt. 25:31; Acts 17:31).
        </p>

        <h2>Christ’s Intercession and Final Victory</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus’ session at the Father’s right hand includes His role as
          intercessor. As the reigning Lord, He continually intervenes on behalf
          of His people, ensuring that the benefits of His redemptive work are
          applied to them. His intercession is not mere supplication but an
          authoritative distribution of grace, made possible by His completed
          sacrifice (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25).
        </p>
        <p>
          This heavenly ministry will continue until all enemies are defeated,
          including death, the last enemy. At His return, Christ will raise the
          dead for judgment (John 5:28–29) and deliver the kingdom to the
          Father, bringing the mediatorial kingdom to its consummation (1 Cor.
          15:24–28).
        </p>

        <h2>Encouragement for Believers</h2>
        <p>
          The knowledge of Christ’s session offers profound encouragement to
          believers. It assures them that their Lord reigns with absolute
          authority and intercedes for them continually. His reign guarantees
          that no enemy, not even death, can ultimately prevail. Christians are
          reminded that their King is not only sovereign but also deeply
          involved in their lives, guiding, empowering, and sustaining them in
          every circumstance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Christ’s session calls believers to live under His
          lordship, acknowledging Him as Judge and seeking to do His will in
          every sphere of life. His reign is a reminder that history is moving
          toward a climactic fulfillment when all things will be brought under
          His perfect rule.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The heavenly session of Jesus Christ highlights His exalted position
          as King, Priest, and Judge. From His throne, He reigns over all
          creation, intercedes for His people, and directs history toward its
          ultimate culmination. Believers find comfort and motivation in the
          assurance of Christ’s sovereign rule, living in anticipation of the
          day when His kingdom will be fully realized, and all things will be
          made new.
