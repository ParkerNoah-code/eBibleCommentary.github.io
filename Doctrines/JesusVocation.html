        <h1>Jesus Christ’s Mission Revealed at His Baptism</h1>
        <h2>The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan</h2>
        <p>
          The baptism of Jesus marks a significant moment in His ministry and in
          the narrative of the Gospel. As Mark recounts: "At that time Jesus
          came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
          As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open
          and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from
          heaven: ‘You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased’"
          (Mark 1:9–11). This event signifies not only the inauguration of
          Jesus' public mission but also a profound revelation of the
          Trinitarian nature of God.
        </p>

        <h2>Continuity and Contrast: John’s Baptism and Christian Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          John the Baptist's baptism was a preparatory rite, calling people to
          repentance and readiness for the coming of the Messiah. It symbolized
          cleansing and the remission of sins (Mark 1:4; Acts 2:38). However,
          Christian baptism, instituted by Jesus (Matt. 28:19), pointed directly
          to a relationship with the risen Christ. Those baptized by John were
          later required to undergo Christian baptism (Acts 19:5), demonstrating
          that John's baptism was not an end in itself but a precursor to the
          fuller reality brought by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike John’s baptism, which prepared people for the coming judgment
          of the Messiah (Matt. 3:7–12), Christian baptism serves as an
          initiatory sign of belonging to Christ. It signifies the believer's
          union with Jesus in His death and resurrection and the gift of the
          Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; Rom. 6:3–4). Thus, while John's baptism was a
          call to readiness, Christian baptism marks the fulfillment of that
          readiness in the new life brought by Christ.
        </p>

        <h2>The Radical Nature of John’s Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          John’s baptism was revolutionary. Traditionally, only Gentiles
          converting to Judaism were required to undergo a symbolic washing. For
          John to demand that Jews themselves undergo this rite was shocking and
          perceived as heretical by many Jewish leaders (Matt. 21:25–26). This
          radical act reflected the universality of sin and the need for
          repentance, regardless of ethnic or religious heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus, despite being sinless, insisted on participating in John's
          baptism. By doing so, He identified Himself with the sinners He came
          to redeem and demonstrated His submission to God’s law as Israel's
          representative. This act "to fulfill all righteousness" (Matt. 3:15)
          underscores Jesus’ role as the Messiah who would bear humanity’s sin
          and fulfill the demands of God's justice (cf. Isa. 53:11).
        </p>

        <h2>The Manifestation of the Trinity</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus’ baptism is one of the clearest manifestations of the Trinity in
          Scripture. As Jesus rose from the water, the heavens were torn open,
          and the Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove, while the
          Father's voice proclaimed His approval: "You are my Son, whom I love;
          with you I am well pleased" (Mark 1:11). This divine affirmation
          reveals the intimate relationship between the Father, Son, and Spirit,
          and it publicly identifies Jesus as the beloved Son and Spirit-bearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The descending dove signifies the Spirit’s anointing of Jesus, marking
          Him as the one who would baptize others with the Spirit (John
          1:32–33). This act not only inaugurates Jesus' ministry but also
          heralds the arrival of the age of the Spirit, fulfilling the prophetic
          hopes of Israel (Luke 4:18–21). Jesus, already filled with the Spirit,
          is now publicly revealed as the one through whom the Spirit would be
          poured out on humanity.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The baptism of Jesus is a moment of profound theological and
          redemptive significance. It bridges the Old Testament expectations of
          a Messiah with the New Testament reality of salvation in Christ. It
          reveals the Trinitarian nature of God, inaugurates Jesus' mission as
          the Spirit-anointed redeemer, and establishes the foundation for
          Christian baptism as a sign of union with Christ and entry into the
          life of the Spirit. In His baptism, Jesus identifies with humanity's
          sin and initiates the redemptive work that would lead to the cross and
          resurrection, fulfilling all righteousness on behalf of those He came
          to save.
