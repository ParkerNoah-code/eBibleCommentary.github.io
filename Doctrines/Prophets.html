        <h1>God Sent Messengers to Declare His Will</h1>
        <h2>The Role of the Prophets</h2>
        <p>
          In Deuteronomy 18:18, God promises, "I will raise up for them a
          prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his
          mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him." Prophets were
          chosen instruments of divine revelation, tasked with conveying God’s
          mind and will to His people. The canonical prophets, whose writings
          constitute a significant portion of the Old Testament, stood as
          intermediaries between God and humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          These prophets, empowered by the Holy Spirit, spoke with divine
          authority (2 Pet. 1:19–21). They began their messages with phrases
          like “This is what the LORD says,” indicating that their words came
          directly from Yahweh. As members of God’s council (Jer. 23:22), they
          were entrusted with both understanding and communicating His purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Foretelling and Forthtelling</h2>
        <p>
          While prophecy often included prediction (foretelling), its primary
          focus was on declaring God’s message for the present (forthtelling).
          Prophets called the people to repentance, urging them to turn back to
          covenant faithfulness. Their warnings often contained predictions of
          judgment, but these were paired with promises of restoration through
          God’s coming king and kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophets were reformers, striving to enforce God’s law and renew
          the nation’s commitment to Him. They were deeply concerned with the
          spiritual and moral state of Israel, calling out sin and guiding the
          people back to their covenant obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>The Prophets as Intercessors</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to delivering God’s messages, prophets interceded for the
          nation. They spoke to God on behalf of the people with the same
          fervency with which they spoke to the people on behalf of God. This
          dual role is exemplified in Moses (Exod. 32:30–32), Samuel (1 Sam.
          7:5–9), and Isaiah (2 Kings 19:4). Their prayers were a vital part of
          their ministry, demonstrating their deep love for the people and their
          reliance on God’s mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there were times when God instructed prophets not to pray for
          the nation because of its persistent rebellion (Jer. 7:16; 11:14;
          14:11). This underscored the gravity of Israel’s sin and the necessity
          of repentance.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem of False Prophets</h2>
        <p>
          False prophets plagued Israel, presenting a distorted version of God’s
          message. These individuals often catered to popular opinion, offering
          reassurance instead of truth. They claimed divine inspiration while
          speaking their own dreams and desires, leading the people astray (1
          Kings 22:1–28; Jer. 23:9–40; Ezek. 13).
        </p>
        <p>
          True prophets stood in stark contrast to these deceivers, speaking
          boldly against sin and calling for genuine repentance. Their messages
          often faced resistance, but their faithfulness to God’s word marked
          them as His true messengers.
        </p>

        <h2>Prophets in the New Testament</h2>
        <p>
          The prophetic ministry continued into the New Testament, though its
          focus shifted with the coming of Christ. Revelation is explicitly
          identified as prophecy, given by God through Jesus Christ (Rev. 1:1–3;
          22:12–20). The apostles carried forward the prophetic tradition by
          delivering God’s instruction to His people, laying the foundation for
          the church (Eph. 2:20; 3:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          New Testament prophets, such as those mentioned in Romans 16:25–27,
          explained the fulfillment of Old Testament promises in Christ. The
          book of Hebrews, with its rich exposition of Christ as the ultimate
          fulfillment of God’s plan, exemplifies this prophetic ministry.
        </p>

        <h2>The Enduring Significance of the Prophets</h2>
        <p>
          The prophets’ messages remain vital for understanding God’s character
          and purposes. They reveal His holiness, justice, and mercy, and they
          point forward to the ultimate Prophet, Jesus Christ, who perfectly
          embodies and communicates God’s will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, their writings continue to guide believers, calling them to
          faithfulness, repentance, and hope in the promises of God. Through the
          prophets, God’s voice still speaks, reminding His people of His
          enduring covenant love and His sovereign plan for redemption.
