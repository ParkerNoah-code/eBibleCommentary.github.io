        <h1>God Sees and Knows</h1>
        <h2>The Scope of God's Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          Proverbs 15:3 declares, “The eyes of the LORD are everywhere, keeping
          watch on the wicked and the good.” This verse encapsulates the
          doctrine of God’s omniscience, the divine attribute of knowing all
          things. Unlike human knowledge, which is limited and fragmented, God’s
          knowledge is perfect, complete, and infinite. He knows everything
          about everyone and everything at all times (Job 24:23; Psalm
          33:13–15).
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s omniscience extends beyond observable facts. He understands the
          hidden motives of human hearts (1 Samuel 16:7), the intricacies of
          creation (Psalm 139:13–16), and the complexities of every action and
          event in the world (Jeremiah 16:17). Furthermore, His knowledge is not
          limited to the present; He knows the past, the future, and even
          potential outcomes that never come to pass (1 Samuel 23:9–13; Isaiah
          48:18). This boundless knowledge demonstrates God’s unmatched wisdom
          and intelligence (Isaiah 40:28; Romans 11:33–36).
        </p>

        <h2>God’s Knowledge and His Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          God’s omniscience is inseparably linked to His sovereignty. He knows
          all things because He created all things, sustains them, and
          orchestrates them according to His eternal purposes (Ephesians 1:11).
          Every aspect of creation operates under His control, and every detail
          aligns with His perfect plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea that God could fully know all things without also governing
          them defies both Scripture and logic. As the sovereign Creator and
          Sustainer, God’s comprehensive knowledge ensures that He directs all
          things toward His glory and the ultimate good of His creation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Awe of God’s Omniscience</h2>
        <p>
          The Bible often portrays God’s omniscience as a source of awe and
          reverence. In Psalm 139:1–6, the psalmist marvels at God’s intimate
          knowledge of his life, exclaiming, “Such knowledge is too wonderful
          for me, too lofty for me to attain.” Similarly, Isaiah 40:13–14 asks,
          “Who can fathom the Spirit of the LORD, or instruct the LORD as his
          counselor?” These passages remind us of the infinite capacity of God’s
          mind, which surpasses human understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theologians have often noted that God’s knowledge is not acquired or
          stored like human knowledge. Rather, it is immediate, direct, and
          eternal. God does not "access" information or learn new things; He
          knows all things instinctively and simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h2>The Comfort and Challenge of God’s Omniscience</h2>
        <p>
          For Christians, God’s omniscience provides profound comfort and
          assurance. Isaiah 40:27–31 encourages believers with the truth that
          God’s knowledge encompasses every detail of their lives, ensuring that
          they are not forgotten or overlooked. His infinite awareness is a
          promise of His care and provision, as He is fully aware of every need,
          struggle, and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who reject God, however, His omniscience is a sobering
          reality. The truth that no thought, action, or motive is hidden from
          God’s sight underscores the inescapable nature of His judgment (Psalm
          94:1–11). In John 1:1–12, the omniscient God is revealed as both
          Creator and Judge, holding all accountable for their response to His
          light.
        </p>

        <h2>Responding to God’s Omniscience</h2>
        <p>
          The knowledge of God’s omniscience should inspire worship,
          accountability, and trust. For believers, it is an invitation to live
          transparently before Him, knowing that nothing is hidden from His
          sight (Hebrews 4:13). This truth also encourages believers to rest in
          God’s wisdom and care, confident that He knows their needs and directs
          their paths with perfect understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those outside the faith, God’s omniscience serves as a call to
          repentance and surrender. The reality of God’s all-seeing presence
          challenges individuals to recognize their need for forgiveness and
          seek the grace offered through Jesus Christ. Ultimately, God’s
          omniscience reveals His holiness, justice, and love, drawing all
          people to respond to Him in faith and obedience.
