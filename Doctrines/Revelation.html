        <h1>Revelation: Scripture as Divine Word</h1>
        <h2>The Centrality of Revelation in Christianity</h2>
        <p>
          Christianity, as the true worship and service of God—the Creator and
          Redeemer of humanity—rests firmly on the foundation of revelation.
          Without God’s proactive disclosure of Himself, humanity would remain
          in ignorance, unable to discern or engage with the divine. This act of
          revelation is enshrined in the Bible, a collection of sixty-six books:
          thirty-nine written before Christ’s incarnation (the Old Testament)
          and twenty-seven written after (the New Testament). These books
          collectively serve as the record, interpretation, expression, and
          embodiment of God’s self-disclosure, with the unifying themes of God
          and godliness permeating their content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "Scriptures" refers to sacred writings that, on one level,
          bear the testimony of the godly to their Creator and Redeemer. On a
          deeper level, the Scriptures represent God’s own testimony,
          communicated through human authors. Through divine inspiration, the
          authors produced texts that are at once fully human and fully divine.
          Therefore, the church rightly refers to the Scriptures as the Word of
          God, affirming both their divine origin and authoritative content.
        </p>

        <h2>Jesus and the Apostolic View of Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          Assurance of Scripture’s divine origin stems from the testimony of
          Jesus Christ and His apostles. Jesus, the incarnate Word of God,
          viewed the Old Testament as the written instruction of His heavenly
          Father, to which He Himself submitted (e.g., Matt. 4:4, 7, 10;
          5:19–20; 19:4–6; Luke 4:16–21). Furthermore, He affirmed its divine
          authority by fulfilling its promises and prophecies (Matt. 5:17–18;
          John 5:46). The apostles, following Christ’s example, recognized the
          Old Testament as “God-breathed,” inspired by the Spirit (2 Tim.
          3:15–17; 2 Pet. 1:21). This acknowledgment underscores the divine
          source and purpose of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament writings continue this divine legacy. Apostolic
          teachings, considered revealed truth (1 Cor. 2:12–13), are viewed as
          completing the canon of Scripture. Peter’s reference to Paul’s letters
          as Scripture (2 Pet. 3:15–16) and Paul’s apparent citation of Luke’s
          Gospel as Scripture (1 Tim. 5:18) reflect the early church’s
          recognition of these texts’ divine authority.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of Scripture in Godly Living</h2>
        <p>
          The principle of written directives from God for guiding His people
          has its roots in the Decalogue, inscribed by God on stone tablets
          (Exod. 32:15–16; 34:1). Moses, under divine instruction, further
          recorded laws and historical narratives to instruct Israel. Throughout
          Israel’s history, engaging with Scripture was central to personal and
          communal devotion (Josh. 1:7–8; Neh. 8; Ps. 119). In Christianity, the
          Old and New Testaments together form the basis for faith and practice,
          ensuring that believers align their lives with divine will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible, being both fully human and fully divine, demands reverence
          and acceptance of all its contents—whether history, poetry, prophecy,
          or teaching—as God’s authoritative instruction. Christians are called
          to respond with gratitude for the gift of Scripture, anchoring their
          faith and conduct in its teachings. Only by doing so can believers
          truly honor and please God.
