        <h1>God Is Love</h1>
        <h2>The Nature of God’s Love</h2>
        <p>
          The declaration that “God is love” (1 John 4:8) encapsulates the
          profound truth of God’s goodness as expressed through His self-giving
          nature. This love is rooted in the eternal relationship of mutual
          affection and honor within the Trinity. The Father loves the Son
          (Matt. 3:17; John 3:35), the Son loves the Father (John 14:31), and
          the Spirit glorifies and exalts both (John 16:13–14). This divine love
          overflows into creation, as God made angels and humans to share in His
          life, glorify Him, and experience the joy of His goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          When John speaks of God’s love in 1 John 4:9–10, he points
          specifically to the redemptive work of Christ. God’s love is not
          merely abstract or sentimental; it is concrete and sacrificial. John
          explains that God demonstrated His love by sending His Son to atone
          for human sin, enabling us to live through Him. This love is
          unprovoked by human merit; rather, “God loved us and sent his Son as
          an atoning sacrifice for our sins.” This self-sacrificing love defines
          God’s character and the heart of the gospel.
        </p>

        <h2>Particularity and Universality in God’s Love</h2>
        <p>
          While the New Testament emphasizes the universal scope of God’s love,
          passages like John 3:16–17 must be understood in context. God’s love
          for “the world” refers to the great multitude of the elect scattered
          across the globe, transcending ethnic and cultural barriers (John
          10:16; 11:52–53). It does not imply that every individual will receive
          salvation but highlights the global inclusivity of God’s redemptive
          plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          This focus on particularity does not diminish the universal
          expressions of God’s goodness. Psalm 145:9 affirms that “The LORD is
          good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.” God’s goodness is
          evident in His provision, sustaining all creation with generosity and
          care. However, the ultimate demonstration of His goodness is the
          saving grace offered through Christ’s sacrifice, which reconciles
          sinners to God and grants eternal life to those who believe (Rom.
          3:22–24; Eph. 2:1–10).
        </p>

        <h2>Expressions of God’s Goodness</h2>
        <p>
          God’s goodness encompasses various aspects, including mercy, patience,
          and faithfulness. His mercy, often described as compassion or pity,
          leads Him to rescue those in distress. The psalmist celebrates this
          mercy in Psalm 136, recounting God’s acts of deliverance and provision
          throughout Israel’s history. Similarly, His patience and
          long-suffering are seen in His restraint toward persistent sinners,
          giving them time to repent (Exod. 34:6; 2 Pet. 3:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          The supreme expression of God’s goodness is His saving grace. Romans
          5:8 declares, “God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we
          were still sinners, Christ died for us.” This grace, offered freely
          yet purchased at the cost of Christ’s life, is the heart of the
          gospel. It reflects the depth of God’s love, as He redeems those who
          deserve only condemnation and transforms them into heirs of His
          kingdom (Rom. 8:32–39; Eph. 3:14–18).
        </p>

        <h2>The Faithfulness of God</h2>
        <p>
          Another vital aspect of God’s goodness is His unwavering faithfulness.
          Unlike human promises, which are often broken, God’s commitments are
          unchanging and dependable. Lamentations 3:22–23 declares, “Because of
          the LORD’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never
          fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.” Even in
          difficult or uncertain times, believers can trust that God’s purposes
          will prevail, and His promises will be fulfilled (Josh. 23:14–15).
        </p>
        <p>
          Though His ways may sometimes seem inscrutable, God’s faithfulness is
          a sure foundation for faith and hope. The testimonies of scripture and
          the experiences of those who walk with Him affirm that “every promise
          has been fulfilled; not one has failed.” This faithfulness underscores
          the reliability of God’s goodness, offering believers solid ground on
          which to build their lives.
        </p>

        <h2>Living in Response to God’s Love</h2>
        <p>
          God’s love and goodness call for a response of gratitude, worship, and
          obedience. The psalmist exhorts, “Give thanks to the LORD, for he is
          good. His love endures forever” (Ps. 136:1). Gratitude for God’s
          kindness and grace should shape every aspect of the believer’s life,
          fostering a spirit of worship and devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, as recipients of divine love, believers are called to
          reflect that love in their relationships. Jesus’ command to “love one
          another as I have loved you” (John 13:34) echoes the self-giving
          nature of God’s love. By extending kindness, mercy, and forgiveness to
          others, Christians demonstrate the transforming power of God’s
          goodness in their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, God’s goodness and love are not just theological concepts
          but realities that transform hearts and lives. They reveal the
          character of a God who is both just and merciful, holy and
          compassionate—a God whose love endures forever.
