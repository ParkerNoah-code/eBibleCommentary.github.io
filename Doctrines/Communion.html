        <h1>This Rite Exhibits Communion with Christ</h1>
        <h2>The Biblical Foundation of the Lord’s Supper</h2>
        <p>
          In 1 Corinthians 11:23–26, Paul recounts the institution of the Lord's
          Supper: "For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you:
          The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he
          had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for
          you; do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way, after supper he
          took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do
          this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.' For whenever you
          eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until
          he comes." The Lord’s Supper is a sacrament, instituted by Christ,
          that serves as both a memorial of His death and a means of communion
          with Him. It is a communal meal shared by believers that embodies the
          new covenant relationship made possible by His sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord’s Supper is not merely a memorial but also a spiritual
          nourishment and a means of grace. The Westminster Confession (XXIX.1)
          explains that the Supper was instituted by Christ "for the perpetual
          remembrance of the sacrifice of himself in his death; the sealing of
          all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment
          and growth in him." It is an act that encourages believers in their
          faith, deepening their relationship with Christ and with one another
          as members of His body.
        </p>

        <h2>The Significance of the Lord’s Supper</h2>
        <p>
          The theological significance of the Lord’s Supper is
          multi-dimensional. It is a ritual that reflects three key aspects:
          past, present, and future. First, it points to the past, reminding us
          of Christ’s sacrificial death on the cross, which brings forgiveness
          and reconciliation with God. Second, it addresses the present, as
          believers partake by faith, drawing spiritual sustenance from Christ.
          It is a moment of personal and communal reflection, reaffirming the
          bond between believers and Christ, and among believers themselves.
          Third, it has a future dimension, as it looks forward to Christ’s
          return, encouraging believers with the hope of His second coming and
          the fulfillment of God's promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sacrament, though grounded in historical events, is not simply a
          remembrance of what happened but a real participation in Christ’s body
          and blood. It serves as a reminder of the grace given through His
          death, and as an invitation to commune with Him in a spiritual way,
          even as we physically partake of the bread and wine.
        </p>

        <h2>The Presence of Christ in the Supper</h2>
        <p>
          The nature of Christ’s presence in the Supper has been the subject of
          considerable debate, especially since the Reformation. The Roman
          Catholic Church teaches transubstantiation, which holds that the bread
          and wine are miraculously transformed into the actual body and blood
          of Christ, though they retain the appearance of bread and wine. Martin
          Luther proposed a doctrine known as "consubstantiation," suggesting
          that the body and blood of Christ are truly present in, with, and
          under the bread and wine, though the elements themselves remain
          unchanged. In contrast, Ulrich Zwingli argued that the Supper is a
          memorial meal, with no physical presence of Christ in the elements.
          John Calvin offered a middle ground, suggesting that while the bread
          and wine remain unchanged, Christ is spiritually present in the
          Supper, drawing believers into communion with Him through the Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these differing views, all the Reformers agreed on one
          essential point: the Supper does not repeat or renew the sacrifice of
          Christ. It is a memorial, an act of thanksgiving for His finished work
          on the cross. The Supper does not reoffer Christ’s sacrifice but
          celebrates the completed and sufficient work of His atonement.
        </p>

        <h2>Ritual and Meaning in the Supper</h2>
        <p>
          The Lord’s Supper is more than a ritual; it carries deep spiritual
          meaning for those who participate. The first level of meaning is its
          reference to Christ’s death, which is the central event of the
          Christian faith. The second level pertains to the present, as
          believers "feed on Christ by faith" during the Supper, reflecting on
          their spiritual unity with Him. This implies not only a personal
          reflection but also a communal reflection on the body of Christ as
          believers share in the meal together. Finally, the Supper has a future
          reference, pointing believers to the anticipated return of Christ,
          when the full realization of God's promises will be realized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul advises self-examination before partaking of the Supper (1 Cor.
          11:28), ensuring that participants approach the table in a manner
          worthy of the Lord. This moment of introspection ensures that
          believers are partaking of the Supper with a proper attitude, both in
          relation to God and to one another.
        </p>

        <h2>The Lord’s Supper and Christian Community</h2>
        <p>
          The Lord’s Supper is a profound expression of the unity believers
          share in Christ. As the body of Christ, the church is called to live
          in fellowship, love, and mutual care. By participating in this
          sacrament, believers affirm their shared faith and their commitment to
          each other as members of Christ’s mystical body. The Supper is a
          celebration of the new covenant, a covenant of grace, which has been
          sealed by Christ’s blood. It is a bond of communion with Him and with
          one another, strengthening the body of believers as they look forward
          to Christ’s return.
