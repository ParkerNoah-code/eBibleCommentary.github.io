        <h1>Fallen Human Beings Are Both Free and Enslaved</h1>
        <h2>The Deceptive Heart</h2>
        <p>
          Jeremiah 17:9 declares, "The heart is deceitful above all things and
          beyond cure. Who can understand it?" This verse captures the essence
          of human fallenness: the internal corruption of human nature. It
          vividly portrays the human heart as intrinsically inclined toward sin,
          demonstrating humanity's profound need for divine intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          A proper understanding of this condition requires discerning the
          concepts of free agency and free will, which have been topics of
          theological reflection for centuries. These terms help illuminate how
          fallen human beings can be simultaneously free in their decisions yet
          enslaved to sin.
        </p>

        <h2>Free Agency</h2>
        <p>
          Free agency refers to the human capacity to make decisions and act
          according to one's desires and understanding of right and wrong. As
          moral agents, humans are accountable to God and others for the choices
          they make. This freedom to act is inherent to humanity and persists
          regardless of moral or spiritual condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam, both in his pre-fallen and post-fallen states, exercised free
          agency. Even in glorified sainthood, where the ability to sin is
          removed, free agency remains. In heaven, the saints' choices will
          align perfectly with their renewed nature, demonstrating that freedom
          to act according to one's nature does not diminish with the absence of
          sin.
        </p>

        <h2>Free Will</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of free will, historically defined as the ability to
          choose any moral option in a given situation, is more complex. While
          free agency remains intact after the Fall, free will in this fuller
          sense has been compromised. Augustine, against Pelagius, argued that
          original sin has so deeply corrupted humanity that people lack the
          natural ability to choose God’s way. This bondage of the will to sin
          reflects Paul’s teaching in Romans 6:16–23, where only those liberated
          by Christ can choose righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free will, as such, is restored through regeneration by grace. When
          Christ frees individuals from sin, He inclines their hearts toward God
          and instills a lasting love for righteousness (John 8:34–36; Gal. 5:1,
          13). This freedom is not a return to an abstract capacity to choose
          good or evil but a transformation of desires that aligns the
          believer’s will with God’s purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>The Nature of Will and Moral Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          Will is not an independent part of the self that can be moved like a
          physical limb; it is the person actively choosing and engaging in
          action. Understanding free agency and the liberation provided by
          Christ becomes clearer when the focus shifts from will as an
          abstraction to the individual as a morally responsible being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each person must recognize: "I am the morally responsible agent; I am
          the slave to sin who needs Christ’s liberation; I am the fallen being
          incapable of choosing God until He renews my heart." This perspective
          emphasizes the profound transformation required to move from
          enslavement to freedom in Christ.
        </p>

        <h2>Christ’s Work of Liberation</h2>
        <p>
          Humanity’s inability to choose God apart from His grace highlights the
          necessity of Christ's redemptive work. Without regeneration, fallen
          human beings remain enslaved to sin, incapable of pursuing the moral
          and spiritual good that aligns with God’s will. Through the gospel,
          Christ frees the enslaved, enabling them to live in obedience and love
          toward God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This liberation is not merely a return to neutral moral ground but a
          positive transformation—a realignment of desires and choices toward
          righteousness. As Paul teaches, the freed person is empowered to live
          for God, reflecting the new life given through the Spirit. This truth
          underscores the hope of the gospel: that fallen human beings, though
          enslaved to sin, are invited into freedom through Christ.
