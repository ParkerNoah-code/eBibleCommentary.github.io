        <h1>"This Is My Name"</h1>
        <h2>The Meaning of God's Name</h2>
        <p>
          In Exodus 3:15, God declared to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The
          LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and
          the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, the
          name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.”
          This proclamation establishes God’s name as more than a mere label. In
          the biblical context, names convey meaning, character, and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike modern names, which function primarily as identifiers, biblical
          names reveal attributes or roles. The Old Testament celebrates God’s
          name as a central theme of worship, evident in Psalms such as Psalm
          8:1, 113:1–3, and 148:13, where God’s name becomes synonymous with His
          revealed nature and deeds. “Name” here refers to God as He has made
          Himself known, particularly through His covenant relationship with
          Israel.
        </p>

        <h2>The Burning Bush: Revelation of Yahweh</h2>
        <p>
          The self-revelation of God’s name is vividly portrayed in the burning
          bush encounter (Exodus 3:6, 13–16). Addressing Moses, God identified
          Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, anchoring His
          identity in His covenantal relationship with the patriarchs. When
          Moses inquired about God’s name, He replied with profound simplicity:
          “I AM WHO I AM” (or “I will be what I will be”). This declaration was
          subsequently shortened to “I AM” and linked to “the LORD” (Yahweh),
          the covenant name of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This name, Yahweh, signifies God’s eternal, self-sustaining, and
          sovereign existence. The burning bush, miraculously aflame yet not
          consumed, symbolizes God’s inexhaustible life and presence. By
          affirming “This is my name forever,” God established an enduring
          connection between His self-revelation and the unchanging nature of
          His being.
        </p>

        <h2>God's Moral Character Revealed</h2>
        <p>
          In Exodus 33:18–34:7, Moses requested to see God’s “glory”—His
          majestic self-display. In response, God proclaimed His name anew,
          emphasizing His moral character: “The LORD, the LORD, the
          compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and
          faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness,
          rebellion, and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished….”
        </p>
        <p>
          This profound revelation portrays God’s balance of justice and mercy.
          While He extends compassion and grace, He also upholds righteousness
          by holding the guilty accountable. This duality of attributes forms
          the foundation of God’s covenantal relationship with His people,
          providing assurance of His steadfast love and unyielding holiness.
        </p>

        <h2>The Jealous God</h2>
        <p>
          God further described Himself as “the LORD, whose name is Jealous”
          (Exodus 34:14). This declaration, echoing the second commandment
          (Exodus 20:5), highlights God’s covenantal jealousy—a deep, protective
          love demanding exclusive devotion. This jealousy is not petty or
          selfish but reflects the virtuous passion of a committed lover who
          seeks the total loyalty of His beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s name as “Jealous” reinforces the seriousness of the covenant and
          the expectation that His people remain faithful. It underscores the
          exclusivity and intimacy of the relationship between God and His
          people.
        </p>

        <h2>Jesus as the Full Revelation of God's Name</h2>
        <p>
          In the New Testament, Jesus Christ embodies the full revelation of
          God’s name and character. As the incarnate Son, He reveals the mind,
          will, and purposes of the Father (John 14:9–11). Through His words and
          deeds, Jesus displays the compassion, justice, and grace that define
          God’s nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase “Hallowed be your name” in the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9)
          expresses a longing for God’s name to be revered and glorified. This
          petition reflects a desire for humanity to recognize and honor the
          splendor of God’s self-disclosure, whether in creation, providence, or
          redemptive grace.
        </p>

        <h2>The Eternal Significance of God's Name</h2>
        <p>
          God’s name, as revealed in Scripture, is not a mere identifier but a
          declaration of His eternal nature, character, and purposes. It calls
          His people to worship, trust, and obedience. To know God’s name is to
          know Him as He has revealed Himself—a compassionate and gracious
          Redeemer, a righteous Judge, and a sovereign Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glory of God’s name invites humanity to respond in awe, devotion,
          and gratitude. As the psalmist declares, “Let them praise the name of
          the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the
          earth and the heavens” (Psalm 148:13).
