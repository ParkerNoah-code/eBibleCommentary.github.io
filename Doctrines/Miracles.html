        <h1>God Shows His Presence and Power</h1>
        <h2>The Biblical Concept of Miracles</h2>
        <p>
          In Scripture, the concept of a miracle is conveyed through three
          primary terms: “wonder,” “mighty work,” and “sign.” Each term
          highlights a unique aspect of what miracles reveal about God’s
          activity in the world. While there is no single biblical word for
          “miracle,” the Latin term <em>miraculum</em> captures the essence of
          the first concept—a wonder that evokes awe and awareness of God’s
          presence and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          A miracle is an event that defies ordinary explanation, pointing
          instead to the direct intervention of God. Whether through striking
          providences, extraordinary coincidences, or acts of divine creative
          power, miracles awaken a heightened sense of the divine. This includes
          events like the raising of the dead or supernatural healings, as well
          as moments in everyday life that manifest God’s hand, such as
          childbirth or the resolution of seemingly impossible circumstances.
          Such wonders testify to God’s continued activity in creation and His
          intimate involvement with humanity.
        </p>

        <h2>Miracles as Mighty Works</h2>
        <p>
          The term “mighty work” underscores the power of God displayed in
          miracles. Throughout biblical history, miracles demonstrate the
          supernatural authority of the Creator who made the world from nothing.
          Events like the raising of the dead—performed by Elijah, Elisha,
          Jesus, Peter, and Paul—are prime examples of this divine power. These
          acts, which include Jesus’ resurrection, defy natural processes and
          cannot be explained by coincidence or the normal course of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organic healings, another common category of miracles in the Gospels,
          similarly showcase God’s power. These include restoring sight to the
          blind, cleansing lepers, and enabling the lame to walk. Such works
          serve not only as acts of compassion but also as demonstrations of
          God’s ability to restore and recreate. They remind us that God’s
          creative power is not bound by human limitations and that He is
          sovereign over life, death, and all aspects of creation.
        </p>

        <h2>Miracles as Signs</h2>
        <p>
          Miracles in Scripture often function as “signs,” conveying a specific
          message about God’s nature, purposes, or the identity of His
          representatives. In John’s Gospel, miracles are regularly referred to
          as signs, and the seven key miracles recorded there underscore Jesus’
          divine identity and mission. For instance, the feeding of the five
          thousand and the raising of Lazarus reveal Jesus’ power over creation
          and death, affirming Him as the Son of God (John 6:1–14; 11:38–44).
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles authenticate the individuals who perform them, marking them
          as God’s chosen messengers. Moses’ miracles before Pharaoh, Elijah’s
          raising of the widow’s son, and Jesus’ works of healing and
          resurrection all serve to confirm their divine authority (Exod. 4:1–9;
          1 Kings 17:24; John 10:38). Miracles also point to broader truths
          about God’s salvation and judgment. They reveal His power to save, His
          compassion for the suffering, and His sovereignty over all creation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Necessity of Belief in Miracles</h2>
        <p>
          Belief in miracles is foundational to the Christian faith. The
          Incarnation and Resurrection, the two supreme miracles of Scripture,
          are central to the gospel message. To reject miracles is to undermine
          the core of Christianity. Some modern theologians and scientists have
          dismissed miracles, not based on scientific evidence but on the
          philosophical assumption of a universe governed by absolute
          uniformity. Such a worldview denies the possibility of divine
          intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there is nothing irrational about believing that the God who
          created the universe can intervene in it. Indeed, doubt in the
          miraculous is less reasonable than faith, as it requires ignoring the
          consistent testimony of Scripture, the witness of the church, and the
          experiences of countless believers who have encountered God’s
          miraculous power. Faith in miracles acknowledges that God’s presence
          and power continue to operate in the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Miracles Today</h2>
        <p>
          While the cluster of miracles recorded in Scripture is unique, their
          purpose remains relevant. Striking providences, extraordinary
          coincidences, and answered prayers often serve as modern reminders of
          God’s presence and activity. While not every event may qualify as a
          biblical “mighty work,” they still evoke wonder and point to the
          divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christians are encouraged to approach life with an openness to God’s
          miraculous intervention, trusting in His power to work in ways that
          defy human understanding. Whether through dramatic acts of healing or
          the quiet workings of providence, God continues to reveal His presence
          and power in the world. Such moments invite believers to respond in
          worship, gratitude, and renewed faith.
