        <h1>God Is Light</h1>
        <h2>The Meaning of God’s Holiness</h2>
        <p>
          The term "holy," as applied to God in scripture, signifies the divine
          quality that sets Him apart from all creation, evoking awe, adoration,
          and reverence. Leviticus 11:44 commands, “Be holy, because I am holy,”
          emphasizing God’s purity and perfection as the standard for His
          people. This holiness is an essential attribute that touches every
          facet of God’s being, encompassing His moral perfection and
          transcendent greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s holiness is foundational to His other attributes. His love is
          holy love; His justice is holy justice; His mercy is holy mercy. This
          purity not only defines His character but also underscores His
          intolerance for sin (Hab. 1:13). When confronted with God’s holiness,
          humanity is compelled to acknowledge its unworthiness, as seen in
          Isaiah’s cry of despair in Isaiah 6:5: “Woe to me!... I am a man of
          unclean lips.”
        </p>

        <h2>Holiness and Divine Justice</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most evident expressions of God’s holiness is His justice.
          Justice, as an outworking of holiness, requires that God act
          righteously in all circumstances. His moral law, described as “holy,
          righteous, and good” (Rom. 7:12), reflects His pure nature and sets
          the standard for human conduct. As both lawgiver and judge, God
          administers justice according to what is right and true (Gen. 18:25;
          Acts 17:31).
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s justice is further displayed in His wrath against sin. Far from
          being arbitrary, His wrath is a holy response to evil, an expression
          of His unwavering opposition to all that contradicts His nature (Rom.
          2:5–16). Yet, this justice is tempered by His covenant faithfulness.
          His acts of salvation, such as redeeming Israel or justifying sinners
          through faith in Christ, reveal that His justice and mercy are
          perfectly intertwined (Isa. 51:5–6; Rom. 3:25–26). This dual
          demonstration of justice magnifies His holiness, as He both judges sin
          and offers redemption.
        </p>

        <h2>“God Is Light”: Holiness and Purity</h2>
        <p>
          John’s declaration that “God is light; in him there is no darkness at
          all” (1 John 1:5) reinforces the centrality of God’s holiness. Light
          here symbolizes absolute purity and moral integrity, emphasizing that
          God’s holiness is untainted by any imperfection. This purity renders
          fellowship between God and unrepentant sinners impossible, demanding a
          response of repentance and pursuit of righteousness (1 John 1:6–7; 2
          Cor. 6:14–7:1).
        </p>
        <p>
          The call for holiness extends to God’s people. Just as God’s light
          reveals and eradicates darkness, His holiness demands transformation
          in the lives of believers. Hebrews 12:10–17 describes holiness as
          essential for seeing the Lord, while passages like 1 Peter 1:15–16
          echo the Levitical command: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
        </p>

        <h2>The Pursuit of Holiness in God’s People</h2>
        <p>
          Holiness is not merely an attribute of God but a standard for His
          people. From the Old Testament to the New, believers are summoned to
          mirror God’s character in their lives. Deuteronomy 30:1–10 outlines
          the blessings of covenantal obedience, while passages like Ephesians
          4:17–5:14 describe the process of putting off sinful behaviors and
          embracing a life reflective of God’s nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament places particular emphasis on holiness as an
          integral part of salvation. Regeneration through Christ enables
          believers to pursue the holiness that pleases God (John 3:1–8; 1 John
          1:9). This pursuit is not optional but central to the Christian life,
          shaping every thought, word, and deed in alignment with God’s will.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Implications of God’s Holiness</h2>
        <p>
          God’s holiness serves as both a comfort and a challenge. It assures
          believers of His unchanging purity and justice, making Him a reliable
          refuge in a world marked by corruption. Simultaneously, it calls them
          to continual growth in righteousness, reflecting His light in a
          darkened world (Matt. 5:14–16).
        </p>
        <p>
          In worship, God’s holiness inspires reverence and humility. As Isaiah
          experienced in his vision (Isa. 6:1–8), encountering God’s holiness
          compels self-examination and leads to deeper dependence on His grace.
          It also strengthens the believer’s hope, as the holy God who calls His
          people to holiness is also the one who empowers them to achieve it
          through His Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, God’s holiness is not merely a doctrine to be understood
          but a reality to be lived. It transforms lives, aligning them with the
          purity and righteousness of the God who is light.
