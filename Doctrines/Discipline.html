        <h1>The Church Must Uphold Christian Standards</h1>
        <h2>Understanding Church Discipline in the Christian Faith</h2>
        <p>
          In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus provides clear instructions on how to
          deal with offenses within the church: "If your brother sins against
          you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he
          listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not
          listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be
          established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses
          to listen, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to
          the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector" (Matt.
          18:15–17). This passage highlights the importance of maintaining
          Christian conduct through a process of accountability and correction
          within the community of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of discipline in the Christian tradition is rooted in the
          Latin word "disciplina," which encompasses a broad range of activities
          designed to nurture, instruct, and train believers in their spiritual
          lives. It is not merely about correction but about guiding individuals
          towards righteousness, holiness, and service to God. Reformed theology
          emphasizes that a church without discipline lacks spiritual health and
          that discipline is a vital mark of a true church. Church discipline
          involves not only judicial actions against immoral behavior but also
          the ongoing processes of personal growth and accountability within the
          body of believers (Matt. 28:20; John 21:15–17; 2 Tim. 2:14–26; Titus
          2; Heb. 13:17).
        </p>

        <h2>Discipline as an Integral Part of Church Life</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament outlines that discipline within the church is
          multifaceted. It is not limited to punitive measures but encompasses a
          holistic approach to discipleship. Judicial correctives—measures taken
          to address specific instances of sin—have a legitimate place within
          this broader context of instruction and growth. Passages such as 1
          Corinthians 5:1–13, 2 Corinthians 2:5–11, and Titus 1:10–14 underscore
          the necessity of corrective discipline for both the health of the
          individual and the collective well-being of the church. Discipline,
          when properly administered, contributes to the maturation of both the
          church and its members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus' authority over the church's discipline is clearly articulated
          in Matthew 18:18, where He grants His apostles the authority to bind
          and loose—that is, to prohibit or permit actions, including the
          declaring of sins remitted or retained (John 20:23). This authority
          has been understood as a divine prerogative given to the apostles, and
          by extension, to the church and its leaders. The "keys of the kingdom"
          (Matt. 16:19), first entrusted to Peter, signify this power to
          formulate doctrine and impose discipline, ensuring that the church
          remains faithful to Christ's commands.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose and Process of Church Discipline</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of church discipline is not punitive but restorative. The
          ultimate goal is to bring about repentance in the wayward individual
          and to restore them to fellowship within the body of Christ. The
          Westminster Confession of Faith outlines several reasons for church
          censures, including the reclaiming of offenders, the deterrence of
          others from sin, and the protection of the honor of Christ and the
          gospel (Westminster Confession, XXX.3). The process begins with
          personal admonition, followed by escalating steps—first private
          correction, then involvement of witnesses, and finally public
          discipline if the person refuses to repent. Exclusion from the Lord’s
          Supper and, in the most severe cases, excommunication, are seen as
          steps taken only after other efforts have failed, with the goal always
          being repentance and reconciliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus' teaching in Matthew 18:15–17 outlines a structured approach to
          resolving offenses. The first step is a private confrontation between
          the offended party and the offender, aimed at reconciliation. If the
          person refuses to listen, the matter should be brought before two or
          three witnesses to establish the truth. If the issue remains
          unresolved, the matter should be taken to the church, and if the
          person still refuses to listen, the individual may be treated as an
          outsider—much like a pagan or tax collector. This process is not
          intended to be punitive but to restore the offender to a right
          relationship with God and with the community.
        </p>

        <h2>Restoration Through Repentance</h2>
        <p>
          The ultimate goal of church discipline is restoration. As long as the
          individual shows signs of repentance, the church is called to forgive
          and welcome them back into fellowship. There is only one reason for
          excommunication: impenitence. When a person refuses to repent and
          remains unyielding in their sin, the church may need to take the
          difficult step of expelling them from the community, symbolizing that
          they have been handed over to the influence of the world (1 Cor.
          5:1–5). However, once repentance is evident, the church is tasked with
          welcoming the individual back, forgiving them, and celebrating their
          return to the fold. The aim is always to call the lost sheep back to
          the shepherd, to restore what was broken, and to renew the
          individual’s walk with Christ.
