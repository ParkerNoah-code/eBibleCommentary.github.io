        <h1>God Is One and Three</h1>
        <h2>Scriptural Foundations of Divine Unity</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of God’s singularity is a foundational truth of the Old
          Testament. Passages like Isaiah 44:6 declare, “This is what the LORD
          says—Israel’s King and Redeemer, the LORD Almighty: I am the first and
          I am the last; apart from me there is no God.” This insistence on
          monotheism is echoed throughout scripture, from Deuteronomy 6:4–5,
          which commands Israel to worship and love the Lord exclusively, to
          Isaiah 45:25, which underscores God’s sovereignty as the sole Creator
          and Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the New Testament, this monotheistic assertion continues with equal
          force. Jesus Himself quotes the Shema, affirming that “The Lord our
          God, the Lord is one” (Mark 12:29–30). Paul also emphasizes the
          oneness of God in passages like 1 Corinthians 8:4 and 1 Timothy 2:5,
          reminding readers that there is only one God to whom all allegiance is
          due. Yet, these texts also reveal the mystery of a triune God, as they
          introduce the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-laborers in the work
          of salvation.
        </p>

        <h2>Revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament introduces a profound truth: the one God exists
          eternally as three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These are not
          mere manifestations or roles but distinct persons who share the same
          divine essence. This understanding arises from Jesus’ teachings and
          the accounts of His life and ministry. Jesus prayed to the Father and
          instructed His disciples to do likewise, yet He also claimed divinity
          for Himself, as seen in passages like John 20:28–31 and Colossians
          2:9, where He is worshiped as God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Jesus promised the coming of the Holy Spirit, describing
          Him as “another Paraclete” who would guide and empower believers (John
          14:16–17). The Spirit’s arrival at Pentecost confirmed His divine
          personhood, as Peter equates lying to the Spirit with lying to God
          (Acts 5:3–4). The baptismal formula given by Jesus in Matthew
          28:19—“in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
          Spirit”—also reflects the unified yet distinct roles of the Trinity.
        </p>

        <h2>Historical Development of the Doctrine</h2>
        <p>
          The term "Trinity" comes from the Latin word <em>trinitas</em>,
          meaning “threeness.” While the technical language of Trinitarian
          theology, such as “subsistences” and “essence,” is not found in
          scripture, the doctrine is firmly rooted in biblical revelation. The
          early church recognized the need to articulate this mystery in order
          to safeguard against heresies like modalism (which denies the distinct
          persons) and tritheism (which posits three gods). Thus, the Nicene
          Creed and other historic formulations affirm the co-equality and
          co-eternality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
        </p>

        <h2>Theological Significance and Practical Implications</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the Trinity underscores the complexity of God’s unity.
          Each person of the Trinity is fully divine, fully personal, and fully
          involved in the work of salvation. The Father initiates the divine
          plan, the Son accomplishes it through His life, death, and
          resurrection, and the Spirit applies it to the lives of believers.
          This interdependent cooperation reveals a relational God who is love
          in His very essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practically, the Trinity shapes Christian worship and devotion.
          Believers are called to honor all three persons equally, recognizing
          their unique roles in
