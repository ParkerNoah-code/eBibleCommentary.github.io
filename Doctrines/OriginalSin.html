        <h1>Depravity Infects Everyone</h1>
        <h2>The Universality of Sin</h2>
        <p>
          In Psalm 51:5, David confesses, "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful
          from the time my mother conceived me." This verse underscores the
          pervasive reality of sin, affirming its presence in every person from
          the moment of existence. Scripture consistently diagnoses sin as a
          universal deformity of human nature, affecting every aspect of human
          life (1 Kings 8:46; Rom. 3:9–23; 7:18; 1 John 1:8–10).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible portrays sin as rebellion against God's authority, a
          deviation from His standards, and an offense to His purity. It is not
          merely an abstract concept but a dynamic force—a drive to resist God's
          rule and assert self-sovereignty. This rebellious spirit, first seen
          in Adam's transgression, manifests in pride and hostility against God.
          Sinful actions, therefore, are the external expressions of an inwardly
          corrupted heart.
        </p>

        <h2>Defining Sin</h2>
        <p>
          Sin, as illustrated in Scripture, is a failure to conform to God's law
          in every aspect of human existence, including actions, attitudes,
          motivations, and character. Jeremiah 17:9 describes the human heart as
          "deceitful above all things and beyond cure." Similarly, Jesus points
          to the inner nature of sin in Matthew 12:30–37 and Mark 7:20–23,
          showing that evil originates within the human heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul's writings, particularly in Romans 1:18–3:20 and Romans 7, expose
          the pervasive power of sin, depicting it as a principle that enslaves
          and corrupts. Galatians 5:16–21 and Ephesians 2:1–3 further highlight
          the manifestations of sin in human behavior and thought. The New
          Testament consistently identifies sin as both a state of being and a
          pattern of actions contrary to God's will.
        </p>

        <h2>Original Sin</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of original sin—though not a biblical term but one coined
          by Augustine—provides a framework for understanding humanity's
          inherent sinfulness. It asserts that sinfulness marks everyone from
          birth, existing as a twisted motivational core before any actual sins
          are committed. This inherited condition stems from Adam, humanity's
          representative, whose disobedience introduced sin into the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          Original sin teaches that we are not sinners because we commit sinful
          acts; rather, we commit sinful acts because we are inherently sinners.
          This doctrine emphasizes the depth of human corruption and the need
          for divine intervention to restore and redeem.
        </p>

        <h2>Total Depravity and Total Inability</h2>
        <p>
          Total depravity, a term closely tied to original sin, describes the
          extent of human corruption. It does not mean that every person is as
          evil as they could be but that no part of human nature remains
          untouched by sin. Consequently, no action or thought is entirely free
          from imperfection or taint in God's eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This corruption results in total inability—the incapacity to respond
          to God or His Word sincerely and wholeheartedly. Paul characterizes
          this state as spiritual death (Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13), indicating the
          profound unresponsiveness of the fallen heart to God's call. The
          Westminster Confession captures this reality: "Man by his fall into a
          state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual
          good accompanying salvation; so as a natural man, being altogether
          averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able by his own
          strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto."
        </p>
        <p>
          Only the grace of God, revealed through Christ, can overcome this
          spiritual deadness. Without divine intervention, humanity remains
          enslaved to sin, incapable of achieving righteousness or
          reconciliation with God on its own.
