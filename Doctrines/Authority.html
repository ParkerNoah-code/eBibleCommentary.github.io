        <h1>The Authority of Scripture</h1>
        <h2>God’s Means of Governance</h2>
        <p>
          The authority of the Bible is central to Christian faith and practice.
          It reflects God’s purpose to direct His people’s beliefs and behaviors
          through the revealed truth of Holy Scripture. This authority also
          means that all human ideas about God must be measured, tested, and
          corrected according to biblical teaching. In Christianity, authority
          belongs exclusively to God, the Creator, who exercises this authority
          through the truth and wisdom of His written Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the human perspective, each biblical book was written to inspire
          wholehearted service to God. From the divine standpoint, the Bible as
          a whole serves this purpose. As 2 Timothy 3:16 declares, “All
          Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
          correcting, and training in righteousness.” Since Christ now holds
          executive authority over the cosmos (Matt. 28:18), Scripture serves as
          the instrument of His lordship over His followers, functioning much
          like His letters to the seven churches in Revelation 2–3.
        </p>

        <h2>Sources of God’s Truth</h2>
        <p>
          Different traditions and schools of thought offer varying answers to
          the question, "Where is God’s authoritative truth to be found today?"
          These answers differ in their understanding and use of Scripture:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Roman Catholic and Orthodox Views:</strong> These traditions
            believe God’s truth is found in the church’s interpretation of
            Scripture, embodied in its traditions and consensus. While affirming
            the Bible as God-given truth, they insist that the church’s
            interpretations are infallible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Liberal and Subjectivist Views:</strong> These perspectives
            see God’s truth in the impressions, thoughts, and theories that
            Scripture inspires in individual readers. This approach often
            dismisses the New Testament’s concept of inspiration and treats the
            Bible as fallible, emphasizing personal discernment as the means of
            finding wisdom.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Historic Protestant View:</strong> This position holds that
            God’s truth resides in the canonical Scriptures themselves.
            Scripture is viewed as inspired (God-breathed, 2 Tim. 3:16),
            inerrant (completely true in all affirmations), sufficient
            (containing all that is necessary for salvation and eternal life),
            and clear (self-interpreting on essential matters). This view
            systematically submits human thoughts to the authority of Scripture
            as the ultimate rule for faith and life.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Canon and Its Role</h2>
        <p>
          The term “canon” refers to a rule or standard. While many traditions
          acknowledge Scripture as canon, their practices reveal differing
          levels of commitment to its authority. Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and
          liberal approaches often place human interpretations or judgments
          above the biblical text, undermining its function as the ultimate
          rule. Historic Protestantism, by contrast, fully embraces the Bible as
          canon, submitting all human reasoning and tradition to its authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          By taking Scripture seriously as the canon, Protestants affirm its
          role as the authoritative guide for faith and practice. This approach
          ensures that Christian belief remains grounded in God’s revealed truth
          rather than subjective or institutional interpretations.
        </p>

        <h2>The Importance of Biblical Authority</h2>
        <p>
          Accepting the Bible’s authority is essential for faithful Christian
          living. Scripture serves not only as the means by which God governs
          His people but also as the standard against which all beliefs and
          practices must be measured. To reject or undermine this authority,
          regardless of one’s sincerity, results in a flawed Christian
          profession. By contrast, full submission to Scripture allows believers
          to align their faith and lives with God’s will, honoring His
          sovereignty and wisdom.
