        <h1>God Reigns</h1>
        <h2>The Majesty of God’s Sovereign Rule</h2>
        <p>
          Daniel 4:34 captures the profound recognition of God’s sovereignty by
          King Nebuchadnezzar: “His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom
          endures from generation to generation.” This declaration underscores
          the biblical theme that God reigns as the supreme ruler over all
          creation. His authority is eternal, unchallenged, and comprehensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imagery of God enthroned as King recurs throughout Scripture. From
          the prophetic visions of Isaiah (6:1) and Ezekiel (1:26) to the
          apocalyptic scenes in Revelation (4:2), the throne symbolizes God’s
          ultimate authority. Psalms such as 47, 93, and 99 echo this theme,
          proclaiming that the LORD reigns with power, righteousness, and
          justice.
        </p>

        <h2>The Extent of God’s Dominion</h2>
        <p>
          God’s dominion is total, encompassing the great and the small. He
          governs the cosmos and directs the minutiae of daily life (Exodus
          15:18; Proverbs 16:33; Matthew 10:29–31). His will is absolute, and
          none can oppose or frustrate His purposes (Daniel 4:34–35). This
          sovereignty ensures that every event, whether grand or seemingly
          insignificant, unfolds according to His divine plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even human and angelic free agency, the power to make personal
          decisions, exists under God’s sovereign control. While humans act
          freely and bear moral responsibility for their choices, God
          sovereignly overrules their actions to fulfill His purposes. Joseph’s
          assurance to his brothers in Genesis 50:20—“You intended to harm me,
          but God intended it for good”—beautifully illustrates this paradox.
          Similarly, Acts 2:23 highlights God’s sovereignty in the crucifixion
          of Jesus, describing it as both a human act and a fulfillment of God’s
          plan.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mystery of Sovereignty and Free Agency</h2>
        <p>
          The coexistence of God’s absolute sovereignty and human free agency
          presents a profound mystery. How can God’s control over human
          decisions be total while individuals remain morally responsible? While
          Scripture affirms both truths, the mechanics of their interplay remain
          beyond human understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regularly, God exercises His sovereignty by allowing natural and human
          events to unfold without miraculous intervention. This non-intrusive
          governance highlights His ability to achieve His purposes through
          ordinary means, demonstrating His wisdom and power.
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 93: A Celebration of God’s Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          Psalm 93 offers a poetic affirmation of God’s sovereign rule. It
          highlights three key aspects:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, God’s reign guarantees the stability of the world. Despite the
          forces of chaos and rebellion, the earth remains secure under His
          dominion (verses 1b–4). Second, God’s sovereignty assures the
          trustworthiness of His words and commands. His directives are
          unchanging and reliable (verse 5a). Third, God’s people are called to
          respond with holiness and reverence. His sovereign rule demands a life
          of worship and obedience (verse 5b).
        </p>
        <p>
          This psalm expresses joy, hope, and confidence, inviting believers to
          rest in the knowledge that God’s reign is eternal and unshakable. It
          serves as a reminder to trust in His power and to live in awe of His
          majesty.
        </p>

        <h2>Responding to God’s Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          The recognition of God’s sovereignty transforms the believer’s
          perspective on life. It fosters trust in His providence, knowing that
          all things work according to His perfect plan (Romans 8:28). It also
          inspires worship, as believers acknowledge His majesty and submit to
          His will.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who resist God’s reign, His sovereignty is a call to
          repentance. The reality of His authority leaves no room for rebellion.
          Instead, it invites all to bow before the King of kings, finding
          peace, purpose, and salvation in His rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s reign is a source of great hope and joy. As Nebuchadnezzar
          discovered, acknowledging His sovereignty restores sanity,
          perspective, and purpose. May we, too, honor and glorify the One who
          reigns forever.
