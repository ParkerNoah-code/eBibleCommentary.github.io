        <h1>God Legislates, and Demands Obedience</h1>
        <h2>The Nature of God’s Law</h2>
        <p>
          Deuteronomy 5:1 captures the foundational call to obedience: "Moses
          summoned all Israel and said: Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I
          declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them."
          Humanity was not created autonomous—free to define its own laws—but
          theonomous, bound to follow the laws of its Creator. This obedience
          was intended to be a source of joy and fulfillment, as duty and
          delight would naturally align. Jesus exemplified this in saying, "My
          food is to do the will of him who sent me" (John 4:34).
        </p>
        <p>
          However, fallen humanity resists God's law, rejecting both its
          authority and its divine origin. Conversely, those transformed by
          Christ find themselves drawn to the law out of gratitude for grace
          (Rom. 7:18–22). By the Holy Spirit's work, believers experience a
          heart-level obedience previously unattainable (Rom. 7:6; 8:4–6; Heb.
          10:16).
        </p>

        <h2>The Scope of God’s Moral Law</h2>
        <p>
          God’s moral law, as revealed throughout Scripture, reflects His holy
          character and purposes for humanity. It is expressed in the Ten
          Commandments, other Mosaic laws, prophetic exhortations, the teachings
          of Jesus, and apostolic letters. The law outlines the behavior that
          pleases God and condemns that which grieves Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus distilled the essence of the moral law into two great
          commandments: love for God and love for neighbor (Matt. 22:37–40). All
          moral instruction in Scripture hinges on these principles. Christ and
          His apostles extended the law's application, addressing life in the
          kingdom of God and the Spirit-filled post-Pentecost church. In these
          contexts, believers are called to embody heaven’s values and serve as
          a countercultural witness in the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Varieties of Biblical Law</h2>
        <p>
          Biblical law encompasses moral, political, and ceremonial categories.
          Moral laws prescribe personal and communal behaviors that remain
          universally binding. Political laws applied moral principles to
          Israel's unique status as a covenant nation. Ceremonial laws governed
          rituals, sacrifices, and purity regulations, serving as temporary
          symbols fulfilled in Christ (Matt. 15:20; Mark 7:15–19; Heb. 10:1–14).
        </p>
        <p>
          The juxtaposition of these laws in the Mosaic code reflects the
          all-encompassing nature of life under God’s authority. Though
          ceremonial and political laws were limited in application, the moral
          law retains its universal and eternal relevance. Jesus affirmed the
          enduring validity of God’s moral law, declaring that He came not to
          abolish but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17–19).
        </p>

        <h2>The Demands of God’s Law</h2>
        <p>
          God’s law demands total obedience from every aspect of human nature.
          It governs the entire person—mind, will, affections, and actions. True
          obedience requires not only external conformity but also internal
          righteousness. Jesus condemned superficial obedience, emphasizing that
          genuine worship and moral integrity must flow from the heart (Matt.
          15:7–8; 23:25–28).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Westminster Larger Catechism encapsulates the law’s comprehensive
          demands: where a duty is commanded, the opposite sin is forbidden, and
          where a sin is forbidden, the opposite duty is commanded. This
          principle underscores the law’s call for active and intentional
          righteousness in every aspect of life.
        </p>

        <h2>The Fulfillment of the Law in Christ</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus perfectly fulfilled God’s law through His sinless life and
          sacrificial death. In Him, the law’s demands are met, and its
          penalties are satisfied. Believers, united with Christ by faith, are
          no longer under the law’s condemnation but are empowered to live in
          obedience through the Holy Spirit. This obedience is not a means of
          earning salvation but an expression of gratitude and love for the God
          who saves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The law remains a guide for believers, showing them how to live in a
          manner that reflects God’s holiness. It functions as both a mirror,
          revealing sin, and a lamp, illuminating the path of righteousness. In
          this way, the law continues to serve God’s redemptive purposes in the
          lives of His people.
