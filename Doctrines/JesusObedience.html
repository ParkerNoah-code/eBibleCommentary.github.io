        <h1>Obedience</h1>
        <h2>Jesus Christ Fulfilled His Father’s Redemptive Will</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus explained His relationship to the Father in terms of complete
          obedience: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself;
          he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the
          Father does the Son also does" (John 5:19). This statement reflects
          the perfect unity and submission within the Trinity, as Jesus carried
          out the Father’s redemptive plan with unwavering faithfulness.
        </p>

        <h2>Humility and Divine Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          In Scripture, humility does not imply self-deprecation but rather a
          faithful adherence to God’s ordained role. Jesus exemplified this
          humility by fully embracing the Father’s will for His life and mission
          (Matt. 11:29). As the second Person of the Trinity, Jesus possessed
          equal divinity with the Father and the Holy Spirit, yet He willingly
          subordinated Himself to fulfill the Father’s purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Trinitarian relationship involves cooperative unity, with the Son
          acting as the Father’s executive and the Spirit as the agent of both.
          For Jesus, it was both natural and joyful to do the Father’s will
          (John 4:34). This humility and obedience reflect the eternal covenant
          of redemption, in which the Son agreed to redeem humanity and glorify
          the Father through His saving work.
        </p>

        <h2>The Covenant of Redemption</h2>
        <p>
          The covenant of redemption is an eternal agreement between the Father
          and the Son, whereby the Father appointed Jesus as the Mediator
          between God and humanity. The Westminster Confession summarizes this
          divine purpose: Jesus was chosen to be Prophet, Priest, and King, to
          redeem, call, justify, sanctify, and glorify His people (Eph. 3:11; 1
          Pet. 1:20; Heb. 5:5–6; Rom. 8:29–30).
        </p>
        <p>
          This covenant unfolded in two stages: humiliation and exaltation. In
          His humiliation, Jesus set aside His glory to take on human nature,
          live as a poor man, and die as a condemned criminal bearing the sins
          of the world (Phil. 2:6–8; 2 Cor. 8:9; Gal. 3:13). In His exaltation,
          He rose from the dead, ascended to the Father, and now reigns as King
          over the church and the world (Phil. 2:9–11). Through His obedience,
          Jesus accomplished the redemption of humanity and now applies its
          benefits to His followers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Work of Christ in Exaltation</h2>
        <p>
          After His ascension, Christ sent the Holy Spirit to apply the
          redemption He secured through His death (John 15:26; Acts 2:33). He
          continues His redemptive work by drawing believers to Himself (John
          12:32), interceding for them before the Father (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25),
          and shepherding them through their spiritual journey (John 10:27–30).
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ’s reign will persist until every one of God’s elect has been
          brought to repentance and new life (2 Pet. 3:9). In doing so, He
          fulfills the Father’s plan to bring many sons and daughters to glory
          (Heb. 2:10), demonstrating the power and effectiveness of His obedient
          sacrifice.
        </p>

        <h2>Jesus’ Joyful Obedience</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus’ obedience to the Father was not burdensome but a source of joy,
          reflecting the unity and love within the Trinity. His voluntary and
          joyful subordination ensures that His redemptive work glorifies both
          Himself and the Father. As John 5:19–23 highlights, the Father’s aim
          is to have the Son worshiped and glorified equally with Himself, a
          goal that is steadily being realized through Christ’s ongoing work.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ’s obedience to the Father is central to His redemptive
          mission. By willingly humbling Himself and fulfilling the Father’s
          plan, He accomplished the salvation of humanity and secured His
          exaltation as King and Savior. His example calls believers to a life
          of humility, obedience, and trust in God’s sovereign plan, confident
          in the ultimate victory of Christ’s redeeming work.
