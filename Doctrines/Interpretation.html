        <h1>Interpretation: Rightly Handling God’s Word</h1>
        <h2>The Responsibility and Right to Interpret</h2>
        <p>
          All Christians have both the right and the duty to interpret
          Scripture, drawing upon the church's heritage of faith while engaging
          personally with the text. Although the Roman Catholic Church has
          historically cautioned against individual interpretation due to the
          risk of misinterpretation, proper rules and principles of exegesis can
          safeguard against this danger. By carefully observing these rules,
          Christians can avoid error and come to a fuller understanding of God’s
          Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, every book of Scripture is a human composition, though
          divinely inspired. As such, it must be interpreted first and foremost
          as a human work intended to communicate with its original audience.
          Allegorical interpretations that ignore the expressed meaning of the
          human author are inappropriate. Instead, Christians must consider the
          language, historical context, and cultural norms of the time to
          accurately discern the intended message.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Through the Spirit</h2>
        <p>
          While comprehension of the historical and cultural context is
          foundational, spiritual understanding—discernment of God’s nature,
          will, and relationship with humankind—requires the work of the Holy
          Spirit. According to 2 Corinthians 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 2:14, the
          veil over one’s heart must be lifted to fully grasp the text’s divine
          implications. This spiritual clarity comes through prayer, as modeled
          in Psalm 119:18–19 and Ephesians 1:17–19. Prayer for God’s Spirit to
          illuminate the text and stir a passion for knowing and honoring Him is
          essential for true understanding.
        </p>

        <h2>The Progressive Revelation of Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          Each book of Scripture has its unique place in the unfolding of God’s
          revelation, which began in Eden and culminated in Jesus Christ,
          Pentecost, and the apostolic writings. For example, while the Psalms
          reveal the devotion of godly hearts in every age, their prayers and
          praises reflect the realities of a pre-Christian context. Interpreters
          must account for the progression of revelation to understand Scripture
          in its proper framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the entirety of Scripture originates from the same divine
          mind, ensuring a self-consistent and complementary message across all
          sixty-six books. Apparent contradictions in Scripture reflect human
          misunderstanding, not errors in the text. The principle of
          interpreting Scripture with Scripture, known as the "analogy of
          faith," emphasizes the unity and coherence of biblical teaching.
        </p>

        <h2>Applying Scripture to Life</h2>
        <p>
          Biblical interpretation ultimately leads to the reapplication of
          timeless truths to present circumstances. Scripture reveals unchanging
          principles about God, humanity, and morality, illustrated through
          specific historical situations. Modern readers, like Josiah in 2 Kings
          22:8–13, must discern how these truths speak to their own contexts.
          Jesus’ use of Genesis 2:24 (Matt. 19:4–6) and Paul’s application of
          Genesis 15:6 and Psalm 32:1–2 in Romans 4:1–8 exemplify this process
          of reapplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is crucial to avoid imposing meanings on Scripture that cannot be
          definitively supported by the text itself. Instead, all
          interpretations must emerge clearly from the inspired words of the
          human authors. Faithful and careful handling of Scripture, as
          instructed in 2 Timothy 2:15, is the hallmark of a mature Christian
          interpreter.
