        <h1>God’s Twofold Will Is One</h1>
        <h2>The Nature of Divine Wisdom</h2>
        <p>
          Wisdom, as described in Scripture, is the ability to choose the
          highest and most noble end and to employ the best means to achieve it.
          Human wisdom, explored in the Old Testament Wisdom books (Job, Psalms,
          Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs) and the New Testament
          epistle of James, centers on living in reverence of God. Proverbs 1:7
          captures this essence: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
          knowledge.” Human wisdom is expressed through practical virtues such
          as prudence, fortitude, forbearance, and zeal, all of which are
          directed toward a life of worship and service to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Divine wisdom, however, far surpasses human understanding. It is
          evident in God’s creation, providence, and redemption. Psalm 104:24
          marvels, “How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all.”
          God’s choice of His glory as His ultimate goal, achieved through the
          intricate workings of creation and redemption, reveals His
          unparalleled wisdom. This is most vividly displayed in the redemptive
          “wisdom” of Christ crucified, which defies human expectations (1 Cor.
          1:18–2:16), and in the global church that results from His work (Eph.
          3:10).
        </p>

        <h2>The Twofold Will of God</h2>
        <p>
          God’s wisdom is manifested in the outworking of His will, which is
          expressed in two interrelated senses: His will of events and His will
          of precept. The will of events refers to God’s eternal decree, His
          sovereign purpose by which “for his own glory, he hath foreordained
          whatsoever comes to pass” (Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q.7). This
          is the will by which God orchestrates all of history, ensuring that
          every event aligns with His divine purpose (Eph. 1:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          The will of precept, on the other hand, represents God’s commands and
          instructions for how people should live. These commands, revealed in
          Scripture, include moral principles rooted in God’s holy character,
          such as the Ten Commandments and the two great commandments to love
          God and neighbor (Exod. 20:1–17; Matt. 22:37–40). They also encompass
          covenantal practices, such as circumcision and sacrifices in the Old
          Testament, and baptism and the Lord’s Supper in the New Testament.
          Together, these commands form a comprehensive guide for righteous
          living, aligning believers with God’s purposes (Eph. 2:10).
        </p>

        <h2>Reconciling Obedience and God’s Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          The interplay between costly obedience and God’s sovereign plan can be
          challenging to comprehend. Scripture acknowledges that obedience often
          brings worldly disadvantage, yet it is an integral part of God’s
          predestined plan for His glory and the believer’s ultimate good (Rom.
          8:28). Paul exhorts believers to trust that even painful acts of
          obedience are woven into the tapestry of God’s redemptive purpose.
          This trust glorifies God and affirms His wisdom, even when the full
          picture remains unseen.
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s will of precept, while requiring human obedience, is also
          instrumental in fulfilling His will of events. Even acts of unbelief
          and disobedience fall within God’s sovereign plan, as illustrated by
          Israel’s rejection of the gospel. Paul reflects on this in Romans
          11:11–32, recognizing that Israel’s unbelief serves to advance the
          gospel among the Gentiles. This realization leads him to exclaim, “Oh,
          the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!” (Rom.
          11:33). Such mysteries of divine wisdom inspire worship and trust in
          God’s ultimate plan.
        </p>

        <h2>God’s Wisdom in Redemption</h2>
        <p>
          Nowhere is God’s wisdom more clearly displayed than in His plan of
          redemption. The cross of Christ, described by Paul as “foolishness to
          those who are perishing” but “the power of God” to believers (1 Cor.
          1:18), exemplifies God’s ability to bring glory out of apparent
          defeat. Through Christ’s sacrificial death and resurrection, God
          reconciles sinners to Himself, demonstrating both justice and mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The global church, composed of people from every nation and culture,
          further showcases the multifaceted wisdom of God. Ephesians 3:10
          declares that through the church, God’s wisdom is made known to the
          powers and authorities in the heavenly realms. This redemptive wisdom
          transcends human understanding and reflects the inexhaustible richness
          of God’s plan.
        </p>

        <h2>Living in Light of God’s Wisdom</h2>
        <p>
          God’s wisdom invites believers to respond with trust, obedience, and
          worship. Trusting in His wisdom means believing that all things, even
          hardships and suffering, are part of His sovereign plan for good. This
          trust sustains believers through life’s uncertainties, anchoring them
          in the assurance of God’s unchanging purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obedience to God’s will of precept is another way to honor His wisdom.
          By aligning their lives with His commands, believers participate in
          His redemptive work and bear witness to His glory. This obedience,
          though sometimes costly, reflects the believer’s faith in God’s
          ultimate plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the wisdom of God calls for worship. Like Paul in Romans
          11:33–36, believers are moved to exclaim, “To him be the glory
          forever!” The contemplation of God’s wisdom leads to awe and
          adoration, as His plans, though often beyond human comprehension,
          reveal His perfect character and unsearchable ways.
