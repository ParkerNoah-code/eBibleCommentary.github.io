        <h1>Loving Is Basic to Christian Behavior</h1>
        <h2>The Foundation of Christian Love</h2>
        <p>
          New Testament Christianity is fundamentally a response to the
          revelation of God as a God of love. God, in His nature as a
          tripersonal Being, expresses love in a way that is unparalleled in
          human experience. The Father loves the ungodly so much that He has
          given His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for them. In turn, the Son gives
          His life, and together, the Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit to
          save sinners from eternal separation and lead them to eternal glory.
          This amazing reality of divine love, which begins with God's
          sacrificial love for us, becomes the foundation and motivation for
          Christians to love God and their neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This divine love is not only the basis for salvation but also the
          ongoing fuel for Christian life and behavior. The love that Christians
          are called to express is a direct reflection of the love God has shown
          to us. As Christians experience God's love in their lives, they are
          moved to love others—first and foremost God Himself, and then their
          neighbors, as Christ commanded (Matt. 22:35–40). The love Christians
          show is a response of gratitude for God's gracious love toward them
          and is meant to be modeled on the selfless love demonstrated by
          Christ.
        </p>

        <h2>The Hallmark of Christian Life: Love</h2>
        <p>
          Love is the hallmark of Christian life. As 1 John 5:3 and John 14:15,
          21, 23 highlight, the measure of our love for God is seen in our
          wholehearted and unqualified obedience to His commands. A true
          expression of love for God involves not only affection but a deep,
          abiding commitment to follow His will. Similarly, the measure of love
          for our neighbors is not only in what we feel but in what we do. The
          ultimate test of love for others is the willingness to lay down our
          lives for them (1 John 3:16; John 15:12–13). This sacrificial love
          entails giving, spending, and even impoverishing ourselves for the
          well-being of others, reflecting the love Christ demonstrated for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus’ story of the Good Samaritan, found in Luke 10:25–37, serves as
          a profound illustration of neighbor-love. In this parable, the
          Samaritan shows mercy to a Jewish man who, in cultural norms, would
          have been considered his enemy. The Samaritan’s love transcends
          societal boundaries, showing that true neighbor-love is not determined
          by who the other person is but by the need they have. Love for one's
          neighbor is self-sacrificial, seeking the good of others even at
          personal cost.
        </p>

        <h2>Neighbor-Love as Described in 1 Corinthians 13</h2>
        <p>
          The apostle Paul’s description of love in 1 Corinthians 13:4–7 offers
          a clear and challenging picture of what neighbor-love looks like in
          action. It is not based on emotion or feelings but is characterized by
          active service. Love is patient and kind, not envious, proud, or
          self-seeking. It does not boast or delight in evil, but it rejoices in
          the truth. True love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and
          always perseveres. This love is radical in its focus on the well-being
          of the other person, devoid of any selfish motivation. It is a love
          that seeks the good of others above all else.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lack of self-concern in love, as outlined in 1 Corinthians 13, is
          breathtaking. Neighbor-love, as defined by Jesus and modeled by the
          apostle Paul, is not about what we get from others, but what we give
          to them. It is a love that requires effort, sacrifice, and sometimes
          even personal discomfort, all for the sake of another’s good. The true
          measure of love is not how much we receive but how much we are willing
          to give.
        </p>

        <h2>Love as a Principle of Action</h2>
        <p>
          Love is not merely a feeling but a principle of action. It is a
          purposeful decision to honor and benefit others, driven by compassion
          for their needs. It is a commitment to do things for others, even when
          personal affection or sentiment is not present. Christian love is not
          contingent on how others behave or how we feel in the moment, but on
          the need to demonstrate Christ-like care for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus made it clear that love is to be the defining characteristic of
          His followers. In John 13:34–35, He commands His disciples to love one
          another as He has loved them, and by this love, the world will know
          that they are His disciples. This active love, expressed in service to
          one another, is the outward sign of an inward transformation that
          reflects God's love for humanity.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Call to Love</h2>
        <p>
          Christian love is not an optional or secondary virtue but the very
          essence of what it means to live as a follower of Christ. It is a love
          that mirrors God’s love for us—selfless, sacrificial, and
          unconditional. This love is active, not passive; it is demonstrated
          through deeds, not just words. Christians are called to love God with
          all their heart, soul, and mind, and to love their neighbors as
          themselves. This love, empowered by the Holy Spirit, is the foundation
          for all Christian behavior and is the hallmark of true discipleship.
