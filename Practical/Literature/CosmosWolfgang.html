        <h2>Objective of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          Smith makes an important distinction between scientific knowledge,
          that which is observable and emperically verifiable, and scientistic
          belief, that which is presupposed in science and not subject to
          scientific analysis. Scientific knowledge can be rigorously verified
          through the scientific method. It relies on tangible evidence and is
          continually subject to scrutiny and validation. In contrast,
          scientistic beliefs are not amenable to empirical verification, and
          they form the philosophical underpinnings of scientific endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smith demonstrates that the many scientistic tenets upon which science
          rests are volatile and groundless. Looking at the fields of cosmology,
          evolution, and psychology, Smith traces the origin of the scientistic
          unconscious that has perpetuated these ideas and formed an unfounded,
          dogmatic confidence in science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, he considers the metaphysical concept of transcendence,
          "breaking through the barrier of scientistic belief." Having revealed
          the limitations of emperical science and scientistic belief, he
          invites us to see an enlarged picture of the universe and of what lies
          beyond it.
