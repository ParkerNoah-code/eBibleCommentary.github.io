        <h2>Objective of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          Van Til wrote this book to give a positive case for his method of
          apolegetics and to defend that position against objections. His goal
          is to give, in outline form, a consistently biblical and Chrisitian
          method of defending the faith. In setting forth his positive case in
          the first section of the book, he frequently contrasts his view, the
          Reformed faith, with the Romanist or Evangelical point of view. In the
          second section of the book, he responds to various theological and
          philosophical objections.
        </p>
        <h1>Section 1: Positive Case</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Van Til accepts as his starting point the
          <a
            href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/belgic-confession"
            target="_blank"
            >Belgic Confession</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism"
            target="_blank"
            >Heidelberg Catechism</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/canons-dort"
            target="_blank"
            >The Canons of Dort</a
          >, and
          <a
            href="https://www.pcaac.org/bco/westminster-confession/"
            target="_blank"
            >Westminster Confession</a
          >. This is in contrast to the Romanist (e.g. Thomas Aquinas), Arminian
          (many mainline evangelicals like Dwight Moody or Billy Graham), and
          Dialectical (e.g. Karl Barth) systems. As a result, the Bible is
          understood to be the infallible rule of faith and practice and the
          ultimate standard for if his system stands or falls. The reformed
          confessions are secondarily considered as criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid critique of Van Til here is that he presupposes scripture but
          rarely will you find a reference or exegesis of any scripture in Van
          Til's writings. Scripture is supposed to be foundational according to
          his methodology and epistemology, but his interpretation of scripture
          is either assumed to be true, not shown from the text, or else it is
          assumed that the views from reformed theologians or confessions are
          faithfully and accurately representing scripture. Unfortunately this
          has the practical effect of making his secondary authorities primary
          over scripture.
        </p>
        <h2>Overview of Objections</h2>
        <p>
          Van Til gives a brief overview of objections with consessions
          following that. Most are critiques of his ideas about common grace,
          antithesis, and idealism.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://archives.calvin.edu/?p=creators/creator&id=297"
            target="_blank"
            >William Masselink</a
          >: He raises a common objection of Van Til about common grace. He
          disputes the idea of "absolute ethical antithesis between God and the
          natural man." His concern is that Van Til's idea doesn't properly
          account for the positive knowledge and actions of unbelievers.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, he does agree with Van Til that there is a distinction
          between believing and non-believing thought. For example, the
          transcendence or immenance of God is conceived of differently in a
          deistic or pantheistic system than in Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://outlook.reformedfellowship.net/sermons/c-van-til-and-his-critics/"
            target="_blank"
            >Cecil De Boer</a
          >: Van Til objects to starting with so called "neutral facts" and
          insists that we start with "God-interpreted facts." De Boer claims
          this is an idealist view that leads to pantheism if worked out
          logically. He also objects that if believers and non-believers do not
          hold certain shared facts between them which they can argue from, but
          are instead starting with interpretations of facts from two different
          points of view, then they are no longer sharing a common ground and
          cannot even refer to the same things by the language they use.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Van Til's thought a "neutral" or "brute" fact is not possible
          because every fact has an interpretation by virtue of its purpose in
          the plan of God. For this reason, believers can have knowledge about
          things, but it will not be proper until it acknowledges God. De Boer
          concedes that Van Til in certain places makes it clear that
          non-believers can have knowledge, but he says this goes against his
          general teaching. This objection, that Van Til makes extreme
          statements which appear to deny that non-believers can have any
          knowledge at all, is expressed by many.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://archives.calvin.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&id=42&q="
            target="_blank"
            >Jesse De Boer</a
          >: One of several more criticisms that Van Til is borrowing too much
          from speculative idealism in relation to his theory of knowledge. He
          objects that Van Til is treating God as one fact amongst many,
          treating God as a part of a greater system of truth, and thus is not
          Christian at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          He writes that he agrees with much of the basics of Van Til's thought.
          It is certain specifics pertaining to his theory of knowledge which he
          takes issue with.

          <a
            href="https://sb.rfpa.org/dr-james-daane-versus-prot-reformed-theology-and-ethics/"
            target="_blank"
            >James Daane</a
          >: He critiques Van Til's theology of common grace on the basis that
          it borrows too much from Hegelian rationalism. Hegel's philosophy is
          characterized by contradiction, bringing two opposites together, and
          creating a synthesis out of that. This again stems from an objection
          of Van Til's doctrine of antithesis, that there are two types of
          people in this world, regenerate and non-regenerate, who are
          fundementally antitheical to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas_Schilder" target="_blank"
            >Klaas Schilder</a
          >: He gives another critique of Van Til's doctrine of common grace,
          that it denies the general work of the Holy Spirit externally and
          internally. This view would logically lead to the denial of total
          depravity since people would have knowledge of God apart from the Holy
          Spirit and a denial human responsibility because people would know
          nothing of God or right and wrong.
        </p>

          <a
            href="https://www.thebanner.org/news/2011/01/in-memoriam-rev-dick-l-van-halsema"
            target="_blank"
            >Van Halsema</a
          >: He also objects that Van Til seems to be saying that non-Christians
          can know nothing and that Christians and non-Christians do not share
          the same logic, math, or any other knowledge. Another objection he
          raises is that because of Van Til's view of facts as interpretations
          of facts, he is phenomenalistic and existential in his thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          He concedes that Van Til's intentions and doctrines are not so much in
          question, but he maintains that Van Til is contradictory.
        </p>
        <h2>Christian Theology</h2>
        <p>
          In this section, Van Til goes on to explain the basics of the reformed
          doctrine of God, Man, Christ, Salvation, Church, and Last Things.
          These views can be found in the reformed confessions above or
          explained by theologians such as
          <a href="https://hermanbavinck.org/articles/" target="_blank"
            >Herman Bavinck</a
          >,
          <a href="https://evangelcs.org/kuyper/" target="_blank"
            >Abraham Kuyper</a
          >, and
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >Louis Berkhof</a
          >. I will just discuss some of the interesting points Van Til brings
          up.
