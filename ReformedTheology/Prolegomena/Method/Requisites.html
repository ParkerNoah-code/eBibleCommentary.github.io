          The requisites to the successful study of theology have already in
          part been indicated in speaking of its limitations. In spite of some
          repetition, however, we mention the following:
        </h2>
        <p>
          (a) A disciplined mind. Only such a mind can patiently collect the
          facts, hold in its grasp many facts at once, educe by continuous
          reflection their connecting principles, suspend final judgment until
          its conclusions are verified by Scripture and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert Browning, Ring and Book, 175 (Pope, 228)—“Truth nowhere lies,
          yet everywhere, in these; Not absolutely in a portion, yet Evolveable
          from the whole: evolved at last Painfully, held tenaciously by me.”
          Teachers and students may be divided into two classes: (1) those who
          know enough already; (2) those wish to learn more than they now know.
          Motto of Winchester School in England: “Disce, aut discede.”Butcher,
          Greek Genius, 213, 230—“The Sophists fancied that they were imparting
          education, when they were only imparting results. Aristotle
          illustrates their method by the example of a shoemaker who, professing
          to teach the art of making painless shoes, puts into the
          apprentice&#x27;s hand a large assortment of shoes ready-made. A witty
          Frenchman classes together those who would make science popular,
          metaphysics intelligible, and vice respectable. The word σχόλη, which
          first meant ‘leisure,’then ‘philosophical discussion,’ and finally
          ‘school,’ shows the pure love of learning among the Greeks.” Robert G.
          Ingersoll said that the average provincial clergyman is like the land
          of the upper Potomac spoken of by Tom Randolph, as almost worthless in
          its original state, and rendered wholly so by cultivation. Lotze,
          Metaphysics, 1:16—“the constant whetting of the knife is tedious, if
          it is not proposed to cut anything with it.” “To do their duty is
          their only holiday,” is the description of Athenian character given by
          Thucydides. Chitty asked a father inquiring as to his son&#x27;s
          qualifications for the law: “Can your son eat sawdust without any
          butter?” On opportunities for culture in the Christian ministry, see
          New Englander, Oct. 1875:644; A. H. Strong, Philosophy and Religion,
          273-275; Christ in Creation, 318-320.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) An intuitional as distinguished from a merely logical habit of
          mind,—or, trust in the mind&#x27;s primitive convictions, as well as
          in its processes of reasoning. The theologian must have insight as
          well as understanding. He must accustom himself to ponder spiritual
          facts as well as those which are sensible and material; to see things
          in their inner relations as well as in their outward forms; to cherish
          confidence in the reality and the unity of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vinet, Outlines of Philosophy, 39, 40—“If I do not feel that good is
          good, who will ever prove it to me?” Pascal: “Logic, which is an
          abstraction, may shake everything. A being purely intellectual will be
          incurably sceptical.” Calvin: “Satan is an acute theologian.” Some men
          can see a fly on a barn door a mile away, and yet can never see the
          door. Zeller, Outlines of Greek Philosophy, 93—“Gorgias the Sophist
          was able to show metaphysically that nothing can exist; that what does
          exist cannot be known by us; and that what is known by us cannot be
          imparted to others” (quoted by Wenley, Socrates and Christ, 28).
          Aristotle differed from those moderate men who thought it impossible
          to go over the same river twice,—he held that it could not be done
          even once (cf. Wordsworth, Prelude, 536). Dove, Logic of the Christian
          Faith, 1-29, and especially 25, gives a demonstration of the
          impossibility of motion: A thing cannot move in the place where it is;
          it cannot move in the places where it is not; but the place where it
          is and the places where it is not are all the places that there are;
          therefore a thing cannot move at all. Hazard, Man a Creative First
          Cause, 109, shows that the bottom of a wheel does not move, since it
          goes backward as fast as the top goes forward. An instantaneous
          photograph makes the upper part a confused blur, while the spokes of
          the lower part are distinctly visible. Abp. Whately: “Weak arguments
          are often thrust before my path; but, although they are most
          unsubstantial, it is not easy to destroy them. There is not a more
          difficult feat known than to cut through a cushion with a sword.” Cf.
          1 Tim. 6:20—“oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called”;
          3:2—“the bishop therefore must be ... sober-minded”—σώφρων = “well
          balanced.”The Scripture speaks of “sound [ὑγιής = healthful] doctrine”
          (1 Tim. 1:10). Contrast 1 Tim. 6:4—[νοσῶν = ailing] “diseased about
          questionings and disputes of words.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) An acquaintance with physical, mental, and moral science. The
          method of conceiving and expressing Scripture truth is so affected by
          our elementary notions of these sciences, and the weapons with which
          theology is attacked and defended are so commonly drawn from them as
          arsenals, that the student cannot afford to be ignorant of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goethe explains his own greatness by his avoidance of metaphysics:
          “Mein Kind, Ich habe es klug gemacht: Ich habe nie über&#x27;s Denken
          gedacht”—“I have been wise in never thinking about thinking”; he would
          have been wiser, had he pondered more deeply the fundamental
          principles of his philosophy; see A. H. Strong, The Great Poets and
          their Theology, 296-299, and Philosophy and Religion, 1-18; also in
          Baptist Quarterly, 2:393 sq. Many a theological system has fallen,
          like the Campanile at Venice, because its foundations were insecure.
          Sir William Hamilton: “No difficulty arises in theology which has not
          first emerged in philosophy.” N. W. Taylor: “Give me a young man in
          metaphysics, and I care not who has him in theology.”President Samson
          Talbot: “I love metaphysics, because they have to do with
          realities.”The maxim “Ubi tres medici, ibi duo athei,” witnesses to
          the truth of Galen&#x27;s words: ἄριστος ἰατρὸς καὶ φιλόσοφος—“the
          best physician is also a philosopher.” Theology cannot dispense with
          science, any more than science can dispense with philosophy. E. G.
          Robinson: “Science has not invalidated any fundamental truth of
          revelation, though it has modified the statement of many.... Physical
          Science will undoubtedly knock some of our crockery gods on the head,
          and the sooner the better.” There is great advantage to the preacher
          in taking up, as did Frederick W. Robertson, one science after
          another. Chemistry entered into his mental structure, as he said,
          “like iron into the blood.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) A knowledge of the original languages of the Bible. This is
          necessary to enable us not only to determine the meaning of the
          fundamental terms of Scripture, such as holiness, sin, propitiation,
          justification, but also to interpret statements of doctrine by their
          connections with the context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emerson said that the man who reads a book in a strange tongue, when
          he can have a good translation, is a fool. Dr. Behrends replied that
          he is a fool who is satisfied with the substitute. E. G. Robinson:
          “Language is a great organism, and no study so disciplines the mind as
          the dissection of an organism.” Chrysostom: “This is the cause of all
          our evils—our not knowing the Scriptures.” Yet a modern scholar has
          said: “The Bible is the most dangerous of all God&#x27;s gifts to
          men.” It is possible to adore the letter, while we fail to perceive
          its spirit. A narrow interpretation may contradict its meaning. Much
          depends upon connecting phrases, as for example, the διὰ τοῦτο and ἐφ᾽
          ᾧ, in Rom. 5:12. Professor Philip Lindsley of Princeton, 1813-1853,
          said to his pupils: “One of the best preparations for death is a
          thorough knowledge of the Greek grammar.”The youthful Erasmus: “When I
          get some money, I will get me some Greek books, and, after that, some
          clothes.” The dead languages are the only really living ones—free from
          danger of misunderstanding from changing usage. Divine Providence has
          put revelation into fixed forms in the Hebrew and the Greek. Sir
          William Hamilton, Discussions, 330—“To be a competent divine is in
          fact to be a scholar.”On the true idea of a Theological Seminary
          Course, see A. H. Strong, Philos. and Religion, 302-313.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) A holy affection toward God. Only the renewed heart can properly
          feel its need of divine revelation, or understand that revelation when
          given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ps. 25:14—“The secret of Jehovah is with them that fear him”; Rom.
          12:2—“prove what is the ... will of God”; cf. Ps. 36:1—“the
          transgression of the wicked speaks in his heart like an oracle.” “It
          is the heart and not the brain That to the highest doth attain.” To
          “learn by heart” is something more than to learn by mind, or by head.
          All heterodoxy is preceded by heteropraxy. In Bunyan&#x27;s
          Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress, Faithful does not go through the Slough of
          Despond, as Christian did; and it is by getting over the fence to find
          an easier road, that Christian and Hopeful get into Doubting Castle
          and the hands of Giant Despair. “Great thoughts come from the heart,”
          said Vauvenargues. The preacher cannot, like Dr. Kane, kindle fire
          with a lens of ice. Aristotle: “The power of attaining moral truth is
          dependent upon our acting rightly.” Pascal: “We know truth, not only
          by the reason, but by the heart.... The heart has its reasons, which
          the reason knows nothing of.” Hobbes: “Even the axioms of geometry
          would be disputed, if men&#x27;s passions were concerned in them.”
          Macaulay: “The law of gravitation would still be controverted, if it
          interfered with vested interests.” Nordau, Degeneracy: “Philosophic
          systems simply furnish the excuses reason demands for the unconscious
          impulses of the race during a given period of time.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord Bacon: “A tortoise on the right path will beat a racer on the
          wrong path.”Goethe: “As are the inclinations, so also are the
          opinions.... A work of art can be comprehended by the head only with
          the assistance of the heart.... Only law can give us liberty.” Fichte:
          “Our system of thought is very often only the history of our heart....
          Truth is descended from conscience.... Men do not will according to
          their reason, but they reason according to their will.” Neander&#x27;s
          motto was: “Pectus est quod theologum facit”—“It is the heart that
          makes the theologian.” John Stirling: “That is a dreadful eye which
          can be divided from a living human heavenly heart, and still retain
          its all-penetrating vision,—such was the eye of the Gorgons.”But such
          an eye, we add, is not all-penetrating. E. G. Robinson: “Never study
          theology in cold blood.” W. C. Wilkinson: “The head is a magnetic
          needle with truth for its pole. But the heart is a hidden mass of
          magnetic iron. The head is drawn somewhat toward its natural pole, the
          truth; but more it is drawn by that nearer magnetism.”See an affecting
          instance of Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s enlightenment, after the death of
          his wife, as to the meaning of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, in Fisher, Nat.
          and Meth. of Revelation, 165. On the importance of feeling, in
          association of ideas, see Dewey, Psychology, 106, 107.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) The enlightening influence of the Holy Spirit. As only the Spirit
          fathoms the things of God, so only he can illuminate our minds to
          apprehend them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Cor. 2:11, 12—“the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of
          God. But we received ... the Spirit which is from God; that we might
          know.” Cicero, Nat. Deorum, 66—“Nemo igitur vir magnus sine aliquo
          adfiatu divino unquam fuit.” Professor Beck of Tübingen: “For the
          student, there is no privileged path leading to the truth; the only
          one which leads to it is also that of the unlearned; it is that of
          regeneration and of gradual illumination by the Holy Spirit; and
          without the Holy Spirit, theology is not only a cold stone, it is a
          deadly poison.” As all the truths of the differential and integral
          calculus are wrapped up in the simplest mathematical axiom, so all
          theology is wrapped up in the declaration that God is holiness and
          love, or in the protevangelium uttered at the gates of Eden. But dull
          minds cannot of themselves evolve the calculus from the axiom, nor can
          sinful hearts evolve theology from the first prophecy. Teachers are
          needed to demonstrate geometrical theorems, and the Holy Spirit is
          needed to show us that the “new commandment” illustrated by the death
          of Christ is only an “old commandment which ye had from the beginning”
          (1 John 2:7). The Principia of Newton is a revelation of Christ, and
          so are the Scriptures. The Holy Spirit enables us to enter into the
          meaning of Christ&#x27;s revelations in both Scripture and nature; to
          interpret the one by the other; and so to work out original
          demonstrations and applications of the truth; Mat. 13:52—“Therefore
          every scribe who hath been made a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is
          like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his
          treasure things new and old.” See Adolph Monod&#x27;s sermons on
          Christ&#x27;s Temptation, addressed to the theological students of
          Montauban, in Select Sermons from the French and German, 117-179.
