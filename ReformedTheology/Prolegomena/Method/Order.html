        <h2>Order of Treatment in Systematic Theology.</h2>
        <p>
          1. Various methods of arranging the topics of a theological system.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The Analytical method of Calixtus begins with the assumed end of
          all things, blessedness, and thence passes to the means by which it is
          secured. (b) The Trinitarian method of Leydecker and Martensen regards
          Christian doctrine as a manifestation successively of the Father, Son
          and Holy Spirit. (c) The Federal method of Cocceius, Witsius, and
          Boston treats theology under the two covenants. (d) The
          Anthropological method of Chalmers and Rothe; the former beginning
          with the Disease of Man and passing to the Remedy; the latter dividing
          his Dogmatik into the Consciousness of Sin and the Consciousness of
          Redemption. (e) The Christological method of Hase, Thomasius and
          Andrew Fuller treats of God, man, and sin, as presuppositions of the
          person and work of Christ. Mention may also be made of (f) The
          Historical method, followed by Ursinus, and adopted in Jonathan
          Edwards&#x27;s History of Redemption; and (g) The Allegorical method
          of Dannhauer, in which man is described as a wanderer, life as a road,
          the Holy Spirit as a light, the church as a candlestick, God as the
          end, and heaven as the home; so Bunyan&#x27;s Holy War, and
          Howe&#x27;s Living Temple.

          See Calixtus, Epitome Theologiæ; Leydecker, De Œconomia trium
          Personarum in Negotio Salutis humanæ; Martensen (1808-1884), Christian
          Dogmatics; Cocceius, Summa Theologiæ, and Summa Doctrinæ de Fœdere et
          Testamento Dei, in Works, vol. vi; Witsius, The Economy of the
          Covenants; Boston, A Complete Body of Divinity (in Works, vol. 1 and
          2), Questions in Divinity (vol. 6), Human Nature in its Fourfold State
          (vol. 8); Chalmers, Institutes of Theology; Rothe (1799-1867),
          Dogmatik, and Theologische Ethik; Hase (1800-1890), Evangelische
          Dogmatik; Thomasius (1802-1875), Christi Person und Werk; Fuller,
          Gospel Worthy of all Acceptation (in Works, 2:328-416), and Letters on
          Systematic Divinity (1:684-711); Ursinus (1534-1583), Loci Theologici
          (in Works, 1:426-909); Dannhauer (1603-1666) Hodosophia Christiana,
          seu Theologia Positiva in Methodum redacta. Jonathan Edwards&#x27;s
          so-called History of Redemption was in reality a system of theology in
          historical form. It “was to begin and end with eternity, all great
          events and epochs in time being viewed ‘sub specie eternitatis.’ The
          three worlds—heaven, earth and hell—were to be the scenes of this
          grand drama. It was to include the topics of theology as living
          factors, each in its own place,” and all forming a complete and
          harmonious whole; see Allen, Jonathan Edwards, 379, 380.

          2. The Synthetic Method, which we adopt in this compendium, is both
          the most common and the most logical method of arranging the topics of
          theology. This method proceeds from causes to effects, or, in the
          language of Hagenbach (Hist. Doctrine, 2:152), “starts from the
          highest principle, God, and proceeds to man, Christ, redemption, and
          finally to the end of all things.” In such a treatment of theology we
          may best arrange our topics in the following order:
        </p>
        <p>1st. The existence of God.</p>
        <p>2d. The Scriptures a revelation from God.</p>
        <p>3d. The nature, decrees and works of God.</p>
        <p>
          4th. Man, in his original likeness to God and subsequent apostasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Redemption, through the work of Christ and of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>6th. The nature and laws of the Christian church.</p>
        <p>7th. The end of the present system of things.</p>
