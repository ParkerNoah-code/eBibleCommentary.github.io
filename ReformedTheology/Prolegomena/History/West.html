        <h2>
          In the Western Church, we may (with Hagenbach) distinguish three
          periods:
        </h2>
        <p>
          (a) The period of Scholasticism,—introduced by Peter Lombard
          (1100-1160), and reaching its culmination in Thomas Aquinas
          (1221-1274) and Duns Scotus (1265-1308).
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Systematic Theology had its beginning in the Eastern Church,
          its development has been confined almost wholly to the Western.
          Augustine (353-430) wrote his “Encheiridion ad Laurentium” and his “De
          Civitate Dei,” and John Scotus Erigena († 850), Roscelin (1092-1122),
          and Abelard (1079-1142), in their attempts at the rational explanation
          of the Christian doctrine foreshadowed the works of the great
          scholastic teachers. Anselm of Canterbury (1034-1109), with his
          “Proslogion de Dei Existentia” and his “Cur Deus Homo,” has sometimes,
          but wrongly, been called the founder of Scholasticism. Allen, in his
          Continuity of Christian Thought, represents the transcendence of God
          as the controlling principle of the Augustinian and of the Western
          theology. The Eastern Church, he maintains, had founded its theology
          on God&#x27;s immanence. Paine, in his Evolution of Trinitarianism,
          shows that this is erroneous. Augustine was a theistic monist. He
          declares that “Dei voluntas rerum natura est,” and regards God&#x27;s
          upholding as a continuous creation. Western theology recognized the
          immanence of God as well as his transcendence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter Lombard, however, (1100-1160), the “magister sententiarum,” was
          the first great systematizer of the Western Church, and his “Libri
          Sententiarum Quatuor” was the theological text-book of the Middle
          Ages. Teachers lectured on the “Sentences”(Sententia = sentence, Satz,
          locus, point, article of faith), as they did on the books of
          Aristotle, who furnished to Scholasticism its impulse and guide. Every
          doctrine was treated in the order of Aristotle&#x27;s four causes: the
          material, the formal, the efficient, the final. (“Cause” here =
          requisite: (1) matter of which a thing consists, e. g., bricks and
          mortar; (2) form it assumes, e. g., plan or design; (3) producing
          agent, e. g., builder; (4) end for which made, e. g., house.) The
          organization of physical as well as of theological science was due to
          Aristotle. Dante called him “the master of those who know.” James Ten
          Broeke, Bap. Quar. Rev., Jan. 1892:1-26—“The Revival of Learning
          showed the world that the real Aristotle was much broader than the
          Scholastic Aristotle—information very unwelcome to the Roman Church.”
          For the influence of Scholasticism, compare the literary methods of
          Augustine and of Calvin,—the former giving us his materials in
          disorder, like soldiers bivouacked for the night; the latter arranging
          them like those same soldiers drawn up in battle array; see A. H.
          Strong, Philosophy and Religion, 4, and Christ in Creation, 188, 189.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candlish, art.: Dogmatic, in Encycl. Brit., 7:340—“By and by a mighty
          intellectual force took hold of the whole collected dogmatic material,
          and reared out of it the great scholastic systems, which have been
          compared to the grand Gothic cathedrals that were the work of the same
          ages.” Thomas Aquinas (1221-1274), the Dominican, “doctor angelicus,”
          Augustinian and Realist,—and Duns Scotus (1265-1308), the Franciscan,
          “doctor subtilis,”—wrought out the scholastic theology more fully, and
          left behind them, in their Summæ, gigantic monuments of intellectual
          industry and acumen. Scholasticism aimed at the proof and
          systematizing of the doctrines of the Church by means of
          Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy. It became at last an illimitable morass
          of useless subtilities and abstractions, and it finally ended in the
          nominalistic scepticism of William of Occam (1270-1347). See Townsend,
          The Great Schoolmen of the Middle Ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The period of Symbolism,—represented by the Lutheran theology of
          Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560), and the Reformed theology of John
          Calvin (1509-1564); the former connecting itself with the Analytic
          theology of Calixtus (1585-1656), and the latter with the Federal
          theology of Cocceius (1603-1669).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lutheran Theology.—Preachers precede theologians, and Luther
          (1485-1546) was preacher rather than theologian. But Melanchthon
          (1497-1560), “the preceptor of Germany,” as he was called, embodied
          the theology of the Lutheran church in his “Loci Communes” = points of
          doctrine common to believers (first edition Augustinian, afterwards
          substantially Arminian; grew out of lectures on the Epistle to the
          Romans). He was followed by Chemnitz (1522-1586), “clear and
          accurate,” the most learned of the disciples of Melanchthon. Leonhard
          Hutter (1563-1616), called “Lutherus redivivus,”and John Gerhard
          (1582-1637) followed Luther rather than Melanchthon. “Fifty years
          after the death of Melanchthon, Leonhard Hutter, his successor in the
          chair of theology at Wittenberg, on an occasion when the authority of
          Melanchthon was appealed to, tore down from the wall the portrait of
          the great Reformer, and trampled it under foot in the presence of the
          assemblage” (E. D. Morris, paper at the 60th Anniversary of Lane
          Seminary). George Calixtus (1586-1656) followed Melanchthon rather
          than Luther. He taught a theology which recognized the good element in
          both the Reformed and the Romanist doctrine and which was called
          “Syncretism.” He separated Ethics from Systematic Theology, and
          applied the analytical method of investigation to the latter,
          beginning with the end, or final cause, of all things, viz.:
          blessedness. He was followed in his analytic method by Dannhauer
          (1603-1666), who treated theology allegorically, Calovius (1612-1686),
          “the most uncompromising defender of Lutheran orthodoxy and the most
          drastic polemicist against Calixtus,” Quenstedt (1617-1688), whom
          Hovey calls “learned, comprehensive and logical,” and Hollaz († 1730).
          The Lutheran theology aimed to purify the existing church, maintaining
          that what is not against the gospel is for it. It emphasized the
          material principle of the Reformation, justification by faith; but it
          retained many Romanist customs not expressly forbidden in Scripture.
          Kaftan, Am. Jour. Theol., 1900:716—“Because the mediæval
          school-philosophy mainly held sway, the Protestant theology
          representing the new faith was meanwhile necessarily accommodated to
          forms of knowledge thereby conditioned, that is, to forms essentially
          Catholic.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Reformed Theology.—The word “Reformed” is here used in its
          technical sense, as designating that phase of the new theology which
          originated in Switzerland. Zwingle, the Swiss reformer (1484-1531),
          differing from Luther as to the Lord&#x27;s Supper and as to
          Scripture, was more than Luther entitled to the name of systematic
          theologian. Certain writings of his may be considered the beginning of
          Reformed theology. But it was left to John Calvin (1509-1564), after
          the death of Zwingle, to arrange the principles of that theology in
          systematic form. Calvin dug channels for Zwingle&#x27;s flood to flow
          in, as Melanchthon did for Luther&#x27;s. His Institutes (“Institutio
          Religionis Christianæ”), is one of the great works in theology
          (superior as a systematic work to Melanchthon&#x27;s “Loci”). Calvin
          was followed by Peter Martyr (1500-1562), Chamier (1565-1621), and
          Theodore Beza (1519-1605). Beza carried Calvin&#x27;s doctrine of
          predestination to an extreme supralapsarianism, which is
          hyper-Calvinistic rather than Calvinistic. Cocceius (1603-1669), and
          after him Witsius (1626-1708), made theology centre about the idea of
          the covenants, and founded the Federal theology. Leydecker (1642-1721)
          treated theology in the order of the persons of the Trinity. Amyraldus
          (1596-1664) and Placeus of Saumur (1596-1632) modified the Calvinistic
          doctrine, the latter by his theory of mediate imputation, and the
          former by advocating the hypothetic universalism of divine grace.
          Turretin (1671-1737), a clear and strong theologian whose work is
          still a text-book at Princeton, and Pictet (1655-1725), both of them
          Federalists, showed the influence of the Cartesian philosophy. The
          Reformed theology aimed to build a new church, affirming that what is
          not derived from the Bible is against it. It emphasized the formal
          principle of the Reformation, the sole authority of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, while the line between Catholic and Protestant in Europe
          runs from west to east, the line between Lutheran and Reformed runs
          from south to north, the Reformed theology flowing with the current of
          the Rhine northward from Switzerland to Holland and to England, in
          which latter country the Thirty-nine Articles represent the Reformed
          faith, while the Prayer-book of the English Church is substantially
          Arminian; see Dorner, Gesch. prot. Theologie, Einleit., 9. On the
          difference between Lutheran and Reformed doctrine, see Schaff,
          Germany, its Universities, Theology and Religion, 167-177. On the
          Reformed Churches of Europe and America, see H. B. Smith, Faith and
          Philosophy, 87-124.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The period of Criticism and Speculation,—in its three divisions:
          the Rationalistic, represented by Semler (1725-1791); the
          Transitional, by Schleiermacher (1768-1834); the Evangelical, by
          Nitzsch, Müller, Tholuck and Dorner.
        </p>
        <p>
          First Division. Rationalistic theologies: Though the Reformation had
          freed theology in great part from the bonds of scholasticism, other
          philosophies after a time took its place. The Leibnitz- (1646-1754)
          Wolffian (1679-1754) exaggeration of the powers of natural religion
          prepared the way for rationalistic systems of theology. Buddeus
          (1667-1729) combated the new principles, but Semler&#x27;s (1725-1791)
          theology was built upon them, and represented the Scriptures as having
          a merely local and temporary character. Michaelis (1716-1784) and
          Doederlein (1714-1789) followed Semler, and the tendency toward
          rationalism was greatly assisted by the critical philosophy of Kant
          (1724-1804), to whom “revelation was problematical, and positive
          religion merely the medium through which the practical truths of
          reason are communicated” (Hagenbach, Hist. Doct., 2:397). Ammon
          (1766-1850) and Wegscheider (1771-1848) were representatives of this
          philosophy. Daub, Marheinecke and Strauss (1808-1874) were the
          Hegelian dogmatists. The system of Strauss resembled “Christian
          theology as a cemetery resembles a town.” Storr (1746-1805), Reinhard
          (1753-1812), and Knapp (1753-1825), in the main evangelical,
          endeavored to reconcile revelation with reason, but were more or less
          influenced by this rationalizing spirit. Bretschneider (1776-1828) and
          De Wette (1780-1849) may be said to have held middle ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second Division. Transition to a more Scriptural theology. Herder
          (1744-1803) and Jacobi (1743-1819), by their more spiritual
          philosophy, prepared the way for Schleiermacher&#x27;s (1768-1834)
          grounding of doctrine in the facts of Christian experience. The
          writings of Schleiermacher constituted an epoch, and had great
          influence in delivering Germany from the rationalistic toils into
          which it had fallen. We may now speak of a
        </p>
        <p>
          Third Division—and in this division we may put the names of Neander
          and Tholuck, Twesten and Nitzsch, Müller and Luthardt, Dorner and
          Philippi, Ebrard and Thomasius, Lange and Kahnis, all of them
          exponents of a far more pure and evangelical theology than was common
          in Germany a century ago. Two new forms of rationalism, however, have
          appeared in Germany, the one based upon the philosophy of Hegel, and
          numbering among its adherents Strauss and Baur, Biedermann, Lipsius
          and Pfleiderer; the other based upon the philosophy of Kant, and
          advocated by Ritschl and his followers, Harnack, Hermann and Kaftan;
          the former emphasizing the ideal Christ, the latter emphasizing the
          historical Christ; but neither of the two fully recognizing the living
          Christ present in every believer (see Johnson&#x27;s Cyclopædia, art.:
          Theology, by A. H. Strong).
