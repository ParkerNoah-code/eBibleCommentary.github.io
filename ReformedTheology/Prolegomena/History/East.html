          1. In the Eastern Church, Systematic Theology may be said to have had
          its beginning and end in John of Damascus (700-760).

          Ignatius († 115—Ad Trall., c. 9) gives us “the first distinct
          statement of the faith drawn up in a series of propositions. This
          systematizing formed the basis of all later efforts” (Prof. A. H.
          Newman). Origen of Alexandria (186-254) wrote his Περὶ Ἀρχῶν;
          Athanasius of Alexandria (300-373) his Treatises on the Trinity and
          the Deity of Christ; and Gregory of Nyssa in Cappadocia (332-398) his
          Λόγος κατηχητικὸς ὁ μέγας. Hatch, Hibbert Lectures, 323, regards the
          “De Principiis” of Origen as the “first complete system of dogma,” and
          speaks of Origen as “the disciple of Clement of Alexandria, the first
          great teacher of philosophical Christianity.” But while the Fathers
          just mentioned seem to have conceived the plan of expounding the
          doctrines in order and of showing their relation to one another, it
          was John of Damascus (700-760) who first actually carried out such a
          plan. His Ἔκδοσις ἀκριβὴς τῆς ὀρθοδόξου Πίστεως, or Summary of the
          Orthodox Faith, may be considered the earliest work of Systematic
          Theology. Neander calls it “the most important doctrinal text-book of
          the Greek Church.” John, like the Greek Church in general, was
          speculative, theological, semi-pelagian, sacramentarian. The
          Apostles&#x27; Creed, so called, is, in its present form, not earlier
          than the fifth century; see Schaff, Creeds of Christendom, 1:19. Mr.
          Gladstone suggested that the Apostles&#x27; Creed was a development of
          the baptismal formula. McGiffert, Apostles&#x27; Creed, assigns to the
          meagre original form a date of the third quarter of the second
          century, and regards the Roman origin of the symbol as proved. It was
          framed as a baptismal formula, but specifically in opposition to the
          teachings of Marcion, which were at that time causing much trouble at
          Rome. Harnack however dates the original Apostles&#x27; Creed at 150,
          and Zahn places it at 120. See also J. C. Long, in Bap. Quar. Rev.,
          Jan. 1892: 89-101.
