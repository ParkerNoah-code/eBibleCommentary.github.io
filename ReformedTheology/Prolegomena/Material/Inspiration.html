        <h2>The Scriptures given by Inspiration of God</h2>
        <p>
          The infallibility and divine authority of the Scriptures are due to
          the fact that they are the word of God; and they are the word of God
          because they were given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>A. The Nature of Inspiration. Definition</p>
        <p>
          The nature of inspiration is to be learnt from the Scriptures; from
          their didactic statements, and from their phenomena. There are certain
          general facts or principles which underlie the Bible, which are
          assumed in all its teachings, and which therefore must be assumed in
          its interpretation. We must, for example, assume, (1.) That God is not
          the unconscious ground of all things; nor an unintelligent force; nor
          a name for the moral order of the universe; nor mere causality; but a
          Spirit,—a self-conscious, intelligent, voluntary agent, possessing all
          the attributes of our spirits without limitation, and to an infinite
          degree. (2.) That He is the creator of the world, and extra-mundane,
          existing before, and independently of it; not its soul, life, or
          animating principle; but its maker, preserver, and ruler. (3.) That as
          a spirit He is everywhere present, and everywhere active, preserving
          and governing all his creatures and all their actions. (4.) That while
          both in the external world and in the world of mind He generally acts
          according to fixed laws and through secondary causes, He is free to
          act, and often does act immediately, or without the intervention of
          such causes, as in creation, regeneration, and miracles. (5.) That the
          Bible contains a divine, or supernatural revelation. The present
          question is not, Whether the Bible is what it claims to be; but, What
          does it teach as to the nature and effects of the influence under
          which it was written?
        </p>
        <p>
          On this subject the common doctrine of the Church is, and ever has
          been, that inspiration was an influence of the Holy Spirit on the
          minds of certain select men, which rendered them the organs of God for
          the infallible communication of his mind and will. They were in such a
          sense the organs of God, that what they said God said.
        </p>
        <p>B. Inspiration Supernatural</p>
        <p>
          This definition includes several distinct points. First. Inspiration
          is a supernatural influence. It is thus distinguished, on the one
          hand, from the providential agency of God, which is everywhere and
          always in operation; and on the other hand, from the gracious
          operations of the Spirit on the hearts of his people. According to the
          Scriptures, and the common views of men, a marked distinction is to be
          made between those effects which are due to the efficiency of God
          operating regularly through second causes, and those which are
          produced by his immediate efficiency without the intervention of such
          causes. The one class of effects is natural; the other, supernatural.
          Inspiration belongs to the latter class. It is not a natural effect
          due to the inward state of its subject, or to the influence of
          external circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          No less obvious is the distinction which the Bible makes between the
          gracious operations of the Spirit and those by which extraordinary
          gifts are bestowed upon particular persons. Inspiration, therefore, is
          not to be confounded with spiritual illumination. They differ, first,
          as to their subjects. The subjects of inspiration are a few selected
          persons; the subjects of spiritual illumination are all true
          believers. And, secondly, they differ as to their design. The design
          of the former is to render certain men infallible as teachers; the
          design of the latter is to render men holy; and of course they differ
          as to their effects. Inspiration in itself has no sanctifying
          influence. Balaam was inspired. Saul was among the prophets. Caiaphas
          uttered a prediction which &quot;he spake not of himself.&quot; (John
          11:51.) In the last day many will be able to say to Christ,
          &quot;Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name
          have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?&quot;
          To whom he will say: &quot;I never knew you; depart from me, ye that
          work iniquity.&quot; (Matt. 7:22, 23.)
        </p>
        <p>C. Distinction between Revelation and Inspiration</p>
        <p>
          Second. The above definition assumes a difference between revelation
          and inspiration. They differ, first, as to their object. The object of
          revelation is the communication of knowledge. The object or design of
          inspiration is to secure infallibility in teaching. Consequently they
          differ, secondly, in their effects. The effect of revelation was to
          render its recipient wiser. The effect of inspiration was to preserve
          him from error in teaching. These two gifts were often enjoyed by the
          same person at the same time. That is, the Spirit often imparted
          knowledge, and controlled in its communication orally or in writing to
          others. This was no doubt the case with the Psalmists, and often with
          the Prophets and Apostles. Often, however, the revelations were made
          at one time, and were subsequently, under the guidance of the Spirit,
          committed to writing. Thus the Apostle Paul tells us that he received
          his knowledge of the gospel not from man, but by revelation from Jesus
          Christ; and this knowledge he communicated from time to time in his
          discourses and epistles. In many cases these gifts were separated.
          Many of the sacred writers, although inspired, received no
          revelations. This was probably the fact with the authors of the
          historical books of the Old Testament. The evangelist Luke does not
          refer his knowledge of the events which he records to revelation, but
          says he derived it from those &quot;which from the beginning were
          eyewitnesses, and ministers of the Word.&quot; (Luke 1:2.) It is
          immaterial to us where Moses obtained his knowledge of the events
          recorded in the book of Genesis; whether from early documents, from
          tradition, or from direct revelation. No more causes are to be assumed
          for any effect than are necessary. If the sacred writers had
          sufficient sources of knowledge in themselves, or in those about them,
          there is no need to assume any direct revelation. It is enough for us
          that they were rendered infallible as teachers. This distinction
          between revelation and inspiration is commonly made by systematic
          writers. Thus Quenstedt (1685) says: &quot;Distingue inter
          revelationem et inspirationem. Revelatio vi vocis est manifestatio
          rerum ignotarum et occultarum, et potest fieri multis et diversis
          modis.… Inspiratio … est interna conceptum suggestio, seu infusio,
          sive res conceptæ jam ante scriptori fuerint cognitæ, sive occultæ.
          Illa potuit tempore antecedere scriptionem, hæc cum scriptione semper
          fuit conjuncta et in ipsam scriptionem influebat.&quot; Often,
          however, the distinction in question is overlooked. In popular
          language, inspiration is made to include both the supernatural
          communication of truth to the mind, and a supernatural control in
          making known that truth to others. The two gifts, however, differ in
          their nature, and should therefore be distinguished. Confounding them
          has sometimes led to serious error. When no revelation was necessary,
          no inspiration is admitted. Thus Grotius says: &quot;Vere dixi non
          omnes libros qui sunt in Hebræo Canone dictatos a Spiritu Sancto.
          Scriptos esse cum pio animi motu, non nego; et hoc est quod judicavit
          Synagoga Magna, cujus judicio in hac re stant Hebræi. Sed a Spiritu
          Sancto dictari historias nihil fuit opus: satis fuit scriptorem
          memoria valere circa res spectatas, aut diligentia in describendis
          veterum commentariis.&quot;2 It is an illogical conclusion, however,
          to infer that because a historian did not need to have the facts
          dictated to him, that therefore he needed no control to preserve him
          from error.
        </p>
        <p>D. Inspired Men the Organs of God</p>
        <p>
          A third point included in the Church doctrine of inspiration is, that
          the sacred writers were the organs of God, so that what they taught,
          God taught. It is to be remembered, however, that when God uses any of
          his creatures as his instruments, He uses them according to their
          nature. He uses angels as angels, men as men, the elements as
          elements. Men are intelligent voluntary agents; and as such were made
          the organs of God. The sacred writers were not made unconscious or
          irrational. The spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets.
          (1 Cor. 14:32.) They were not like calculating machines which grind
          out logarithms with infallible correctness. The ancients, indeed, were
          accustomed to say, as some theologians have also said, that the sacred
          writers were as pens in the hand of the Spirit; or as harps, from
          which He drew what sounds He pleased. These representations were,
          however, intended simply to illustrate one point, namely, that the
          words uttered or recorded by inspired men were the words of God. The
          Church has never held what has been stigmatized as the mechanical
          theory of inspiration. The sacred writers were not machines. Their
          self-consciousness was not suspended; nor were their intellectual
          powers superseded. Holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy
          Ghost. It was men, not machines; not unconscious instruments, but
          living, thinking, willing minds, whom the Spirit used as his organs.
          Moreover, as inspiration did not involve the suspension or suppression
          of the human faculties, so neither did it interfere with the free
          exercise of the distinctive mental characteristics of the individual.
          If a Hebrew was inspired, he spake Hebrew; if a Greek, he spake Greek;
          if an educated man, he spoke as a man of culture; if uneducated, he
          spoke as such a man is wont to speak. If his mind was logical, he
          reasoned, as Paul did; if emotional and contemplative, he wrote as
          John wrote. All this is involved in the fact that God uses his
          instruments according to their nature. The sacred writers impressed
          their peculiarities on their several productions as plainly as though
          they were the subjects of no extraordinary influence. This is one of
          the phenomena of the Bible patent to the most cursory reader. It lies
          in the very nature of inspiration that God spake in the language of
          men; that He uses men as his organs, each according to his peculiar
          gifts and endowments. When He ordains praise out of the mouth of
          babes, they must speak as babes, or the whole power and beauty of the
          tribute will be lost. There is no reason to believe that the operation
          of the Spirit in inspiration revealed itself any more in the
          consciousness of the sacred writers, than his operations in
          sanctification reveal themselves in the consciousness of the
          Christian. As the believer seems to himself to act, and in fact does
          act out of his own nature; so the inspired penmen wrote out of the
          fulness of their own thoughts and feelings, and employed the language
          and modes of expression which to them were the most natural and
          appropriate. Nevertheless, and none the less, they spoke as they were
          moved by the Holy Ghost, and their words were his words.
        </p>
        <p>E. Proof of the Doctrine</p>
        <p>
          That this is the Scriptural view of inspiration; that inspired men
          were the organs of God in such a sense that their words are to be
          received not as the words of men, but as they are in truth, as the
          words of God (1 Thess. 2:13), is proved,—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. From the signification and usage of the word. It is, of course,
          admitted that words are to be understood in their historical sense. If
          it can be shown what idea the men living in the apostolic age attached
          to the word θεόπνευστος and its equivalents, that is the idea which
          the Apostles intended to express by them. All nations have entertained
          the belief not only that God has access to the human mind and can
          control its operations, but that He at times did take such possession
          of particular persons as to make them the organs of his
          communications. Such persons were called by the Greeks θεοφόροι (those
          who bore a God within them); or, ἔνθεος (those in whom a God dwelt).
          In the Septuagint the word πνευματοφόρος is used in the same sense. In
          Josephus, the idea is expressed by the phrase &quot;τῷ θείῳ πνεύματι
          κεκινήμενος;&quot; to which the words of Peter (2 Peter 1:21) exactly
          answer, ὑπὸ πνεύματος φερόμενοι; and what is written by men under this
          influence of the Spirit is called γραφὴ θεόπνευστος. (2 Tim. 3:16.)
          Gregory of Nyssa, having quoted the words of our Lord in Matt. 22:43,
          &quot;How then doth David in Spirit call him Lord,&quot; adds, οὐκοῦν
          τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ Πνεύματος οἱ θεοφορούμενοι τῶν ἁγίων ἐμπνέονται, καὶ
          διὰ τοῦτο πᾶσα γραφὴ θεόπνευστος λέγεται, διὰ τὸ τῆς θείας ἐμπνεύσεως
          εἰναι διδασκαλίαν, that is, &quot;Hence those of the saints who by the
          power of the Spirit are full of God are inspired, and therefore all
          Scripture is called θεόπνευστος. because the instruction is by divine
          inspiration.&quot; The idea of inspiration is therefore fixed. It is
          not to be arbitrarily determined. We must not interpret the word or
          the fact, according to our theories of the relation of God to the
          world, but according to the usage of antiquity, sacred and profane,
          and according to the doctrine which the sacred writers and the men of
          their generation are known to have entertained on the subject.
          According to all antiquity, an inspired man was one who was the organ
          of God in what he said, so that his words were the words of the god of
          which he was the organ. When, therefore, the sacred writers use the
          same words and forms of expression which the ancients used to convey
          that idea, they must in all honesty be assumed to mean the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>Argument from the Meaning of the Word Prophet</p>
        <p>
          2. That this is the Scriptural idea of inspiration is further proved
          from the meaning of the word prophet. The sacred writers divide the
          Scriptures into the &quot;law and the prophets.&quot; As the law was
          written by Moses, and as Moses was the greatest of the prophets, it
          follows that all the Old Testament was written by prophets. If,
          therefore, we can determine the Scriptural idea of a prophet, we shall
          thereby determine the character of their writings and the authority
          due to them. A prophet, then, in the Scriptural sense of the term, is
          a spokesman, one who speaks for another, in his name, and by his
          authority; so that it is not the spokesman but the person for whom he
          acts, who is responsible for the truth of what is said. In Exodus 7:1,
          it is said, &quot;See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron
          thy brother shall be thy prophet,&quot; i.e., thy spokesman. This is
          explained by what is said in Exodus 4:14–16, &quot;Is not Aaron the
          Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.… Thou shalt speak
          unto him, and put words into his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth,
          and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall
          be thy spokesman unto the people; and he shall be, even he shall be,
          to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of
          God.&quot; (See Jeremiah 36:17, 18.) This determines definitely, what
          a prophet is. He is the mouth of God; one through whom God speaks to
          the people; so that what the prophet says God says. So when a prophet
          was consecrated, it was said, &quot;Behold, I have put my words in thy
          mouth.&quot; (Jer. 1:9; Is. 51:16.) That this is the Scriptural idea
          of a prophet is moreover evident from the formulas, constantly
          recurring, which relate to his duties and mission. He was the
          messenger of God; he spoke in the name of God; the words, &quot;Thus
          saith the Lord,&quot; were continually in his mouth. &quot;The word of
          the Lord&quot; is said to have come to this prophet and on that;
          &quot;the Spirit came upon,&quot; &quot;the power,&quot; or
          &quot;hand&quot; of God was upon him; all implying that the prophet
          was the organ of God, that what he said, he said in God&#x27;s name
          and by his authority. It is true, therefore, as Philo says, προφήτης
          γάρ ἴδιον οὐδὲν ἀποφθέγγεται ἀλλότρια δὲ πάντα ὑπηχοῦντος ἑτέρου.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is precisely what the Apostle Peter teaches when he says (2 Peter
          1:20, 21), &quot;No prophecy of the Scripture is of any private
          interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of
          man: but holy men spake as they were moved (φερόμενοι, borne along as
          a ship by the wind) by the Holy Ghost.&quot; Prophecy, i.e., what a
          prophet said, was not human, but divine. It was not the prophet&#x27;s
          own interpretation of the mind and will of God. He spoke as the organ
          of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>What the Prophets said God said</p>
        <p>
          3. It is another decisive proof that the sacred writers were the
          organs of God in the sense above stated, that whatever they said the
          Spirit is declared to have said. Christ himself said that David by the
          Spirit called the Messiah Lord. (Matt. 22:43.) David in the 95th Psalm
          said, &quot;To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
          heart;&quot; but the Apostle (Heb. 3:7), says that these were the
          words of the Holy Ghost. Again, in ch. 10:15, the same Apostle says,
          &quot;Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
          he had said before, This is the covenant that I will make with them
          after those days, saith the Lord.&quot; Thus quoting the language of
          Jeremiah 31:33, as the language of the Holy Ghost. In Acts 4:25, the
          assembled Apostles said, &quot;with one accord,&quot; &quot;Lord thou
          art God.… Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
          heathen rage?&quot; In Acts 28:25, Paul said to the Jews, &quot;Well
          spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers.&quot; It
          is in this way that Christ and his Apostles constantly refer to the
          Scriptures, showing beyond doubt that they believed and taught, that
          what the sacred writers said the Holy Ghost said.
        </p>
        <p>Inspiration of the New Testament Writers</p>
        <p>
          This proof bears specially, it is true, only on the writings of the
          Old Testament. But no Christian puts the inspiration of the Old
          Testament above that of the New. The tendency, and we may even say the
          evidence, is directly the other way. If the Scriptures of the old
          economy were given by inspiration of God, much more were those
          writings which were penned under the dispensation of the Spirit.
          Besides, the inspiration of the Apostles is proved, (1.) From the fact
          that Christ promised them the Holy Spirit, who should bring all things
          to their remembrance, and render them infallible in teaching. It is
          not you, He said, that speak, but the Spirit of my Father speaketh in
          you. He that heareth you heareth me. He forbade them to enter upon
          their office as teachers until they were endued with power from on
          high. (2.) This promise was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, when
          the Spirit descended upon the Apostles as a mighty rushing wind, and
          they were filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak as the Spirit
          gave them utterance (dabat eloqui, as the Vulgate more literally
          renders the words). From this moment they were new men, with new
          views, with new spirit, and with new power and authority. The change
          was sudden. It was not a development. It was something altogether
          supernatural; as when God said, Let there be light, and there was
          light. Nothing can be more unreasonable than to ascribe this sudden
          transformation of the Apostles from narrowminded, bigoted Jews, into
          enlightened, large-minded, catholic Christians, to mere natural
          causes. Their Jewish prejudices had resisted all the instructions and
          influence of Christ for three years, but gave way in a moment when the
          Spirit came upon them from on high. (3.) After the day of Pentecost
          the Apostles claimed to be the infallible organs of God in all their
          teachings. They required men to receive what they taught not as the
          word of man but as the word of God (1 Thess. 2:13); they declared, as
          Paul does (1 Cor. 14:37), that the things which they wrote were the
          commandments of the Lord. They made the salvation of men to depend on
          faith in the doctrines which they taught. Paul pronounces anathema
          even an angel from heaven who should preach any other gospel than that
          which he had taught. (Gal. 1:8.) John says that whoever did not
          receive the testimony which he bore concerning Christ, made God a
          liar, because John&#x27;s testimony was God&#x27;s testimony. (1 John
          5:10.) &quot;He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God,
          heareth not us.&quot; (4:6.) This assertion of infallibility, this
          claim for the divine authority of their teaching, is characteristic of
          the whole Bible. The sacred writers all, and everywhere, disclaim
          personal authority; they never rest the obligation to faith in their
          teachings, on their own knowledge or wisdom; they never rest it on the
          truth of what they taught as manifest to reason or as capable of being
          proved by argument. They speak as messengers, as witnesses, as organs.
          They declare that what they said God said, and, therefore, on his
          authority it was to be received and obeyed.
        </p>
        <p>The Testimony of Paul</p>
        <p>
          The Corinthians objected to Paul&#x27;s preaching that he did not
          attempt any rational or philosophical proof of the doctrines which he
          propounded; that his language and whole manner of discourse were not
          in accordance with rhetorical rules. He answers these objections,
          —first, by saying that the doctrines which he taught were not the
          truths of reason, were not derived from the wisdom of men, but were
          matters of divine revelation; that he simply taught what God declared
          to be true; and secondly, that as to the manner of presenting these
          truths, he was the mere organ of the Spirit of God. In 1 Cor. 2:7–13,
          he sets forth this whole subject in the clearest and most concise
          manner. The things which he taught, which he calls &quot;the wisdom of
          God,&quot; &quot;the things of the Spirit,&quot; i.e., the gospel, the
          system of doctrine taught in the Bible, he says, had never entered
          into the mind of man. God had revealed those truths by his Spirit; for
          the Spirit is the only competent source of such knowledge. &quot;For
          what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is
          in him? even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
          God.&quot; So much for the source of knowledge, and the ground on
          which the doctrines he taught were to be received. As to the second
          objection, which concerned his language and mode of presentation, he
          says, These things of the Spirit, thus revealed, we teach &quot;not in
          the words which man&#x27;s wisdom teacheth; but which the Holy Ghost
          teacheth,&quot; πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ συγκρίνοντες, combining
          spiritual with spiritual, i.e., clothing the truths of the Spirit in
          the words of the Spirit. There is neither in the Bible nor in the
          writings of men, a simpler or clearer statement of the doctrines of
          revelation and inspiration. Revelation is the act of communicating
          divine knowledge by the Spirit to the mind. Inspiration is the act of
          the same Spirit, controlling those who make the truth known to others.
          The thoughts, the truths made known, and the words in which they are
          recorded, are declared to be equally from the Spirit. This, from first
          to last, has been the doctrine of the Church, notwithstanding the
          endless diversity of speculations in which theologians have indulged
          on the subject. This then is the ground on which the sacred writers
          rested their claims. They were the mere organs of God. They were his
          messengers. Those who heard them, heard God; and those who refused to
          hear them, refused to hear God. (Matt. 10:40; John 13:20.)
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This claim to infallibility on the part of the Apostles was duly
          authenticated, not only by the nature of the truths which they
          communicated, and by the power which those truths have ever exerted
          over the minds and hearts of men, but also by the inward witness of
          the Spirit of which St. John speaks, when he says, &quot;He that
          believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself&quot; (1 John
          5:10); &quot;an unction from the Holy One.&quot; (1 John 2:20.) It was
          confirmed also by miraculous gifts. As soon as the Apostles were
          endued with power from on high, they spake in &quot;other
          tongues;&quot; they healed the sick, restored the lame and the blind.
          &quot;God also,&quot; as the Apostle says (Heb. 2:4), &quot;bearing
          them witness, both with signs, and wonders, and with divers miracles,
          and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.&quot; And Paul
          tells the Corinthians that the signs of an Apostle had been wrought
          among them &quot;in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty
          deeds.&quot; (2 Cor. 12:12.) The mere working of miracles was not an
          evidence of a divine commission as a teacher. But when a man claims to
          be the organ of God, when he says that God speaks through him, then
          his working of miracles is the testimony of God to the validity of his
          claims. And such testimony God gave to the infallibility of the
          Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above considerations are sufficient to show, that according to the
          Scriptures, inspired men were the organs, or mouth of God, in the
          sense that what they said and taught has the sanction and authority of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>F. Inspiration extends equally to all Parts of Scripture</p>
        <p>
          This is the fourth element of the Church doctrine on this subject.
          This means, first, that all the books of Scripture are equally
          inspired. All alike are infallible in what they teach. And secondly,
          that inspiration extends to all the contents of these several books.
          It is not confined to moral and religious truths, but extends to the
          statements of facts, whether scientific, historical, or geographical.
          It is not confined to those facts the importance of which is obvious,
          or which are involved in matters of doctrine. It extends to everything
          which any sacred writer asserts to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is proved, (1) Because it is involved in, or follows as a
          necessary consequence from, the proposition that the sacred writers
          were the organs of God. If what they assert, God asserts, which, as
          has been shown, is the Scriptural idea of inspiration, their
          assertions must be free from error. (2.) Because our Lord expressly
          says, &quot;The Scripture cannot be broken&quot; (John 10:35), i.e.,
          they cannot err. (3.) Because Christ and his Apostles refer to all
          parts of the Scriptures, or to the whole volume, as the word of God.
          They make no distinction as to the authority of the Law, the Prophets,
          or the Hagiographa. They quote the Pentateuch, the historical books,
          the Psalms, and the Prophets, as all and equally the word of God. (4.)
          Because Christ and the writers of the New Testament refer to all
          classes of facts recorded in the Old Testament as infallibly true. Not
          only doctrinal facts, such as those of the creation and probation of
          man; his apostasy; the covenant with Abraham; the giving the law upon
          Mount Sinai; not only great historical facts, as the deluge, the
          deliverance of the people out of Egypt, the passage of the Red Sea,
          and the like; but incidental circumstances, or facts of apparently
          minor importance, as e.g. that Satan tempted our first parents in the
          form of a serpent; that Moses lifted up a serpent in the wilderness;
          that Elijah healed Naaman, the Syrian, and was sent to the widow in
          Sarepta; that David ate the shew-bread in the temple; and even that
          great stumbling-block, that Jonah was three days in the whale&#x27;s
          belly, are all referred to by our Lord and his Apostles with the
          sublime simplicity and confidence with which they are received by
          little children. (5.) It lies in the very idea of the Bible, that God
          chose some men to write history; some to indite psalms; some to unfold
          the future; some to teach doctrines. All were equally his organs, and
          each was infallible in his own sphere. As the principle of vegetable
          life pervades the whole plant, the root, stem, and flower; as the life
          of the body belongs as much to the feet as to the head, so the Spirit
          of God pervades the whole Scripture, and is not more in one part than
          in another. Some members of the body are more important than others;
          and some books of the Bible could be far better spared than others.
          There may be as great a difference between St. John&#x27;s Gospel and
          the Book of Chronicles as between a man&#x27;s brain and the hair of
          his head; nevertheless the life of the body is as truly in the hair as
          in the brain.
        </p>
        <p>G. The Inspiration of the Scriptures extends to the Words</p>
        <p>
          1. This again is included in the infallibility which our Lord ascribes
          to the Scriptures. A mere human report or record of a divine
          revelation must of necessity be not only fallible, but more or less
          erroneous.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The thoughts are in the words. The two are inseparable. If the
          words, priest, sacrifice, ransom, expiation, propitiation,
          purification by blood, and the like, have no divine authority, then
          the doctrine which they embody has no such authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ and his Apostles argue from the very words of Scripture. Our
          Lord says that David by the Spirit called the Messiah Lord, i.e.,
          David used that word. It was in the use of a particular word, that
          Christ said (John 10:35), that the Scriptures cannot be broken.
          &quot;If he call them gods unto whom the word of God came, and the
          Scripture cannot be broken,&quot; etc. The use of that word,
          therefore, according to Christ&#x27;s view of the Scripture, was
          determined by the Spirit of God. Paul, in Gal. 3:16, lays stress on
          the fact, that in the promise made to Abraham, a word used is singular
          and not plural, &quot;seed,&quot; &quot;as of one,&quot; and not
          &quot;seeds as of many.&quot; Constantly it is the very words of
          Scripture which are quoted as of divine authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The very form in which the doctrine of inspiration is taught in the
          Bible, assumes that the organs of God in the communication of his will
          were controlled by Him in the words which they used. &quot;I have put
          my words in thy mouth.&quot; (Jer. 1:9.) &quot;It is not ye that
          speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.&quot;
          (Matt. 10:20.) They spake &quot;as the Spirit gave them
          utterance.&quot; (Acts 2:4.) &quot;Holy men of God spake as they were
          moved by the Holy Ghost.&quot; (2 Pet. 1:21.) All these, and similar
          modes of expression with which the Scriptures abound, imply that the
          words uttered were the words of God. This, moreover, is the very idea
          of inspiration as understood by the ancient world. The words of the
          oracle were assumed to be the words of the divinity, and not those
          selected by the organ of communication. And this, too, as has been
          shown, was the idea attached to the gift of prophecy. The words of the
          prophet were the words of God, or he could not be God&#x27;s spokesman
          and mouth. It has also been shown that in the most formally didactic
          passage in the whole Bible on this subject (1 Cor. 2:10–13), the
          Apostle expressly asserts that the truths revealed by the Spirit, he
          communicated in words taught by the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>Plenary Inspiration</p>
        <p>
          The view presented above is known as the doctrine of plenary
          inspiration. Plenary is opposed to partial. The Church doctrine denies
          that inspiration is confined to parts of the Bible; and affirms that
          it applies to all the books of the sacred canon. It denies that the
          sacred writers were merely partially inspired; it asserts that they
          were fully inspired as to all that they teach, whether of doctrine or
          fact. This of course does not imply that the sacred writers were
          infallible except for the special purpose for which they were
          employed. They were not imbued with plenary knowledge. As to all
          matters of science, philosophy, and history, they stood on the same
          level with their contemporaries. They were infallible only as
          teachers, and when acting as the spokesmen of God. Their inspiration
          no more made them astronomers than it made them agriculturists. Isaiah
          was infallible in his predictions, although he shared with his
          countrymen the views then prevalent as to the mechanism of the
          universe. Paul could not err in anything he taught, although he could
          not recollect how many persons he had baptized in Corinth. The sacred
          writers also, doubtless, differed as to insight into the truths which
          they taught. The Apostle Peter intimates that the prophets searched
          diligently into the meaning of their own predictions. When David said
          God had put &quot;all things&quot; under the feet of man, he probably
          little thought that &quot;all things&quot; meant the whole universe.
          (Heb. 2:8.) And Moses, when he recorded the promise that childless
          Abraham was to be the father &quot;of many nations,&quot; little
          thought that it meant the whole world. (Rom. 4:13). Nor does the
          Scriptural doctrine on this subject imply that the sacred writers were
          free from errors in conduct. Their infallibility did not arise from
          their holiness, nor did inspiration render them holy. Balaam was
          inspired, and Saul was among the prophets. David committed many
          crimes, although inspired to write psalms. Peter erred in conduct at
          Antioch; but this does not prove that he erred in teaching. The
          influence which preserved him from mistakes in teaching was not
          designed to preserve him from mistakes in conduct.
        </p>
        <p>H. General Considerations in Support of the Doctrine</p>
        <p>
          On this point little need be said. If the questions, What is the
          Scriptural doctrine concerning inspiration? and, What is the true
          doctrine? be considered different, then after showing what the
          Scriptures teach on the subject, it would be necessary to prove that
          what they teach is true. This, however, is not the position of the
          Christian theologian. It is his business to set forth what the Bible
          teaches. If the sacred writers assert that they are the organs of God;
          that what they taught He taught through them; that they spoke as they
          were moved by the Holy Ghost, so that what they said the Holy Spirit
          said, then, if we believe their divine mission, we must believe what
          they teach as to the nature of the influence under which they spoke
          and wrote. This is the reason why in the earlier period of the Church
          there was no separate discussion of the doctrine of inspiration. That
          was regarded as involved in the divine origin of the Scriptures. If
          they are a revelation from God, they must be received and obeyed; but
          they cannot be thus received without attributing to them divine
          authority, and they cannot have such authority without being
          infallible in all they teach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The organic unity of the Scriptures proves them to be the product of
          one mind. They are not only so united that we cannot believe one part
          without believing the whole; we cannot believe the New Testament
          without believing the Old; we cannot believe the Prophets without
          believing the Law; we cannot believe Christ without believing his
          Apostles; but besides all this they present the regular development,
          carried on through centuries and millenniums, of the great original
          promise, &quot;The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent&#x27;s
          head.&quot; This development was conducted by some forty independent
          writers, many of whom understood very little of the plan they were
          unfolding, but each contributed his part to the progress and
          completion of the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Bible be the work of one mind, that mind must be the mind of
          God. He only knows the end from the beginning. He only could know what
          the Bible reveals. No one, says the Apostle, knows the things of God
          but the Spirit of God. He only could reveal the nature, the thoughts,
          and purposes of God. He only could tell whether sin can be pardoned.
          No one knows the Son but the Father. The revelation of the person and
          work of Christ is as clearly the work of God as are the heavens in all
          their majesty and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, we have the witness in ourselves. We find that the truths
          revealed in the Bible have the same adaptation to our souls that the
          atmosphere has to our bodies. The body cannot live without air, which
          it receives and appropriates instinctively, with full confidence in
          its adaptation to the end designed. In like manner the soul receives
          and appropriates the truths of Scripture as the atmosphere in which
          alone it can breathe and live. Thus in receiving the Bible as true, we
          necessarily receive it as divine. In believing it as a supernatural
          revelation, we believe its plenary inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine involves nothing out of analogy with the ordinary
          operations of God. We believe that He is everywhere present in the
          material world, and controls the operations of natural causes. We know
          that He causes the grass to grow, and gives rain and fruitful seasons.
          We believe that He exercises a like control over the minds of men,
          turning them as the rivers of water are turned. All religion, natural
          and revealed, is founded on the assumption of this providential
          government of God. Besides this, we believe in the gracious operations
          of his Spirit, by which He works in the hearts of his people to will
          and to do; we believe that faith, repentance, and holy living are due
          to the ever-present influence of the Holy Spirit. If, then, this
          wonder-working God everywhere operates in nature and in grace, why
          should it be deemed incredible that holy men should speak as they were
          moved by the Holy Ghost, so that they should say just what He would
          have them say, so that their words should be his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all Christ is the great object of the Christian&#x27;s faith. We
          believe him and we believe everything else on his authority. He hands
          us the Old Testament and tells us that it is the Word of God; that its
          authors spoke by the Spirit; that the Scriptures cannot be broken. And
          we believe on his testimony. His testimony to his Apostles is no less
          explicit, although given in a different way. He promised to give them
          a mouth and a wisdom which their adversaries could not gainsay or
          resist. He told them to take no thought what they should say,
          &quot;For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
          ought to say.&quot; (Luke 12:12.) &quot;It is not ye that speak but
          the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.&quot; He said to them
          &quot;he that receiveth you receiveth me&quot;; and He prayed for
          those who should believe on Him through their word. We believe the
          Scriptures, therefore, because Christ declares them to be the Word of
          God. Heaven and earth may pass away, but his word cannot pass away.
        </p>
        <p>I. Objections</p>
        <p>
          A large class of the objections to the doctrine of inspiration, which
          for many minds are the most effective, arise from the rejection of one
          or other of the presumptions specified on a preceding page. If a man
          denies the existence of a personal, extramundane God, he must deny the
          doctrine of inspiration, but it is not necessary in order to prove
          that doctrine that we should first prove the being of God. If he
          denies that God exerts any direct efficiency in the government of the
          world, and holds that everything is the product of fixed laws, he
          cannot believe what the Scriptures teach of inspiration. If the
          supernatural be impossible, inspiration is impossible. It will be
          found that most of the objections, especially those of recent date,
          are founded on unscriptural views of the relation of God to the world,
          or on the peculiar philosophical views of the objectors as to the
          nature of man or of his free agency.

          A still larger class of objections is founded on misconceptions of the
          doctrine. Such objections are answered by the correct statement of
          what the Church believes on the subject. Even a man so distinguished
          for knowledge and ability as Coleridge, speaks with contempt of what
          he regards as the common theory of inspiration, when he utterly
          misunderstands the real doctrine which he opposes. He says: &quot;All
          the miracles which the legends of monk or rabbi contain, can scarcely
          be put in competition, on the score of complication, inexplicableness,
          the absence of all intelligible use or purpose, and of circuitous
          self-frustration, with those that must be assumed by the maintainers
          of this doctrine, in order to give effect to the series of miracles by
          which all the nominal composers of the Hebrew nation before the time
          of Ezra, of whom there are any remains, were successively transformed
          into automaton compositors,&quot; etc. But if the Church doctrine of
          inspiration no more assumes that the sacred writers &quot;were
          transformed into automaton compositors,&quot; than that every believer
          is thus transformed in whom God &quot;works to will and to do,&quot;
          then all such objections amount to nothing. If God, without
          interfering with a man&#x27;s free agency, can make it infallibly
          certain that he will repent and believe, He can render it certain that
          he will not err in teaching. It is in vain to profess to hold the
          common doctrine of Theism, and yet assert that God cannot control
          rational creatures without turning them into machines.

          But although the theologian may rightfully dismiss all objections
          founded on the denial of the common principles of natural and revealed
          religion, there are others which cannot be thus summarily disposed of.
          The most obvious of these is, that the sacred writers contradict each
          other, and that they teach error. It is, of course, useless to contend
          that the sacred writers were infallible, if in point of fact they err.
          Our views of inspiration must be determined by the phenomena of the
          Bible as well as from its didactic statements. If in fact the sacred
          writers retain each his own style and mode of thought, then we must
          renounce any theory which assumes that inspiration obliterates or
          suppresses all individual peculiarities. If the Scriptures abound in
          contradictions and errors, then it is vain to contend that they were
          written under an influence which precludes all error. The question,
          therefore, is a question of fact. Do the sacred writers contradict
          each other? Do the Scriptures teach what from any source can be proved
          not to be true? The question is not whether the views of the sacred
          writers were incorrect, but whether they taught error? For example, it
          is not the question Whether they thought that the earth is the centre
          of our system? but, Did they teach that it is? The objection under
          consideration, namely, that the Bible contains errors, divides itself
          into two. The first, that the sacred writers contradict themselves, or
          one the other. The second, that the Bible teaches what is inconsistent
          with the facts of history or science.

          As to the former of these objections, it would require, not a volume,
          but volumes to discuss all the cases of alleged discrepancies. All
          that can be expected here is a few general remarks: (1.) These
          apparent discrepancies, although numerous, are for the most part
          trivial; relating in most cases to numbers or dates. (2.) The great
          majority of them are only apparent, and yield to careful examination.
          (3.) Many of them may fairly be ascribed to errors of transcribers.
          (4.) The marvel and the miracle is that there are so few of any real
          importance. Considering that the different books of the Bible were
          written not only by different authors, but by men of all degrees of
          culture, living in the course of fifteen hundred or two thousand
          years, it is altogether unaccountable that they should agree
          perfectly, on any other hypothesis than that the writers were under
          the guidance of the Spirit of God. In this respect, as in all others,
          the Bible stands alone. It is enough to impress any mind with awe,
          when it contemplates the Sacred Scriptures filled with the highest
          truths, speaking with authority in the name of God, and so
          miraculously free from the soiling touch of human fingers. The errors
          in matters of fact which skeptics search out bear no proportion to the
          whole. No sane man would deny that the Parthenon was built of marble,
          even if here and there a speck of sandstone should be detected in its
          structure. Not less unreasonable is it to deny the inspiration of such
          a book as the Bible, because one sacred writer says that on a given
          occasion twenty-four, and another says that twenty-three thousand, men
          were slain. Surely a Christian may be allowed to tread such objections
          under his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admitting that the Scriptures do contain, in a few instances,
          discrepancies which with our present means of knowledge, we are unable
          satisfactorily to explain, they furnish no rational ground for denying
          their infallibility. &quot;The Scripture cannot be broken.&quot; (John
          10:35.) This is the whole doctrine of plenary inspiration, taught by
          the lips of Christ himself. The universe teems with evidences of
          design, so manifold, so diverse, so wonderful, as to overwhelm the
          mind with the conviction that it has had an intelligent author. Yet
          here and there isolated cases of monstrosity appear. It is irrational,
          because we cannot account for such cases, to deny that the universe is
          the product of intelligence. So the Christian need not renounce his
          faith in the plenary inspiration of the Bible, although there may be
          some things about it in its present state which he cannot account for.
        </p>
        <p>Historical and Scientific Objections</p>
        <p>
          The second great objection to the plenary inspiration of the Scripture
          is that it teaches what is inconsistent with historical and scientific
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here again it is to be remarked, (1.) That we must distinguish between
          what the sacred writers themselves thought or believed, and what they
          teach. They may have believed that the sun moves round the earth, but
          they do not so teach. (2.) The language of the Bible is the language
          of common life; and the language of common life is founded on
          apparent, and not upon scientific truth. It would be ridiculous to
          refuse to speak of the sun rising and setting, because we know that it
          is not a satellite of our planet. (3.) There is a great distinction
          between theories and facts. Theories are of men. Facts are of God. The
          Bible often contradicts the former, never the latter. (4.) There is
          also a distinction to be made between the Bible and our
          interpretation. The latter may come into competition with settled
          facts; and then it must yield. Science has in many things taught the
          Church how to understand the Scriptures. The Bible was for ages
          understood and explained according to the Ptolemaic system of the
          universe; it is now explained without doing the least violence to its
          language, according to the Copernican system. Christians have commonly
          believed that the earth has existed only a few thousands of years. If
          geologists finally prove that it has existed for myriads of ages, it
          will be found that the first chapter of Genesis is in full accord with
          the facts, and that the last results of science are embodied on the
          first page of the Bible. It may cost the Church a severe struggle to
          give up one interpretation and adopt another, as it did in the
          seventeenth century, but no real evil need be apprehended. The Bible
          has stood, and still stands in the presence of the whole scientific
          world with its claims unshaken. Men hostile or indifferent to its
          truths may, on insufficient grounds, or because of their personal
          opinions, reject its authority; but, even in the judgment of the
          greatest authorities in science, its teachings cannot fairly be
          impeached.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible duly to estimate the importance of this subject. If
          the Bible be the word of God, all the great questions which for ages
          have agitated the minds of men are settled with infallible certainty.
          Human reason has never been able to answer to its own satisfaction, or
          to the assurance of others, the vital questions, What is God? What is
          man? What lies beyond the grave? If there be a future state of being,
          what is it? and How may future blessedness be secured? Without the
          Bible, we are, on all these subjects, in utter darkness. How endless
          and unsatisfying have been the answers to the greatest of all
          questions, What is God? The whole Eastern world answers by saying,
          &quot;That He is the unconscious ground of being.&quot; The Greeks
          gave the same answer for philosophers, and made all nature God for the
          people. The moderns have reached no higher doctrine. Fichte says the
          subjective Ego is God. According to Schelling, God is the eternal
          movement of the universe, subject becoming object, object becoming
          subject, the infinite becoming finite, and the finite infinite. Hegel
          says, Thought is God. Cousin combines all the German answers to form
          his own. Coleridge refers us to Schelling for an answer to the
          question, What is God? Carlyle makes force God. A Christian child
          says: &quot;God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in
          his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and
          truth.&quot; Men and angels veil their faces in the presence of that
          answer. It is the highest, greatest, and most fruitful truth ever
          embodied in human language. Without the Bible, we are without God and
          without hope. The present is a burden, and the future a dread.
