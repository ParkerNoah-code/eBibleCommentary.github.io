          "The kingdom is God’s reign through God’s people over God’s
          place."<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>God's Reign</h2>
        <p>
          The vision of this kingdom isn't a utopian fantasy but rather an
          envisioning of a world that is structured according to God's divine
          grace and authority. God is the King who reigns on high!
        </p>
        <h2>God's People</h2>
        <p>
          God governs his people, but he also governs through his people. "Their
          relationship with God highlights the fact that they are thinking,
          responsible, communicative persons, and it is this relationship with
          God that allows them to act as God’s representative on earth."<sup

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin damaged humanity's connection with God and tainted God's creation.
          Nevertheless, God didn't abandon his plan for his kingdom. He will
          reestablish his rule over the entire creation, and at the core of the
          kingdom's arrival lies the reconciliation of the King's followers.
        </p>
        <h2>God's Place</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of God's realm, often referred to as the kingdom,
          envisions His rule on earth mirroring that in heaven. This divine
          vision initially took root in a garden, yet its ultimate purpose was
          to extend globally, where individuals from diverse backgrounds and
          cultures would thrive under God's benevolent rule.<sup>3</sup>
          While the notion of saving souls is accurate, it is not the entirety
          of God's plan. God, as a magnificent King, has pledged to bring about
          the renewal of all aspects of creation.
