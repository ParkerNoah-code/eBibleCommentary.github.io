        <h2>The End for which God Created the World</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="">Defining Terms</a>: To avoid all confusion in our inquiries
          concerning the end for which God created the world, a distinction
          should be observed between the chief end for which an agent performs
          any work, and the ultimate end.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="">Reason</a>: What may, and what may not, be supposed to be
          God’s ultimate end in the creation of the world? It would be relying
          too much on reason, to determine the affair of God’s last end in the
          creation of the world, without being principally guided by divine
          revelation. Nevertheless, as objections have been made against what
          the Scriptures have truly revealed, we may soberly consider in a few
          things, what seems rational to be supposed concerning this affair,
          before we proceed to consider what light divine revelation gives us in
          it.
