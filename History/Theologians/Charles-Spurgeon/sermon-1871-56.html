        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1023)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow
          be performed. O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh
          more." -- Psalm 65:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          UPON Zion there was erected an altar dedicated to God for the offering
          of sacrifices. Except when prophets were commanded by God to break
          through the rule, burnt offering was only to be offered there. The
          worship of God upon the high places was contrary to the divine
          command: "Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
          in every place that thou seest: but in the place which the Lord shall
          choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt
          offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee." Hence the
          tribes on the other side of Jordan, when they erected a memorial
          altar, disclaimed all intention of using it for the purpose of
          sacrifice, and said most plainly, "God forbid that we should rebel
          against the Lord, and turn this day from following the Lord, to build
          an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices,
          beside the altar of the Lord our God that is before his tabernacle."
        </p>
        <p>
          In fulfillment of this ancient type, we also "have an altar whereof
          they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle." Into our
          spiritual worship, no observers of materialistic ritualism may
          intrude; they have no right to eat at our spiritual altar, and there
          is no other at which they can eat and live for ever. There is but one
          altar Jesus Christ our Lord. All other altars are impostures and
          idolatrous inventions. Whether of stone, or wood, or brass, they are
          the toys with which those amuse themselves who have returned to the
          beggarly elements of Judaism, or else the apparatus with which
          clerical jugglers dupe the sons and daughters of men. Holy places made
          with hands are now abolished; they were once the figures of the true,
          but now that the substance has come, the type is done away with. The
          all-glorious person of the Redeemer, God and Man, is the great center
          of Zion's temple, and the only real altar of sacrifice. He is the
          church's head, the church's heart, the church's altar, priest, and all
          in all. "To him shall the gathering of the be." Around him we all
          congregate even as the tribes around the tabernacle of the Lord in the
          wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the church is gathered together, we may liken it to the
          assemblies upon Mount Zion, whither the tribes go up, even the tribes
          of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel. There the song went up, not
          so much from each separate worshipper as from all combined; there the
          praise as it rose to heaven was not only the praise of each one, but
          the praise of all. So where Christ is the center, where his one
          sacrifice is the altar whereon all offerings are laid; and where the
          church unites around that common center, and rejoices in that one
          sacrifice, there is the true Zion. If we this evening -- gathering in
          Christ's name, around his one finished sacrifice, present our prayers
          and praises entirely to the Lord through Jesus Christ, we are "come
          unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
          Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general
          assembly and church of the firstborn, whose names are written in
          heaven." This is Zion, even this house in the far-off islands of the
          Gentiles, and we can say indeed and of a truth, "Praise waiteth for
          thee, O God, in Zion; and unto thee shall the vow be performed."
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall, with devout attention, notice two things: the first is our
          holy worship, which we desire to render; and then the encouragement,
          the stimulative encouragement, which God provides for us: "O thou that
          hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, let us consider the HOLY OFFERING OF WORSHIP WHICH WE DESIRE
          TO PRESENT TO GOD. It is twofold: there is praise, and there is also a
          vow, a praise that waiteth, and a vow of which performance is
          promised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us think, first of all, of the praise. This is the chief
          ingredient of the adoration of heaven; and what is thought to be
          worthy of the world of glory, ought to be the main portion of the
          worship of earth. Although we shall never cease to pray as long as we
          live here below, and are surrounded by so many wants, yet we should
          never so pray as to forget to praise. "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
          done on earth, as it is heaven," must never be left out because we are
          pressed with want, and therefore hasten to cry, "Give us this day our
          daily bread." It will be a sad hour when the worship of the church
          shall be only a solemn wail. Notes of exultant thanksgiving should
          ever ascend from her solemn gatherings. "Praise the Lord O Jerusalem;
          praise thy God, O Zion." "Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new
          song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice
          in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their
          King." Let it abide as a perpetual ordinance, while sun and moon
          endure, "Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion." Never think little
          of praise, since holy angels and saints made perfect count it their
          life-long joy, and even the Lord himself saith, "Whoso offereth
          praise, glorifieth me." The tendency, I fear, among us has been to
          undervalue praise as a part of public worship, whereas it should be
          second to nothing. We frequently hear of prayer-meetings, and but
          seldom of praise-meetings. We acknowledge the duty of prayer by
          setting apart certain times for it; we do not always so acknowledge
          the duty of praise. I hear of "family prayer;" do I always hear of
          "family praise?" I know you cultivate private prayer: are you as
          diligent also in private thanksgiving and secret adoration of the
          Lord? In everything we are to give thanks; it is as much an apostolic
          precept as that other, "In everything, by prayer and supplication,
          make your requests known unto God." I have often said to you, dear
          brethren, that prayer and praise are like the breathing in and out of
          the air, and make up that spiritual respiration by which the inner
          life is instrumentally supported. We take in an inspiration of
          heavenly air as we pray: we breathe it out again in praise unto God,
          from whom it came; if, then, we would be healthy in spirit, let us be
          abundant in thanksgiving. Prayer, like the root of a tree, seeks for
          and finds nutriment; praise, like the fruit, renders a revenue to the
          owner of the vineyard. Prayer is for ourselves, praise is for God; let
          us never be so selfish as to abound in the one and fail in the other.
          Praise is a slender return for the boundless favors we enjoy; let us
          not be slack in rendering it in our best music, the music of a devout
          soul. "Praise the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his
          name; for it is pleasant."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us notice the praise which is mentioned in our text, which is to
          be so large a matter of concern to the Zion of God whenever the saints
          are met together.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will observe, first, that it is praise exclusively rendered to
          God. "Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion." "Praise for thee, and
          all the praise for thee," and no praise for man or for any other who
          may be thought to be, or may pretend to be, worthy of praise. Have I
          not sometimes gone into places called houses of God where the praise
          has waited for a woman -- for the Virgin, where praise has waited for
          the saints, where incense has smoked to heaven, and songs and prayers
          have been sent up to deceased martyrs and confessors who are supposed
          to have power with God? In Rome it is so, but in Zion it is not so.
          Praise waiteth for thee, O Mary, in Babylon; but praise waiteth for
          thee, O God, in Zion. Unto God, and unto God alone, the praise of his
          true church must ascend. If Protestants are free from this deadly
          error, I fear they are guilty of another, for in our worship, we too
          often minister unto our own selves. We do so when we make the tune and
          manner of the song to be more important than the matter of it. I am
          afraid that where organs, choirs, and singing men and singing women
          are left to do the praise of the congregation, men's minds are more
          occupied with the due performance of the music, than with the Lord,
          who alone is to be praised. God's house is meant to be sacred unto
          himself, but too often it is made an opera-house, and Christians form
          an audience, not an adoring assembly. The same thing may, unless great
          care be taken, happen amid the simplest worship, even though
          everything which does not savor of gospel plainness is excluded, for
          in that case we may drowsily drawl out the words and notes, with no
          heart whatever. To sing with the soul, this only is to offer
          acceptable song! We come not together to amuse ourselves, to display
          our powers of melody or our aptness in creating harmony we come to pay
          our adoration at the footstool of the Great King, to whom alone be
          glory for ever and ever. True praise is for God -- for God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, you must take heed lest the minister, who would, above all,
          disclaim a share of praise, should be set up as a demi-god among you.
          Refute practically the old slander that presbyter is only priest writ
          large. Look higher than the pulpit, or you will be disappointed. Look
          far above an arm of flesh, or it will utterly fail you. We may say of
          the best preacher upon the earth, "Give God the praise, for we know
          that this man is a sinner." If we thought that you paid superstitious
          reverence to us, we would, like Paul and Silas at Lystra, rend our
          clothes, and cry, "Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
          like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from
          these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and
          the sea, and all things that are therein." It is not to any man, to
          any priest, to any order of men, to any being in heaven or earth
          beside God, that we should burn the incense of worship. We would as
          soon worship cats with the Egyptians, as popes with the Romanists: we
          see no difference between the people whose gods grew in their gardens
          and the sect whose deity is made by their baker. Such vile idolatry is
          to be loathed. To God alone shall all the praise of Zion ascend.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be feared that some of our praise ascends nowhere at all, but
          it in as though it were scattered to the winds. We do not always
          realize God. Now, "he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and
          that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek trim;" this is as
          true of praise as of prayer. "God is a Spirit," and they that praise
          him must praise him "in spirit and in truth," for "the Father seeketh
          such" to praise him, and only such; and, if we do not lift our eyes
          and our hearts to him, we are but misusing words and wasting time. Our
          praise is not as it should be, if it be not reverently and earnestly
          directed to the Lord of Hosts. Vain is it to shoot arrows without a
          target: we must aim at God's glory in our holy songs, and that
          exclusively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, next, that it should be continual. "Praise waiteth for thee, O
          God, in Zion." Some translators conceive that the main idea is that of
          continuance. It remains; it abides; for Zion does loot break up when
          the assembly is gone. We do not leave the holiness in the material
          house, for it never was in the stone and the timber, but only in the
          living amenably of the faithful.
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, where'er thy people meet,</p>
        <p>There they behold thy mercy-seat;</p>
        <p>Where'er they seek thee, thou art found,</p>
        <p>And every place is hallow'd ground,</p>
        <p>For thou within no walls confined,</p>
        <p>Inhabitest the humble mind;</p>
        <p>Such ever bring thee where they come,</p>
        <p>And going, take thee to their home."</p>
        <p>
          The people of God, as they never cease to be a church, should maintain
          the Lord's praise perpetually as a community. Their assemblies should
          begin with praise and end with praise, and ever be conducted in a
          spirit of praise. There should be in all our solemn assemblies a
          spiritual incense altar, always smoking with "the pure incense of
          sweet spices, mingled according to the art of the apothecary": the
          thanksgiving which is made up of humility, gratitude, love,
          consecration, and holy joy in the Lord. It should be for the Lord
          alone, and it should never go out day nor night. "His mercy endureth
          for ever:" let our praises endure for ever. He makes the outgoings of
          the morning to rejoice, let us celebrate the rising of the sun with
          holy psalm and hymn. He makes the closing in of the evening to be
          glad, let him have our vesper praise. "One generation shall praise thy
          works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts." Could his mercy
          cease, there might be some excuse for staying our praises: but, even
          should it seem to be so, men who love the Lord would say with Job,
          "Shall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not also
          receive evil? The Lord gave, end the Lord hath taken away; and blessed
          be the name of the Lord." Let our praise abide, continue, remain, and
          be perpetual. It was a good idea of Bishop Farrar, that, in his own
          house he would keep up continual praise to God, and as, with a large
          family and household, he numbered just twenty-four, he set apart each
          one for an hour in the day to be engaged specially in prayer and
          praise, that he might girdle the day with a circle of worship. We
          could not do that. To attempt it might on our part be superstition;
          but to fall asleep blessing God, to rise in the night to meditate on
          him, and when we wake in the morning to feel our hearts leap in the
          prospect of his presence during the day, this is attainable, and we
          ought to reach it. It is much to be desired that all day long, in
          every avocation, and every recreation, the soul should spontaneously
          pour forth praise, even as birds sing, and flowers perfume the air,
          and sunbeams cheer the earth. We would be incarnate psalmody, praise
          enshrined in flesh and blood. From this delightful duty we would
          desire no cessation, and ask no pause. "Praise waits for thee, O God,
          in Zion;" thy praise may come and go, from the outside world, where
          all things ebb and flow, for it lies beneath the moon, and there is no
          stability in it; but amidst thy people, who dwell in thee, and who
          possess eternal life -- in them thy praise perpetually abides.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third point, however, is clear upon the surface of the words.
          "Praise waiteth for thee" -- as though praise must always be humble.
          The servants "wait" in the king's palace. There the messengers stand
          girt for any mission; the servitors wait, prepared to obey; and the
          courtiers surround the throne, all eager to receive the royal smile
          and to fulfill the high command. Our praises ought to stand, like
          ranks of messengers, waiting to hear what God's will is; for this is
          to praise him, Furthermore, true praise lies in the actual doing of
          the divine will, even this, -- to pause in sacred reverence until God
          the Lord shall speak, whatever that will may be; it is true praise to
          wait subserviently on him. Praises may be looked upon as servants who
          delight to obey their master's bidding. There is such a thing as an
          unholy familiarity with God; this age is not so likely to fall into it
          as some ages have been, for there is little familiarity with God of
          any sort now; public worship becomes more formal, and stately, and
          distant. The intense nearness to God which Luther enjoyed -- how
          seldom do we meet with it! But, however near we come to God, still he
          is God, and we are his creatures. He is, it is true, "our Father," but
          be it ever remembered that he is "our Father which art in heaven."
          "Our Father" -- therefore near and intimate: "our Father in heaven,"
          therefore we humbly, solemnly bow in his presence. There is a
          familiarity that runs into presumption: there is another familiarity,
          is so sweetly tempered with humility that it doth not intrude. "Praise
          waiteth for thee" with a servant's livery on, a servant's ear to hear,
          and a servant's heart to obey. Praise bows at thy foot-stool, feeling
          that it is still an unprofitable servant.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, perhaps, you are aware, dear friends, that there are other
          translations of this verse. "Praise waiteth for thee," may be read,
          "Praise is silent unto thee" -- "is silent before thee." One of the
          oldest Latin commentators reads it, "Praise and silence belong unto
          thee;" and Dr. Gill tells us, that in the King of Spain's Bible, it
          runs "The praise of angels is only silence before thee, O Jehovah," so
          that when we do our best our highest praise is but silence before God,
          and we must praise him with confession of shortcomings. Oh, that we
          too, as our poet puts it, might,
        </p>
        <p>"Loud as his thunders speak his praise,</p>
        <p>And sound it lofty as his throne!"</p>
        <p>
          But we cannot do that, and when our notes are most uplifted, and our
          hearts most joyous, we have not spoken all his praise. Compared to
          what his nature and glory deserve, our most earnest praise has been
          little more than silence. Oh, brethren, have you not often felt it to
          be so? Those who are satisfied with formal worship, think that they
          have done well when the music has been correctly sung; but those who
          worship God in spirit, feel that they cannot magnify him enough. They
          blush over the hymns they sing, and retire from the assembly of the
          saints mourning that they have fallen far short of his glory. O for an
          enlarged mind, rightly to conceive the divine majesty; next fur the
          gift of utterance to clothe the thought in fitting language; and then
          for a voice like many waters, to sound forth the noble strain. Alas!
          as yet, we are humbled at our failures to praise the Lord as we would.
        </p>
        <p>"Words are but air, and tongues but clay,</p>
        <p>And his compassions are divine;</p>
        <p>
          How, then, shall we proclaim to men God's glory? When we have done our
          best, our praise is but silence before the merit of his goodness, and
          the grandeur of his greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet it may be well to observe here, that the praise which God accepts,
          presents itself under a variety of forms. There is praise for God in
          Zion, and it is often spoken; but there is often praise for God in
          Zion, and it is silence. There are some who cannot sing vocally, but
          perhaps, before God, they sing best. There are some, I know, who sing
          very harshly and inharmoniously -- that is to say, to our ears; and
          yet God may accept them rather than the noise of stringed instruments
          carefully touched. There is a story told of Rowland Hill's being much
          troubled by a good old lady who would sit near him and sing with a
          most horrible voice, and very loudly -- as those people generally do
          who sing badly -- and he at last begged her not to sing so loudly. But
          when she said, "It comes from my heart," the honest man of God
          retracted his rebuke, and said, "Sing away, I should be sorry to stop
          you." When praise comes from the heart, who would wish to restrain it.
          Even the shouts of the old Methodists, their "hallelujahs" and
          "glorys," when uttered in fervor, were not to be forbidden; for if
          these should hold their peace, even the stones would cry out. But
          there are times when those who sing, and sing well, have too much
          praise in their soul for it to enclose itself in words. Like some
          strong liquors which cannot use a little vent, but foam and swell
          until they burst each hoop that binds the barrel; so, sometimes, we
          want a larger channel for our soul than that of mouth and tongue, and
          we long to have all our nerves and sinews made into harpstrings, and
          all the pores of our body made mouths of thankfulness. Oh, that we
          could praise with our whole nature, not one single hair of our heads,
          or drop of blood in our veins, keeping back from adoring the Most
          High! When this desire for praise is most vehement, we fall back upon
          silence, and quiver with the adoration which we cannot speak. Silence
          becomes our praise.
        </p>
        <p>"A sacred reverence cheeks our songs,</p>
        <p>And praise sits silent on our tongues."</p>
        <p>
          It would be well, perhaps, in our public service, if we had more often
          the sweet relief of silence. I am persuaded that silence, ay, frequent
          silence, is most beneficial; and the occasional unanimous silence of
          all the saints when they bow before God would, perhaps, better
          express, and more fully promote, devout feeling than any hymns which
          have been composed or songs that could be sung. To make silence a part
          of worship habitually might be affectation and formalism, but to
          introduce it occasionally, and even frequently into the service, would
          be advantageous and profitable. Let us, then, by our silence, praise
          God, and let us always confess that our praise, compared with God's
          deserving, is but silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would add that there is in the text the idea that praise waits for
          God expectantly. When we praise God, we expect to see more of him by
          and by, and therefore wait for him. We bless the King, but we desire
          to draw nearer to him. We magnify him for what we have seen, and we
          expect to see more. We praise him in his outer courts, for we shall
          soon be with him in the heavenly mansions. We glorify him for the
          revelation of himself in Jesus, for we expect to be like Christ, and
          to be with him where he is. When I cannot praise God for what I am, I
          will praise him for what I shall be. When I feel dull and dead about
          the present, I will take the words of our delightful hymn and say,
        </p>
        <p>"And a near song is in my mouth,</p>
        <p>To long-loved music set;</p>
        <p>Glory to thee for all the grace</p>
        <p>I have not tasted yet."</p>
        <p>
          My praise shall not only be the psalmody of the past, which is but
          discharging a debt of gratitude, but my faith shall anticipate the
          future, and wait upon God to fulfill his purposes; and I will begin to
          pay my praise even before the mercy comes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren and sisters, let us for a moment present our praise to
          God, each one of us on his own account. We have our common mercies. We
          call them common, but, oh, how priceless they are. Health to be able
          to come here and not to be stretched on a bed of sickness, I count
          this better than bags of gold. To have our reason, and not to be
          confined in yonder asylum; to have our children still about us and
          dear relatives spared still to us -- to have bread to eat and raiment
          to put on -- to have been kept from defiling our character -- to have
          been preserved to-day from the snares of the enemy! These are godlike
          mercies, and for all these our praises shall wait upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But oh! take up the thoughts suggested by the psalm itself in the next
          verse, and you will doubly praise God. "Iniquities prevail against me.
          As for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away." Infinite love
          has made us clean every whit! -- though we were black and filthy. We
          are washed -- washed in priceless blood. Praise him for this! Go on
          with the passage, "Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest
          to approach unto thee." Is not the blessing of access to God an
          exceeding choice one? Is it a light thing to feel that, though once
          far off, we are made nigh through the blood of Christ; and this
          because of electing love! "Blessed is the man whom thou choosest." Ye
          subjects of eternal choice, can you be silent? Has God favored you
          above others, and can your lips refuse to sing? No, you will magnify
          the Lord exceedingly, because he hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and
          Israel for his peculiar treasure. Let us read on, and praise God that
          we have an abiding place among his people -- "That he may dwell in thy
          courts." -- Blessed be God we are not to be cast forth and driven out
          after a while, but we have an entailed inheritance amongst the sons of
          God. We praise him that we have the satisfaction of dwelling in his
          house as children. "We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy
          house, even of thy holy temple." But I close the psalm, and simply say
          to you, there are ten thousand reasons for taking down the harp from
          the willows; and I know no reason for permitting it to hang there
          idle. There are ten thousand times ten thousand reasons for speaking
          well of "him who loved us, and gave himself for us." "The Lord hath
          done great things for us whereof we are glad." I remember hearing in a
          prayer-meeting this delightful verse mutilated in prayer, "The Lord
          hath done great things for us, whereof we desire to be glad." Oh,
          brethren, I dislike mauling, and mangling, and adding to a text of
          Scripture. If we are to have the Scriptures revised, let it be by
          scholars, and not by every ignoramus. "Desire to be glad," indeed?
          This is fine gratitude to God when he hath done great things for us."
          If these great things have been done, our souls must be glad, and
          cannot help it; they must overflow with gratitude to God for all his
          goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. So much on the first part of our holy sacrifice. Attentively let us
          consider the second, namely, the vow. "Unto thee shall the vow be
          performed."
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not given to vow-making in these days. Time was when it was far
          oftener done. It may be that had we been better men we should have
          made more vows; it may possibly be that had we been more foolish men
          we should have done the same. The practice was so abused by
          superstition, that devotion has grown half-ashamed of it. But we have,
          at any rate, most of us bound ourselves with occasional vows. I do
          confess to-day a vow I have not kept as I should desire; the vow made
          on my first conversion. I surrendered myself, body, soul, and spirit,
          to him that bought me with a price, and the vow was not made by way of
          excess of devotion or supererogation, it was but my reasonable
          service. You have done that. Do you remember the love of your
          espousals, the time when Jesus was very precious, and you had just
          entered into the marriage bond with him? You gave yourselves up to
          him, to be his for ever and for ever. O brethren and sisters, it is a
          part of worship to perform that vow. Renew it to-night, make another
          surrender of yourselves to him whose you are and whom you serve. Say
          to-night, as I will, with you, "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even
          with cords to the horns of the altar." Oh, for another thong to strap
          the victim to the altar-horn! Does the flesh struggle? Then let it be
          more fastly bound, never to escape from the altar of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, many of us did, in effect, make a most solemn vow at the time
          of our baptism. We were buried with Christ in baptism unto death, and,
          unless we were greatly dissembling, we avowed that we were dead in
          Christ and buried with him; wherein, also, we professed that we were
          risen with him. Now, shall the world live in those who are dead to it,
          and shall Christ's life be absent from those who are risen with him?
          We gave ourselves up there and then, in that solemn act of mystic
          burial. Recall that scene, I pray you; and as you do it blush, and ask
          God that your vow may yet be performed, as Doddridge well expresses
          it: --
        </p>
        <p>"Baptised into your Saviour's death</p>
        <p>Your souls to sin must die;</p>
        <p>With Christ your Lord ye live anew,</p>
        <p>With Christ ascend on high."</p>
        <p>
          Some such vow we made, too, when we united ourselves to the church of
          God. There was an understood compact between us and the church, that
          we would serve it, that we would seek to honor Christ by holy living,
          increase the church by propagating the faith, seek its unity, its
          comfort, by our own love and sympathy with the members. We had no
          right to join with the church if we did not mean to give ourselves up
          to it, under Christ, to aid in its prosperity and increase. There was
          a stipulation made, and a covenant understood, when we entered into
          communion and league with our brethren in Christ. How about that? Can
          we say that, as unto God and in his sight, the vow has been performed?
          Yes, we have been true to our covenant in a measure, brethren. Oh,
          that it were more fully so! Some of us made another vow, when we gave
          ourselves, as I trust, under divine call, altogether to the work of
          the Christian ministry; and though we have taken no orders, and
          received no earthly ordination, for we are no believers in man-made
          priests, yet tacitly it is understood that the man who becomes a
          minister of the church of God is to give his whole time to his work --
          that body, soul, and spirit should be thrown into the cause of Christ.
          Oh, that this vow were more fully performed by pastors of the church!
          You, my brethren, elders and deacons, when you accepted office, you
          knew what the church meant. She expected holiness and zeal of you. The
          Holy Ghost made you overseers that you might feed the flock of God.
          Your office proves your obligation. You are practically under a vow.
          Has that vow been performed? Have you performed it in Zion unto the
          Lord?
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides that, it has been the habit of godly men to make vows
          occasionally, in times of pain, and losses, and affliction. Did not
          the psalm we just now sang it so? --
        </p>
        <p>"Among the saints that fill thine house,</p>
        <p>My offerings shall be paid;</p>
        <p>There shall my zeal perform the vows</p>
        <p>My soul in anguish made.</p>
        <p>Now I am thine, for ever thine,</p>
        <p>Nor shall my purpose move!</p>
        <p>Thy hand hath loosed my bands of pain,</p>
        <p>And bound me with thy love.</p>
        <p>Here in thy courts I leave my vow,</p>
        <p>And thy rich grace record;</p>
        <p>Witness, ye saints, who hear me now,</p>
        <p>If I forsake the Lord."</p>
        <p>
          You said, "If I am ever raised up, and my life is prolonged, it shall
          be better spent." You said, also, "If I am delivered out of this great
          trouble, I hope to consecrate my substance more to God." Another time
          you said, "If the Lord will return to me the light of his countenance,
          and bring me out of this depressed state of mind, I will praise him
          more than ever before." Have you remembered all this? Coming here
          myself so lately from a sick bed, I at this time preach to myself. I
          only wish I had a better hearer; I would preach to myself in this
          respect, and say, "I charge thee, my heart, to perform thy vow." Some
          of us, dear friends, have made vows in time of joy, the season of the
          birth of the first-born child, the recovery of the wife from sickness,
          the merciful restoration that we have ourselves received, times of
          increasing goods, or seasons when the splendor of God's face has been
          unveiled before our wondering eye. Have we not made vows, like Jacob
          when he woke up from his wondrous dream, and took the stone which had
          been his pillow, and poured oil on its top, and made a vow unto the
          Most High? We have all had our Bethels. Let us remember that God has
          heard us, and let us perform unto him our vow which our soul made in
          her time of joy. But I will not try to open the secret pages of your
          private note-books. You have had tender passages, which you would not
          desire me to read aloud: the tears start at their memory. If your life
          were written, you would say, "Let these not be told; they were only
          between God and my soul" -- some chaste and blessed love passages
          between you and Christ, which must not be revealed to men. Have you
          forgotten how then you said, "I am my beloved's, and he is mine," and
          what you promised when you saw all his goodness made to pass before
          you. I have now to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, and
          bid you present unto the Lord to-night the double offering of your
          heart's praise and of your performed vow. "O magnify the Lord with me,
          and let us exalt his name together."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, time will fail me, but I must have a few words upon THE
          BLESSED ENCOURAGEMENT afforded us in the text for the presentation of
          these offerings unto God. Here it is, -- "O thou that hearest prayer,
          unto thee shall all flesh come?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, here, that God hears prayer. It is, in some aspects, the
          lowest form of worship, and yet he accepts it. It is not the worship
          of heaven, and it is, in a measure, selfish. Praise is superior
          worship, for it is elevating; it is the utterance of a soul that has
          received good from God, and is returning its love to him in
          acknowledgment. Praise has a sublime aspect. Now, observe, if praiser
          is heard, then praise will be heard too. If the lower form, on weaker
          wing as it were, reaches the throne of the majesty on high, how much
          more shall the seraphic wing of praise bear itself into the divine
          presence. Prayer is heard of God: therefore our praises and vows will
          be. And this is a very great encouragement, because it seems terrible
          to pray when you are not heard, and discouraging to praise God if he
          will not accept it. What would be the use of it? But if prayer and yet
          more praise be most surely heard, ah, brethren, then let us continue
          and abide in thanksgiving. "Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me, saith
          the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe too according to the text, that all prayer, if it be true
          prayer, is heard of God, for so it is put -- "Unto thee shall all
          flesh come." Oh, how glad I am at that word. My poor prayer -- shall
          God reject it? Yes, I might have feared so if he had said, "Unto thee
          shall all spirits come." Behold, my brethren, he takes the grosser
          part as it were, and looks at prayer in his infinite compassion,
          perceiving it to be what it is -- a feeble thing -- a cry coming from
          poor fallen flesh, and yet he puts it, "Unto thee shall all flesh
          come. My broken prayer, my groaning prayer shall get to thee, though
          it seems to me a thing of flesh, it is nevertheless wrought in me by
          thy Spirit. And, O my God, my song, though my voice be hoarse and
          oftentimes my notes most feeble, shall reach thee. Though I groan
          because it is so imperfect, yet even that shall come to thee. Prayer,
          if true, shall be received of God, notwithstanding all its faultiness,
          through Jesus Christ. Then so it will be with our praises and our
          vows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, prayer is always and habitually received of God. "O thou that
          hearest prayer." Not that didst hear it or on a certain occasion may
          have heard it, but thou that ever hearest prayer. If he always hears
          prayer, then he always hears praise. Is not this delightful to think
          of my praise, though it be but that of a child or a poor unworthy
          sinner -- God does hear it, does accept it, in spite of its
          imperfections, and does accept it always? Oh, I will have another hymn
          to-morrow, I will sing a new song to-morrow. I will forget my pain, I
          will forget for a moment all my care, and if I cannot sing aloud by
          reason of those that are with me, yet will I set the bells of my heart
          ringing, I will make my whole soul full of praise. If I cannot let it
          out of my mouth, I will praise him in my soul, because he always hears
          me. You know it is hard to do things for one who never accepts what
          you do. Many a wife has said, "Oh! it is hard. My husband never seems
          pleased. I have done all I can, but he takes no notice of little deeds
          of kindness." But how easy it is to serve a person who, when you have
          done any little thing, saw, "How kind it was of you" and thinks much
          of it. Ah, poor child of God, the Lord thinks much of thy praises,
          much of thy vows, much of thy prayers. Therefore, be not slack to
          praise and magnify him unceasingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this all the more, because we have not quite done with that word,
          "Unto thee shall all flesh come." All flesh shall come because the
          Lord hears prayer. Then all my praises will be heard and all the
          praises of all sorts of men, if sincere, come unto God. The great ones
          of the earth shall present praise, and the poorest of the poor also,
          for thou shalt not reject them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, Lord, wilt thou put it so; "Unto thee shall all flesh come," and
          wilt thou say, "but not such a one?" Wilt thou exclude me? Brethren,
          fear not that God will reject you. I remind you of what I told you the
          other night concerning a good earnest believing woman, who in prayer
          said, "Lord, I am content to be the second thou shalt forsake, but I
          cannot be the first." The Lord says all flesh shall come to him, and
          it is implied that he will receive them when they come -- all sorts of
          men, all classes and conditions of men. Then he cannot reject me if I
          go, nor my prayers if I pray, nor my praise if I praise him, nor my
          vows if I perform them. Come then, let us praise the Lord, let us
          worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our maker, for we
          are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done when I have said this. Dear brethren and sisters, there
          may be difficulties in your way; iniquities may hinder you, or
          infirmities; but there is the promise, "thou shalt purge them away."
          Infirmities may check you, but note the word of divine help, "Blessed
          is the man whom thou causest to approach unto thee." He will come to
          your aid, and lead you to himself. Infirmities, therefore, are
          overcome by divine grace. Perhaps your emptiness hinders you: "He
          shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house." It is not your
          goodness that is to satisfy either God or you, but God's goodness is
          to satisfy. Come, then, with thine iniquity, come with thine
          infirmity; come with thy emptiness. Come, dear brethren, if you have
          never come to God before. Come and confess your sin to God, and ask
          for mercy; you can do no less than ask. Come and trust his mercy,
          which endures for ever; it has no limit. Think not hardly of him, but
          come and lay yourself down at his feet. If you perish, perish there.
          Come and tell your grief; pour out your hearts before him. Bottom
          upwards turn the vessel of your nature, and drain out the last dreg,
          and pray to be filled with the fullness of his grace. Come unto Jesus;
          he invites you, he enables you. A cry from that pew will reach the
          sacred ear: "You have not prayed before," you say. Everything must
          have a beginning. Oh that that beginning might come now. It is not
          because you pray well that you are to come, but because the Lord hears
          prayer graciously, therefore, all flesh shall come. You are welcome;
          none can say you nay. Come! tis mercy's welcome hour. May the Lord's
          bands of love be cast about you; may you be drawn now to him. Come by
          way of the cross; come resting in the precious atoning sacrifice,
          believing in Jesus; and he has said, "Him that cometh unto me, I will
          in no wise cast out." The grace of our Lord be with you. Amen.
