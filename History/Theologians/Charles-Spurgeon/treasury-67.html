        <b> <p align="justify">A Psalm and song of David.</p></b> A combination
        of psalm and song, which may be best described by the term, "A Lyrical
        Poem." In this case the Psalm may be <i>said </i>or <i>sung</i>, and be
        equally suitable. We have had two such Psalms before, Psalms 30 and 48,
        and we have now the first of a little series of four following each
        other. It was meant that Psalms of pleading and longing should be
        followed by hymns of praise.
        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT AND DIVISION. David sings of the glory of God in his church,
          and in the fields of nature. Here is the song both of grace and
          providence. It may be that he intended hereby to commemorate a
          remarkably plentiful harvest, or to compose a harvest hymn for all
          ages. It appears to have been written after a violent rebellion had
          been quelled, verse 7; and foreign enemies had been subdued by signal
          victory, verse 8. It is one of the most delightful hymns in any
          language.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We shall view in verses 1-4 the way of approach to God.

        <p align="justify">
          Then from verses 5-8 we shall see the Lord in answer to prayer
          performing wonders for which he is praised.

        <p align="justify">

        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 1. Praise waits for you, O God, in Zion.
          </p></b
        >Though Babylon adores Antichrist, Zion remains faithful to her King; to
        him, and to him only, she brings her perpetual oblation of worship.
        Those who have seen in Zion the blood of sprinkling, and know themselves
        to belong to the church of the firstborn, can never think of her without
        presenting humble praise to Zion's God; his mercies are too numerous and
        precious to be forgotten.
        <p align="justify">
          The praises of the saints wait for a signal from the divine Lord, and
          when he shows his face they burst forth at once. Like a company of
          musicians gathered to welcome and honor a prince, who wait until he
          makes his appearance, so do we reserve our best praises until the Lord
          reveals himself in the assembly of his saints; and, indeed, until he
          shall descend from Heaven in the day of his appearing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Praise also waits like a servant or courtier in the royal
          halls—gratitude is humble and obedient. Praise attends the Lord's
          pleasure, and continues to bless him, whether he shows tokens of
          present favor or not. She is not soon wearied, but all through the
          night she sings on in sure hope that the morning comes. We shall
          continue to wait on, tuning our harps, amid the tears of earth. O what
          harmonies will those be which we will pour forth, when the home
          bringing is come, and the King shall appear in his glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The passage may be rendered "praise is silent for you;" it is calm,
          peaceful, and ready to adore you in quietness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Or, it may mean, our praise is but silence compared with your
          deservings, O God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Or, in solemn silence we worship you, because our praise cannot be
          uttered; accept, therefore, our silence as praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Or, we are so engrossed in your praise, that to all other things we
          are dumb; we have no tongue for anything but you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Certainly, when the soul is most filled with adoring awe, she is least
          content with her own expressions, and feels most deeply how inadequate
          are all mortal songs to proclaim the divine goodness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A church, bowed in silent adoration by a profound sense of divine
          mercy, would certainly offer more real praise than the sweetest voices
          aided by pipes and strings; yet, vocal music is not to be neglected,
          for this sacred hymn was meant to be sung.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is well before singing, to have the soul placed in a waiting
          attitude, and to be humbly conscious that our best praise is but
          silence compared with Jehovah's glory.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And unto you shall the vow be performed.</p></b>
        Perhaps a special vow made during a season of drought and political
        danger. Nations and churches must be honest and prompt in redeeming
        their promises to the Lord, who cannot be mocked with impunity.
        <p align="justify">
          So, too, must individuals. We are not to forget our vows, or to redeem
          them to be seen of men—unto God alone must they be performed, with a
          single eye to his acceptance. Believers are all under covenant, which
          they made at conversion, and have renewed upon being baptized, joining
          the church, and coming to the table, and some of them are under
          special pledges which they entered into under peculiar circumstances;
          these are to be piously and punctually fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We ought to be very deliberate in promising, and very punctilious in
          performing.
          <i>A vow unkept will burn the conscience like a hot iron.</i> Vows of
          service, of donation, of praise, or whatever the may be, are no
          trifles; and in the day of grateful praise they should, without fail,
          be fulfilled to the utmost of our power.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. O you who hear prayer.</p></b> This is
        your name, your nature, your glory. God not only has heard, but is now
        hearing prayer, and always must hear prayer, since he is an immutable
        being and never changes in his attributes.
        <p align="justify">
          What a delightful title for the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
          Christ! Every right and sincere prayer is as surely heard as it is
          offered. Here the psalmist brings in the personal pronoun you, and we
          beg the reader to notice how often "you," and "your," occur in this
          hymn; David evidently believed in a personal God, and did not adore a
          mere idea or abstraction.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Unto you shall all flesh come.</p></b> This shall
        encourage men of all nations to become suppliants to the one and only
        God, who proves his Deity by answering those who seek his face. Flesh
        they are, and therefore weak; frail and sinful, they need to pray; and
        you are such a God as they need, for you are touched with compassion,
        and do condescend to hear the cries of poor flesh and blood.
        <p align="justify">
          Many come to you now in humble faith, and are filled with good, but
          more shall be drawn to you by the attractiveness of your love, and at
          length the whole earth shall bow at your feet. To come to God is the
          life of true religion. We come weeping in conversion, hoping in
          supplication, rejoicing in praise, and delighting in service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          False gods must in due time lose their deluded votaries, for man when
          enlightened will not be longer be fooled; but each one who tries the
          true God is encouraged by his own success to persuade others also, and
          so the kingdom of God comes to men, and men come to it.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. Iniquities prevail against me.</p></b
        >Others accuse and slander me, and in addition to my own sins rise up
        and would beset me to my confusion, were it not for the remembrance of
        the atonement which covers every one of my iniquities.<i>
          Our sins would, but for grace, prevail against us in the court of
          divine justice, in the court of conscience, and in the battle of life. </i
        >Unhappy is the man who despises these enemies, and worse still is he
        who counts them his friends! He is best instructed who knows their
        deadly power, and flees for refuge to him who pardons iniquity.

        >
        You cover them all, for you have provided a covering atoning sacrifice,
        a mercy-seat which wholly covers your law. Note the word <i>our</i>, the
        faith of the one penitent who speaks for himself in the first clause,
        here embraces all the faithful in Zion. He is so persuaded of the
        largeness of forgiving love that he leads all the saints to sing of the
        blessing.
        <p align="justify">
          What a comfort that iniquities that prevail against us, do not prevail
          against God. They would keep us away from God, but he sweeps them away
          from before himself and us; they are too strong for us, but not for
          our Redeemer, who is mighty, yes, and almighty to save. It is worthy
          of note that as the priest washed in the laver before he sacrificed,
          so David leads us to obtain purification from sin before we enter upon
          the service of song. When we have washed our robes and made them white
          in his blood, then shall we acceptably sing, "Worthy is the Lamb who
          was slain."

          First, we are <i>chosen </i>of God, according to the good pleasure of
          his will, and this alone is blessedness.

        <p align="justify">
          Then, since we cannot and will not come to God of ourselves, he works
          graciously in us, and attracts us powerfully. He subdues our
          unwillingness, and removes our inability by the almighty workings of
          his transforming grace. This also is no slight blessedness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Furthermore, we, by his divine drawings, are made near by the blood of
          his Son, and brought near by his spirit, into intimate fellowship; so
          that we have <i>access </i>with boldness, and are no longer as those
          who are afar off by wicked works. Here also is unrivaled blessedness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To crown all, we do not come near in peril of dire destruction, as
          Nadab and Abihu did, but we approach as chosen and
          <i> accepted </i>ones, to become dwellers in the divine household.
          This is heaped up blessedness, vast beyond conception.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But dwelling in the house we are treated as sons, for the servant
          abides not in the house forever, but the son abides ever. Behold what
          manner of love and blessedness the Father has bestowed upon us that we
          may dwell in his house, and go no more out forever. Happy men who
          dwell at home with God. May both writer and reader be such men.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">That he may dwell in your courts.</p></b>
        Acceptance leads to abiding. God does not make a temporary choice, or
        give and take; his gifts and calling are without repentance. He who is
        once admitted to God's courts shall inhabit them forever; he shall be
        "No more a stranger or a guest, but like a child at home."
        <p align="justify">
          Permanence gives preciousness. Terminating blessings are but half
          blessings. To dwell in the courts of the Great King is to be ennobled;
          to dwell there forever is to be imparadised. Yet such is the portion
          of every man whom God has chosen and caused to approach unto him,
          though once his iniquities prevailed against him.

          The saints, in the commencement of the Psalm, offered praise in

          The direct allusion here is, no doubt, to the Lord's overthrow of the

          See in this verse how <i>righteousness </i>and <i> salvation </i>are

          Jesus could they be blended? The God who saves may answer our prayers
          in a way which puts unbelief into a flutter; but when faith spies the
          Savior, she remembers that "things are not what they seem," and she is
          of good courage. He who is terrible is also our refuge from terror

        as difficult to rule as the sea itself, they are as fitful, treacherous,
        restless, and furious; they will not brook the bridle nor be restrained
        by laws. Canute had not a more perilous seat by the rising billows, than
        many a king and emperor has had when the multitude have been set on
        mischief, and have grown weary of their lords.
        <p align="justify">
          God alone is King of nations. The sea obeys him, and the yet more
          tumultuous nations are kept in check by him. Human society owes its
          preservation to the continued power of God. Evil passions would secure
          its instant dissolution—envy, ambition, and cruelty would create
          anarchy tomorrow if God did not prevent. Whereof we have had clear
          proof in the various French revolutions.

        Signs of God's presence are not few, nor confined to any one region.
        These tokens are sometimes terrible phenomena in nature—such as
        earthquakes, pestilence, tornado, or storm; and when these are seen,
        even the most barbarous people tremble before God.

        Our rising hours are bright with hope, and our evening moments mellow
        with thanksgiving. Whether the sun go forth or come in we bless God and
        rejoice in the gates of the day. When the fair morning blushes with the
        rosy dawn we rejoice; and when the calm evening smiles restfully we
        rejoice still. We do not believe that the dew weeps the death of the

        God's visits leave a blessing behind; this is more than can be said of
        every visitor. When the Lord goes on visitations of mercy, he has
        abundance of necessary things for all his needy creatures. He is
        represented here as going round the earth, as a gardener surveys his
        garden, and as giving water to every plant that requires it, and that
        not in small quantities, but until the earth is drenched and soaked with
        a rich supply of refreshment.
        <p align="justify">
          O Lord, in this manner visit your church, and my poor, parched, and
          withering piety. Make your grace to overflow towards my graces; water

        <b> <p align="justify">You greatly enrich it.</p></b> Millions of
        dollars could not so much enrich mankind as the showers do. The soil is
        made rich by the rain, and then yields its riches to man; but God is the
        first giver of all. How truly rich are those who are enriched with
        grace—this is great riches.

        deluge poured from the clouds of yesterday may be succeeded by another
        tomorrow, and yet the waters above the firmament shall not fail.
        <p align="justify">
          How true this is in the realm of grace; there the river of God is full
          of water, and "of his fullness have we all received, and grace upon
          grace." The ancients in their fables spoke of Pactolus, which flowed
          over sands of gold; but this river of God, which flows above and from
          which the rain is poured, is far more enriching; for, after all, the
          wealth of men lies mainly in the harvest of their fields, without
          which even gold would be of no value whatever.

        <b> <p align="justify">You provide them with corn.</p></b>Corn is
        specially set apart to be the food of man. In its various species it is
        a divine provision for the nutriment of our race, and is truly called
        the staff of life. We hear in commerce of "prepared corn flour," but God
        prepared it long before man touched it. As surely as the manna was
        prepared of God for the tribes, so certainly is corn made and sent by
        God for our daily use.
        <p align="justify">
          What is the difference whether we gather wheat ears or manna; and what
          does it matter if the first comes upward to us, and the second comes
          downward to us? God is as much present beneath as above.

        all is prepared to produce corn, the Lord puts the finishing stroke, and
        the grain is forthcoming. Not even, when all the material is prepared,
        will the wheat be perfected without the continuous and perfecting
        operation of the Most High. Blessed be the Great Householder; he does
        not allow the harvest to fail, he supplies the teeming myriads of earth
        with bread enough from year to year. Even thus does he grant heavenly
        food to his redeemed ones. "He has given food unto those who fear him;
        he is ever mindful of his covenant."

        The harvest is the plainest display of the divine bounty, and the crown
        of the year. The Lord himself conducts the coronation, and sets the
        golden coronal upon the brow of the year.

          Or we may understand the expression to mean that God's love encircles
          the year as with a crown; each month has its gems, each day its pearl.
          Unceasing kindness girdles all time with a belt of love. The

        he creates.

        of the wind. Nature has no discords. Her airs are melodious, her chorus
        is full of harmony. All, all is for the Lord; the world is a hymn to the
        Eternal—blessed is he who, hearing, joins in it, and makes one singer in
        the mighty chorus.
