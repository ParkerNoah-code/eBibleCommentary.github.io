          It has been three and a half years since we published volume four of
          The Treasury of David. We have had many inquiries as to when volume
          five would appear. Our publishers have given hopeful replies, but
          their patience has been strained with our slow progress and long
          intervals of inactivity. The book is finally ready, much to the
          author's relief, though he is not as satisfied with this volume.
          <i>There is more work in it, but less to show for the effort. </i
          >Equal diligence has been given, but the material has been extremely
          slender and the research has had to go further afield to discover
          notes and expositions. Where there was much material there was more
          freedom of selection and the extracts were rich and suggestive. But
          now that the supply is scarce, what we have discovered after much
          hunting, is not always of the highest value.

            As most commentators on the Psalms proceed, they grow sloppy, appear
            to write hurriedly, and think superficially, either because they
            grow weary of their huge task or because they have already said
            their best things
          </p></i
        >. This makes the compiler's work more difficult. Another source of the
        increasing "famine in the land" is the lazy practice of referring to a
        parallel passage in a previous Psalm, or, what is worse, writers fall
        into the habit of repeating what they had previously said.
        <p align="justify">
          Our greatest trouble is that <i>the expounders are partial</i>. They
          spend all their love or at least their energies, on favorite parts of
          the sacred volume, passing over other passages with scarcely a remark,
          as if all Scripture were not equally inspired. Why should so much be
          written on Psalm 116, and so little on Psalm 118? Everyone seems to
          have written on certain passages. But having passed through these few
          frequent places, we travel a new road. With many texts, we have
          sighed, "Few there are that find it."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are writing about the Psalms, the best portion of the Old
          Testament, and so the fact is all the more singular. We have thousands
          of writers, of one kind or another, but they go in flocks, like sheep,
          traveling only the same texts and passages. The lack of a
          conscientious effort to expound all Scripture, causes much of it to
          appear as if it had never been written for our instruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is not the only reason why this volume has taken so long, though
          we judge it to be quite sufficient. We want to complete this work at
          our best, and not allow the close of it to exhibit signs of fatigue
          and decline. We have often sat to write comments on a Psalm and have
          risen from the task because we did not feel at home with it. It is
          useless compelling the mind, for such a production is like forced
          fruits, disappointing without flavor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We like to write after the style of John Bunyan, who said, "As I
          pulled, it came." We prefer that the pulling should be as gentle as
          possible, and so we have at times lingered for months over a Psalm,
          feeling unfit to enter it. This was the case with Psalm 109. We would
          never have been able to handle it, had it not been for the Bulgarian
          massacres. These threw us into a righteous indignation; while we were
          pondering, the fire burned. We melted the sentences and wished we
          could put them boiling on the monsters. Later news made us feel that
          the other side might be favored with a similar visitation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Other Psalms have been difficult, though none can compare with Psalm
          109. The grand cosmos of Psalm 104 could not be dismissed in a few
          days, and, even now, after putting our best efforts to it, we feel
          dissatisfied with the poor results. We have done our best, however,
          and have grappled honestly with all the hard places. We are a long way
          through our labor and look for full deliverance.

            >If some friends have had to wait, we hope they will gain by
            obtaining fruit all the riper and better, because it came in due

        <p align="justify">
          This volume is shorter than the others. This is due to Psalm 119,
          which is far too long to be incorporated in this volume. It is also
          too long for the next volume, so we will attempt it by itself, if
          health and strength permits. We plan that Psalm 120 to Psalm 150 will
          be a volume of the usual size. Then, The Treasury will be complete,
          Lord willing, in seven sections.

        <p align="justify">
          Innumerable thanks makes the continuation of this work a happy
          engagement. Free to take as much time as we please, this work will
          never degenerate into a task, nor will it be executed "by the piece,"
          as too much literary work is evidently done. If we die before it is
          completed, it will have been better that what we finished was executed
          with care, rather than to make a hurried close with inferior
          workmanship.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this volume, as in all the rest, we have had the indefatigable
          assistance of Mr. J. L. Keys, who, in addition to vast amounts of
          copying, has visited various libraries and museums to select from rare
          works that could not be found in any other place. Our venerable
          friend, George Rogers, has all along contributed his invaluable sermon
          outlines, for which we are deeply grateful. Mr. Gracey, the classical
          tutor of the Pastor's College, helped through the earlier Psalms by
          making selections from the Latin authors. When he was obliged to
          decline, owing to the pressure of his engagements, his place was ably
          filled by Mr. Gibson, formerly of Crayford, to whom we also owe
          certain notes from German authors. The immense mass of work that has
          been done in translating does not appear in the volume; only here and
          there has an extract been selected from the immense area of Latin that
          had to be traveled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many of the voluminous authors are so fanciful as to be frequently
          ridiculous in their interpretations;
          <i
            >amid acres of words, one can hardly find a grain of reasonable
            comment</i
          >. Worst still, if worse it can be, their translations are not
          reliable.
          <i
            >They generally throw the most weight on the slenderest threads,
            hanging ponderous teaching on doubtful interpretations.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Furthermore, Latin authors, like the English, greatly degenerate as
          they proceed, and the quotable portions become rare. We have enlarged
          on this point so that our readers may see that
          <i
            >this smaller volume represents far more work than any of its
            predecessors</i
          >. Driven to the Latin authors by the poverty of the English, we have
          not used a tenth of what has been selected. It has hardly been
          encouraging to do more work with less apparent results. Yet, it must
          be more useful to give even hints at the interpretation of neglected
          passages, than to merely present our readers with what they could
          easily have found concerning familiar passages. Reflecting on this, we
          thank God and take courage.

          Though frequently interrupted by ill health, we hope to proceed with
          all possible fathers, the libraries of his brethren will remain
          enriched and that other minds helped in wetting the infinite fullness
          of this incomparable portion of God's word.

            with the bottomless depths of the sacred Word.

        >Nor can we refrain from uttering our growing conviction that the
        Scriptures possess a verbal as well as a complete inspiration. Indeed,
        we are quite unable to see how they could have one without the other. So
        much meaning dwells in the turn of an expression, the tense of a verb,
        or the number noun that we believe in the inspiration of the words
        themselves. Certainly, the words are the things written, and the only
        things that can be written—for the refined spirit of a passage is not
        the creature of pen and ink. Our Lord's favorite sentence, "It is
        written," must apply to words, for only words are written. The words
        that the Holy Spirit teaches are not to be regarded as mere words.
        Besides their office of conserving the inner meaning, as the shell
        preserves the mystic germ in the egg, they are spirit and life. From all
        of them, we gather life, and they breathe fire into our souls.
        <p align="justify">
          May the enlightening Spirit rest on all students of the Psalms and
          grant them to see far more deeply into the hidden meaning of these
          sacred hymns than we have been able to do.
          <i
            >We rise from our perusal of each holy passage abashed at our short
            sight and almost overwhelmed at our audacity to have dared undertake
            such work</i
          >. May he who accepts us according to what a person has, and not
          according to what they bless our unworthy labor to His own glory, for
          Christ's sake.
