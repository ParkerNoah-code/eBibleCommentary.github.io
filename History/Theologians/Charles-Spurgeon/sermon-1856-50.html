        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.104</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 23, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
          sinners, Christ died for us." -- Romans 5:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall have nothing new to tell you; it will be as old as the
          everlasting hills, and so simple that a child may understand it.
          Love's commendation. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that,
          while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." God's commendation of
          himself and of his love is not in words, but in deeds. When the
          Almighty God would commend his love to poor man, it is not written,
          "God commendeth his love towards us in an eloquent oration"; it is not
          written that he commendeth his love by winning professions; but he
          commendeth his love toward us by an act, by a deed; a surprising deed,
          the unutterable grace of which eternity itself shall scarce discover.
          He "commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
          Christ died for us." Let us learn, then upon the threshold of our
          text, that if we would commend ourselves it must be by deeds, and not
          by words. Men may talk fairly, and think that thus they shall win
          esteem; they may order their words aright, and think that so they
          shall command respect; but let them remember, it is not the wordy
          oratory of the tongue, but the more powerful eloquence of the hand
          which wins the affection of "the world's great heart." If thou wouldst
          commend thyself to thy fellows, go and do -- not go and say; if thou
          wouldst win honour from the excellent, talk not, but act; and if
          before God thou wouldst show that thy faith is sincere, and thy love
          to him real: remember, it is no fawning words, uttered either in
          prayer or praise, but it is the pious deed, the holy act, which is the
          justification of thy faith, and the proof that it is the faith of
          God's elect. Doing, not saying -- acting, not talking -- these are the
          things which commend a man.
        </p>
        <p>"No big words of ready talkers,</p>
        <p>No fine boastings will suffice;</p>
        <p>Broken hearts and humble walkers,</p>
        <p>These are dear in Jesus' eyes."</p>
        <p>
          Let us imitate God, then, in this. If we would commend our religion to
          mankind, we cannot do it by mere formalities, but by gracious acts of
          integrity, charity and forgiveness, which are the proper discoveries
          of grace within. "Let your light so shine before men that they may see
          your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." "Let
          your conversation be such as becometh the gospel of Christ;" and so
          shall you honour him, and "adorn the doctrine" which you profess.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now for this mighty deed whereby God commended his love. We think
          that it is twofold. We believe the apostle has given us a double
          commendation of love. The first is, "God commendeth his love toward
          us, in that, Christ died for us"; the second commendation arises from
          our condition, "In that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first commendation of love, then, is this -- that "CHRIST DIED
          FOR US"; and as the whole text is double, so this sentence also
          contains a twofold commendation There is a commendation of love in the
          person who died -- Christ; and then in the act which he performed --
          "Christ died for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, it is the highest commendation of love, that it was
          CHRIST who died for us. When sinful man erred from his Maker, it was
          necessary that God should punish his sin. He had sworn by himself,
          "The soul that sinneth it shall die;" and God -- with reverence to his
          all-holy name be it spoken -- could not swerve from what he had said.
          He had declared on Sinai that he would by no means clear the guilty;
          but inasmuch as he desired to pardon the offending, it was necessary
          that some one else should bear the sufferings which the guilty ought
          to have endured, that so by the vicarious substitution of another, God
          might be "just, and yet the justifier of the ungodly." Now, the
          question might have arisen, "Who is he that shall be the scapegoat for
          man's offence? Who is he that shall bear his transgressions and take
          away his sins?" If I might be allowed to picture in my imagination
          (and mark, it is nothing more than imagination), I could almost
          conceive a parliament in heaven. The angels are assembled; the
          question is proposed to them: -- "Cherubim and seraphim, cohorts of
          the glorified, ye spirits that like flames of fire, swift at my
          bidding fly; ye happy beings, whom I have created for my honour! here
          is a question which I condescend to offer for your consideration: --
          Man has sinned; there is no way for his pardon but by some one
          suffering and paying blood for blood. Who shall it be?" I can conceive
          that there was silence throughout the august assembly. Gabriel spoke
          not: he would have stretched his wings and flapped the ether in a
          moment, if the deed had been possible; but he felt that he could never
          bear the guilt of a world upon his shoulders, and, therefore, still he
          sat. And there the mightiest of the mighty, those who could shake a
          world if God should will it, sat still, because they felt all
          powerless to accomplish redemption. I do not conceive that one of them
          would have ventured to hope that God himself would assume flesh and
          die. I do not think it could have entered even into angelic thought to
          conceive that the mighty Maker of the skies should bow his awful head
          and sink into a grave. I cannot imagine that the brightest and most
          seraphic of these glorified ones would for an instant have suffered
          such a thought to abide with him. And when the Son of God, upstarting
          from his throne, spoke to them and said, "Principalities and powers! I
          will become flesh, I will veil this Godhead of mine in robes of mortal
          clay, I will die!" -- I think I see the angels for once astonished.
          They had seen worlds created; they had beheld the earth, like a spark
          from the incandescent mass of unformed matter, hammered from the anvil
          of Omnipotence, and smitten off into space; and yet they had not
          wondered. But on this occasion I conceive that they ceased not to
          marvel. "What! wilt thou die, O Word! Creator! Master! Infinite!
          Almighty! wilt thou become a man and die?" "Yes," saith the Saviour,
          "I will." And are you not astonished, mortal men? Do you not wonder?
          What, will you not marvel? The hosts of heaven still are wondering.
          Though it is many an age since they heard it, they have not yet ceased
          to admire; and do not you begin to marvel yet? Shall the theme which
          stirs the marvel of the seraph not move your hearts? That God himself
          should become man, and then should die for you! "God commendeth his
          love toward us, in that, Christ should die. Roll that thought over in
          your mind; ponder it in your meditations; weigh it in your hearts. If
          ye have right ideas of Godhead, if ye know what Christ is, if ye can
          conceive him who is the everlasting God, and yet the man -- if ye can
          picture him, the pure, holy, perfect creature, and yet the everlasting
          Creator -- if ye can conceive of him as the man who was wounded, and
          yet the God who was exalted for ever -- if ye can picture him as the
          Maker of all worlds, as the Lord of providence, by whom all things
          exist and consist -- if ye can conceive of him now, as robed in
          splendor, surrounded with the choral symphonies of myriads of angels,
          then perhaps ye may guess how deep was that stride of condescension,
          when he stepped from heaven to earth, from earth into the grave, from
          the grave down, it is said, into the lowest "sheol," that he might
          make his condescension perfect and complete. "He hath commended his
          love" to you, my brethren, in that it was Christ, the Son of God, who
          died for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part of the first commendation lieth here, that Christ died
          for us. It was much love when Christ became man for us, when he
          stripped himself of the glories of his Godhead for awhile, to become
          an infant of a span long, slumbering in the manger of Bethlehem. It
          was no little condescension when he divested himself of all his
          glories, hung his mantle on the sky, gave up his diadem and the
          pleasures of his throne, and stooped to become flesh. It was moreover,
          no small love when he lived a holy and a suffering life for us; it was
          love amazing, when God with feet of flesh did tread the earth, and
          teach his own creatures how to live, all the while bearing their
          scoffs and jests with cool unangered endurance. It was no little
          favour of him that he should condescend to give us a perfect example
          by his spotless life; but the commendation of love lieth here -- not
          that Christ lived for us, but that Christ died for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, dear hearers, for a moment weigh those words. "Christ died for
          us!" Oh, how we love those brave defenders of our nation who but
          lately died for us in a far-off land! Some of us showed our sympathy
          to their sons and daughters, their wives and children, by contributing
          to support them, when the fathers were laid low. We feel that the
          wounded soldier is a friend to us, and that we are his debtors for
          ever. We may not love war; we may not, some of us, think it a
          Christian act to wield the sword; but, nevertheless, I am sure we love
          the men who sought to defend our country with their lives, and who
          died in our cause. We would drop a tear over the silent graves of
          Balaclava, if we were there now. And, if it should ever come to pass
          that any one of them should be called to die for us, should we not
          henceforth love them? Do any of us know what is contained in that
          great word "die?" Can we measure it? Can we tell its depths of
          suffering or its heights of agony? "Died for us!" Some of you have
          seen death; you know how great and dread is its power; you have seen
          the strong man bowing down, his knees quivering; you have beheld the
          eyestrings break, and seen the eyeballs glazed in death; you have
          marked the torture and the agonies which appal men in their dying
          hours; and you have said, "Ah! it is a solemn and an awful thing to
          die." But, my hearers, "Christ died for us." All that death could mean
          Christ endured; he yielded up the ghost, he resigned his breath; he
          became a lifeless corpse, and his body was interred, even like the
          bodies of the rest that died. "Christ died for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the circumstances which attended his death. It was no common
          death he died; it was a death of ignominy, for he was put to death by
          a legal slaughter; it was a death of unutterable pain, for he was
          crucified; and what more painful fate than to die nailed to a cross?
          It was a long protracted death, for he hung for hours, with only his
          hands and his feet pierced -- parts which are far away from the seat
          of life, but in which are situated the most tender nerves, full of
          sensibility. He suffered a death which for its circumstances still
          remain unparalleled. It was no speedy blow which crushed the life out
          of the body, and ended it; but it was a lingering, long, and doleful
          death, attended with no comforts and no sympathy, but surrounded with
          scorn and contempt. Picture him! They have hurled him on his back;
          they have driven nails through his hands and his feet; they have
          lifted him up. See! They have dashed the cross into its place. It is
          fixed. And now behold him! Mark his eyes, all full of tears; behold
          his head, hanging on his breast. Ah! mark him, he seems all silently
          to say, "I am poured out like water; all my bones are out of joint; I
          am brought into the dust of death." Hear him, when he groans, "I
          thirst." Above all, listen to him, whilst he cries, "Eloi, Eloi, lama
          sabachthani?" My words cannot picture him; my thoughts fail to express
          it. No painter ever accomplished it, nor shall any speaker be able to
          perform it. Yet I beseech you regard the Royal Sufferer. See him, with
          the eye of your faith, hanging on the bloody tree. Hear him cry,
          before he dies, "It is finished!"
        </p>
        <p>"See from his head, his hands, his feet,</p>
        <p>Sorrow and love flow mingled down!</p>
        <p>Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,</p>
        <p>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?"</p>
        <p>
          Oh! how i wish I could stir you! If I should tell you some silly story
          of a love-sick maid, ye would weep; if I should turn novelist, and
          give you some sad account of a fabled hero who had died in pain -- if
          it were a fiction, I should have your hearts; but this is a dread and
          solemn reality, and one with which you are intimately connected, for
          all this was done for as many of you as sincerely repent of your sins.
        </p>
        <p>"All ye that pass by,</p>
        <p>to Jesus draw nigh:</p>
        <p>To you is it nothing that Jesus should die?"</p>
        <p>
          Bethink you, that if you are saved, it is something to you, for the
          blood which trickles from his hands, distils for you. That frame which
          writhes in torture writhes for you; those knees, so weak with pain,
          are weak for you; those eyes, dripping with showers of tears, do drop
          for you. Ah! think of him, then, ye who have faith in him; look to
          him, and as many of you as have not yet believed, I will pray for you,
          that ye may now behold him as the expiation of your guilt; as the key
          which opens heaven to all believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our second point was this: "God commendeth his love towards us," not
          only because Christ died for us, but that CHRIST DIED FOR US WHILE WE
          WERE YET SINNERS."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us for a moment consider what sort of sinners many of us have
          been, and then we shall see it was marvellous grace that Christ should
          die for men -- not as penitents"but as sinners. Consider how many of
          us have been continual sinners. We have not sinned once, nor twice,
          but ten thousand times. Our life, however upright and moral it has
          been, is stained by a succession of sins. If we have not revolted
          against God in the outward acts which proclaim the profligate to be a
          great sinner, yet the thoughts of our heart and the words of our lips
          are swift witnesses against us that we have continually transgressed.
          And oh! my brethren, who is there among us who will not likewise
          confess to sins of act? Who among us has not broken the Sabbath-day?
          Who among us has not taken God's name in vain? Who of us shall dare to
          say that we have loved the Lord our God with all our heart, with all
          our soul, and with all our strength? Have we never by any act
          whatsoever showed that we have coveted our neighbour's goods? Verily,
          I know we have; we have broken his commands, and it is well for us to
          join in that general confession -- "We have done those things which we
          ought not to have done; we have left undone those things which we
          ought to have done, and there is no health in us." Now, the sweet
          thought is, that Christ died for us, whilst he knew that we should be
          continual transgressors. Men, brethren, and fathers, he did not die
          for you as those who have committed but one fault, but as those who
          were emphatically "sinners;" sinners of years' standing; some of you
          sinners with grey heads; sinners who have persevered in a constant
          course of iniquity. As sinners we are redeemed, and by it we become
          saints. Does not this commend Christ's love to us, that he should die
          for sinners, who have dyed themselves with sin as with crimson and
          with scarlet; great and continual sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note again, he has died for us, although our sins were aggravated. Oh!
          there are some of us here who are great sinners -- not so much in the
          acts we have performed, as in the aggravation of our guilt. I reckon
          that when I sin, I sin worse than many of you, because I sin against
          better training than many of my hearers received in their youth. Many
          of you, when you sin, sin against faithful ministers, and against the
          most earnest warnings. It has been your wont to sit under truthful
          pastors; you have often been told of your sins. Remember, sirs, when
          you sin you do not sin so cheap as others: when you sin against the
          convictions of your consciences, against the solemn monitions of your
          pastors, you sin more grossly than others do. The Hottentot sinneth
          not as the Briton doth. He who has been brought up in this land may be
          openly more righteous, but he may be inwardly more wicked, for he sins
          against more knowledge. But even for such Christ died -- for men who
          have sinned against the wooings of his love, against the strivings of
          their consciences, against the invitations of his Word, against the
          warnings of his providence -- even for such Christ died, and therein
          he commendeth his love towards us, that he died for sinners. My
          hearer, if thou hast so sinned, do not therefore despair, it may be he
          will yet make thee rejoice in his redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflect again, When we were sinners, we were sinners against the very
          person who died for us. "Tis strange, tis passing strange, tis
          wonderful," that the very Christ against whom we have sinned died for
          us. If a man should be injured in the street, if a punishment should
          be demanded of the person who attacked him, it would be passing
          strange if the injured man should for love's sake bear the penalty,
          that the other might go free; but twas so with Christ. He had been
          injured, yet he suffers for the very injury that others did to him. He
          dies for his enemies -- dies for the men that hate and scorn him.
          There is an old tradition, that the very man who pierced Christ's side
          was converted; and I sometimes think that peradventure in heaven we
          shall meet with those very men who drove the nails into his hands and
          pierced his side. Love is a mighty thing; it can forgive great
          transgressors. I know my Master said, "Begin at Jerusalem," and I
          think he said that because there lived the men who had crucified him,
          and he wanted them to be saved. My hearer, hast thou ever blasphemed
          Christ? Hast thou ever mocked him, and scoffed at his people? Hast
          thou done all thou couldst to emulate the example of those who spat in
          his holy face? Dost thou repent of it? Dost thou feel thou needst a
          Saviour? Then I tell thee, in Christ's name, he is thy Saviour; yes,
          thy Saviour, though thus hast insulted him -- thy Saviour, though thou
          hast trampled on him -- thy Saviour though thou hast spoken evil of
          his people, his day, his Word, and his gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, let us remember, that many of us as sinners have been
          persons who for a long time have heard this good news, and yet have
          despised it. Perhaps there is nothing more wonderful in the depravity
          of man than that it is able to forget the love of Christ. If we were
          not so sinful as we are, there is not one of us here this morning who
          would not weep at the thought of the Saviour's love, and I believe
          there is not a solitary man, woman, or child here, who would not say,
          "I love thee, O my God! because thou hast done so much for me." It is
          the highest proof of our depravity that we do not at once love the
          Christ who died for us. There is a story told of the convenanters --
          of one named Patrick Welwood -- whose house was surrounded at a time
          when a minister had for security been hidden there. Claverhouse's
          dragoons were at the door, and the minister had fled. The master of
          the house was summoned, and it was demanded of him, "Where is the
          minister?" "He is gone; I cannot tell whither, for I know not." But
          they were not satisfied with that; they tortured him, and since he
          could not tell them where he was (for in reality he did not know),
          they left him, after inflicting upon him the torture of the
          thumbscrew; and they took his sister, a young girl who was living in
          the house. I believe she did know where the minister was concealed;
          but on taking her they asked her, and she said, "No, I can die myself,
          but I can never betray God's servant, and never will, as he may help
          me." They dragged her to the water's edge, and making her kneel down,
          they determined to put her to death. But the captain said, "Not yet;
          we will try to frighten her"; and sending a soldier to her, he knelt
          down, and applying a pistol to her ear, she was bidden to betray the
          minister or die. The click of the pistol was heard in her ear, but the
          pistol was not loaded. She slightly shivered, and the question was
          again asked of her. "Tell us now," said they, "where he is, or we will
          have your life." "Never, never," said she. A second time the endeavour
          was made; this time a couple of carabines were discharged, but into
          the air, in order to terrify her. At last they resolved upon really
          putting her to death, when Trail, the minister, who was hidden
          somewhere near, being aroused by the discharge of guns, and seeing the
          poor girl about to die for him, sprang forward, and cried, "Spare that
          maiden's blood, and take mine; this poor innocent girl, what hath she
          done?" The poor girl was dead even there with the fright, but the
          minister had come prepared to die himself, to save her life. Oh, my
          friends, I have sometimes thought that her heroic martyrdom was
          somewhat like the blessed Jesus. He comes to us, and says, "Poor
          sinner, wilt thou be my friend?" We answer, "No," He comes to us, and
          says, "Ah, I will make thee so," saith he, "I will die for thee"; and
          he goes to die on the cross. Oh! methinks I could spring forward and
          say, "Nay, Lord Jesus, nay, thou must not die for such a worm." Surely
          such a sacrifice is a price too large to pay for poor sinful worms!
          And yet, my hearers, to return again to what I have uttered before,
          you will hear all this, and nine out of ten will retire from this
          place, and say, "It was an old, old story"; and while ye can drop a
          tear for aught else, ye will not weep one tear for Jesus, nor sigh one
          sigh for him, nor will ye afford him even a faint emotion of love.
          Would it were different! Would to God he would change your hearts,
          that so ye might be brought to love him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, to illustrate my text, let me remark again, that inasmuch as
          Christ died for sinners, it is a special commendation of his love for
          the following reasons: -- It is quite certain that God did not
          consider man's merit when Christ died; in fact, no merit could have
          deserved the death of Jesus. Though we had been holy as Adam, we could
          never have deserved a sacrifice like that of Jesus for us. But
          inasmuch as it says, "He died for sinners," we are thereby taught that
          God considered our sin, and not our righteousness. When Christ died,
          he died for men as black, as wicked, as abominable, not as good and
          excellent. Christ did not shed his blood for us as saints, but as
          sinners. He considered us in our loathsomeness, in our low estate and
          misery -- not in that high estate to which grace afterwards elevates
          us, but in all the decay into which we had fallen by our sin. There
          could have been no merit in us; and therefore, God commendeth his love
          by our ill desert.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: it is quite certain, because Christ died for us as sinners,
          that God had no interest to serve by sending his Son to die. How could
          sinners serve him? Oh! if God had pleased, he might have crushed this
          nest of rebels, and have made another world all holy. If God had
          chosen, the moment that man sinned he might have said unto the world,
          "Thou shalt be burned"; and like as a few years ago astronomers told
          us that they saw the light of a far-off world burning, myriads of
          miles away, this world might have been consumed with burning heat, and
          sin scorched out of its clay. But no. Whilst God could have made
          another race of beings, and could have either annihilated us, or
          consigned us to eternal torment, he was pleased to veil himself in
          flesh, and die for us. Surely then it could not have been from any
          motive of self-interest. God had nothing to get by man's salvation.
          What are the attractions of human voices in Paradise. What are the
          feeble symphonies which mortal lips can sing on earth, compared with
          the death of our Lord? He had angels enough. Do they not day without
          night circle his throne rejoicing? Are not their golden harps
          sufficient? Is not the orchestra of heaven large enough? Must our
          glorious Lord give up his blood to buy poor worms, that they may join
          their little notes with the great swell of a choral universe? Yes, he
          must; and inasmuch as we are sinners, and could by no possibility
          repay him for his kindness, "God commendeth his love towards us, in
          that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another commendation of love. Christ died for us
          "unasked." Christ did not consider me as an awakened heir of heaven,
          but as a dead, corrupt, lost, and ruined heir of hell. If he had died
          for me as an awakened heir of heaven, then I could have prayed for him
          to die, for then I have power to pray, and will to pray; but Christ
          died for me when I had no power nor will to lift my voice in prayer to
          him. It was entirely unasked. Where did ye ever hear that man was
          first in mercy? Did man ask God to redeem? Nay, rather, it is almost
          the other way; it is as if God did entreat man to be redeemed. Man
          never asked that he might be pardoned, but God pardons him, and then
          turns round and cries, "Return unto me, backsliding children of men,
          and I will have mercy upon you." Sinners! if you should go down on
          your knees, and were for months to cry for mercy, it would be great
          mercy if mercy should look upon you; but without asking, when we are
          hardened and rebellious, when we will not turn to Christ, he still
          comes to die for us. Tell it in heaven; tell it in the lower world!
          God's amazing work surpasses thought; for love itself did die for
          hatred -- holiness did crucify itself to save poor sinful men, and
          unasked for and unsought, like a fountain in the desert sparkling
          spontaneously with its native waters, Jesus Christ came to die for
          man, who would not seek his grace. "God commendeth his love towards
          us."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my dear hearers, I want to close up, if the Spirit of God
          will help me, by endeavouring to commend God's love to you, as much as
          ever I can, and inviting as many of you as feel your need of a
          Saviour, to lay hold of him and embrace him now as your all-sufficient
          sacrifice. Sinner! I can commend Christ to thee for this reason: I
          know that thou needest him. Thou mayest be ignorant of it thyself, but
          thou dost need him. Thou hast a leprosy within thine heart -- thou
          needest a physician; thou sayest, "I am rich;" but sinner, thou art
          not -- thou art naked, and poor, and miserable. Thou sayest, "I shall
          stand before God accepted at last"; but, sinner, without Christ thou
          wilt not; for whosoever believeth not on Christ "hath not life, but
          the wrath of God abideth on him." Hear that, my dear hearers: "The
          wrath of God abideth on him." Oh! that wrath of God! Sinner, thou
          needest Christ, even though thou dost not think so. Oh, that the Lord
          would impress this upon thee! Again, a day is coming when thou wilt
          feel thy need of Christ if thou dost not now. Within a few short
          years, perhaps months or days, thou wilt lie upon the last bed that
          shall ever bear thy weight; soon thou shalt be stayed up by soft
          pillows; thy frame will be weak, and thy soul full of sorrow. Thou
          mayest live without Christ now, but it will be hard work to die
          without him. Thou mayest do without this bridge here; but when thou
          gettest to the river thou wilt think thyself a fool to have laughed at
          the only bridge which can carry thee safely over. Thou mayest despise
          Christ now, but what wilt thou do in the swellings of Jordan. Canst
          thou face death, and not be afraid? Nay, man, thou art affrighted now
          if the cholera is in the city; or if some little sickness is about
          thee thou shakest for fear; what wilt thou do when thou art in the
          jaws of death, when his bony hand is squeezing thee, and when his dart
          is in thy vitals? What wilt thou do then without a Saviour? Ah! thou
          wilt want him then. And what wilt thou do when thou hast passed that
          black stream, when thou findest thyself in the realm of spirits -- in
          that day of judgment, when the thunders shall be loosed, and the wings
          of the lightning shall be unbound -- when tempests shall herald with
          trumpet voice the arrival of the great Assize? What wilt thou do when
          thou shalt stand before his bar before whom, in astonishment, the
          stars shall flee, the mountains quake, and the sea be licked up with
          tongues of forked flame? What wilt thou do, when from his throne he
          shall exclaim, "Come hither, sinner," and thou shalt stand there
          alone, to be judged for every deed done in the body? Thou wilt turn
          thine head, and say, "Oh! for an advocate!" And he shall look on thee,
          and say, "I called, and ye refused; I stretched out my hand and no man
          regarded; I also will now laugh at your calamity, and mock when your
          fear cometh." Ah! what wilt thou do then sinner, when the
          judgment-seat is set? Oh! there will be weeping -- there will be
          weeping at the judgment-seat of Christ. And what wilt thou do in that
          day when he shall say, "Depart, ye cursed;" and when the black angel,
          with a countenance more fierce than lightening, and with a voice
          louder than ten thousand thunders, shall cry, "Depart!" and smite thee
          down where lie for ever those accursed spirits, bound in fetters of
          iron, who, long long ago, were cast into perdition? Say not, I tell
          thee terrible things: if it be terrible to speak of, how terrible it
          must be to bear! If you believe not what I say, I shall not wonder if
          you laugh at me; but as the most of you believe this, I claim your
          most solemn attention to this subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sirs! Do ye believe there is a hell, and that you are going there? And
          yet do you still march heedless on? Do you believe that beyond you,
          when the stream of life is ended, there is a black gulf of misery? and
          do you still sail downwards to it, quaffing still your glass of
          happiness, still merry as the live-long day? O stay, poor sinner,
          stay! Stay! It may be the last moment thou wilt ever have the
          opportunity to stay in. Therefore stay now I beseech thee. And if thou
          knowest thyself to be lost and ruined, if the Holy Spirit has humbled
          thee and made thee feel thy sin, let me tell thee how thou shalt be
          saved. "He that believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ and is baptized,
          shall be saved. "He that believeth not," saith the Scripture "shall be
          damned." Do you not like that message? Ought I to have said another
          word instead of that? If you wish it, I shall not; what God says I
          will say; far be it from me to alter the messages from the Most High;
          I will, if he help me, declare his truth without altering. He saith
          "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth
          not shall be damned." What is it to believe? To tell you as simply as
          possible: to believe is to give up trusting in yourself and to trust
          in Jesus Christ as your Saviour. The negro said, you know, "Massa dis
          here is how I believe -- when I see a promise, I do not stand on de
          promise; but I say, dat promise firm and strong; I fall flat on it; if
          de promise will not bear me, den it is de promise fault; but I fall
          flat on it." Now, that is faith. Christ says, "This is a faithful
          saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the
          world to save sinners." Faith is to say, "Well, then, sink or swim,
          that is my only hope; lost or saved, that is my only refuge. I am
          resolved, for this my last defence,
        </p>
        <p>'If I perish there and die,</p>
        <p>At his cross I still will lie'."</p>
        <p>
          "What!" says one, "no good works?" Good works will come afterwards,
          but they do not go with it. You must come to Christ, not with your
          good works, but with your sins; and coming with your sins, he will
          take them away, and give you good works afterwards. After you believe,
          there will be good works as the effect of your faith; but if you think
          faith will be the effect of good works, you are mistaken. It is
          "believe and live." Cowper calls them the soul-quickening words,
          "believe and live." This is the sum and substance of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, do any of you say this is not the gospel? I shall ask you one day
          what it is. Is not this the doctrine Whitfield preached? Pray what
          else did Luther thunder, when he shook the Vatican? what else was
          proclaimed by Augustine and Chrysostom, but this one doctrine of
          salvation in Christ by faith alone? And what did Paul write? Turn ye
          to his epistles. And what did our Saviour himself say, when he left
          these words on record -- "Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them
          in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?" And
          what did he command his disciples to teach them? To teach them this.
          The very words I have now repeated to you were his last commission.
          "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth
          not shall be damned."
        </p>
        <p>
          But again you say, "How can I believe that Christ died for me?" Why,
          thus, -- He says he died for sinners: canst thou say thou art a
          sinner? I do not mean with that fine complimentary phrase which many
          of you use, when you say, "Yes, I am a sinner;" and if I sit down to
          ask you, "Did you break that commandment?" "Oh, no," you will say:
          "Did you commit that offence?" "Oh, no;" you never did anything wrong.
          And yet you are sinners. Now that is the sort of sinners I do not
          think I shall preach to. The sort of sinners I would call to
          repentance are those whom Christ invited -- those who know that they
          have been guilty, vile, and lost. If thou knowest thy sinnership, so
          truly Christ died for thee. Remember that striking saying of Luther.
          Luther says, Satan once came to him and said, "Martin Luther, thou art
          lost, for thou art a sinner." Said I to him, "Satan, I thank thee for
          saying I am a sinner, for inasmuch as thou sayest I am a sinner, I
          answer thee thus -- Christ died for sinners; and if Martin Luther is a
          sinner, Christ died for him." Now, canst thou lay hold on that, my
          hearer? It is not on my authority, but on God's authority. Go away and
          rejoice; for if thou be the chief of sinners thou shalt be saved, if
          thou believest.
        </p>
