          1. If, however, any one say, "What then? Could not God have exhibited
          man as perfect from beginning?" let him know that, inasmuch as God is
          indeed always the same and unbegotten as respects Himself, all things
          are possible to Him. But created things must be inferior to Him who
          created them, from the very fact of their later origin; for it was not
          possible for things recently created to have been uncreated. But
          inasmuch as they are not uncreated, for this very reason do they come
          short of the perfect. Because, as these things are of later date, so
          are they infantile; so are they unaccustomed to, and unexercised in,
          perfect discipline. For as it certainly is in the power of a mother to
          give strong food to her infant, [but she does not do so], as the child
          is not yet able to receive more substantial nourishment; so also it
          was possible for God Himself to have made man perfect from the first,
          but man could not receive this [perfection], being as yet an infant.
          And for this cause our Lord in these last times, when He had summed up
          all things into Himself, came to us, not as He might have come, but as
          we were capable of beholding Him. He might easily have come to us in
          His immortal glory, but in that case we could never have endured the
          greatness of the glory; and therefore it was that He, who was the
          perfect bread of the Father, offered Himself to us as milk, [because
          we were] as infants. He did this when He appeared as a man, that we,
          being nourished, as it were, from the breast of His flesh, and having,
          by such a course of milk nourishment, become accustomed to eat and
          drink the Word of God, may be able also to contain in ourselves the
          Bread of immortality, which is the Spirit of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And on this account does Paul declare to the Corinthians, "I have
          fed you with milk, not with meat, for hitherto ye were not able to
          bear it." That is, ye have indeed learned the advent of our Lord as a
          man; nevertheless, because of your infirmity, the Spirit of the Father
          has not as yet rested upon you. "For when envying and strife," he
          says, "and dissensions are among you, are ye not carnal, and walk as
          men?" That is, that the Spirit of the Father was not yet with them, on
          account of their imperfection and shortcomings of their walk in life.
          As, therefore, the apostle had the power to give them strong meat --
          for those upon whom the apostles laid hands received the Holy Spirit,
          who is the food of life [eternal] -- but they were not capable of
          receiving it, because they had the sentient faculties of the soul
          still feeble and undisciplined in the practice of things pertaining to
          God; so, in like manner, God had power at the beginning to grant
          perfection to man; but as the latter was only recently created, he
          could not possibly have received it, or even if he had received it,
          could he have contained it, or containing it, could he have retained
          it. It was for this reason that the Son of God, although He was
          perfect, passed through the state of infancy in common with the rest
          of mankind, partaking of it thus not for His own benefit, but for that
          of the infantile stage of man's existence, in order that man might be
          able to receive Him. There was nothing, therefore, impossible to and
          deficient in God, [implied in the fact] that man was not an uncreated
          being; but this merely applied to him who was lately created, [namely]
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. With God there are simultaneously exhibited power, wisdom, and
          goodness. His power and goodness [appear] in this, that of His own
          will He called into being and fashioned things having no previous
          existence; His wisdom [is shown] in His having made created things
          parts of one harmonious and consistent whole; and those things which,
          through His super-eminent kindness, receive growth and a long period
          of existence, do reflect the glory of the uncreated One, of that God
          who bestows what is good ungrudgingly. For from the very fact of these
          things having been created, [it follows] that they are not uncreated;
          but by their continuing in being throughout a long course of ages,
          they shall receive a faculty of the Uncreated, through the gratuitous
          bestowal of eternal existence upon them by God. And thus in all things
          God has the pre-eminence, who alone is uncreated, the first of all
          things, and the primary cause of the existence of all, while all other
          things remain under God's subjection. But being in subjection to God
          is continuance in immortality, and immortality is the glory of the
          uncreated One. By this arrangement, therefore, and these harmonies,
          and a sequence of this nature, man, a created and organized being, is
          rendered after the image and likeness of the uncreated God, -- the
          Father planning everything well and giving His commands, the Son
          carrying these into execution and performing the work of creating, and
          the Spirit nourishing and increasing [what is made], but man making
          progress day by day, and ascending towards the perfect, that is,
          approximating to the uncreated One. For the Uncreated is perfect, that
          is, God. Now it was necessary that man should in the first instance be
          created; and having been created, should receive growth; and having
          received growth, should be strengthened; and having been strengthened,
          should abound; and having abounded, should recover [from the disease
          of sin]; and having recovered, should be glorified; and being
          glorified, should see his Lord. For God is He who is yet to be seen,
          and the beholding of God is productive of immortality, but immortality
          renders one nigh unto God.

          4. Irrational, therefore, in every respect, are they who await not the
          time of increase, but ascribe to God the infirmity of their nature.
          Such persons know neither God nor themselves, being insatiable and
          ungrateful, unwilling to be at the outset what they have also been
          created -- men subject to passions; but go beyond the law of the human
          race, and before that they become men, they wish to be even now like
          God their Creator, and they who are more destitute of reason than dumb
          animals [insist] that there is no distinction between the uncreated
          God and man, a creature of to-day. For these, [the dumb animals],
          bring no charge against God for not having made them men; but each
          one, just as he has been created, gives thanks that he has been
          created. For we cast blame upon Him, because we have not been made
          gods from the beginning, but at first merely men, then at length gods;
          although God has adopted this course out of His pure benevolence, that
          no one may impute to Him invidiousness or grudgingness. He declares,
          "I have said, Ye are gods; and ye are all sons of the Highest." But
          since we could not sustain the power of divinity, He adds, "But ye
          shall die like men," setting forth both truths -- the kindness of His
          free gift, and our weakness, and also that we were possessed of power
          over ourselves. For after His great kindness He graciously conferred
          good [upon us], and made men like to Himself, [that is] in their own
          power; while at the same time by His prescience He knew the infirmity
          of human beings, and the consequences which would flow from it; but
          through [His] love and [His] power, He shall overcome the substance of
          created nature. For it was necessary, at first, that nature should be
          exhibited; then, after that, that what was mortal should be conquered
          and swallowed up by immortality, and the corruptible by
          incorruptibility, and that man should be made after the image and
          likeness of God, having received the knowledge of good and evil.<br />
