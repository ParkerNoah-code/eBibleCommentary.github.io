        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1007)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, keep not back."
          -- Isaiah 43:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN THE FULLNESS of the promised days when the Jews shall be restored
          from their wanderings, and all the seed of Jacob shall again meet in
          their own land, God in his mighty providence will speak to all the
          nations, saying: "To the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
          back;" and at the divine bidding free passage shall be given, all lets
          and hindrances shall be removed, and his own people shall come to
          their own land. Entailed on Abraham's seed by a covenant of salt, the
          Holy Land shall receive again its rightful heritors, the banished
          shall come to their own again, and no nation or people shall keep them
          back. So much for the literal meaning. I am unable to indulge you with
          fuller details, for I have no skill in guessing at the meaning of dark
          passages, but leave such things to those to whom it is given, or who
          think it is given to them. We shall now pursue the spiritual teaching
          of the passage.

          At this moment, my brethren and sisters, we who follow the footsteps
          of King Jesus are soldiers of an army which has invaded this world.
          This land belongs to our great Leader, for he made it. It was right
          that everywhere, all round the globe, his name should he honored, for
          he is the King among the nations, and the governor thereof: But our
          race has revolted, set up another monarch, and bowed its strength to
          support another dynasty -- the dynasty of darkness and death. Our race
          has broken the good and wholesome laws of the great Lord, the rightful
          King, and set up new laws and new customs altogether opposed to right
          and truth. This is the Great Rebellion the Revolt of Manhood, the
          Sedition of Sinners. Now, no king will willingly lose his dominions,
          and therefore the Great King of kings has sent his son to conquer this
          world by force of arms, though not by arms of steel, or weapons that
          cut and kill, and wound, yet by arms more mighty far; and this earth
          is to be yet subdued to the kingdom of the Crown Prince, the Prince
          Imperial of heaven, Jesus Christ, the Lord. We, his regenerated
          people, form part of the army of occupation. We have invaded the land.
          Hard and stern hath been the battle up to this point. We have had to
          win every inch of ground by sheer push of pike. Effort after effort
          has been put forth by the church of God under the guidance of her
          heavenly leader, and none has been in vain. Hitherto the Lord hath
          helped us, but there is much yet to be done. Canaanites and Hivites,
          and Jebusites have to be driven out; yea, in fact, the whole world
          seems still to lie in darkness, and under the dominion of the wicked
          one. We do but hold here and there a sacred fortress for truth and
          holiness in the land; but these we must retain till the Lord Jesus
          shall send us more prosperous times, and the battle shall be tamed
          against the foe, and the kingdom shall come unto our prince. Nor is
          there any fear but that such a time will come, therefore let us have
          courage. Soldiers of the cross, have faith; have faith in your great
          leader, for behold he is still at the head of you, and is still
          omnipotent. The hour of his weakness is past. His sun set once in
          blood, but it has risen to go down no more. Once was it eclipsed at
          noon day; but now the Sun of Righteousness ariseth with healing
          beneath his wings. He who died once for all, is now life's source,
          center, and Lord. The living Christ is present among us as the
          commander-in-chief of the church militant. Let us refresh our souls by
          drawing, near to him by the power of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text has two grand matters in it: -- First, here is the royalty of
          the word -- where the word of this king is there is power. Secondly,
          here is the word of royalty, and that word we may well consider, for
          where the word of this king is there is wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, here is THE ROYALTY OF THE WORD. It is more than an imperial
          edict; it is the fiat of onmipotence. Jesus Christ saith to the north,
          "Give up," and it does give up; and to the south, "Keep not back," and
          it cannot keep back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand from reading this declaration, that there is a general
          opposition in the world to the cause and kingdom of God; for until he
          saith, "Give up,"' and "Keep not back," men do not crowd to Immanuel's
          feet, and even the chosen of God do not come forth from their hiding
          places. All the world over there is a general opposition to the cause
          of Christ, to the doctrine of truth, to the throne of God. Go where
          you may, in the highest places of the earth, you shall find true
          religion despised; among the lowest of the land you shall find that
          same religion blasphemed; and in the middle classes, where some seem
          to fancy that all virtue resides, you shall find carelessness about
          the things of the world to come, and carking carefulness about the
          selfishness of this present life. Jesus Christ is everywhere despised
          in comparison with the things that perish. They will not have this man
          to reign over them. The trees of the wood reject heaven's cedar, and
          choose hell's bramble. Even the eleven sell the true Joseph into
          Egypt, nor is there one found who will defend the chosen of God. Go
          amongst savage nations, and there the idol is worshipped, but Jesus is
          not known. Go among civilised nations, and, lo, they have only changed
          their idols; they have rebaptised their imates, given new names to the
          objects of their superstitious reverence, but the true Christ is
          misunderstood and rejected. Go you to the swarthy Hindoo, the man of
          deep philosophy and sophistry, and you shall find his heart set
          against the gospel of Jesus of Nazareth; and then sail over the blue
          sea to the islands of the deep, and man in his simplicity worships he
          knows not what, but not the incarnate God. Traverse the central parts
          of continents where as yet civilization has scarcely reached, and you
          shall find that man is still opposed to his Maker, and hates the name
          of the only begotten Son of God. Nor need we travel or even look
          abroad; the opposition is universal among ourselves, among the old,
          among the young. Striking is that text, "They go astray from the womb,
          speaking lies." An old Puritan puts it; "They go astray before they
          go: they speak lies before they speak;" and so it is. Before it comes
          to acts, the evil propensity is in the heart; and before the lips can
          frame the falsehood, there is the lie within the soul. From the
          earliest infancy to palsied age, nothing seems to cure manhood of its
          rebellious disposition; the carnal mind is enmity against God, and is
          not reconciled to God, neither indeed while it remains what it is can
          it be. There is a general opposition to the cause and kingdom of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text seems to hint that there is a particular form of that
          opposition in each case. There is a word to the north, a different
          word from that which is given to the south. The north holds fast, and
          therefore the word is, "Give up:" the south retires, is despairing,
          therefore it is said, "Keep not back." The opposition takes different
          shapes, and there is a different word to meet its ever varying forms.
          How true is Dr. Watts's verse --
        </p>
        <p>"We wander each a different way,</p>
        <p>But all the downward road."</p>
        <p>
          As each land has its own tribes of wild animals, so has each heart its
          indigenous sins. All land will grow weeds, but you will not find the
          same sort of weed equally abundant in every soil: so in one heart the
          deadly nightshade of ignorance chokes the seed, and in another the
          prickly thistle of malice crowds out the wheat. There are difficulties
          in reaching the heart of any man, but not the same difficulties in all
          men. Some, for instance, cannot be influenced because of their want of
          intelligence; others because of their supposed learning. Some cannot
          be come at because of their presumption; others because of their
          despondency. Some spend their all upon the pleasures of this world,
          others spend nothing, but find their pleasure simply in hoarding, yet
          are they equally averse to heavenly things. Whatever form sin takes,
          it is the same opposition, but yet it may need a different mode of
          treatment, and by a different weapon will it have to be overcome. My
          dear brother in Christ, you perhaps have a different personal,
          spiritual difficulty from mine. I have no wish to change with you, and
          I should not advise you to change with me. The same is true with our
          trials in winning souls. We have each our difficulties, but they are
          not precisely alike in detail. You have to fight the north perhaps,
          and I the south; but the same Lord and Master can make us victorious,
          and without him we shall be equally defeated. The opposition which we
          encounter in serving our Lord is the same, depend upon it. You need
          not say, "Mine is a peculiarly hard task," or if you do, I may say the
          same of mine. After all, both tasks are impossibilities without God,
          and both labors shall be readily performed if Jesus speaks the divine
          fiat, and saith "to the north, Give up; arid to the south, Keep not
          back."
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, as there is in all an opposition, and as there is in each a
          distinct opposition, so no power can in any case subdue any part of
          the world to Christ apart from him. It is possible that you may fall
          in with a family which seems to be naturally religious: you may even
          meet with tribes of people who appear to he spontaneously inclined to
          godliness; but if you bring the religion of Christ to them, you will
          find that their very religiousness is the greatest difficulty you have
          to deal with. Some, on the other hand, never could be superstitious:
          the conformation of their mind is that of practical, sound, common
          sense; but do not deceive yourself with the idea that their conversion
          is any the easier. You may preach the gospel in the most forcible way
          to them, and you will find that this very common sense of theirs will
          be the main difficulty to be overcome. Believe me, however intent you
          may be in winning souls to Christ, you shall never meet with one who
          can be subdued to him by any persuasions of yours apart from the
          working of his own power. I know the preacher has thought within
          himself, "I have only to put the truth in a reasonable way, and the
          man will see it." Ah! sir, but sinners are not reasonable: they are
          the most unreasonable of all creatures: none are so senseless, none
          act so madly us they do. "But," saith one, "if I were to tell them of
          the love of Christ in an affectionate loving way, that would reach
          them." Yes; but you will find that all your affection and your tears,
          and earnest delineation of the love of Jesus, will be powerless
          against human hearts, unless the Eternal Spirit shall drive home your
          appeals. We know some who have been reasoned with, and if logic could
          win them, they ought to have been won long ago: they have also been
          persuaded, and if rhetoric could reach them, they ought to have turned
          away from their evil ways years ago; but all human art has been tried
          and tried, and tried in vain; yet there is no room for despair, for
          Jesus can conquer the unconquerables, and heal the incurables. Do not
          be disappointed, dear brother, if you have hitherto failed in your
          efforts; you have but proved that "vain is the help of man." You see
          now by experience that "it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
          runneth, but of God that showeth mercy." It is yours to try and bring
          that soul to Jesus; but it lies with him to perform the work. Duty is
          ours, the result is God's. If the soil of the field committed to me
          will never yield a harvest, I am yet bound to plough it, if my Lord
          commands. If I could foresee that my child would never turn to the
          Lord, yet I ought not to slacken my efforts for its conversion. I have
          to do with my Master's command, and what he bids me do I am bound to
          do. Never let us be surprised when we are defeated, for we ought to
          know that old Adam is far too strong for us, if we assail him
          single-handed. We cannot expect to cast out the devil: he laughs us to
          scorn if we attempt to exorcise him in our own name. We may speak as
          we will, but if it is only we that speak, the devil will say, "Jesus I
          know, and the Holy Ghost I know -- but who are ye? I do not yield to
          you. I will not go out of this sinner, through all your persuasions
          and all your talkings." Do not forget then that there is a general
          opposition to the kingdom of Christ -- such opposition as no human
          power can by any possibility overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my brethren, here is the point of the text. That opposition,
          whatever form it assumes, though not to be subdued by our agency
          alone, shall assuredly yield before the fiat of our great King, when
          he saith "to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back." His
          word is a word of power wherever it comes. Let us rejoice then,
          whatever place we dwell in, that we have only to ask the King himself
          to come there, and to speak with power, and we shall see conversions,
          conversions most numerous, that shall glorify his name. I fully
          believe that the darkest time of any true Christian church is just the
          period when it ought to have most hope, for when the Lord has allowed
          us to spin ourselves out till there is no more strength in us, then it
          is that he will come to our rescue. What could have been lower than
          the condition into which we, as a church, had sunk some seventeen
          years ago? But a little faithful band used to meet in that dreary
          chapel in Park Street, and cry unto the Lord, never ceasing their
          prayers. And, oh! how soon the house began to fill, and how speedily
          our tent was too strait for us, and we broke forth on the right hand
          and on the left, and God made the desolate places to be inhabited.
          Members of other churches, you have the same God to go to. Go to him,
          for he can work the same wonders for you. Look to the Most High, and
          not to man, or ministers, or modes, or methods, but only to him, and
          the guidance of his Spirit. "Well, but ours is a village," saith one.
          And is not he the Lord of the villages? Is he the Lord of the cities,
          and not the Lord of the hamlets? "But our chapel is ugly, and built in
          a back street," saith one. "Nobody knows of its existence. We shall
          never get the people within its obscure and dreary walls." Is God the
          God of the wide thoroughfares and not of the lanes? Does not the Lord
          know the back streets as well as the broad ones? Was not that the
          question in dispute of old? Is he the God of the hills, and not the
          God of the valleys? I have already put it in another shape to you. In
          his name I ask you, can anything be too hard for the Lord? Perhaps in
          your sphere of service you have grown so dispirited that you are
          inclined to say, "I may as well give up all further effort; no good
          will result from my endeavors." But what have you told the Master, and
          what have you sought at his hand? Have you told him all your
          discouragements? Have you asked him to speak with power, and has he
          refused you? If so, then give it up, but not till then, for he can
          even now "say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back;"
          and as when he said to the thick primaeval darkness, "Let there be
          light," and the light leaped into being, and the darkness fled, so can
          he, amid the gross darkness of our huge city, or the not less dense
          darkness of our villages, create light to our astonishment and to his
          glory. It is the king's word we want -- nothing short of it, and
          nothing more. We must get that by prayer: we must wait upon him with
          importunity. If there be only two or three whose hearts break over the
          desolations of the church, if we have only half a dozen that resolve
          to give the Lord no rest till he establish and make Jerusalem a praise
          in the earth, we shall see great things yet. A handful of people who
          resolve if a blessing is to be had they will have it, and that if
          souls are not saved it shall be the sovereignty of God that prevents
          it and nothing else: such a mere handful shall win the day. If they
          will have souls saved; if so they plead and agonize, oh! then the Lord
          will turn his gracious hand, and send a plenteous stream of blessing
          upon their district; for where he wills it the blessing must come, and
          he always wills to display his grace where and when he leads his
          people to pray for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I leave this point, let me say the power of the King's word is
          always exercised in full consistence with the free agency of man. You
          must not think when we say that Christ has his will, and works
          omnipotently in men's hearts, that we imagine that he violates the
          free agency which he has created. He says to the north, "Give up," and
          that word does it; for a word is a suitable instrument by which to
          rule a free agent. The way to make blocks of timber move would be to
          drag them, and if we wish to shape them we must hew them with the axe,
          or cut them with a saw; but the way to deal with men is to speak with
          them. That is how Jesus operates. His power is exerted in conformity
          with the laws of human mind. He does not violate the free agency of
          man, though he does as he wills with man: His word is an instrument
          consistent with our mental nature, and he uses that word wisely. He
          says to the north, "Give up:" he says to the south, "Keep not back."
          His word touches the secret spring, and sets all in motion. No man is
          ever taken to heaven against his will, though I do not believe any man
          ever went there of his own free will till God's sovereign grace
          enlightened him and made him willing. You must not suppose that Christ
          conquers human hearts by physical compulsion, such as the King of
          Prussia used, for instance, in subduing France, or such as a man uses
          in driving a horse. The Lord knows how to leave us free, and yet to
          make us do his bidding, and therein lies the beauty of gospel
          influences. Suppose man's will to be a room; if you and I want to open
          it, we break in the lock; we do not understand the true method; but
          the Lord has the key, and knows how to open the door without a wrench.
          Without violating even the most delicate spring in the watch, the
          maker knows how to regulate it. Grace draws, but it is with hands of a
          man; it rules, but it is with a scepter of love. The fact is, the
          great dispute between Calvinists and Arminians has arisen very much
          through not understanding one another, and from one brother saying,
          "What I hold is the truth" -- and the other saying, "What I hold is
          truth, and nothing else." The men need somebody to knock both their
          heads together, and fuse their beliefs into one. They need one
          capacious brain to hold both the truths which their two little heads
          contain; for God's word is neither all on one side nor altogether on
          the other: it overlaps all systems, and defies all formularies. It
          lays the full responsibility of his ruin on man, but all the power and
          glory of grace it ascribes to God; and it is wise of us to do the
          same. The great King doeth as he wills among men as well as among the
          armies of heaven. Who shall stay his hand or say unto him, "What doest
          thou?" He rules men as men, and not as inanimate stones. He has a
          scepter which is adapted to mind and spirit. The weapons of his
          warfare are not carnal: his forces rule the heart, the mind, the whole
          manhood as he has made it; and so he conquers, and becomes the happy
          king of willing subjects, who, though subdued by power, are happy to
          own his sway. Thus much on the first point -- the royalty of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. How we will consider THE WORD OF ROYALTY. The King saith "to the
          north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back."
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not spend many minutes over these words, but just briefly hint
          at what meaning may be drawn from them. There are some persons to
          whom, when the powerful word of grace comes, it speaks in this way --
          "Give up; give up." There are other persons in another state of mind
          to whom, whenever the word of salvation comes, it says, "Keep not
          back; keep not back." Now, to some we find that it comes in this way:
          "Give up; give up." You say, "I am righteous; I am no worse than
          others. I have broken the law, but not much; my sins are trivial. I
          cannot deserve to be cast into hell for my small offenses. I have been
          -- not perfect, but as righteous as most. I have done this, I have
          done that, I have done the other." Ah, dear friend, the sword of
          divine grace will kill all this; and the message that God's mercy
          sends to you to-day is, "Give up." Renounce your fancied goodness and
          deceitful self-esteem. Oh, give up that spinning; it is a poor trade
          to spin cobwebs. Give it up. Your father, Adam, taught you to make
          aprons of fig-leaves; but it was after he had fallen. It is a bad
          business: give it up. Your own works will never cover you as you
          should be covered; there is a better righteousness than yours to be
          had; there is a better footing to stand before God upon than anything
          you have done. Your refuges are all refuges of lies; give them up.
          That pretty righteousness of yours, which fools so white, is only
          white because your eyes are blind; if you could see it, it is all as
          black as filth can make it. You conceive your robe to be new and fair,
          but it is all riddled through and through with holes. The worms have
          devoured it; it is all moth-eaten and decayed. Give it up. Oh, give up
          that Pharisaic mouthful, "God, I thank thee," and betake thyself to
          the publican's prayer, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." Give up thy
          selftrust; it is a painted lie, a rotten plank, a foul deception, a
          false traitor; it promises salvation, but it brings sure damnation.
          Jesus is the sinner's only hope. Give up every other reliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, too, you have an opposition in your hearts to the gospel.
          Concerning that also the word saith to you, "Give up." Perhaps you
          were prejudiced against it foolishly and ignorantly; before you ever
          heard it you felt persuaded you should not like it. Possibly you have
          been brought up to a religion of forms; you hardly think that
          salvation can be by simple faith in Jesus Christ; you feel a great
          deal of attachment to that regeneration of yours which was wrought in
          your baptism, and to that confirmation of yours bestowed by the
          bishop's fingers. Besides, you have been so regular in your religion
          up till now, that you can hardly brook to be told that the whole
          bundle of it is mere rubbish, not worth the time you have spent on it.
          You cannot endure to be told that --
        </p>
        <p>"None but Jesus can do helpless sinners good."</p>
        <p>
          But rest assured, the sooner you give up all those flattering
          reliances of yours, the better for you, for there is nothing in them.
          Even ceremonies that God has commanded are only of spiritual use to
          spiritual men, and since you are not a spiritual man they cannot
          profit you. Have you in your heart an opposition to Christ? Can you
          not yield to him as God? Can you not stoop to be saved entirely by his
          merits, and acknowledge him for your Lawgiver, and Teacher, and Guide?
          Then as, the text saith so would I say, and may the Lord apply the
          word: "Give up; give up." There is no salvation for thee till thou
          "give up" all ceremonial hopes and formal confidences. Strike the
          colors, man, before a broadside goes through thee; for depend upon it,
          if thou yield not in one way thou wilt in another. Thou shalt either
          break or bow; thou shalt either turn or burn; that is the alternative
          to every man of woman born: he must turn away from his enmity to
          Christ, and yield himself up to his love, or else he shall find the
          power of God in Christ to be his destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible, dear friends, that your opposition to Jesus Christ has
          taken the form of the love of a favourite sin. Now, there is nothing
          more certain than this, that you cannot be saved and keep your sins:
          they must be parted with. No man can carry fire in his bosom and yet
          be safe from burning. While you drink the poison, it must and will
          work death in you. The thief cannot expect mercy while he keeps the
          goods he has stolen. John Bunyan says that one day, when he was
          playing "cat" on a Sunday, on the village green, he thought he heard a
          voice saying to him: "Wilt thou have thy sins and go to hell, or leave
          thy sins and go to heaven?" That question is put to every man who
          hears the gospel faithfully preached. Most men in their heart of
          hearts would like to have their sins and go to heaven too. But that
          cannot be; while God is just, and heaven is holy, and truth is
          precious, it cannot be. What then? "Let the wicked forsake his way,
          and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the
          Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
          abundantly pardon." Give up, give up; give up your sin. What is the
          sin? The drunkards cup? Away with the bewitching draught. Is it the
          drunkard's company? That is as damnable as his cup; renounce such
          society at once. Is it blaspheming? O man, God rinse thy mouth our of
          such black stuff as that! Have done with a sin for which there cannot
          be any excuse, for it cannot bring thee any pleasure or profit, nor
          can there be any necesssity for it: it is a degrading, useless,
          senseless. God-provoking crime. Is it some secret sin that must not be
          named lest the cheek of modesty be reddened? Give it up, friend; it
          will be much better for thee to lose it though it were as precious as
          thy right arm or thy right eye, than to keep it and be cast into hell
          fire. The chamber of wantonness is the gate of death, flee from it
          without delay. The sins of the flesh are a deep ditch, and the
          abhorred of the Lord fall therein; but as thou lovest thy soul, O
          young man, escape like a bird from the fowler's snare. Here is the
          message of God to thee: "Give up, give up thy sin." Perhaps though you
          hear the summons, you trifle with it, and reply, "Yes; I mean to give
          them all up, and I hope by so doing I shall find my way to heaven. I
          shall deserve well of my Maker when I have denied myself all sinful
          pleasures." But stop; let me not deceive you: this is not all. I fear
          that some men are not improved in their hearts when they are altered
          in their outward behavior. I am glad of the outward improvement, but I
          have sometimes fancied that they have only changed their sins, but not
          given them up. They show no leprosy in their skin, but it dies in
          their bone and their flesh. It is little use merely to shift the
          region in which sin sets up its throne if its dominion is still
          undestroyed. It reminds one of the verse --
        </p>
        <p>"So when a raging fever burns,</p>
        <p>We shift from side to side by turns;</p>
        <p>And tis a poor relief we gain</p>
        <p>To shift the place but keep the pain."</p>
        <p>
          What if the man does not go to hell as a drunkard, it will not mend it
          if he is ruined by being self-righteous: so long as he is lost I do
          not see that it materially matters how. Many and many a man has given
          up outward sins and set up a self-righteousness of his own, and said,
          "These be thy gods, O Israel;" and so he fled from a bear, and a lion
          slew him; he leaned on a wall, and a serpent bit him. All sin must be
          cast out of the throne of the heart, and whatever righteousness that
          is not Christ's righteousness must go with it. I would fain put the
          sword-point to thy heart, O sinner, and say, "Give up all that opposes
          Christ;" for if thou do not give it up, thy soul will be lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fine, dear friends, speaking to the children of God as well as to
          such as are not converted, I say, give up all and have Christ; give up
          all attempts to save yourself, and let Christ save you. Work
          afterwards, because he worketh in you to will and to do, but now do
          nothing either great or small, to make yourself righteous, for Jesus
          did it, did it all, long, long ago. Do nothing by way of straining for
          merit, but begin to do everything by way of gratitude. "Give up;" that
          is, give up yourself to Christ, whatever his will may be. If it be his
          will that you be sick, that you be poor, that you die, give all up,
          and say, "Thy will be done. I resign all to thee, my God." Doth Jesus
          command you to do anything? Let it not be irksome to you. Whatsoever
          he saith unto you, do it. Let there be no back-stair by which to play
          the truant; no keeping back of part of the price as though you would
          not do Christ's will, except in some points. Give up unreservedly, and
          make no provision for the flesh. Let his will be your will. Yield
          entirely; and if you have anything in this world of substance, of
          talent, of opportunity, "Give up." Begin with resignation, go on to
          obedience, and finish with consecration. "Give up, give up" till all
          is given up, body, soul, and spirit, a reasonable sacrifice to him,
          till you can say:
        </p>
        <p>"Now Lord I would be thine alone,</p>
        <p>And wholly live to thee."</p>
        <p>
          I perceive that my text has grown from a word to the sinner who has to
          be conquered into a word directed to Christ's nearest and dearest
          friends, even to those who are the soldiers of his army. It is in
          effect a lofty, far-reaching precept, and would to God we could live
          up to it, by presenting our all to Jesus our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now spend a minute or two on the second word of the King: "Keep
          not back." Is there some person within this assembly who feels within
          his heart, the desire to come and confess his sins to his God?
          Standing at the filthy swine-trough, does the prodigal say within
          himself: "I will arise and go unto my Father, and say unto him,
          Father, I have sinned"? "Keep not back:" quench not that holy flame.
          If thou hast a desire to come and acknowledge thy transgressions unto
          the pardoning Savior, let nothing keep thee back -- neither fear, nor
          shame, nor procrastination, but rest not till thou hast reached the
          bosom of thy God and acknowledged all thy guilt before him. A repulse
          need not be feared, nor even an upbraiding -- a rich, free, loving
          welcome is sure. "Keep not back."
        </p>
        <p>
          But is there another who has confessed his sin, but yet has found no
          peace? Dost thou see yonder Christ on the cross? "Yes," sayest thou;
          "I know there is life in a look at him, but may I look?" My Master's
          message to thee is, "Keep not back; keep not back," for whosoever
          looketh shall be made whole, and none are forbidden to look. Does the
          crowd around the Savior hinder thee, thou sick and dying soul? Be not
          baffled by difficulty, but persevere. Press into the thickest of the
          throng for if thou do but touch the hem of his garment thou shalt be
          made whole. "Keep not back; keep not back." Thou mayst believe in
          Jesus now! Mayst! Nay, thou art commanded to do it; and thou art
          threatened if thou do not, which proves that thou hast permission and
          something more. It is written: "He that believeth not shall be
          damned." O man, it is but another way of saying thou hast a full
          permission to do it, for thou art threatened if thou do it not. Come
          thou, then, come thou, now, right joyfully. "Keep not back." Confess
          thy sin with repentance, and lay it on Christ by faith, and thou shalt
          be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren and sisters, many of you have come to Christ and have
          been saved, and to you the text says, "Keep not back," in another
          sense. Do not keep back from confessing Christ. If you have the love
          of Jesus Christ in your soul, confess it, tell it to others. Never be
          ashamed of your Lord and Master. Come and unite with his church and
          people. It is due to the church; it is due to the preacher who was the
          means of your conversion, it is due especially to your Lord and Master
          that you "keep not back." I have heard of some who keep back because
          the church is not perfect. And you are very perfect I dare say! Why,
          if the church were perfect we should not endure you in it, my captious
          friend. I have no doubt whatever that you will find the church quite
          as perfect as you are. There are others who keep aloof from the people
          of God because they feel they are not perfect themselves. My dear
          friend, if you were perfect we should not want you, because you would
          be the only perfect member among us, and having a very imperfect
          pastor, I do not know what we should do with you; we should find you
          such a speckled bird among us, that we should probably pray the Lord
          to take you home to heaven at once. I should like to have you become
          perfect, and the nearer perfection the better -- but still if you make
          no profession of faith till you are sinless, it will not be this side
          the grave. Nay, confess Christ, for is it not written: "He that with
          his heart believeth, and with his mouth maketh confession of him,
          shall he be saved"? Do not forget the confession of the mouth. "Keep
          not back." And when you have done that, if there be any Christian
          excellency that can be reached, do not despair of reaching it. "Keep
          not back." And if perfection itself be attainable, never be content
          till you get it. If you are a child of God you never will be
          self-satisfied, you will be always crying: Not as though I had already
          attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I
          may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus." O
          that you may never be content with yourself! Self-satisfaction is the
          death of progress. You have come into the lowest seat at the feast,
          but Jesus saith: "Friend, come up higher;" and when you get into a
          higher room, and enter into closer communion with him, he will say to
          you, "Friend, come up higher." Do not hesitate to climb higher in
          grace and fellowship. Let your prayer be, "Nearer to thee, my God,
          nearer to thee." Be insatiable in the longings of your soul; hunger
          and thirst after righteousness; covet earnestly the best gifts. Grow
          in grace, and in the knowledge of your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
          "Keep not back." There is no point in grace which we are prohibited
          from aiming at. We ought none of us to say, "I am all I can ever be."
          Oh, no, let us reach to the front ranks by God's grace; for he says,
          "Keep not back."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me add if there be a brother who could do more for Christ than he
          is doing, let him "keep not back." Could you preach? Well, there are
          plenty of places needing occasional minister, and others that are
          quite destitute. I do not know a nobler occupation for a man who is in
          business in London than for him to be maintaining himself by his shop,
          or whatever else his calling may be, and going out to suburban
          villages on the Sabbath to preach. I often wonder more persons do not
          imitate the example of some good brethren, whom I could name, who are
          in their business diligent, and who are also fervent in spirit in
          their Master's work. What reason can there be that for every little
          church there should be a pastor specially set apart for the work? It
          is a very desirable thing wherever there are enough Christian people
          to be able to support the minister that there should be such; but I
          believe we very much hamper ourselves in our Christian work through
          always imagining that a paid person set apart to preach is necessary
          for every Christian church. There ought to be more farmers who educate
          themselves, and preach in their own barns or on the village greens.
          There ought to be more men of business in London who seek to improve
          their minds, that they may preach acceptably anywhere the gospel of
          Jesus Christ; and I hope the time will come when our dear friends, the
          members of churches in London, will not be so backward as they are,
          but will come forward and speak to the honor of the Lord Jesus. If you
          cannot edify a thousand, perhaps you can influence ten; if you cannot
          with a regular congregation continue to find fresh matter year after
          year (and believe me that is a very difficult thing), yet you can
          preach a sermon here and a sermon there, and tell to different
          companies the same story of the Savior's love. I do not know what
          special work you can do, but something is within your power, and from
          that "Keep not back." Besides, there are all our street corners. In
          spring and summer, how delightful to stand in the thick of the throng
          and uplift the Crucified One! Of course, you are sure to have a
          congregation out of doors, and a congregation that is rather
          attentive, and sometimes rather inquisitive, and do not need to be so
          inconveniently crowded as we are in this Tabernacle. Take the wide
          sweep, cast the big net, and hope for fish. If you have any grace or
          gift, "Keep not back." "Alas!" murmurs the glowworm, "I mean to shut
          up my lamp, and hide under those damp weeds, and never shine again."
          What is the matter with you? "Why," says he, "I have seen the sun; I
          shall never shine again after seeing the sun." That glowworm is
          stupid. If it were wise, it would say, "I have looked upon the sun;
          and I perceive with shame that my lamp is but a poor light, but for
          that reason I must use it the more diligently. The sun may well hide
          its light after twelve hours are over; but I must try to glimmer
          during the whole twenty-four hours, and so give as much light as I
          can, little though it be." You complain that you have but one talent;
          that is the reason for being doubly diligent with it. If you had five,
          they ought to be fully used; but if you have only one, you must put
          all your wits to work to make something more of it. At any rate, "Keep
          not back."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," says one, "I think I could do something, but I am of a
          retiring disposition." I am afraid if I had been in the French army in
          the late war, I should be very much of the same disposition; but in a
          soldier, as a rule, a retiring disposition in the hour of battle is
          not much commended by his captain. You who are so modest (shall I say
          so cowardly?) that you cannot do for Christ what you ought to do, will
          have an account to settle with your consciences one of these days,
          which will cost you a world of sorrow. Break through this bashfulness,
          this laziness (for it comes to that in the long run), this silly,
          wicked, shame. Pride must also be slain, for this hinders many. They
          cannot be so prominent as others, and therefore shun the work
          altogether. Get rid of all that cripples you, shake all off by the
          power of the Holy Spirit, my dear brethren, and "Keep not back," for
          who knows but that you may yet bring sinners to Jesus, may save a soul
          from death, and hide a multitude of sins, through God's eternal
          Spirit. May it be so, for Christ's sake. Amen.
