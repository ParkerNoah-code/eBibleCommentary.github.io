          28. They shall curse, but thou shalt bless: when they arise, they
          shall be put to shame; but thy servant shall rejoice.29. My
          adversaries shall be clothed with shame, and covered with their own
          confusion, as with a garment.30. I will praise Jehovah greatly with my
          mouth; and I will extol him in the midst of the great, 31. Because he
          standeth at the right hand of the poor, to deliver his soul from
          condemnations.

          28. They shall curse. Interpreters are divided in their opinions about
          the meaning of these words. One class would render them as expressive
          of a desire or wish: Let them curse, provided that thou bless: let
          them arise, and be clothed with confusion Another class, and with them
          I readily agree, adopt the future tense of the indicative mood, They
          shall curse, etc. Should any prefer to understand the passage as
          indicating, on the part of the Psalmist, his resolution to suffer and
          submit to the curses of his enemies, I do not oppose their
          interpretation. In my opinion, however, those who view the words as a
          prayer, misinterpret them; because David, having already presented his
          petitions to God, and being secure in his favor, seems now rather to
          boast that their cursing will do him no harm; for Thou, says he, wilt
          bless me. By this means, he proves how little and how lightly he
          regarded the menaces of his enemies, though they might assail him by
          the poison of the tongue, and the power of the sword. From the example
          of David, let us learn to form the resolution of engaging God on our
          side, who can baffle all the designs of our enemies, and inspire us
          with courage to set at defiance their malice, wickedness, audacity,
          power, and fury.

          And then, indeed, it is that the loving-kindness of God appears, when
          it banishes from our minds the fears which we entertain of the
          threatenings of the world. Therefore, relying upon the grace of God,
          boldly setting at nought the machinations and attacks of his enemies,
          believing that they could not prevail against God's blessing, David
          raises the shout of triumph even in the midst of the battle. This
          truth is still more impressively inculcated in the succeeding clause
          of the verse: Though they arise, yet shall they be put to shame. By
          these words it is obviously his design to intimate that the
          ungovernable violence of his enemies is not yet subdued, but that he
          can endure all their fury and foam so long as the hand of God is
          stretched forth to maintain and defend him; and thus he animates and
          fortifies himself against all the pride of the world, and, at the same
          time, by his example emboldens all the faithful, so that they do not
          feel dejected even when the perverseness of their enemies seems to get
          the advantage over them, and to menace them with instant destruction.
          Cherishing such a hope, he trusts that, for the future, he shall be
          delivered from all his sorrows. Whence let us learn to bear patiently
          and meekly our trials, until the fit season and the full time, which
          God hath appointed, arrive for turning our weeping into joy. In the
          following verse he proceeds in the same strain of exultation, because,
          though he beholds the ungodly assuming a lofty air, yet, looking
          beyond the present state of things with the eye of faith, he
          entertains no doubt that God will frustrate all their designs, and
          pour contempt upon all their schemes.

          30. I will praise Jehovah greatly with my mouth These words clearly
          establish the truth of the observation I formerly made, that David
          does not pray God to curse his enemies, but, by the holy boldness of
          his faith, sets them at defiance; for he prepares to offer up a
          tribute of gratitude to God, as if he had already realised the object
          of his desire. The phrase, with my mouth, is not, as some erroneously
          suppose, superfluous, but is to be considered as a public
          acknowledgement, on his part, of his thanksgiving to God for the
          deliverance vouchsafed to him; as if he should say, I will, not only
          when alone and when no human eye beholds me, and in the inward
          recesses of my heart, meditate upon the great goodness which I have
          received from God, but also in the appointed sacrifice of praise will
          I declare publicly, before men, how much I am indebted to his grace.
          Agreeably to this meaning, he adds, in the assembly of great, or of
          many men; for the term rvym, rabbim, is susceptible of being rendered
          both ways. I prefer rendering it, great men, because it appears to me,
          that David refers to an assembly of men of notable and noble rank. He
          declares that he will acknowledge the goodness of God, not only in
          some obscure corner, but also in the great assembly of the people, and
          among governors and those of noble rank. In the celebration of God's
          praises, there can be no question that these must issue from the heart
          ere they be uttered by the lips; at the same time, it would be an
          indication of great coldness, and of want of fervor, did not the
          tongue unite with the heart in this exercise. The reason why David
          makes mention of the tongue only is, that he takes it for granted
          that, unless there be a pouring out of the heart before God, those
          praises which reach no farther than the ear are vain and frivolous;
          and, therefore, from the very bottom of his soul, he pours forth his
          heart-felt gratitude in fervent strains of praise; and this he does,
          from the same motives which ought to influence all the faithful -- the
          desire of mutual edification; for to act otherwise would be to rob God
          of the honor which belongs to him.
        </p>

          Moreover, he also subjoins the form in which he rendered thanks;
          namely, that God stood at the right hand of the poor By this language
          he intimates, that when God had apparently forsaken and abandoned him,
          and stood far from him, even then he was always near and ready to
          render him seasonable and needful help; and, assuredly, his poverty
          and affliction gave some reason for suspecting that he was forsaken of
          God, inasmuch as he then either withdrew or concealed his
          loving-kindness. Notwithstanding of this seeming departure, he
          acknowledges that, during his affliction and poverty, God never ceased
          to be present to render him assistance. In saying that he was saved
          from the judges of his life, he sets forth, in a still stronger light,
          the very trying situation in which he was placed; his having to deal
          with very formidable enemies, such as the king and the princes of the
          realm, who, proudly presuming upon their grandeur and greatness, and
          regarding his recovery hopeless, treated him as if he had been a dead
          dog. It is my firm conviction, that in this passage he complains both
          of the torturing cruelty of his enemies, and also that his character
          had been unjustly aspersed by calumny and reproach; for we know that
          he was borne down by the malignity and wickedness of those who, being
          invested with authority, boastingly, yet falsely, pretended that they
          wished to act as judges and as the executors of justice, which
          plausible pretexts they adopt as a cloak for their iniquity.<br />
