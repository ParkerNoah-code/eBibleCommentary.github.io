        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.968)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, January 1st, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Because I live, ye shall live also." -- John 14:19.</p>
        <p>
          THIS world saw our Lord Jesus for a very little time, but now it seeth
          him no more. It only saw him with the outward eye and after a carnal
          sort, so that when the clouds received him and concealed him from
          bodily vision, this spiritually blind world lost sight of him
          altogether. Here and there, however, among the crowds of the sightless
          there were a few chosen men who had received spiritual sight; Christ
          had been light to them, he had opened their blind eyes, and they had
          seen him as the world had not seen him. In a high and full sense they
          could say, "We have seen the Lord," for they had in some degree
          perceived his Godhead, discerned his mission, and learned his
          spiritual presence of its object, those persons who had seen Jesus
          spiritually, saw him after he had gone out of the world unto the
          Father. We who have the same sight still see him. Read carefully the
          words of the verse before us: "Yet a little while, and the world seeth
          me no more; but ye see me." It is a distinguishing mark of a true
          follower of Jesus that he sees his Lord and Master when he is not to
          be seen by the bodily eye; he sees him intelligently and spiritually;
          he knows his Lord, discerns his character, apprehends him by faith,
          gazes upon him with admiration as our first sight of Christ brought us
          into spiritual life, for we looked unto him and were saved, so it is
          by the continuance of this spiritual sight of Christ that our
          spiritual life is consciously maintained. We lived by looking, we live
          still by looking. Faith is still the medium by which life comes to us
          from the life-giving Lord. It is not only upon the first day of the
          Christian's life that he must needs look to Jesus only, but every day
          of that life, even until the last, his motto must be, "Looking unto
          Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." The world sees him no
          more, for it never saw him aright; but ye have seen him and lived, and
          now, through continuing still to see him, you remain in life. Let us
          ever remember the intimate connection between faith and spiritual
          life. Faith is the life-look. we must never think that we live by
          works, by feelings, or by ceremonies. "The just shall live by faith."
          We dare not preach to the ungodly sinner a way of obtaining life by
          the works of the law, neither dare we hold up to the most advanced
          believer a way of sustaining life by legal means. We should in such a
          case expect to hear the apostle's expostulation, "Are ye so foolish?
          having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?" Our
          glorifying is that our life is not dependent on ourselves, but is safe
          in our Lord, as saith the apostle, "I am crucified with Christ:
          nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life
          which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God,
          who loved me, and gave himself for me." Because he lives, we live, and
          shall live for ever. God grant that our eye may ever be clear towards
          Jesus, our life. May we have no confidence but in our Redeemer; may
          our eyes be fixed upon him, that no other object may in any measure or
          degree shut out our view of him as our all in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text contains in it very much of weighty truth, far more than we
          shall be able to bring forth from it this morning. First, we see in it
          a life; secondly, that life preserved; and thirdly, the reason for the
          preservation of that life: "Because I live, ye shall live also."
        </p>
        <p>I. First, we have LIFE here spoken of.</p>
        <p>
          We must not confound this with existence. It were indeed to reduce a
          very rich text to a poverty-stricken sentence if we read it, "Because
          I exist, ye shall exist also." We could not say of such a use of words
          that the water of ordinary speech was turned to wine, but rather that
          the wine was turned to water. Before the disciples believed in Jesus
          they existed, and altogether apart from him as their spiritual life
          their existence would have been continued; it was something far other
          and higher than immortal existence which our Lord was here dealing
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life, what is it? We know practically, but we cannot tell in words. We
          know it, however, to be a mystery of different degrees. As all flesh
          is not the same flesh, so all life is not the same life. There is the
          life of the vegetable, the cedar of Lebanon, the hyssop on the wall.
          There is a considerable advance when we come to animal life -- the
          eagle or the ox. Animal life moves in quite a different world from
          that in which the plant vegetates -- sensation, appetite, instinct,
          are things to which plants are dead, though they may possess some
          imitation of them, for one life mimics another. Animal life rises far
          above the experience and apprehension of the flower of the field. Then
          there is mental life, which we all of us possess, which introduces us
          into quite another realm from that which is inhabited by the mere
          beast. To judge, to foresee, to imagine, to invent, to perform moral
          acts, are not these new functions which the ox hath not? Now, let it
          be clear to you, that far above mental life there is another form of
          life of which the mere carnal man can form no more idea than the plant
          of the animal, or the animal of the poet. The carnal mind knoweth not
          spiritual things, because it has no spiritual capacities. As the beast
          cannot comprehend the pursuits of the philosopher, so the man who is
          but a natural man cannot comprehend the experience of the spiritually
          minded. Thus saith the Scripture: "The natural man receiveth not the
          things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:
          neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But
          he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of
          no man." There is in believers a life which is not to be found in
          other men -- nobler, diviner for education cannot raise the natural
          man into it, neither can refinement reach it; for at its best, "that
          which is born of the flesh is flesh," and to all must the humbling
          truth be spoken, "Ye must be born again."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be remarked concerning our life in Christ, that it is the
          removal of the penalty which fell upon our race for Adam's sin. "In
          the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," was the
          Lord's threatening to our first parent, who was the representative of
          the race. He did eat of the fruit, and since God is true, and his word
          never fails, we may be sure of this, that in that selfsame day Adam
          died. It is true that he did not cease to exist, but that is quite
          another thing from dying. The threatening was not that he should
          ultimately die, but "In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
          die;" and it is beyond all doubt that the Lord kept his word to the
          letter. If the first threatening was not carried out we might take
          liberty to trifle with all others. Rest assured, then, that the threat
          was on the spot fulfilled. The spiritual life departed from Adam; he
          was no longer at one with God, no more able to live and breathe in the
          same sphere as the Lord. He fell from his first estate; he had need if
          he should enter into spiritual life to be born again, even as you and
          I must be. As he hides himself from his Maker, and uttersvain excuses
          before his God, you see that he is dead to the life of God, dead in
          trespasses and sins. We also, being heirs of wrath even as others, are
          through the fall dead, dead in trespasses and sins; and if ever we are
          to possess spiritual life, it must be said of us, "And you hath he
          quickened." We must be as "those that are alive from the dead." The
          world is the valley of dry bones, and grace raises the chosen into
          newness of life. The fall brought universal death, in the deep
          spiritual sense of that word, over all mankind; and Jesus delivers us
          from the consequences of the fall by implanting in us a spiritual
          life. By no other means can this death be removed: "He that believeth
          on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son
          shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." The work of
          regeneration, in which the new life is implanted, effectually restores
          the ruin of the fall, for we are born again, "not of corruptible seed,
          but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for
          ever." But you remind me that still sin remains in us after we have
          received the divine life. I know it does, and it is called "the body
          of this death;" and this it is which rages within, between the power
          of the death in the first Adam, and the power of the life in the
          second Adam; but the heavenly life will ultimately overcome the deadly
          energy of sin. Even to-day our inner life groans after deliverance,
          but with its groan of "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
          from the body of this death?" it mingles the thankful song, "I thank
          God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          This life is of a purely spiritual kind. We find analogies and
          resemblances of it in the common mental life, but they are only
          analogies, the spiritual life is far and high above the carnal life,
          and altogether out of sight of the fleshly mind. Scarce are there
          words in which it can be described. To know this life you must have
          it; it must pulsate within your own bosom, for no explanations of
          others can tell you what this life is; it is one of the secrets of the
          Lord. It would not be possible for us with the greatest skill to
          communicate to a horse any conception of what imagination is; neither
          could we by the most diligent use of words, communicate to carnal
          minds what it is to be joined unto the Lord so as to be one spirit.
          One thing we know of it, namely, that the spiritual life is intimately
          connected with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the soul. When he
          comes we are "born again from above," "born of the Spirit." While he
          works in us mightily our life is active and powerful if he withdraws
          his active operations our new life becomes faint and sickly. Christ is
          our life, but he works in us through his Holy Spirit, who dwelleth in
          us evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, we know that this life very much consists in union with God.
          "For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
          life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it
          is not subject to the law of God, neither again can be. So then they
          that are in the flesh cannot please God." Death as to the body
          consists in the body being separated from the soul; the death of the
          soul lies mainly in the soul's being separated form its God. For the
          soul to be in union with God is the soul's highest life; in his
          presence it unfolds itself like an opening flower; away from him it
          pines, and loses all its beauty and excellence, till it is as a thing
          destroyed. Let the soul obey God, let it be holy, pure, gracious, then
          is it happy, an truly living; but a soul saundered from God is a soul
          blasted, killed, destroyed; it exists in a dreadful death; all its
          true peace, dignity, and glory, are gone; it is a hideous ruin, the
          mere corpse of manhood. The new life brings us near to God, makes us
          think of him, makes us love him, and ultimately makes us like him. My
          brethren, it is in proportion as you get near to God that you enter
          into the full enjoyment of life -- that life which Jesus Christ gives
          you, and which Jesus Christ preserves in you. "In his favour is life."
          Psalm 30:5. "The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life." Prov.14:27.
          To turn to God is "repentance unto life." To forget God is for a man
          to be "dead whilst he liveth." To believe the witness of God is to
          possess the faith which overcometh the world. "He that believeth on
          the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God
          hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God
          gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us
          eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath
          life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
        </p>
        <p>
          This life within the soul bears fruit on earth in righteousness and
          true holiness. It blooms with sweetest of flowers of fellowship with
          God below, and it is made perfect in the presence of God in heaven.
          The life of glorified spirits above is but the life of justified men
          here below; it is the same life, only it is delivered from
          encumbrances, and has come to the fullness of its strength. The life
          of heaven is in every believer even now. The moment a sinner believes
          in Jesus he receives from God that selfsame life which shall look down
          serenely upon the conflagration of earth, and the passing away of
          those lower skies. Blessed is that man who hath everlasting life, who
          is made a partaker of the divine nature, who is born again from above,
          who is born of God by a seed which remaineth in him, for he is the man
          upon whom the second death hath no power, who shall enjoy life eternal
          when the wicked go away into everlasting punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus much concerning this life. We have now to ask each of you whether
          you have received it. Have you been born, not of blood, nor of the
          will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God? Was there a
          time with you when you passed from death unto life, or are you abiding
          in death? Have you the witness in yourself that you have been operated
          upon by a divinely spiritual power? Is there something in you which
          was not once there, not a faculty developed by education, but a life
          implanted by God himself? Do you feel an inward craving unknown to
          carnal minds, a longing desire which this world could neither excite
          nor gratify? Is there a strange sighing for a land as yet unseen, of
          which it is a native, and for which it yearns? Do you walk among the
          sons of men as a being of another race, not of the world, even as
          Christ was not of the world? Can you say, with the favoured apostle,
          "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
          understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
          that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and
          eternal life." Oh! then, thank God for this, and thank God yet more
          that you have an infallible guarantee for this, and thank God yet more
          that you have an infallible guarantee that your life shall be
          continued and perfected, for so saith the text, "Because I live, ye
          shall live also."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second head treats of LIFE PRESERVED. "Because I life, ye
          shall live also." There stands the promise, " Ye shall live also. This
          heavenly life of yours which ye have received shall be preserved to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this sentence, let me draw your attention, first of all, to
          its fullness: "Ye shall live." I think I see in that much more than
          lies upon the surface. Whatever is meant by living shall be ours. All
          the degree of life which is secured in the covenant of grace,
          believers shall have. Moreover, all your new nature shall live, shall
          thoroughly live, shall eternally live. By this word it is secured that
          the eternal life implanted at regeneration shall never die out. As our
          Lord said so shall it be. "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I
          shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him
          shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
          We may not view this precious word as referring to all the essential
          spiritual graces which make up the new man? Not even, in part, shall
          the new man die. "Ye shall live," applies to all the parts of our
          new-born nature. If there be any believer here who has not lived to
          the full extent he might have done, let him lay hold upon this
          promise; and seeing that it secures the preservation of all his new
          nature, let him have courage to seek a higher degree of health. "I am
          come," saith Christ, "that ye might have life, and have it more
          abundantly." There is no reason, Christian, why your love to Jesus
          should not become flaming, ardent, conquering; for it lives, and ever
          must live. As to your faith, it also has immortal vitality in it, and
          even though it be just now weak, and staggering, lift up the hands
          that hang down and confirm the feeble knees, for your faith shall not
          die out. Here in your Lord's promise the abiding nature of the vital
          faculties of your spirit is guaranteed. There is no stint in the
          fullness of Christian life. Beneath the skies I would labour to attain
          it, but herein is my joy , that it shall be most surely mine, for this
          word is faithful and true. As surely as I have this day eternal life
          by reason of faith in Christ Jesus, so surely shall I reach its
          fullness when Christ who is my life shall appear. Even here on earth I
          have the permit to seek for the fullest development of this life; nay
          I have a precept in this promise bidding me to seek after it. "Ye
          shall live," means that the new life shall not be destroyed -- no, not
          as to any of its essentials. All the members of the spiritual man
          shall be safe; we may say of it as of the Lord himself, "Not a bone of
          him shall be broken." The shield of Christ's own life covers all the
          faculties of our spiritual nature. We shall not enter into life halt
          or maimed; but he will present us faultless before the presence of his
          glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, much less nay
          dead limbs or decayed faculties. It is a grand promise, and covers the
          spiritual nature as with the wings of God, so that we may apply to it
          the words of David, in the ninety-first Psalm: "Surely he shall
          deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome
          pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
          shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou
          shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that
          flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor
          for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at
          thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come
          nigh thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          The text secures that the death-penalty of the law shall never fall
          upon believers. The quickened man shall never fall back into the old
          death from which he has escaped; He shall not be numbered with the
          dead, and condemned either in this life or the next. Never shall the
          spiritually living become dead again in sin. As Jesus being raised
          form the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him;
          even so sin shall not have dominion over us again. Once, through the
          offense of one, death reigned in us; but now having received abundance
          of grace and of the gift of righteousness, we shall reign in life by
          one, Christ Jesus. Rom.5:17. "For if, when we were enemies, we were
          reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being
          reconciled, we shall be saved by his life." Rom.5:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are united to Christ this day by bands of spiritual life which
          neither things present nor things to come can separate. Our union to
          Jesus is eternal. It may be assailed; but it shall never be destroyed.
          The old body of this death may for awhile prevail, and like Herod it
          may seek the young child's life, but it cannot die. Who shall condemn
          to death that which is not under the law? Who shall slay that which
          abides under the shadow of the Almighty? Even as sin reigned unto
          death, even so must grace reign unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remark carefully the continuance insisted upon in this verse.
          Continuance is indeed the main element of this promise -- "Ye shall
          live." It means certainly that during our abode in this body we shall
          live. We shall not be again reduced to our death-state during our
          sojourn here. Ten thousand attempts will be made to bring us under
          dominion to the law of sin and death, but this one word baffles all.
          Your soul may be so assailed that it shall seem as if you could not
          keep your hold on Christ, but Christ shall keep his hold on you. The
          incorruptible seed may be crushed, bruised, buried, but the life
          within it shall not extinguished, it shall yet arise. "Ye shall live."
          When ye see all around you ten thousand elements of death, think ye
          believers, how grand is this word, "Ye shall live." No falling from
          grace for you, no being cast out of the covenant, no being driven from
          the Father's house and left to perish. "Ye shall live."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all, for when the natural death comes, which indeed to us
          is no longer death, our inner life shall suffer no hurt whatsoever; it
          will not even be suspended for a moment. It is not a thing which can
          be touched by death. The shafts of the last enemy can have no more
          effect upon the spiritual, than a javelin upon a cloud. Even in the
          very crisis, when the soul is separated from the body, no damage shall
          be done to the spiritual nature. And in the awful future, when the
          judgment comes, when the thrones are set, and the multitudes are
          gathered, and to the right the righteous, and to the left the wicked,
          let what may of terror and of horror come frothy, the begotten of God
          shall live. Onward through eternity, whatever may be the changes which
          yet are to be disclosed, nothing shall affect our God-given life. Like
          the life of God himself -- eternal, and ever-blessed, it shall
          continue. Should all things else be swept away, the righteous must
          live on; I mean not merely that they shall exist, but they shall live
          in all the fullness of that far-reaching, much-comprehending word
          "life." Bearing the nature of God as far as the creature can
          participate in it, the begotten from the dead shall prove the sureness
          of the promise, "Ye shall live."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me further call to your notice that the fact here stated is
          univeral, in application to all spiritual life. The promise is, "Ye
          shall live," that is to say, every child of God shall live. Every one
          who sees Christ, as the world sees him not, is living and shall live.
          I can understand such a promised given to eminent saints who live near
          to God, but my soul would prostrate herself before the throne in
          reverent loving wonder when she hears this word spoken to the very
          least and meanest of the saints, "Ye shall live." Thou art not
          exempted, thou whose faith is but as a smoking flax, thou shalt live.
          The Lord bestows security upon the least of his people as well as upon
          the greatest. It is plain that the reason given for the preservation
          of the new life is as applicable to one saint as another. If it had
          been said, "Because your faith is strong, ye shall live" then weak
          faith would have perished; but when it is written, "Because I live,"
          the argument is as powerful in the one case as in the other. Take it
          home to thyself, my brother, however heavy thy heart, or dim thy bone,
          Jesus lives, and you shall live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remark yet again that this text is exceeding broad. Mark its breadth
          and see how it meets everything to the contrary, and overturns all the
          hopes of the adversary. "Ye shall live." Then the inbred corruption
          which rides within us shall not stifle the new creature. Chained as
          the spirit seem to be to the loathsome and corrupt body of this death,
          it shall live in spite of its hideous companionship. Though besetting
          sins may be as arrows, and fleshly lusts like drawn swords, yet grace
          shall not be slain. Neither the fever of hasty passion, nor the palsy
          of timorousness, nor the leprosy of covetousness, nor any other
          disease of sin, shall so break forth in the old nature as to destroy
          the new. Nor shall outward circumstances overthrow the inner life.
          "For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
          thy ways." They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
          foot against a stone. If providence should cast you into a godless
          family, where you dwell as in a sepulcher, and the air you breathe is
          laden with the miasma of death, yet shall you live. Evil example shall
          not poison your spirit, you shall drink this deadly thing and it shall
          not hurt you, you shall be kept from giving way to evil. You shall not
          be decoyed by fair temptation, you shall not be cowed by fierce
          persecution: mightier is he that is in you than he which is in the
          world. Satan will attack you, and his weapons are deadly, but you
          shall foil him at all points. To you is it given to tread upon the
          lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under
          foot. If God should allow you for awhile to be sorely tried, as he did
          his servant Job, and if the devil should have all the world to help
          him in his attempt to destroy your spiritual life, yet even on the
          dunghill of poverty, and in the wretchedness of sickness, your spirit
          shall still maintain its holy life, and you shall prove it so by
          blessing and magnifying God, notwithstanding all. We little dream what
          may be reserved for us; we may have to climb steeps of prosperity,
          slippery and dangerous, but we shall live; we may be called to sink
          into the dark waters of adversity, all God's waves and billows may go
          over us, but we shall live. WE may traverse persilent swamps of error,
          or burning dewerts of unbelief, but the divine life shall live amid
          the domains of death. Let the future be bright or black, we need not
          wish to turn the page; that which we prize best, namely, our spiritual
          life, is hid with Christ in God, beyond the reach of harm, and we
          shall live. If old age shall be our portion, and our crown shall be
          delayed till we have fought a long and weary battle, yet nevertheless
          we shall live; or if sudden death should cut short the time of our
          trial here, yet we shall have lived in the fullness of that word.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Our third point is, THE REASON FOR THE SECURITY OF THE SPIRITUAL
          LIFE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason assigned is this, "Because I live, ye shall live also."
          Christ has life essentially as God. Christ, as man, having fulfilled
          his life-work, having offered full atonement for human sin, dieth no
          more, death hath no more dominion over him. His life is communicated
          to us, and becomes the guarantee to us that we shall live also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, first, that this is the sole reason of the believer's
          spiritual life. "Because I live, ye shall live also." The means by
          which the soul is pardoned is found in the precious blood of Jesus;
          the cause of its obtaining spiritual life at first is found in
          Christ's finished work; and the only reason why the Christian
          continues still to live after he is quickened, lies in Jesus Christ,
          who liveth and was dead and is alive for evermore. When I first come
          to Christ, I know I must find all in him, for I feel I have nothing of
          my own; but all my life long I am to acknowledge the same absolute
          dependence; I am still to look for everything to him. " I am the vine,
          ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same
          bringeth forth much fruit: for without me, yet can do nothing." the
          temptation is after we have looked to Jesus and found life there, to
          fancy that in future time we are to sustain ourselves in spiritual
          existence by some means within ourselves, or by supplies extra and
          apart from Christ. But it must not be so; all for the future as well
          as all for the past is wrapped up in the person and the work of the
          Lord Jesus. Because he died, ye are pardoned; because he lives, ye
          live; all your life still lies in him who is the way, the truth, and
          the life. Does not the Christian's life depend upon his prayerfulness?
          Could he be a Christian if he ceased to pray? We reply, the
          Christian's spiritual health depends upon his prayerfulness, but that
          prayerfulness depends on something else. The reason why the hands of
          the clock move may be found first in a certain wheel which operates
          upon them, but if you go to the primary cause of all, you reach the
          main-spring, or the weight, which is the source of all the motion.
          Many secondary causes tend to sustain spiritual life; but the primary
          cause, the first and foremost, is because Jesus Christ lives. "All my
          fresh springs are in thee." While Jesus lives, he sends the Spirit;
          the Spirit being sent, we pray; our payer becomes the evidence of our
          spiritual life. "But are not good works essential to the maintenance
          of the spiritual life?" Certainly, if there be no good works, we have
          no evidence of spiritual life. In its season the tree must bring forth
          its fruit and its leaves; if there be no outward sign we suspect that
          there is no motion of the sap within. Still, to the tree the fruit is
          not the cause of life, but the result of it, and to the life of the
          Christian, good works bear the same relationship, they are its
          outgrowth, not its root. If then my spiritual life is low, what am I
          to look to? I am not to look to my prayers, I am not to find comfort
          in my works. I may from these discover how declining I am; but if I
          want my life to be renovated, I must fly to the fountain of my life,
          even Jesus, for there, and there only, shall I find restoration. Do
          let us recollect this, that we are not saved because of anything that
          we are, or anything that we do; and that we do not remain saved
          because of anything we are or can be. A man is saved because Christ
          died for him he continues saved because Christ lives for him. The sole
          reason why the spiritual life abides is because Jesus lives. This is
          to get upon a rock, above the fogs which cover all things down below.
          If my life rests on something within me, then to-day I live, and
          to-morrow I die; but if my spiritual life rests in Christ, then in my
          darkest frames-ay, and when sin has most raged against my spirit-
          still I live in the ever-living One, whose life never changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, it is a sufficient cause for my life. "Because I live, ye
          shall live also." It must be enough to make believers live that Christ
          lives; for first, Christ's life is a proof that his work has
          accomplished the absolution of his people from their sins. He would
          have been in the tomb to this hour had he not made a complete
          satisfaction for their sins, but his rising again from the dead is the
          testimony of God that he has accepted the atonement of his dear Son;
          his resurrection is our full acquittal. Then if the living Christ be
          our acquittal, how can God condemn us to die for sins which he has by
          the fact of Christ's resurrection declared to be for ever blotted out?
          If Jesus lives, how can we die? Shall there be two deaths for one sin,
          the death of Christ and the death of those for whom he died? God
          forbid that there should be any such injustice with the Most High. The
          very fact that Jesus lives, proves that our sin has been atoned for,
          that we are absolved, and therefore cannot die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus is the representative of those for whom he is the federal head.
          Shall the representative live, and yet those represented die? How
          shall the living represent the dead? But in his life I see my own
          life, for as Levi was in the loins of Abraham, so is every saint in
          the loins of Christ, and the life of Christ is representatively the
          life of all his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, he is the surety for his people, under bonds and pledges to
          bring his redeemed safely home. His own declaration is, "I give unto
          my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any
          pluck them out of my hands." Will he break his covenant bonds? Shall
          his suretyship be cast to the winds? It cannot be. The fact that if
          any of his people for whom he died, to whom he has given spiritual
          life, should after all die, Christ would be disappointed of his
          intent, which supposition involves the grossest blasphemy. What so
          many shall he have for his reward? The purchase-price shall not be
          given in vain; a redemption so marvelous as that which he has
          presented upon the tree, shall never in any degree become a failure.
          His life, which proves his labour to be over, guarantees to people.
          Know ye not, my brethren, that if one of those to whom Christ has
          given spiritual life should after all fall from it and die, it would
          argue either that he had a want of power to keep them, or a want of
          will to do so. Shall we conceive him to be devoid of power? Then how
          he is mighty God? Is he devoid of will to keep his people- is that
          conceivable? Cast out the traitorous thought! He must be as willing as
          he is able, and as able as he is willing. While he was in this world,
          he kept his people; having loved his own, he loved them to the end; he
          is "the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever," he will not suffer one
          of these little ones to perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recollect, and this perhaps will cheer you most of all, that all who
          have spiritual life are one with Christ Jesus. Jesus is the head of
          the mystical body, they are the members. Suppose one of the members of
          the mystical body of Christ should die, then from that moment, with
          reverence be it spoken, Christ is not a complete Christ. What were the
          head without the body? A most ghastly sight. What were the head with
          only a part of the members? Certainly not perfect. There must be every
          member present to make a complete body. Therefore we gather that you,
          brother, though you think yourself the meanest part of the body, are
          nevertheless, essential to its perfection; and you, sister, though you
          fancy yourself to be one of the uncomely portions of the body, yet you
          must be there, or else the body cannot be perfect, and Christ cannot
          be a complete Christ. From him, the head, the life streams into all
          the members and while that head lives as a perfect head of a perfect
          body, all members must live also. As we have often said, as long as a
          man's head is above water you cannot drown his limbs; as long as our
          head is above the reach of spiritual death we also are the same-no
          weapons can hurt, no poison can destroy, not all hell's fires could
          burn, nor all earth's floods could drown, the spiritual life within
          us: it must be safe because it is indissolubly one with Jesus Christ
          the Lord. What comfort, then, lies in this, the sole but sufficient
          reason for the eternal maintenance of the new-born life within us, is
          this, "Because I live, ye shall live also."
        </p>
        <p>
          And be it remembered, that this reason is an abiding reason --
          "Because I live, ye shall live also" -- a reason which has as much
          force at one time as another. From causes variable the effects are
          variable; but remaining causes produce permanent effects. Now Jesus
          always lives. Yesterday, dear brother you were exalted in fellowship
          with him, and stood upon the mountain top; then your heart was glad,
          and your spirit rejoiced, and you could say, "I live in Christ."
          To-day darkness has intervened, you do not feel the motions of the
          inner life as you did yesterday, but do not therefore conclude that
          the life is not there. What is to be your sign; what is to be the
          rainbow of the covenant to you? Why, that Jesus lives. Do you doubt
          that he lives? You dare not. You trust him, doubt not then that you
          live, for your life is as sure as his. Believe also that you shall
          live, for that also is as sure as the fact that he lives. God gave to
          Noah, a token that he would not destroy the earth-it was the rainbow:
          but then the rainbow is not often seen; there are peculiar
          circumstances before the bow is placed in the cloud. You, brother, you
          have a token of God's covenant given you in the text which can always
          be seen, neither sun nor shower are needful to its appearance. The
          living Christ is the token that you live too. God gave to David the
          token of the sun and the moon; he said if the ordinances of day and
          night should be changed, then would he cast off the seed of David. But
          there are times when neither sun nor moon appear, but your token is
          plain when these are hidden. Christ at all times lives. When you are
          lowest, when you cannot pray, when you can hardly groan, when you do
          not seem to have spiritual life enough even to heave a desire, still
          if you cling to Jesus this life is as surely in you as there is life
          in Christ himself at the right hand of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, it is a most instructive cause. It instructs us in many
          ways: let us hint at three. It instructs us to admire the
          condescension of Christ. Look at the two pronouns, "ye" and "I"; shall
          they ever come into contact? yes, here they stand in close connection
          with each other. "I" -- the I AM the Infinite; "ye" the creatures of
          an hour; yet I, the Infinite, come into union with you, the finite; I
          the Eternal, take up you the fleeting, and I make you live because I
          live. What? Is there such a bond between me and Christ? Is there such
          a link between his life and mine? Blessed be his name! Adored be his
          infinite condescension!
        </p>
        <p>
          It demands of us next abundance of gratitude. Apart from Christ we are
          dead in trespasses and sins; look at the depth of our degradation! But
          in Christ we live, live with his own life. Look at the height of our
          exaltation, and let our thankfulness be proportioned to this infinity
          of mercy. Measure if you can from the lowest hell to the highest
          heaven, and so great let your thankfulness be to him who has lifted
          you from death to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the last lesson be see the all-importance of close communion with
          Jesus. Union with Christ makes you live; keep up your enjoyment of
          that union, that you may clearly perceive and enjoy your life. Begin
          this year with the prayer, "Nearer to thee, my Lord, nearer to thee."
          Think much of the spiritual life and less of this poor carnal life,
          which will be soon be over. Go to the source of life for an increase
          of spiritual life. Go to Jesus. Think of him more than you have done,
          pray to him more; use his name more believingly in your supplications.
          Serve him better, and seek to grow up into his likeness in all things.
          Make an advance this year. Life is a growing thing. Your life only
          grows by getting nearer to Christ; therefore, get under the beams of
          the Sun of the Righteousness. Time brings you nearer to him, you will
          soon be where he is in heaven; let grace bring you nearer also. You
          taste more of his love as fresh mercies come, give him more of your
          love, more of your fellowship. Abide in him, and may his word abide in
          you henceforth and for ever, and all shall be to his glory. Amen.
