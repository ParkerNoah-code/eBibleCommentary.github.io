        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>

        <p>
          "The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but they that seek the
          Lord shall not want any good thing." -- Psalm 34:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE young lions are very strong; they are as yet in the freshness of
          their youth, and yet their strength does not always suffice to keep
          them supplied. The young lions are very crafty; they understand how to
          waylay their game and leap upon them with a sudden spring at unawares,
          and yet, with all their craftiness, they howl for hunger in the wood.
          The young lions are very bold and furious, very unscrupulous; they are
          not stayed from any deed of depredation, and yet for all that,
          free-booters as they are, they sometimes lack, and suffer hunger.
          These are just the type of many men in the world; they are strong men,
          they are cunning men, they are thoroughly up to the times -- smart,
          sharp men. If anybody could be well supplied, one would think they
          should be. Rut how many of them go to bankruptcy and ruin, and, with
          all their cunning, they are too cunning, and, with all their
          unscrupulousness, they manage at last full often, to come to an ill
          end. They do lack and suffer hunger. But here are the people of God --
          they are regarded as simpletons, such simpletons as to seek the Lord
          instead of adopting the maxims of universal worldly wisdom namely,
          "Seek yourself"; they have given up what is called the first law of
          human nature, namely, self-seeking, self-pleasing, self-serving, and
          have come to seek the Lord, to seek to magnify him. And what comes of
          their simplicity? "They shall not want any good thing."
          Notwithstanding their want of power, their want of cunning, and the
          check which conscience often puts upon them so that they cannot do
          what others can to enrich themselves, yet for all that, they have a
          fortune ensured to them: they "shall not want any good thing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us look at this text now, and together consider it thus: first,
          the seeking of the Lord which is here intended; and then following
          upon that, the promise that is given upon such seeking.
        </p>
        <p>1. THE SEEKING OF THE LORD HERE INTENDED.</p>
        <p>
          We must be particular and very precise about this. The promise is so
          rich that we wish to win it fully, but we do not wish to be dishonest.
          We would not take a word of God that does not belong to us, lest we
          should deceive ourselves, and be guilty of robbing God. We must go
          carefully and jealously here, and must search ourselves to see if in
          very deed and truth we are such as really seek the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the term to "seek the Lord," I may say, is the description of the
          life of the Christian. When he lives as he should, his whole life is
          seeking the Lord. It is with this he begins. "Behold, he prayeth,"
          that is, he seeks the Lord. The has begun to be conscious of his sin;
          he is seeking pardon of the Lord. He has begun to be aware of his
          danger; he is seeking salvation in the Lord. He is now aware of his
          powerlessness, and he is looking for strength to the Lord. Those deep
          convictions, those cries and tears, those repentings and humblings,
          and, above all, those acts of simple confidence in which he casts
          himself upon the great atonement made upon Calvary's bloody tree --
          those are all acts of seeking the Lord. Now, perhaps, some of you have
          got no farther than this. Well, you shall have your proportion of
          blessing, according to your strength. You shall have your share in it,
          little as you are. He will give to his children at the table their
          portion, as well as to those who have grown to manhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a man has attained unto eternal life by confiding in the Lord
          Jesus, he then goes on to seek the Lord in quite another way. No
          wonder; since he has found the Lord, or rather has been found of him,
          and yet he still presses on to apprehend him of whom he has been
          already apprehended. He still presses forward, seeking the Lord, and
          he seeks the Lord thus. He seeks now to know the Lord's mind, the
          Lord's law and will. "Show me what thou wouldest have me to do," saith
          he. "Lord, I went by my own wit once, and I brought myself into a dark
          wood: I lost myself: I was at hell's brink, and thou didst save me:
          now, Lord, guide and direct me: be pleased to teach me: open my lips
          when I speak: guide my hands when I act: I wait at thy feet, feeling
          that: --
        </p>
        <p>"For holiness no strength have I;</p>
        <p>My strength is at thy feet to lie."</p>
        <p>
          The man now seeks the Lord by daily and constant prayer, seeking that
          he may be upheld, guided, constrained in paths of righteousness, and
          restrained from the ways of sin. He becomes a seeker of the Lord after
          sanctification as once he was after justification. And then he becomes
          a seeker of the Lord in a further sense. He seeks to enjoy the Lord's
          love, and his gracious fellowship and communion. He seeks to get near
          in reverent friendship to his Lord. He now longs to grow up in the
          likeness of Christ, that his intercourse with the Father and the Son
          may be more close, more sweet, more continuous. He feels that God is
          his Father, and that he is no longer at a distance from him in one
          sense, for he is made nigh by the blood of the cross. Yet sometimes he
          is oppressed with a sense of his old evil heart of unbelief and in
          departure from the living God, and he cries out, "Draw me nearer to
          thyself." In fact, his prayer always is:
        </p>
        <p>"Nearer my God to thee,</p>
        <p>Nearer to thee:</p>
        <p>E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,</p>
        <p>Still all my cry shall be,</p>
        <p>Nearer to thee, nearer to thee."</p>
        <p>
          He seeks the Lord's company. He delights to be in God's house, and at
          God's mercy-seat, and at the foot of the cross, where God reveals
          himself in all his glory. He is constantly crying for a larger
          capacity to receive more of God, and the longing of his soul is, "When
          shall I come and appear before God?" He feels that he never shall be
          satisfied till he awakes up in the Lord's likeness. Now, all this,
          which may be private within him, and scarce known to any, operates
          practically in an outward seeking of the Lord which makes the man's
          life to be sublime. The genuine Christian lives for God. He makes the
          first object of all that he does the glory of God, the extension of
          the Redeemer's kingdom, the showing forth of his praise, who has
          brought him out of darkness into marvellous light. He is a young man,
          an apprentice; he has been converted, and he says, "Now, what can I do
          while I am in this house to make it better, to make it happier and
          holier, that men may see what the religion of Jesus is? How can I
          recommend my Lord and Master to those among whom I dwell -- to my
          master and my mistress, and my fellow-servants?" He becomes a
          tradesman on his own account, and when he opens that shop-door he
          says, "I do not mean to trade for myself, I will make this to be my
          object, that this shall be God's shop; God has got to keep me; he has
          promised that he will; therefore, I may take what I want for the daily
          subsistence of myself and my children; but I will keep the shop for
          God for all that, and if he prospers me, I will give him of my
          substance; but whatever comes of it, I will so trade across my
          counter, so keep those books, and manage those bills, that I will let
          the world see what a Christian trader is, and I will seek thus to
          recommend my Lord and my God, and my object shall be to make him
          famous."
        </p>
        <p>
          He seeks the Lord on Sundays. He desires at the Sunday-school, or the
          preaching-station, or anywhere he may serve, to be glorifying God. But
          he equally seeks him on Mondays and other weekdays, for he believes
          there is a way of turning over calicoes, weighing pounds of tea,
          ploughing acres of land, driving a cart, or whatever else he may be
          called to do, by which he can honour God, and cause others to honour
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I say very solemnly -- I hope I am mistaken in what I say but I
          fear I am not -- I am afraid there are many professors who would tell
          a lie if they said that they sought God always in their business, for
          though they are the members of a church, and you would not find them
          out in anything seriously inconsistant, yet their whole life is
          inconsistent because for a Christian to live for anything but the Lord
          Jesus Christ is inconsistant. It is inconsistant to the very root and
          core, to the tenour and aim, the supreme object of life, altogether
          inconsistant. A man has a right to live, to bring up his family, to
          educate them and see them comfortably settled in life; but that ought
          to be only for God's glory. That, he, acting as a father, is expected
          to do -- for if a man careth not for his own household, he is worse
          than a heathen man and a publican -- that God may be glorified by his
          doing his duty. But when I see some people putting by their thousands,
          and getting rich for no sort of reason that I know of, except that
          people may say, "How much did he leave behind him?" how can I believe
          that those professors, as they take the sacramental cup, are doing
          anything but drinking condemnation unto themselves? When I see some
          Christian men who profess to be living for nothing, but to be
          respectable, and to be known, and honoured, and noticed, but never
          seem to care about the souls of men, nor about Christ's glory, never
          shedding a tear over a dying sinner, nor heaving a sigh over this huge
          and wicked city which is like a millstone upon the neck of some of us,
          like a nightmare perpetually upon our hearts -- when I see these men
          so cold, so indifferent, so wrapped up in themselves, what can I think
          but that their religion is but a cloak, a painted pageantry, for them
          to go to hell in, which shall be discovered at the last, and be a
          theme for the laughter of the fiends. Oh! may God grant that we may
          all be able truly to say, "I seek the Lord; I am sure, I am certain
          that I seek him," for if we can feel that that is true, then we can
          take the promise of the text; if not, we may not touch it. If we, as
          professing Christians, fire not at top and bottom, in heart, and soul,
          and spirit, and in all that we do, really seeking the giory of God,
          the promise does not belong to us; but if we can from our very souls
          declare, "Notwithstanding a thousand infirmities, yet, Lord, thou
          knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee, and that I seek
          thine honour," then this is true of us, and no one of us shall want
          any good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a word or two more about this, for one must discriminate
          thoroughly well before we come to the promise. It is too rich and
          precious to be bestowed upon the wrong persons, and there are some who
          hope to get this promise, who feel that they must not take it. We must
          be among those who seek the Lord heartily, not merely saying that we
          do, or wishing that we did, but, filled with the Holy Spirit, and in
          the power of his blessed residence in our souls, we must be panting
          after God's glory heartily, otherwise I do not see that we can put our
          hands on the promise without presumption. We must be seeking it
          honestly, too, for there is a way of seeking God's good and your own
          at the same time -- I mean having a sinister and selfish motive. We
          may preach, and not be preaching only for God at all. A man may live
          in the Sanctuary, in holy engagements from morning until nights and
          yet may never ardently, intensely seek the Lord. A man may be a great
          giver to charities, a great attender at prayer-meetings, a great doer
          of all kinds of Christian work, and yet he may never seek the Lord,
          but may yet be seeking to have his name known, to be noted as a
          generous man, or be merely seeking to get merit to himself, or
          self-complacency to his own conscience. It is a downright honest
          desire to serve and glorify God while we are here that is meant in the
          text. If we have got it -- and I think we may readily see whether we
          have or not -- then is the word of the Psalmist true to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must seek God's glory heartily, honestly, and we must seek it most
          obediently. A man cannot say, "I am seeking God's glory," when he
          knows he is disobeying God's command in what he is doing. How can I
          say that I am desiring to glorify God by following a pursuit which is
          sinful, by giving loose to my anger, and speaking rashly; by giving
          rein to my passions, by indulging my own desires, by being proud and
          domineering over my fellow-Christians, or by being pliant, fearful,
          timid after an unholy sort, and not being bold for God and for his
          truth? No, we must watch ourselves very narrowly and cautiously. We
          must be very careful of our own spirits. We soon get off the line.
          Even when we are keeping correct outwardly, we may be getting very
          inconsistent inwardly by forgetting that the first, last, midst, and
          sole object of a bloodbought spirit is to live for Christ, and that if
          saints on earth were what they should be, they would be as constantly
          God's servants as the angels are in heaven; they would be as much
          messengers of God in their daily calling as the seraphs are before the
          eternal throne. Oh! when will the Spirit of God lift us up to anything
          like this? The most of us are still hunting after things that will
          melt beneath the sun, or rot beneath the moon. We are gathering up
          shadows to ourselves; things which have no abiding substance: seeking
          self, seeking anything rather than the blessed God. Lord! forgive us
          this sin wherein we have fallen into it, and make us truly such as
          truly seek the Lord! Now, let us be prepared to behold: --
        </p>
        <p>II. THE PROMISE OF THE REWARD OF SUCH SEEKING.</p>
        <p>
          "They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing." That is, not
          one of them. They that first stepped into Bethesda's pool were healed,
          and no others; but here everybody that steps into this pool is healed;
          that is to say, everyone that seeks the Lord has this promise -- the
          least, as well as the greatest: the Little-faiths and the Much-afraids
          as much as the Great-hearts and the Stand-fasts. They that seek the
          Lord, whether they are chimney-sweeps or princes, whether they are
          tender children, or seasoned veterans in the Master's great army --
          they shall want no good thing. "Well, but" somebody says, "there are
          some of them that are in want." They are in want? Yes, that may be,
          but they are not in want of any good thing. They cannot be. God's word
          against anything you say, or I say. If they seek the Lord, they shall
          not, they cannot, they must not want any good thing. "Well, at any
          rate, they want what appears to be a good thing." That is very likely;
          the text does not say they shall not be. "Well, but they want what
          they once found to be a good thing; they want health -- is not that a
          good thing? It was a good thing to them when they had it before, yet
          they want health; does not that go against the text?" No, it does not
          in any way whatever. The text means this, that anything which is
          absolutely good for him, all circumstances being considered, no child
          of God shall ever want. I met with this statement in a work by that
          good old Puritan, Mr. Clarkson, which stuck by me when I read it some
          time ago. I think the words were these, "If it were a good thing for
          God's people for sin, Satan, sorrow, and affliction to be abolished,
          Christ would blot them out within five minutes, and if it were a good
          thing for the seeker of the Lord to have all the kingdoms of this
          world put at his feet and for him to be made a prince, Jesus would
          make him a prince before the sun rose again." If it were absolutely to
          him, all things being considered, a good thing, he must have it, for
          Christ would be sure to keep his word. He has said he shall not want
          it, and he would not let his child want it, whatever it might be, if
          it were really, absolutely, and in itself, all things considered, a
          good thing. Now, taking God's Word and walking by faith towards it,
          what a light it sheds on your history and mine! There are many things
          for which I wish, and which I sincerely think to be good, but I say at
          once, "If I have not got them, they are not good, for if they were
          good, good for me, and I am truly seeking God, I should have them: if
          they were good things, my heavenly Father would not deny them to me:
          he has said he would not, and I believe his pledged word." I think
          sometimes it would be a good thing for me if I had more talents, but
          if it were a good thing I should have more, I should have them. You
          think it were a good thing, if you were to have more money. Well, if
          he saw it to be good, you would have it. "Oh!" say you, "but it would
          have been a good thing if my poor mother had been spared to me: if she
          had been alive now, it would have been a good thing, and it would be a
          good thing certainly for us to be in the position I was five years ago
          before these terrible panic times came." Well, if it had been a good
          thing for you to have been there, you would have been there. "I don't
          see it." says one. Well, do not expect to see it, but believe it. We
          walk by faith, not by sight. But the text says so. It says not that
          every man shall have every good thing, but it does say that every man
          that seeks the Lord shall have every good thing. He shall not want any
          good thing, be it what it may. "Well, I doubt it," says one. Very
          well; I do not wonder that you do, for your father Adam doubted it,
          and that is how the whole race fell. Adam and Eve were In the garden,
          and they might have felt quite sure that their heavenly Father would
          not deny them any good thing, but the devil came and whispered, and
          said to them, "God doth know that in the day you eat of the fruit of
          that tree you will be as gods; that fruit is very good for you, a
          wonderfully good thing; never anything like it, and that one good
          thing God has kept away from you." "Oh!" said Eve, "then I will get
          it," and down we all fell. The race was ruined through their doubting
          the promise. If they had continued to seek the Lord, they would not
          have wanted any good thing. That fruit was not a good thing to them;
          it might have been good in itself, but it was not good to them, or
          else God would have given it to them, and their doubting it brought
          all this terrible sorrow on us. So it will upon you, for let me show
          you -- you say, perhaps, "It would be a very good thing for me to be
          rich." God has stopped you up many times. You have never prospered
          when you thought you were going to. You will put out your hand,
          perhaps, to do a wrong thing to be rich, but if you say, "No, I will
          work, and toil, and do what I can, but if I am not prospered, it is
          not a good thing for me to be prospered, and I would not do a wrong
          thing, if it would bring me all the prosperity that heart could
          desire," then you will walk uprightly and God will bless you; but if
          you begin to doubt it and say, "That is a good thing, and my heavenly
          Father does not give it to me," you will, first of all, get hard and
          bitter thoughts against your heavenly Father, and then you will get
          wicked thoughts and wrong desires, and these will lead you to do wrong
          things, and God's name will be greatly dishonoured thereby. How do you
          know what is a good thing for you? "Oh! I know," says one. That is
          just what your child said last Christmas. He was sure it was a good
          thing for him to have all those sweets: he thought you very hard that
          you denied them to him, and yet you knew better. You had seen him
          before so made ill through those very things he now longed for. And
          your heavenly Father knows, perhaps, that you could not bear to be
          strong in body; you would never be holy if you had too robust health.
          He knows you could not endure to be wealthy: you would be proud, vain,
          perhaps wicked: you do not know how bad you might be if you had this,
          perhaps. He has put you in the best place for you. He has given you
          not only some of the things that are good for you, but all that is
          good for you, and there is nothing in the world that is really,
          solidly, abidingly good for you, but you either have it now, or you
          shall have it ere long. God your Father is dealing with you in perfect
          wisdom and perfect love, and though your reason may begin to cavil and
          question, yet, your faith should sit still at his feet, and say "I
          believe it; I believe it, even though my heart is wrung with sorrow; I
          am a seeker of God; I do seek his glory, and I shall not want any good
          thing."

          Methinks someone in the congregation might say to me, "Look at the
          martyrs; did not they seek the Lord above all men?" Truly so, but what
          were you about to object? "Why, that they wanted many good things;
          they were in prison, sometimes in cold, and nakedness, and hunger;
          they were on the rack tormented, many of them went to heaven from the
          fiery stake." Yes, but they never wanted any good thing. It would not
          have been a good thing to them as God's martyrs to have suffered less,
          for now read their history. The more they suffered, the brighter they
          shine. Rob them of their sufferings, and you strip their crowns of
          their gems. Who are the brightest before the eternal throne? Those who
          suffered most below. lf their could speak to you now, they would tell
          you that that noisome dungeon was, because it enabled them to glorify
          God, a good thing to them. They would tell you that the rack whereon
          they did sing sweet hymns of praise was a good thing for them, because
          it enabled them to show forth the patience of the saints, and to have
          their names written in the book of the peerage of the skies. They
          would tell you that the fiery stake was a good thing, because from
          that pulpit they preached Christ after such a fashion as men could
          never have heard it from cold lips and stammering tongues. Did not the
          world perceive that the suffering of the saints were good things, for
          they were the seed of the Church? They helped to spread the truth, and
          because God would not deny them any good thing he gave them their
          dungeons, he gave them their racks, he gave them their stakes, and
          these were the best things they could have had, and with enlarged
          reason, and with their mental faculties purged, those blessed spirits
          would now choose again, could they live over again, to have suffered
          those things. They would choose, were it possible, to have lived the
          very life, and to have endured all they braved, to have received so
          glorious a reward as they now enjoy.

          "Ah! well, then," says one, "I see I really have not understood a
          great deal that has happened to me: I have been in obscurity, lost my
          friends, been despised, felt quite broken down; do you mean to tell me
          that that has been a good thing?" I do. God has blessed it to you. He
          will enable you to say, "Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now
          have I kept thy law." And if you get more grace, you will say it is a
          good thing, for is it not a good thing for you to be conformed to the
          likeness of Christ? How can you be if you have no suffering? If you
          never suffer with him, how can you expect to reign with him? How are
          you to be made like him in his humiliation, if you never are humbled?
          Why, methinks every pain that shoots through the frame and thrills the
          sensitive soul helps us to understand what Christ suffered, and being
          sanctified, gives us the power to pass through the rent veil, and to
          be baptized with his baptism, and in our measure to drink of his cup,
          and, therefore, it becomes a good thing, and our Father gives it us,
          because his promise is that he will not deny or withhold any good
          thing from those that walk uprightly.

          I feel, brethren, as though my text were too full for me to go on with
          it, there is such a mass in it, and if you will take it home and turn
          it over at your leisure, you may do with it better than I can, if I
          attempt wire-drawing and word-spinning. There is the text. It seems to
          me to speak as plainly as the English tongue can speak. Give
          yourselves up to God wholly and live for him, and you shall never want
          anything that is really good for you; your life shall be the best life
          for you, all things considered in the light of eternity, that a life
          could have been. Only mind you keep to this -- the seeking of the
          Lord. There is the point of it. Get out of that, and there may be some
          promise for you, but certainly not this one. You have got out of the
          line of the promise; but keep to that and seek the Lord, and your life
          shall be, even if it be a poverty-stricken one, such a life that if
          you could have the infinite intelligence of your heavenly Father, you
          would ordain it to be precisely as it now is. "They that seek the Lord
          shall not want any good thing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, how rich this makes the poor! How content this makes the
          suffering! How grateful this makes the afflicted! How does it make our
          present state to glow with an unearthly glory! But, brethren, we shall
          never understand this text fully this side of heaven. There we shall
          see it in splendour. They that seek the Lord here shall have up yonder
          all that imagination can picture, all that fancy could conceive, all
          that desire could create. You shall have more than eye hath seen, or
          ear hath ever heard. You shall have capacities to receive of the
          divine fulness, and the fulness of the pleasures that are with God for
          evermore shall be yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again I come back to that, are you seeking the Lord? That is a
          question I have asked my own heart many and many a time -- Do I seek
          the Lord's glory in all things? I ask it of you, you young men who are
          starting in business. Now, you know you can if you like go into
          business for yourselves; I mean you can make your trade tell for
          yourselves, and live to yourselves, and the end will be miserable, and
          the way to it will not be happy. But if God's Spirit shall help you
          young men and women early in life to give your hearts to Jesus, and to
          say, "Now, God has made us, we will serve him that made us; Christ has
          bought us, we will serve him that bought us; the Spirit of God has
          given us a new life, we will live for this new and quickening Spirit"
          -- then I do not stand here to promise you ease and comfort, for in
          the world you shall have tribulation, but I do say in God's name that
          he will not withhold one good thing from you, and that when you come
          to be with him for ever and ever you will bless him that he did for
          you the best that could be done even by infinite wisdom and infinite
          love. You shall have the best life that could be lived, the best
          mercies that could be given, and the best of all good things shall be
          yours here and hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be some here, however, who have long passed the days of
          youth, and up till now have never had a thought of their Maker. The ox
          knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib, but they have not
          known God. If you keep a dog, he fawns on you, and follows at your
          heels. There is scarcely any creature so ignorant but what it knows
          its keeper. Go to the Zoological Gardens and see if those animals that
          are most deficient in brain are not still obedient to those that feed
          them. Yet here is God, good and kind to a man like you, and you have
          lived to be forty, and have never had an idea of loving and serving
          God. Are you lower sunk than the brutes? Think of that! But Jesus
          Christ came into the world to save sinners such as you. Repent! May
          God's Eternal Spirit lead you to repentance of this great sin of
          having lived in neglect of God, and from henceforth, seeking pardon
          for the past through the atoning sacrifice, and strength for the
          future through the Divine Spirit, seek the Lord, and you shall find
          that you shall not want any good thing. The Lord bring you there, and
          save and bless you eternally! Amen.<br />
