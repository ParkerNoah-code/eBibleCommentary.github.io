          And the church of the Corinthians continued in the orthodox faith up
          to the time when Primus was bishop in Corinth. I had some intercourse
          with these brethren on my voyage to Rome, when I spent several days
          with the Corinthians, during which we were mutually refreshed by the
          orthodox faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my arrival at Rome, I drew up a list of the succession of bishops
          down to Anicetus, whose deacon was Eleutherus. To Anicetus succeeded
          Soter, and after him came Eleutherus. But in the case of every
          succession, and in every city, the state of affairs is in accordance
          with the teaching of the Law and of the Prophets and of the Lord....
        </p>
        <p>
          And after James the Just had suffered martyrdom, as had the Lord also
          and on the same account, again Symeon the son of Clopas, descended
          from the Lord's uncle, is made bishop, his election being promoted by
          all as being a kinsman of the Lord.
        </p>

          Therefore was the Church called a virgin, for she was not as yet
          corrupted by worthless teaching. Thebulis it was who, displeased
          because he was not made bishop, first began to corrupt her by stealth.
          He too was connected with the seven sects which existed among the
          people, like Simon, from whom come the Simoniani; and Cleobius, from
          whom come the Cleobiani; and Doritheus, from whom come the Dorithiani;
          and Gorthæus, from whom come the Gortheani; Masbothæus, from whom come
          the Masbothæi. From these men also come the Menandrianists, and the
          Marcionists, and the Carpocratians, and the Valentinians, and the
          Basilidians, and the Saturnilians. Each of these leaders in his own
          private and distinct capacity brought in his own private opinion. From
          these have come false Christs, false prophets, false apostles -- men
          who have split up the one Church into parts through their corrupting
          doctrines, uttered in disparagement of God and of His Christ....
        </p>
        <p>
          There were, moreover, various opinions in the matter of circumcision
          among the children of Israel, held by those who were opposed to the
          tribe of Judah and to Christ: such as the Essenes, the Galileans, the
          Hemerobaptists, the Masbothæi, the Samaritans, the Sadducees, the
          Pharisees.
