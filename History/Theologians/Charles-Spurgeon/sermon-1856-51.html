        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.105</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 30, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God." -- 2 Chron.33:13.</p>
        <p>
          MANASSEH is one of the most remarkable characters whose history is
          written in the sacred pages. We are accustomed to mention his name in
          the list of those who greatly sinned, and yet found great mercy. Side
          by side with Saul of Tarsus, with that great sinner who washed the
          feet of Jesus with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her
          head, and with the thief that died upon the cross -- a forgiven sinner
          at the eleventh hour -- we are wont to write the name of Manasseh, who
          "shed innocent blood very much," and notwithstanding that, was
          forgiven and pardoned, finding mercy through the blood of a Saviour
          who had not then died, but whom God foresaw should die, and the merits
          of whose sacrifice he therefore imputed to so great a transgressor as
          Manasseh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without preface we shall enter on the history of Manasseh this
          morning, and consider him in a threefold light: first, as a sinner,
          then as an unbeliever, and thirdly, as a convert. It may be there
          shall be some Manasseh within these walls now; and if in describing
          the case of this ancient king of Israel I shall in some degree
          describe him, I trust he will take to himself the same consoling
          truths which were the means of the comfort of Manasseh when in the
          dungeon of repentance.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, we shall consider MANASSEH IN HIS SIN.</p>
        <p>
          1. And we note, first, that he belonged to that class of sinners who
          stand first in the phalanx of evil -- namely, those who sin against
          great light, against a pious education and early training. Manasseh
          was the son of Hezekiah, a man who had some faults, but of whom it is
          nevertheless said, "He did right in the sight of the Lord." To a great
          degree he walked before God with a perfect heart, even as did David
          his father. We can not suppose that he neglected the education of his
          son Manasseh. He was the son of his old age. You will remember that at
          a time of heavy sickness God promised him that he should have his life
          prolonged fifteen years. Three years after that event Manasseh was
          born, and he was, therefore, only twelve years old when his father
          died; still he was old enough to remember the pious prayers of a
          father and a mother, and had arrived at sufficient maturity to
          understand right from wrong, and to have received those early
          impressions which we believe are, in most cases, eminently useful for
          after life. And yet Manasseh pulled down what his father had built up,
          and built up the idol temples which his father had pulled down. Now,
          it is a notorious fact, that men who do go wrong after a good
          training, are the worst men in the world. You may not know, but it is
          a fact, that the late lamented murder of Williams at Erromanga, was
          brought about by the evil doings of a trader who bad gone to the
          island, and who was also the son of a missionary. He had become
          reckless in his habits, and treated the islanders with such barbarity
          and cruelty, that they revenged his conduct upon the next white man
          who put his foot on their shore; and the beloved Williams, one of the
          last of the martyrs, died a victim of the guilt of those who had gone
          before him. The worst of men are those who, having much light, still
          run astray. You shall find among the greatest champions of the camp of
          hell, men who were brought up and educated in our very ranks. It is
          not necessary that I should mention names; but any of you that are
          acquainted with those who are the leaders of infidelity at the present
          time will at once recognize the fact. And such men actually make the
          very worst of infidels; while the best of Christians often come from
          the very worst of sinners. Our John Bunyans have come from the
          pot-house and the taproom, from the bowling-alley, or places lower in
          the scale; our best of men have come from the very worst of places,
          and have been the best adapted to reclaim sinners, because they
          themselves had stepped into the kennel, and had nevertheless been
          washed in a Saviour's cleansing blood. And so it is true that the
          worst of the enemies of Christ are those who are nourished in our
          midst, and like the viper of old, which the husbandman nursed in his
          bosom, turn round to sting the bosom which has nurtured them. Such a
          one was Manasseh.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the next place, Manasseh as a sinner was a very bold one. He was
          one of those men who do not sin covertly, but who, when they
          transgress, do not seem to be at all ashamed, who are born with brazen
          foreheads, and lift their faces to heaven with insolence and
          impudence. He was a man who, if he would set up an idol, as you would
          see by reading this chapter, did not set it up in an obscure part of
          the land, but put it in the very temple of God; and when he would
          desecrate the name of the Most High, he did not privily go to his
          chapel, where he might worship some evil deity, but he put the deity
          into the very temple itself, as if to insult God to his very face. He
          was a desperado in sin, and went to the utmost limit of it, being very
          bold, and desperately set on mischief. Now, whether it be for right or
          wrong, boldness is always sure to win the day. Give me a coward -- you
          give me nothing; give me a bold man, and you give me one that can do
          something, whether for Christ's cause or for the devil's. Manasseh was
          a man of this kind. If he cursed God, it was with a loud voice; it was
          not in hole or corner, but upon his throne, that he issued
          proclamations against the Most High, and in the most daring manner
          insulted the Lord God of Israel. And yet, dear friends, this man was
          saved, notwithstanding all this. This greatest sinner, this man who
          had trampled on his father's prayers, who had wiped from his brow the
          tears which bad been shed there by an anxious parent, who had stifled
          the convictions of his conscience, and had gone to an extremity of
          guilt, in bold, open, and desperate sin, yet this man was at last, by
          divine grace, humbled and brought on his knees to acknowledge that God
          was God alone. Let no man, therefore, despair of his fellow. I never
          do, since I think and hope that God has saved me. I am persuaded that,
          live as long as I may, I shall never see the individual of whom I can
          say "That man is a hopeless case" I may peradventure meet with the
          person who has been so exhorted and so warned, and has so put off all
          the sweet wooings of his conscience, that he has become seared and
          hardened, and consequently apparently hopeless; but I shall never meet
          a man who has sinned so desperately that I can say of him he never can
          be saved. Ah! no; that arm of mercy which was long enough to save me
          is long enough to save you; and if he could redeem you from your
          transgression, assuredly there are none sunk lower than you were, and
          therefore you may believe that his arm of mercy can reach them. Above
          all, let no man despair of himself. Whilst there is life there is
          hope. Give not up yourselves into Satan's arms. He tells you that your
          death-warrant is sealed, that your doom is cast, and that you never
          can be saved. Tell him to his face that he is a liar, for that Jesus
          Christ "is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by
          him, seeing that he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, Manasseh was a sinner of that peculiar caste which we
          suspect is not to be found very frequently. He was one of those who
          had the power of leading others to a very large extent astray from the
          truth and religion of God. He was a king, and had, therefore, great
          influence; what he commanded was done. Among the rank of idolaters
          Manasseh stood first, and it was the song and glory of the false
          priests that the king of Judah was on the side of the gods of the
          heathen. He was the leader -- the first man in the battle. When the
          troops of the ungodly went to war against the God of the whole earth,
          Manasseh led the vanguard and cheered them on. He was their great
          Goliath, challenging all the armies of the living God. Many among the
          wicked stood back and feared the conflict; but be never feared. "He
          spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast;" and therefore
          he was bold and arrogant in leading others astray. There are some such
          still alive -- men not content with treading the broad road
          themselves, but seeking to entice others into it. And O, how active
          they are in their efforts! They will go from house to house, and
          distribute those publications which are impure and polluting; they
          will stand in our streets and endeavor to draw around them the young,
          ay, men and women just fresh come from the house of God, or going to
          God's sanctuary, to tell them that dreary story that there is no God,
          or the dismal falsehood that there is no future, but that we must all
          die like dogs and suffer annihilation. There are some such who never
          seem to be happy unless when they are leading others astray. It is not
          enough for them to go alone against God, but they must sin in company.
          Like the woman in the Proverbs, they hunt for precious life, and like
          hounds thirsting for blood, they are seeking after men to destroy
          them. Society now is like Prometheus: it is, to a great extent, bound
          hand and foot by the very customs that surround it, and like
          Prometheus, we have upon us the winged hound of hell perpetually
          tapping at our heart and swallowing the life-blood of our spirit. I
          mean we have that accursed infidelity which seeks to lead men from God
          and drive them from their Maker. But, nevertheless, leaders among them
          have yet been saved. Manasseh, the leader of those who hated God, was
          yet humbled, and made to love the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you ask me whether such cases ever occur now? I answer, yes they
          do; too rarely, but they do happen. Yesterday I received something
          which cheered my heart very much, and made me bless my God, that
          notwithstanding all opposition, he had still made me of some little
          use in the world. I received a long letter from a certain city, from
          one who has been one of the leaders of the secular society in that
          place. The writer says, "I purchased one of the pamphlets entitled Who
          is this Spurgeon?' and also your portrait (or a portrait sold as
          yours) for 3d. I brought these home, and exhibited them in my shop
          window. I was induced to do so from a feeling of derisive pleasure.
          The title of the pamphlet is, naturally, suggestive of caricature, and
          it was especially to incite that impression that I attached it to your
          portrait and placed it in my window. But I also had another object in
          view. I thought by its attraction to improve my trade. I am not at all
          in the book or paper business, which rendered its exposure and my
          motive the more conspicuous. I have taken it down now: I am taken down
          too. * * * I had bought one of your sermons of an old infidel a day or
          two previous. In that sermon I read these words: -- 'They go on; that
          step is safe -- they take it; the next is safe -- they take it; their
          foot hangs over a gulf of darkness.' I read on, but the word darkness
          staggered me. It was all dark with, me. True, the way has been safe so
          far, but I am lost in bewilderment. No, no, no, I will not risk it.' I
          left the apartment in which I had been musing, and as I did so, the
          three words, Who can tell?' seemed to be whispered at my heart. I
          determined not to let another Sunday pass without visiting a place of
          worship. How soon my soul might be required of me I knew not, but felt
          that it would be mean, base, cowardly, not to give it a chance. Ay, my
          associates may laugh, scoff, deride, call me coward, turncoat, I will
          do an act of justice to my soul. I went to the chapel; I was just
          stupefied with awe. What could I want there? The door keeper opened
          his eyes wider, and involuntarily demanded, It's Mr. -- isn't it ?'
          Yes,' I said, it is.' He conducted me to a seat, and afterward brought
          me a hymn-book. I was fit to burst with anguish. Now,' I thought, I am
          here, if it be the house of God, heaven grant me an audience, and I
          will make full surrender. O God, show me some token by which I may
          know that thou art, and that thou wilt in no wise cast out the vile
          deserter who has ventured to seek thy face and thy pardoning mercy.' I
          opened the hymn-book to divert my mind from feelings that were rending
          me, and the first words that caught my eyes were
        </p>
        <p>"Dark, dark indeed the grave would be,</p>
        <p>Had we no light O God, from thee.'"</p>
        <p>
          After giving some things which he looks upon as evidences that he is a
          true convert of religion, he closes up by saying, "O sir, tell this to
          the poor wretch whose pride, like mine, has made him league with hell;
          tell it to the hesitating and to the timid; tell it to the cooling
          Christian, that God is a very present help to all that are in need.
          Think of the poor sinner who may never look upon you in this world,
          but who will live to bless and pray for you here, and long to meet you
          in the world exempt from sinful doubts, from human pride, and
          backsliding hearts." Ah, he need not ask my forgiveness; I am happy,
          too happy, in the hope of calling him " brother" in the Christian
          church. This letter is from a place many miles from this city and from
          a man who had no small standing among the ranks of those who hate
          Christ. Ah! there have been Manassehs saved, and there shall be yet.
          There have been men who hated God, who have leaped for joy, and said
          --
        </p>
        <p>"I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven,</p>
        <p>I'm a miracle of grace,"</p>
        <p>
          and have kissed the very feet which once they scorned and scoffed, and
          could not bear to hear the mention of.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one fact concerning Manasseh which stamps him as being a very
          prince of sinners, namely this : "He caused his children to pass
          through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom," and dedicated
          his sons unto Tophet. This was a dreadful sin; for though Manasseh
          repented, we find that his son Amon followed in the steps of his
          father in his wickedness but not in his righteousness. Listen! "Amon
          was two-and-twenty years old when be began to reign, and reigned two
          years in Jerusalem. But he did that which was evil in the sight of the
          Lord, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
          carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; and
          humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had
          humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more." Children will
          imitate their fathers in their vices, seldom in their repentance; if
          parents sin, their children will follow them, without much doubt; but
          when they repent and turn to God, it is not easy to lead a child back
          in the way which it has once forsaken. Are there any here, who, like
          that ancient Carthaginian, have dedicated their sons to the opposition
          of their enemy. You remember one who dedicated his son Hannibal from
          his very birth to be the everlasting enemy of the Romans. There may be
          such a man here, who has dedicated his offspring to Satan, to be the
          everlasting enemy of Christ's gospel, and is trying to train up and
          tutor him in a way which is contrary to the fear of the Lord. Is such
          a man hopeless? His sin is dreadful, his state is dreary, his sin
          without repentance will assuredly damn him; but so long as he is here,
          we still will preach repentance to him, knowing that Manasseh was
          brought to know God, and was forgiven all his manifold sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second aspect in which we are to regard Manasseh is as an
          UNBELIEVER; for it appears that Manasseh did not believe that Jehovah
          was God alone; he was, therefore, a believer in false gods, but an
          unbeliever, so far as the truth is concerned. Now, does it not strike
          you at the outset, that while Manasseh was an unbeliever in the truth,
          he must have been a very credulous person to believe in the all
          imaginary deities of the heathen? In fact, the most credulous persons
          in the world are unbelievers. It takes ten thousand times more faith
          to be an unbeliever than to be a believer in revelation. One man comes
          to me and tells me I am credulous, because I believe in a great First
          Cause who created the heavens and the earth, and that God became man
          and died for sin. I tell him I may be, and no doubt am very credulous,
          as he conceives credulity, but I conceive that which I believe is in
          perfect consistency with my reason, and I therefore receive it. "But,"
          saith he, "I am not credulous -- not at all." Sir, I say, I should
          like to ask you one thing. You do not believe the world was created by
          God? "No." You must be amazingly credulous, then, I am sure. Do you
          think this Bible exists without being made? If you should say I am
          credulous because I believe it had a printer and a binder, I should
          say you were infinitely more credulous, if you assured me that it was
          made at all. And should you begin to tell me one of your theories
          about creation -- that atoms floated through space, and came to a
          certain shape, I should resign the palm of credulity to you. You
          believe, perhaps, moreover, that man came to be in this world through
          the improvement of certain creatures. I have read, you say, that there
          were certain monads -- that these monads improved themselves until
          they came to be small animalculae -- that afterward they grew into
          fishes -- that these fishes wanted to fly, and then wings grow -- that
          by-and-by they wanted to crawl, and then legs came, and they became
          lizards, and by divers steps they then became monkeys, and then the
          monkeys became men, and you believe yourself to be cousin-german to an
          ourang-outang. Now, I may be very credulous, but really not so
          credulous as you are. I may believe very strange things; I may believe
          that, with the jaw-bone of an ass, Samson slew a thousand men; I may
          believe that that the earth was drowned with water, and many other
          strange things, as you call them; but as for your creed, your
          non-creed, "tis strange, tis passing strange, tis wonderful," and it
          as much outvies mine in credulity, if I be credulous, as an ocean
          outvies a drop. It requires the hardest faith in the world to deny the
          Scriptures, because the man, in his secret heart, knows they are true,
          and, go where he will, something whispers to him, "You may be wrong --
          perhaps you are," and it is as much as he can do, to say, "Lie down,
          conscience! down with you; I must not let you speak, or I could not
          deliver my lecture to-morrow, I could not go among my friends, I could
          not go to such-and-such a club; for I can not afford to keep a
          conscience, if I can not afford to keep a God."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let me tell you what I conceive to be the reasons why Manasseh
          was an unbeliever. In the first place, I conceive that the unlimited
          power which Manasseh possessed had a very great tendency to make him a
          disbeliever in God. I should not wonder if an autocrats man with
          absolute dominion, should deny God; I should think it only natural.
          You remember that memorable speech of Napoleon's. He was told that man
          proposed, but that God disposed. "Ah!" said Napoleon, "I propose and
          dispose too;" and therein he arrogated to himself the very supremacy
          of God. We do not wonder at it, because his victories had so speedily
          succeeded each other, his prowess had been so complete, his fame so
          great, and his power over his subjects so absolute. Power al -- ways,
          as I believe, except in the heart which is rightly governed by grace,
          has a tendency to lead us to deny God. It is that noble intellect of
          such-and-such a man which has led him into discussion; he has twice,
          thrice, four, five, six, seven times, come off more than conqueror in
          the field of controversy; he looks round and says, "I am, there is
          none beside me; let me sake up whatever I please, I can defend it;
          there is no man can stand against the blade of my intellect; I can
          give him such a home thrust as will assuredly overcome him;" and then,
          like Dr. Johnson, who often took up the side of the question he did
          not believe, just because he liked to get a victory that was hard to
          win, so do these men espouse what they believe to be wrong, because
          they conceive it gives them the finest opportunity of displaying their
          abilities. "Let me," says some mighty intellect, "fight with a
          Christian; I shall have hard enough work to prove my thesis, I know I
          shall have a great difficulty to undermine the bastions of truth which
          he opposes to bear against me; so much the better; it were worth while
          to be conquered by so stout an opposition and if I can overcome my
          antagonist, if I can prove myself to have more logic than he has, then
          I can say, tis glorious; tis glorious to have fought against an
          opponent with so much on his side, and yet to have come off more than
          conqueror." I do believe the best man in the world is very hard to be
          trusted with power; he will, unless grace keeps him, make a wrong use
          of it before long. Hence it is that the most influential of God's
          servants are almost invariably the most tried ones, because our
          heavenly Father knows that if it were not for great trials and
          afflictions we should begin to set ourselves up against him, and
          arrogate to ourselves a glory which we had no right to claim.

          But another reason why Manasseh was an unbeliever, I take it, was
          because he was proud. Pride lieth at the root of infidelity; pride is
          the very germ of opposition to God. The man saith, " Why should I
          believe? The Sunday-school child reads his Bible, and says it is true.
          Am I, a man of intellect, to sit side by side with him, and receive a
          thing as true simply at the dictum of God's Word? No, I will not; I
          will find it out for myself, and I will not believe simply because it
          is revealed to me, for that were to make myself a child." And when he
          turns to the page of revelation, and reads thus, " Except ye be
          converted and become as little children, ye can in nowise enter into
          the kingdom of heaven," he says, " Pshaw! I shall not be converted
          then; I am not going to be a child; I am a man, and a man I will be,
          and I would rather be lost a man than saved a child. What I am I to
          surrender my judgment, and sit down tacitly to believe in God's Word?"
          " Yes," says God's Word, "thou art; thou art to become as a child, and
          meekly to receive my Word." "Then," says he, in his arrogance and
          pride, "I will not," and like Satan, he declares it were better to
          rule in hell than serve in heaven, and he goes away an unbeliever,
          because to believe is too humbling a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps the most potent reason for Manasseh's unbelief lies here;
          that he loved sin too well. When Manasseh built the altars for his
          false gods, he could sin easily, and keep his conscience; but he felt
          Jehovah's laws so stringent, that if he once believed in the one God
          he could not sin as he did. He read it thus: "Remember the Sabbath-day
          to keep it holy; thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal;" and so
          on. Manasseh wanted to do all these things, and therefore he would not
          believe because he could not believe and keep his sin. The very reason
          why we have much unbelief is because we have much love of sin. Men
          will have no God, because God interferes with their lusts. They could
          not go on in their sins, if they once believed there was an
          everlasting God above them, or professed to believe it, for all do
          believe it, whether they say so or not; and because the thought of God
          checks them in their impiety and their lust, therefore they cry out,
          "There is no God," and say it with their lips as well as in their
          hearts. I believe it was this that led Manasseh to persecute the
          saints of God; for among his sins it is written, " he shed innocent
          blood very much." It is a tradition among the Jews that the prophet
          Isaiah was sawn in sunder by Manasseh, on account of a rebuke which he
          gave him for his sin. Isaiah was not wont to be very timid, and he
          told the king of his lusts, and therefore placing him between two
          planks, he cut him in sunder from head to foot. It is just the reason
          why men hate God, and bate his servants, because the truth is too hot
          for them. Send you a preacher who would not tell you of your sins and
          you would hear him peaceably; but when the gospel comes with power,
          then it is that men can not bear it; when it trenches upon that
          pleasure, that sin, or that lust, then they will not believe it. Ye
          would believe the gospel if ye could believe it and live in your sins
          too. O! how many a drunken reprobate would be a Christian, if he might
          be a drunkard and a Christian too! How many a wicked wretch would turn
          believer, if he might believe and yet go on in his sins! But because
          faith in the everlasting God can never stand side by side with sin,
          and because the gospel cries, "Down with it! down with it! down with
          your sin," therefore it is that men turn round and say, "Down with the
          gospel." It is too hot for you, O ye sinful generation; therefore ye
          turn aside from it, because it will not tolerate your lusts, nor
          indulge your iniquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We look, then, at Manasseh as an unbeliever, and now we have our
          last most pleasing task of looking at Manasseh as A CONVERT. Hear it,
          O heavens, and listen, O earth! The Lord God hath said it. Manasseh
          shall be saved. He on his throne of cruelty has just appended his name
          to another murderous edict against the saints of God; yet he shall be
          humbled; he shall ask for mercy and shall be saved. Manasseh hears the
          decree of God; he laughs. "What! I play the hypocrite, and bend my
          knee? Never! It is not possible; and when the godly hear of it, they
          all say, It is not possible.' What! Saul among the prophets? Manasseh
          regenerated ? Manasseh made to bow before the Most High? The thing is
          impossible." Ah! it is impossible with man, but it is possible with
          God; God knows how to do it. The enemy is at the gates of the city; a
          hostile king has just besieged the walls of Jerusalem; Manasseh flees
          from his palace and hides himself among the thorns; he is there taken,
          carried captive to Babylon, and shut up in prison. And now we see what
          God can do. The proud king is proud no longer, for he has lost his
          power; the mighty man is mighty no more, for his might is taken from
          him; and now in a low dungeon listen to him. It is no more the
          blasphemer, no more the hater of God; but see him cold on the floor!
          Manasseh bows his knee, and with the tears rolling down his cheeks, he
          cries, "O God! my father's God! an outcast comes to thee; a hell-hound
          stained with blood throws himself at thy feet; I, a very demon, full
          of filthiness, now prostrate myself before thee! O my God, canst thou,
          wilt thou have mercy on such a wretch as I?" Hear it, ye heavens!
          Listen yet again. See, from the skies the angel flies with mercy in
          his hand. Ah! whither speeds he? It is to the dungeon of Babylon. The
          proud king is on his knee, and mercy comes and whispers in his ear --
          "Hope!" He starts from his knees, and cries, "Is there hope?" And down
          he falls again. Once more he pleads, and mercy whispers that sweet
          promise, uttered once by the murdered Isaiah -- "I, even I, am he that
          blotteth out thy transgressions for my name's sake, and will not
          remember thy sins." O! do you see him? His very heart is running over
          in his eyes. O! how he weeps for joy, and yet for sorrow that he ever
          could have sinned against a God so kind. A moment more, and the
          dungeon is opened; the king of Babylon, moved by God, bids him go
          free, and he returns to his kingdom and throne, a happier and a better
          man than he had ever been before. I think I see him coming into
          Jerusalem. There are his statesmen and favorites, crying to him, "Come
          in, Manasseh; the bowl shall be filled, and we will have a merry night
          to-night; we will bow before the shrine of Ashtaroth, and thank her
          that she has set thee at liberty; lo, the horses of the sun are ready;
          come and pay thy devotions to him that shines on the earth, and leads
          the host of heaven!" Methinks I see their astonishment when he cries,
          " Stand back! stand back! ye are my friends no longer, until ye become
          God's friends; I have dandled you on my knees, and, vipers, you have
          stung me with the poison of asps; I made you my friends, and you have
          led me down to the gulf of hell. But I know it now. Stand back till ye
          are better men; and I will find others to be my courtiers." And there
          the poor saints, hidden in the back streets of the city, so frightened
          because the king has come back, are holding meetings of solemn prayer,
          crying unto God that no more murderous, persecuting edicts might go
          forth. And lo, a messenger comes and says? "The king is returned;" and
          while they are looking at him, wondering what the messenger is about
          to say, he adds, "He has returned, not Manasseh as he went, but as a
          very angel. I saw him with his own hands dash Ashtaroth in pieces; I
          heard him cry, The horses of the sun shall be hoofed; sweep out the
          house of God; we will hold a passover there; the morning and evening
          lamb shall again burn on Jehovah's altars, for he is God, and beside
          him there is none else.'" O! can you conceive the joy of believers on
          that auspicious day? Can you think how they went up to God's house
          with joy and thanksgiving? And on the next Sabbath they sung, as they
          had -- never sung before, "O come let us sing unto the Lord, let us
          make a joyful noise unto the rock of our salvation," while they
          remembered that he who had persecuted the saints of God aforetime, now
          defended that very truth which once he abhorred. There was joy on
          earth, ay, and there was joy in heaven too; the bells of heaven rang
          merry peals the day Manasseh prayed; the angels of heaven flapped
          their wings with double alacrity the day Manasseh repented; earth and
          heaven were glad, and even the Almighty on his throne smiled gracious
          approbation, while he again said, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out
          thy transgressions for my name's sake, and will not remember thy
          sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now are you curious to know what were the bases of the faith of
          Manasseh -- what were the rocks on which he built his trust in God? I
          think they were two. He believed in God, first, because he had
          answered his prayer; and secondly, because he had forgiven his sin. I
          have sometimes said, when I have become the prey of doubting thoughts,
          "Well, now I dare not doubt whether there be a God, for I can look
          back in my diary and say, on such a day in the depths of trouble I
          bent my knee to God, and or ever I had risen from my knees the answer
          was given me." And so can many of you say; and therefore whatever
          others may say, you know there is a God, because he answered your
          prayer. You heard of that holy man, Mr. Müller, of Bristol. If you
          were to tell George Müller there was not a God, he would weep over
          you. "Not a God?" he would say; "why, I have seen his hand. Whence
          came those answers to my prayers?" Ah! sirs, ye may laugh at us for
          credulity; but there are hundreds here who could most solemnly assert
          that they have asked of God for divers matters, and that God has not
          failed them, but granted their request. This was one reason why
          Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other reason was, that Manasseh had a sense of pardoned sin. Ah!
          that is a delightful proof of the existence of a God. Here comes a
          poor miserable wretch: his knees are knocking together, his heart is
          sinking within him, be is giving himself up to despair. Bring the
          physicians to him! they cry, "We fear his mind is infirm. We believe
          he will at last have to be taken to some lunatic asylum;" and they
          apply their remedies, but he is none the better, but rather grows
          worse. On a sudden this poor creature, afflicted with a sense of sin,
          groaning on account of guilt, is brought within the sound of the
          sacred Word; he hears it -- it increases his misery; he hears again --
          his pain becomes doubled; till at last every one says his case is
          utterly hopeless. Suddenly, on a happy morning which God had ordained,
          the minister is led to some sweet passage. Perhaps it is this: "Come
          now, and let us reason together; though your sins be as scarlet, they
          shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be
          as wool." The Spirit applies it, and the poor man goes home light as
          air, and says to his wife and children, " Come rejoice with me." "Why
          ?" say they. "Because," says he, "my sins are forgiven.," "How do you
          know that?" "O!" says he, "I have a sense of pardoning love within my
          heart, which all the doubters in the world could not gainsay; and if
          all the earth should rise up against me and say I should be condemned,
          I could say, I know there is now no condemnation for me.'" Have you
          ever felt pardoning blood applied? You will never doubt God, I know,
          if you have. Why, dear friends, if the poorest old woman in the world
          should be brought before an infidel of the wisest order, having a mind
          of the greatest caliber, and he should endeavor to pervert her, I
          think I see her smile at him, and say, "My good man, it is of no use
          at all, for the Lord has appeared unto me of old, saying, Yea I have
          loved thee with an everlasting love,' and so you may tell me what you
          please: I have had a sense of blood-bought pardon shed abroad in my
          heart, and I know that he is God, and you can never beat it out of
          me." As good Watts says, when we have once such an assurance as that,
        </p>
        <p>"Should all the forms that men devise</p>
        <p>Assault my faith with treacherous art,</p>
        <p>I'd call them vanity and lies,</p>
        <p>And bind the gospel to my heart."</p>
        <p>
          O! if you have a sense that sin is forgiven, you can never doubt the
          existence of a God; for it will be said of you, "Then he knew that the
          Lord he was God."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I gather up my strength for just one moment, to speak to those
          of you who desire to know what you must do to be saved. My hearer, no
          question can be more important than that; none is so requisite to ask.
          Alas! there are too many who never ask it, but who go sailing down to
          the gulf of black despair, listening to the syren song of
          procrastination and delay. But, if you have been brought to ask the
          question solemnly and seriously, " What must I do to be saved ?" I am
          happy, thrice happy to be able to tell you God's own word, "He that
          believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ and is baptized, shall he saved; he
          that believeth not," the Scripture saith, "shall be damned." " Not of
          works, lest any man should boast." "But sir," you say, "I have many
          good works, and would trust in them." If you do, you are a lost man.
          As old Matthew Wilks most quaintly said once, speaking in his usual
          tone -- " You might as well try to sail to America in a paper boat, as
          to go to heaven by your own works; you will be swamped on the passage
          if you attempt it." We can not spin a robe that is long enough to
          cover us; we can not make a righteousness that is good enough to
          satisfy God. If you would be saved, it must be through what Christ
          did, and not what you did. You can not be your own Saviour; Christ
          must save you, if you are saved at all. How then can you be saved by
          Christ? Here is the plan of salvation. It is written -- " This is a
          faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
          into the world to save sinners." Do you feel that you are a sinner?
          Then believe that Jesus Christ came to save you; for so sure as ever
          you feel you are a sinner, it is a fact that Christ died for you; and
          if he died for you, you shall not perish, for I can not conceive that
          Christ would die in vain. If he did die for you, you shall most
          assuredly be pardoned and saved, and shall one day sing in heaven. The
          only question is, Did he die for you? He most certainly did if you are
          a sinner; for it is written -- I will repeat it again -- "It is a
          faithful saying, that Christ Jesus came to save sinners." Poor sinner,
          believe! My dear friend, give me thine hand! I wish I could put it
          inside Christ's hand. O! embrace him! embrace him! lest haply the
          clouds of night should come upon thee, and the sun should set ere thou
          hast found him, O! lay hold on him, lest death and destruction should
          overtake thee; fly to this mountain, lest thou be consumed, and
          remember, once in Christ, thou art safe beyond hazard.
        </p>
        <p>"Once in Christ in Christ for ever,</p>
        <p>Nothing from his love can sever."</p>
        <p>
          O! believe him! believe him, my dear, dear hearers for Jesus sake!
          Amen.
