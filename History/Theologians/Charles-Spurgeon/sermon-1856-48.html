        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.102</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, August 24, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
          weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end
          is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their
          shame, who mind earthly things." -- Philippians 3:18-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          PAUL was the very model of what a Christian minister should be. He was
          a watchful shepherd over the flock; he did not simply preach to them,
          and consider that he had done all his duty when he had delivered his
          message; but his eyes were always upon the Churches, marking their
          spiritual welfare, their growth in grace, or their declension in
          godliness. He was the unsleeping guardian of their spiritual welfare.
          When he was called away to other lands to proclaim the everlasting
          gospel, he seems always to have kept an eye upon those Christian
          colonies which he had founded in the midst of heathen darkness. While
          lighting up other lamps with the torch of truth, he did not fail to
          trim the lamps already burning. Here you observe he was not
          indifferent to the character of the little church at Philippi, for he
          speaks to them and warns them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, too, that the apostle was a very honest pastor -- when he marked
          anything amiss in his people, he did not blush to tell them; he was
          not like your modern minister, whose pride is that he never was
          personal in his life, and who thus glories in his shame, for had he
          been honest, he would have been personal, for he would have dealt out
          the truth of God without deceitfulness, and would have reproved men
          sharply, that they might be sound in the faith. "I tell you," says
          Paul, "because it concerns you." Paul was very honest; he did not
          flinch from telling the whole truth, and telling it often too, though
          some might think that once from the lip of Paul would be of more
          effect than a hundred times from any one else. "I have told you
          often," says he, "and I tell you yet again there are some who are the
          enemies of the cross of Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          And while faithful, you will notice that the apostle was, as every
          true minister should be, extremely affectionate. He could not bear to
          think that any of the members of the churches under his care should
          swerve from the truth, he wept while he denounced them; he knew not
          how to wield the thunderbolt with a tearless eye; he did not know how
          to pronounce the threatening of God with a dry and husky voice. No;
          while he spoke terrible things the tear was in his eye, and when he
          reproved sharply, his heart beat so high with love, that those who
          heard him denounce so solemnly, were yet convinced that his harshest
          words were dictated by affection. "I have told you often, and I tell
          you, even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I have a message to deliver to-night which is to the same
          effect as that of the Apostle Paul, and I am afraid it is as necessary
          now as it was in his time. There are many now among us, as there were
          then, who walk in such a manner that we recognise them at once as the
          "enemies of the cross of Christ." I do fear that the evil, instead of
          having decreased, has multiplied and grown in danger. We have more
          profession now than there was in the age of Paul, and consequently we
          have more hypocrisy. It is a crying sin with our churches that there
          are many in their midst who never ought to be there, who would be fit
          members of an ale-house or any favourite resort of the gay and
          frivolous, but who never ought to sip the sacramental wine or eat the
          holy bread, the emblems of the sufferings of our Lord. We have -- O
          Paul, how wouldst thou have said it to-night, and how wouldst thou
          have wept while saying it! -- we have many in our midst who are the
          "enemies of the cross of Christ," because "their God is their belly,
          they mind earthly things," and their life is not consistent with the
          great things of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavour, for a short time to-night, to tell you the reason
          of the apostle's extraordinary sorrow. I never read that the apostle
          wept when he was persecuted. Though they ploughed his back with
          furrows, I do believe that never a tear was seen to gush from his eye
          while the soldiers scourged him. Though he was cast into prison, we
          read of his singing, never of his groaning. I do not believe he ever
          wept on account of any sufferings or dangers to which he himself was
          exposed for Christ's sake. I call this an extraordinary sorrow,
          because the man who wept was no soft piece of sentiment, and seldom
          shed a tear even under grievous trials. He wept for three things: he
          wept on account of their guilt; on account of the ill effects of their
          conduct; and on account of their doom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, Paul wept on account of the GUILT of those persons who,
          having a name to live, were dead, and while uniting themselves with a
          Christian church, were not walking as they should do among men and
          before God. Notice the sin with which he charges them. He says, "Their
          God was their belly;" by this I understand that they were sensual
          persons. There were those in the early church who, after they sat at
          God's table, would go away and sit at the feasts of the heathen, and
          there indulge in gluttony and drunkenness; others indulged in lusts of
          the flesh, enjoying those pleasures (so miscalled) which, afterwards,
          bring unutterable pain even to the body itself, and are disgraceful to
          men, much more to professors of religion. Their God was their belly.
          They care more about the dress of their body than the dress of their
          soul; they regarded more the food of the outward carcass than the life
          of the inner man. Ah! my hearers; are there not many everywhere in our
          churches who still bow before their belly-god, and make themselves
          their own idols? Is it not notorious, in almost every society, that
          professing men can pamper themselves as much as others? -- I mean not
          all, but some. Ay, I have heard of drunken professors; not men who
          positively reel through the street, who are drunken in mid-day or
          intoxicated before their fellow-men, but men who go to the very verge
          of drunkenness in their social parties; men who take so much, that
          while it would be an insult to their respectability to call them
          intoxicated, it would be equally an insult to the truth to call them
          sober. Have we not some men in our churches (it is idle to deny it)
          who are as fond of the excesses of the table and surfeit in the good
          things of this life as any other class of men? Have we not persons who
          spend a very fortune upon the dress of their bodies, adorning
          themselves far more than they adorn the doctrine of their Saviour; men
          whose perpetual business it is to take good care of their bodies,
          against whom flesh and blood never had any cause to complain, for they
          not only serve the flesh, but make a god of it? Ah! sirs, the church
          is not pure; the church is not perfect; we have scabbed sheep in the
          flock. In our own little communion, now and then, we find them out,
          and then comes the dread sentence of excommunication, by which they
          are cut off from our fellowship; but there are many of whom we are not
          aware, who creep like snakes along the grass, and are not discovered
          till they inflict a grievous wound upon religion, and do damage to our
          great and glorious cause. Brethren, there are some in the church (both
          established and dissenting) -- let us say it with the deepest sorrow
          -- "whose god is their belly."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another of their sins was that they did mind earthly things. Beloved,
          the last sentence may not have touched your consciences, but this is a
          very sweeping assertion, and I am afraid that a very large proportion
          of Christ's church are verily guilty here. It is an anomaly, but it is
          a fact, that we hear of ambitious Christians, although Christ has told
          us that he who would be exalted must humble himself. There are among
          the professed followers of the humble Man of Galilee, men who strive
          to gain the topmost round of the ladder of this world; whose aim is,
          not to magnify Christ, but to magnify themselves at any hazard. It had
          been thought at one time that a Christian would be a holy, a humble,
          and contented man; but it is not so now-a-days. We have (Oh, shame, ye
          churches!) mere professors; men who are as worldly as the worldliest,
          and have no more of Christ's Holy Spirit in them than the most carnal
          who never made a profession of the truth. Again, it is a paradox, but
          it stares us in the face every day, that we have covetous Christians.
          It is an inconsistency. We might as well talk of unholy seraphim, of
          perfect beings subject to sin, as of covetous Christians; yet there
          are such men, whose purse strings were never intended to slide, at
          least at the cry of the poor; who call it prudence to amass wealth,
          and never use it in any degree in the cause of Christ. If you want men
          that are hard in business, that are grasping after wealth, that seize
          upon the poor debtor and suck the last particle of his blood; if you
          want the men who are grasping and grinding, that will skin the flint,
          and take away the very life from the orphan, you must come -- I blush
          to say it, but it is a solemn truth -- you must come sometimes to our
          churches to find them. Some such there are amongst the highest of her
          officers, who "mind earthly things," and have none of that devotion to
          Christ which is the mark of pure godliness. These evils are not the
          fruits of religion, they are the diseases of mere profession. I
          rejoice that the remnant of the elect are kept pure from these, but
          the "mixed multitude" are sadly possessed therewith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another character which the Apostle gives of these men is that they
          gloried in their shame. A professing sinner generally glories in his
          shame more than any one else. In fact, he miscalls it. He labels the
          devil's poisons with the names of Christ's medicines. Things that he
          would reckon vices in any other man are virtues with himself. If he
          could see in another man the selfsame action which he has just
          performed -- if another could be the looking-glass of himself, oh! how
          he would thunder at him! He is the very first man to notice a little
          inconsistency. He is the very strictest of Sabbatarians; he is the
          most upright of thieves; he is the most tremendously generous of
          misers; he is the most marvellously holy of profane men. While he can
          indulge in his favourite sin, he is for ever putting up his glass to
          his eye to magnify the faults of others. He may do as he pleases; he
          may sin with impunity; and if his minister should hint to him that his
          conduct is inconsistent, he will make a storm in the church, and say
          the minister was personal, and insulted him. Reproof is thrown away on
          him. Is he not a member of the church? Has he not been so for years?
          Who shall dare to say that he is unholy? O sirs, there are some of
          your members of churches who will one day be members of the pit. We
          have some united with our churches who has passed through baptism and
          sit at our sacramental tables, who, while they have a name to live,
          are dead as corpses in their graves as to anything spiritual. It is an
          easy thing to palm yourself off for a godly man now-a-days. There is
          little self-denial, little mortification of the flesh, little love to
          Christ wanted. Oh, no. Learn a few religious hymns; get a few cant
          phrases, and you will deceive the very elect; enter into the church,
          be called respectable, and if you cannot make all believe you, you
          will yet smooth your path to destruction by quieting an uneasy
          conscience. I am saying hard things, but I am saying true things; for
          my blood boils sometimes when I meet with men whom I would not own,
          whom I would not sit with anywhere, and who yet call me "brother."
          They can live in sin, and yet call a Christian "brother." God forgive
          them! We can feel no brotherhood with them; nor do we wish to do so
          until their lives are changed, and their conduct is made more
          consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, then, in the Apostle's days there were some who were a
          disgrace to godliness, and the Apostle wept over them because he knew
          their guilt. Why, it is guilt enough for a man to make a God of his
          belly without being a professor; but how much worse for a man who
          knows better, who even sets up to teach other people better, still to
          go on and sin against God and against his conscience, by making a
          solemn profession, which is found in his case to be a lie. Oh! how
          dreadful is such a man's guilt! For him to stand up and say,
        </p>
        <p>"Tis done; the great transaction's done.</p>
        <p>I am the Lord's, and he is mine,"</p>
        <p>
          and yet to go and sin like others; to use the same conversation, to
          practise the same chicanery, to walk in as ungodly a manner as those
          who have never named the name of Christ -- ah! what guilt is here! It
          is enough to make us weep if we have been guilty ourselves; ay, to
          weep tears of blood that we should so have sinned against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But the Apostle did not so much weep for them as for THE MISCHIEF
          THEY WERE DOING, for he says, emphatically, that they are, "The
          enemies of the cross of Christ." "The enemies;" as much as to say, the
          infidel is an enemy; the curser, the swearer, the profane man, is an
          enemy; Herod, yonder, the persecutor, is an enemy; but these men are
          the chief soldiers -- the life-guards in Satan's army. "The enemies of
          the cross of Christ" are Pharisaic professors, bright with the
          whitewash of outside godliness, whilst they are rotten within. Oh!
          methinks there is nothing that should grieve a Christian more than to
          know that Christ has been wounded in the house of his friends. See,
          there comes my Saviour with bleeding hands and feet. O my Jesus, my
          Jesus, who shed that blood? Whence comes that wound? Why lookest thou
          so sad? He replies, "I have been wounded, but guess where I received
          the blow?" Why, Lord, sure thou wast wounded in the gin-palace; thou
          wast wounded where sinners meet, in the seat of the scornful; thou
          wast wounded in the infidel hall. "No, I was not," saith Christ; "I
          was wounded in the house of my friends; these scars were made by those
          who sat at my table and bore my name, and talked my language; they
          pierced me and crucified me afresh, and put me to an open shame." Far
          worst of sinners they that pierce Christ thus whilst professing to be
          friends. Caesar wept not until Brutus stabbed him; then it was that he
          was overcome, and exclaimed, "Et tu, Brute!" And thou, "Hast thou
          stabbed me?" So, my hearers, might Christ say to some of you. "What!
          thou, and thou, and thou, a professor, hast stabbed me?" Well might
          our Saviour muffle up his face in grief, or rather bind it in clouds
          of wrath, and drive the wretch away that has so injured his cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I must be defeated in battle, let me be defeated by mine enemies,
          but let me not be betrayed by my friends. If I must yield the citadel
          which I am willing to defend even to the death, then let me yield it,
          and let my foes walk over my body; but oh! let not my friends betray
          me; let not the warrior who stands by my side unbar the gate and admit
          the foemen. That were enough to break one's heart twice -- once for
          the defeat, and the second time at the thought of treachery.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a small band of Protestants were striving for their liberties in
          Switzerland, they bravely defended a pass against an immense host.
          Though their dearest friends were slain, and they themselves were
          weary, and ready to drop with fatigue, they stood firm in the defence
          of the cause they had espoused. On a sudden, however, a cry was heard
          -- a dread and terrible shriek. The enemy was winding up a steep
          acclivity, and when the commander turned his eye thither, O how his
          brow gathered with storm! He ground his teeth and stamped his foot,
          for he knew that some caitiff Protestant had led the blood-thirsty foe
          up the goat track to slay his friends. Then turning to his friends, he
          said "On!" and like a lion on his prey, they rushed upon their
          enemies, ready now to die, for a friend had betrayed them. So feels
          the bold-hearted Christian, when he sees his fellow-member betraying
          Christ, when he beholds the citadel of Christianity given up to its
          foes by those who pretended to be its friends. Beloved, I would rather
          have a thousand devils out of the church, than have one in it. I do
          not care about all the adversaries outside; our greatest cause of fear
          is from the crafty "wolves in sheep's clothing," that devour the
          flock. It is against such that we would denounce in holy wrath the
          solemn sentence of divine indignation, and for such we would shed our
          bitterest tears of sorrow. They are "the enemies of the cross of
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, for a moment, let me show you how it is that the wicked professor
          is the greatest enemy to Christ's church.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, he grieves the church more than any one else. It
          any man in the street were to pelt me with mud, I believe I should
          thank him for the honor, if I knew him to be a bad character, and knew
          that he hated me for righteousness sake. But if one who called himself
          a Christian should injure the cause with the filthiness of his own
          licentious behaviour: ah! that were more injurious than the stakes of
          Smithfield, or the racks of the Tower. The deepest sighs the Christian
          has ever heaved, have been fetched from him by carnal professors. I
          would not weep a tear if every man should curse me who was a hater of
          Christ; but when the professor forsakes Christ, and betrays his cause:
          ah! that indeed is grievous; and who is he that can keep back the tear
          on account of so vile a deed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: nothing divides the church more. I have seen many divisions in
          journeying through the country, and I believe almost every division
          may be traced to a deficiency of piety on the part of some of the
          members. We should be more one, if it were not for cants that creep
          into our midst. We should be more loving to each other, more
          tender-hearted, more kind, but that these men, so deceptive, coming
          into our midst, render us suspicious. Moreover, they themselves find
          fault with those who walk worthily, in order to hide their own faults
          against God, and against justice. The greatest sorrows of the church
          have been brought upon her, not by the arrows shot by her foes, not by
          the discharge of the artillery of hell, but by fires lit in her own
          midst, by those who have crept into her in the guise of good men and
          true, but who were spies in the camp, and traitors to the cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet again: nothing has ever hurt poor sinners more than this. Many
          sinners coming to Christ would get relief far more quickly, if it were
          not for the ill lives of false professors. Now let me tell you a
          story, which I remember telling once before: it is a very solemn one;
          I hope to feel its power myself, and I pray that all of you may do the
          same. A young minister had been preaching in a country village, and
          the sermon apparently took deep effect on the minds of the hearers. In
          the congregation there was a young man who felt acutely the truth of
          the solemn words to which the preacher had given utterance. He sought
          the preacher after the service, and walked with him. On the road, the
          minister talked of every subject except the one that had occupied his
          attention in the pulpit. The poor soul was under great distress, and
          he asked the minister a question or two, but they were put off very
          coolly, as if the matter was of no great importance. Arriving at the
          house, several friends were gathered together, and the preached
          commenced very freely to crack his jokes, to utter his funny
          expressions, and to set the company in a roar of laughter. That,
          perhaps, might not have been so bad, had he not gone even farther, and
          uttered words which were utterly false, and verged upon the
          licentious. The young man suddenly rose from the table; and though he
          had wept under the sermon, and had been under the deepest apparent
          conviction, he rose up, went outside the door, and stamping his foot,
          said, "Religion is a lie! From this moment I abjure God, I abjure
          Christ; and if I am damned I will be damned, but I will lay the charge
          at that man's door, for he preached just now and made me weep, but now
          see what he is! He is a liar, and I will never hear him again." He
          carried out his threat; and some time afterwards, as he lay dying, he
          sent word to the minister that he wanted to see him. The minister had
          removed to a distant part, but had been brought there by providence, I
          believe, purposely to chasten him for the great sin he had committed.
          The minister stepped into the room with the Bible in his hand to do as
          he was accustomed -- to read a chapter and to pray with the poor man.
          Turning his eyes on him, the man said, "Sir, I remember hearing you
          preach once." "Blessed be God," said the minister, "I thank God for
          it," thinking, no doubt, that he was a convert, and rejoicing over
          him. "Stop," said the man, "I do not know that there is much reason
          for thanking God, at any rate, on my part. Sir, do you remember
          preaching from such-and-such a text on such-and-such an evening?"
          "Yes, I do." "I trembled then, sir; I shook from head to foot; I left
          with the intention of bending the knee in prayer, and seeking God in
          Christ; but do you remember going to such-and-such a house, and what
          you said there!" "No," said the minister, "I cannot." "Well, then, I
          can tell you, and mark you! through what you said that night my soul
          is damned, and as true as I am a living man I will meet you at God's
          bar and lay it to your charge." The man then shut his eyes and died. I
          think you can scarcely imagine what must have been the feeling of that
          preacher as he retired from the bedside. He must carry with him always
          that horrid, that terrible incubus, that there was a soul in hell who
          laid his blood to his charge.

          I am afraid there are some in the ranks of the church who have much
          guilt at their doors on this account. Many a young man has been driven
          from a solemn consideration of the truth by the harsh and censorious
          remarks of Scribes and Pharisees. Many a careful seeker has been
          prejudiced against sound doctrine by the evil lives of its professors.
          Ah! ye Scribes and Pharisees, ye enter not in yourselves, and them
          that would enter in ye hinder. Ye take the key of knowledge, lock up
          the door by your inconsistencies, and drive men away by your unholy
          living.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, they are "the enemies of the cross of Christ," because they
          give the devil more theme for laughter, and the enemy more cause for
          joy, than any other class of Christians. I do not care what all the
          infidel lecturers in the world like to say. They are very clever
          fellows, no doubt, and good need they have to be so, to prove an
          absurdity, and "make the worse appear the better reason;" but we care
          little what they say; they may say what they like against us that is
          false, but it is when they can say anything that is true about us that
          we do not like it. It is when they can find a real inconsistency in
          us, and then bring it to our charge, that they have got stuff to make
          lectures of. If a man be an upright Christian, he never need fear what
          others say of him; they will get but little fun out of him if he leads
          a holy, blameless life; but let him be sometimes godly, and at other
          times ungodly, then he may grieve, for he has given the enemy cause to
          blaspheme by his unholy living. The devil gets much advantage over the
          church by the inconsistency of professors. It is when Satan makes
          hypocrites that he brings the great battering ram against the wall.
          "Your lives are not consistent" -- ah! that is the greatest battering
          ram that Satan can use against the cause of Christ. Be particular, my
          dear friends, be very particular that you do not dishonour the cause
          you profess to love, by living in sin and walking in iniquity. And let
          me say a word to those of you who, like myself, are strong Calvinists.
          No class of persons are more maligned than we. It is commonly said
          that our doctrine is licentious; we are called Antinomians; we are
          cried down as hypers; we are reckoned the scum of creation; scarcely a
          minister looks on us or speaks favourably of us, because we hold
          strong views upon the divine sovereignty of God, and his divine
          electings and special love towards his own people. In many towns the
          legal ministers will tell you that there is a nasty nest of people
          there, who they say are Antinomians -- such a queer set of creatures.
          Very likely, if a good minister enters the pulpit, when he has done
          his sermon, up comes some man and grasps his hand, and says, "Ah!
          brother, I am glad to see you down here; sixteen ounces to the pound
          to-day; our minister gives us nothing but milk and water." "Where do
          you go?" he asks. "Oh, I attend a little room where we labour to exalt
          free-grace alone." "Ah! then you belong to that nasty set of
          Antinomians your minister was telling me of just now." Then you begin
          to talk with him, and you find that if he is an Antinomian you should
          very much like to be one yourself. Very possibly he is one of the most
          spiritual men in the village; he knows so much of God that he really
          cannot sit down under a legal ministry; he understands so much of
          free-grace that he is obliged to turn out or else he would be starved
          to death. It is common to cry down those who love God, or rather, who
          not only love God, but love all that God has said, and who hold the
          truth firmly. Let us then, not as Christians only, but as being a
          peculiar class of Christians, take care that we give no handle to the
          enemy, but that our lives are so consistent, that we do nothing to
          disgrace that cause which is dear to us as our lives, and which we
          hope to maintain faithfully unto death.

          III. Lastly, Paul wept, BECAUSE HE KNEW THEIR DOOM: "Their end is
          destruction." Mark you, the end of a professing man who has been a
          hypocrite will be emphatically destruction. If there be chains in hell
          more heavy than others -- if there be dungeons in hell more dark than
          others -- if there be racks that shall more fearfully torment the
          frame -- if there be fires that shall more tremendously scorch the
          body -- if there be pangs that shall more effectually twist the soul
          in agonies, professing Christians must have them if they be found
          rotten at last, I had rather die a profligate than die a lying
          professor. I think I had rather die the veriest sweeping of the street
          than die a hypocrite. Oh, to have had a name to live, and yet to have
          proved insincere. The higher the soar the greater the fall. This man
          has soared high; how low must he tumble when he finds himself
          mistaken! He who thought to put to his mouth the nectared cup of
          heaven, finds when he quaffs the bowl, that is the very draught of
          hell. He who hoped to enter through the gates into the city finds the
          gates shut, and he himself bidden to depart as an unknown stranger.
          Oh! how thrilling is that sentence, "Depart from me, I never knew
          you!" I think I had rather hear it said to me, "Depart, accursed,
          among the rest of the wicked," than to be singled out, and to have it
          said, after exclaiming, "Lord, Lord," "Depart from me; I know you not;
          though you ate and drank in my courts; though you came to my
          sanctuary, you are a stranger to me, and I am a stranger to you." Such
          a doom, more horrible than hell, more direful than fate, more
          desperate than despair, must be the inevitable lot of those "whose god
          is their belly," who have "gloried in their shame," and "minded
          earthly things."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I dare say most of you will say, "Well, he has stirred the
          churches up to-night; if he has not spoken earnestly, he has spoken
          harshly, at any rate." "Ah!" says one, "I dare say it is very true;
          they are all a set of cants and hypocrites; I always thought so; I
          shall not go amongst them; none of them are genuine." Stop a bit, my
          friend, I did not say they were all so; I should be very wicked if I
          did. The very fact that there are hypocrites proves that all are not
          so. "How is that?" say you. Do you think there would be any bad bank
          notes in the world if there were no good ones? Do you think anyone
          would try and circulate bad sovereigns if there were no really good
          ones? No, I think not. It is the good bank note that makes the bad
          one, by prompting the wicked man to imitate it and produce a forgery.
          It is the very fact that there is gold in the world that makes another
          try to imitate the metal and so to cheat his neighbour. If there were
          no true Christians, there would be no hypocrites. It is the excellence
          of the Christian character which makes men seek after it, and because
          they have not the real heart of oak, they try to grain their lives to
          look like it. Because they have not the real solid metal, they try to
          gild themselves to imitate it. You must have a few brains left, and
          those are enough to tell you that if there be hypocrites, there must
          be some who are genuine. "Ah!" says another, "quite right; there are
          many genuine ones, and I can tell you, whatever you may think, I am
          genuine enough. I never had a doubt or fear. I know I was chosen of
          God; and though I do not exactly live as I could wish, I know if I do
          not go to heaven, very few will ever have a chance. Why, sir, I have
          been a deacon the last ten years, and a member twenty; and I am not to
          be shaken by anything you say. As for my neighbour there, who sits
          near me, I do not think he ought to be so sure; but I have never had a
          doubt for thirty years." Oh my dear friend, can you excuse me? I will
          doubt for you. If you had not doubt yourself, I begin to doubt. If you
          are quite so sure, I really must suspect you; for I have noticed that
          true Christians are the most suspicious in the world; they are always
          afraid of themselves. I never met with a truly good man but he always
          felt he was not good enough; and as you are so particularly good, you
          must excuse me if I cannot quite endorse your security. You may be
          very good, but if you will take a trifle of my advice, I recommend you
          to "examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith," lest, being
          puffed up by your carnal fleshly mind, you fall into the snare of the
          wicked one. "Not too sure," is a very good motto for the Christian.
          "Make your calling and election sure," if you like; but do not make
          your opinion of yourself so sure. Take care of presumption. Many a
          good man in his own esteem has been a very devil in God's eyes; many a
          pious soul in the esteem of the church has been nothing but rottenness
          in the esteem of God. Let us then try ourselves. Let us say, "Search
          us, O God, and try our hearts; see if there be any wicked way in us,
          and lead us in the way everlasting." If you shall be sent home with
          such a thought, I shall bless God that the sermon was not altogether
          in vain. But there are some here who say that it does not matter
          whether they are in Christ or no. They intend to go on trifling still,
          despising God, and laughing at his name. Mark this, sinner: The cry
          that does for one day won't do for ever; and thou you talk of religion
          now as if it were a mere trifle, mark ye men, you will want it
          by-and-bye. You are on board ship, and you laugh at the life-boat,
          because there is no storm; you will be glad enough to leap into it if
          you are able when the storm shall come. Now you say Christ is nothing,
          because you do not want him, but when the storm of vengeance comes,
          and death lays hold upon you, mark me, you will howl after Christ,
          though you will not pray for him now; you will shriek after him then,
          though you will not call for him now. "Turn ye, turn ye; why will ye
          die, O house of Israel." The Lord bring you to himself, and make you
          his true and genuine children, that you may not know destruction, but
          that you may be saved now, and saved for ever!

          The tongue of the wicked has assailed Mr. SPURGEON with the most
          virulent abuse and lying detraction. His sentiments have been
          misrepresented, and his words perverted. His doctrines have been
          impugned as "blasphemous," "profane," and "diabolical." Nevertheless,
          the good hand of the Lord has been upon him, and he has not heeded the
          falsehoods of the ungodly.
