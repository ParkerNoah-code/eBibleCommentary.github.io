          1. Inasmuch, then, as in both Testaments there is the same
          righteousness of God [displayed] when God takes vengeance, in the one
          case indeed typically, temporarily, and more moderately; but in the
          other, really, enduringly, and more rigidly: for the fire is eternal,
          and the wrath of God which shall be revealed from heaven from the face
          of our Lord (as David also says, "But the face of the Lord is against
          them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth"
          ), entails a heavier punishment on those who incur it, -- the elders
          pointed out that those men are devoid of sense, who, [arguing] from
          what happened to those who formerly did not obey God, do endeavour to
          bring in another Father, setting over against [these punishments] what
          great things the Lord had done at His coming to save those who
          received Him, taking compassion upon them; while they keep silence
          with regard to His judgment; and all those things which shall come
          upon such as have heard His words, but done them not, and that it were
          better for them if they had not been born, and that it shall be more
          tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment than for that city
          which did not receive the word of His disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For as, in the New Testament, that faith of men [to be placed] in
          God has been increased, receiving in addition [to what was already
          revealed] the Son of God, that man too might be a partaker of God; so
          is also our walk in life required to be more circumspect, when we are
          directed not merely to abstain from evil actions, but even from evil
          thoughts, and from idle words, and empty talk, and scurrilous
          language: thus also the punishment of those who do not believe the
          Word of God, and despise His advent, and are turned away backwards, is
          increased; being not merely temporal, but rendered also eternal. For
          to whomsoever the Lord shall say, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
          everlasting fire," these shall be damned for ever; and to whomsoever
          He shall say, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
          prepared for you for eternity," these do receive the kingdom for ever,
          and make constant advance in it; since there is one and the same God
          the Father, and His Word, who has been always present with the human
          race, by means indeed of various dispensations, and has wrought out
          many things, and saved from the beginning those who are saved, (for
          these are they who love God, and follow the Word of God according to
          the class to which they belong,) and has judged those who are judged,
          that is, those who forget God, and are blasphemous, and transgressors
          of His word.
        </p>

          3. For the self-same heretics already mentioned by us have fallen away
          from themselves, by accusing the Lord, in whom they say that they
          believe. For those points to which they call attention with regard to
          the God who then awarded temporal punishments to the unbelieving, and
          smote the Egyptians, while He saved those that were obedient; these
          same [facts, I say,] shall nevertheless repeat themselves in the Lord,
          who judges for eternity those whom He doth judge, and lets go free for
          eternity those whom He does let go free: and He shall [thus] be
          discovered, according to the language used by these men, as having
          been the cause of their most heinous sin to those who laid hands upon
          Him, and pierced Him. For if He had not so come, it follows that these
          men could not have become the slayers of their Lord; and if He had not
          sent prophets to them, they certainly could not have killed them, nor
          the apostles either. To those, therefore, who assail us, and say, If
          the Egyptians had not been afflicted with plagues, and, when pursuing
          after Israel, been choked in the sea, God could not have saved His
          people, this answer may be given; -- Unless, then, the Jews had become
          the slayers of the Lord (which did, indeed, take eternal life away
          from them), and, by killing the apostles and persecuting the Church,
          had fallen into an abyss of wrath, we could not have been saved. For
          as they were saved by means of the blindness of the Egyptians, so are
          we, too, by that of the Jews; if, indeed, the death of the Lord is the
          condemnation of those who fastened Him to the cross, and who did not
          believe His advent, but the salvation of those who believe in Him. For
          the apostle does also say in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians:
          "For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them which are
          saved, and in them which perish: to the one indeed the savour of death
          unto death, but to the other the savour of life unto life." To whom,
          then, is there the savour of death unto death, unless to those who
          believe not neither are subject to the Word of God? And who are they
          that did even then give themselves over to death? Those men,
          doubtless, who do not believe, nor submit themselves to God. And
          again, who are they that have been saved and received the inheritance?
          Those, doubtless, who do believe God, and who have continued in His
          love; as did Caleb [the son] of Jephunneh and Joshua [the son] of Nun,
          and innocent children, who have had no sense of evil. But who are they
          that are saved now, and receive life eternal? Is it not those who love
          God, and who believe His promises, and who "in malice have become as
          little children?" <br />
