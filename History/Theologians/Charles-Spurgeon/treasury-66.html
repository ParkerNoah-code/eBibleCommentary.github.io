          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician. </b>The leader of the choir, for the
          time being, is charged with this song. It were well if the chief
          musicians of all our congregations estimated their duty at its due
          solemnity, for it is no mean thing to be called to lead the sacred
          song of God's people, and the responsibility is by no means light.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">A Psalm of David.</p></b> His life was one of
        conflict, and very seldom does he finish a Psalm without mentioning his
        enemies; in this instance his thoughts are wholly occupied with prayer
        against them.
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. From verses 1-6 he describes the cruelty and craftiness of
          his foes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From verses 7-10 he prophesies their overthrow.<br />

        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 1. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer.</p></b
        >It often helps devotion if we are able to use the voice and speak
        audibly; but even mental prayer has a voice with God which he will hear.
        <p align="justify">
          We do not read that Moses had spoken with his lips at the Red Sea, and
          yet the Lord said to him, "Why do you cry unto me?"
          <i
            >Prayers which are unheard on earth, may be among the best heard in
            Heaven</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is our duty to note how constantly David turns to prayer; it is his
          battle axe and weapon of war. He uses it under every pressure, whether
          of inward sin or outward wrath, foreign invasion or domestic
          rebellion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Just so,
          <i
            >we shall act wisely if we make prayer to God our first and best
            trusted resource in every hour of need.
          </i>
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p></b>
        From harm and dread of harm protect me; or it may be read as an
        expression of his assurance that it would be so; "from fear of the foe
        you will preserve me." With all our sacrifices of prayer, we should
        offer the salt of faith.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked.
          </p></b
        >
        From their hidden snares hide me. Circumvent their counsel; let their
        secrets be met by your secret providence; their counsels of malice by
        your counsels of love.

          <p align="justify">
            From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity.
          </p></b
        >
        When their secret counsels break forth into clamorous tumults, be you
        still my preserver. When they <i>think </i>evil, let your divine
        thoughts defeat them. When they <i>do </i>evil, let your powerful
        justice overthrow them. In both cases, let me be out of reach of their
        cruel hand, and even out of sight of their evil eye. It is a good thing
        to conquer malicious foes, but a better thing still to be screened from
        all conflict with them, by being hidden from the strife. The Lord knows
        how to give his people peace, and when he wills to make quiet, he is
        more than a match for all disturbers, and can defeat alike their deep
        laid plots and their overt hostilities.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. Who sharpen their tongue like a sword.
          </p></b
        >
        Slander has ever been the master weapon of the godly man's enemies, and
        great is the care of the malicious to use it effectively. As warriors
        grind their swords, to give them an edge which will cut deep and wound
        desperately, so do the unscrupulous invent falsehoods which shall be
        calculated to inflict pain, to stab the reputation, to kill the honor of
        the righteous.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            What is there which an evil tongue will not say? What misery will it
            not labor to inflict?
          </p></i
        >
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            And bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words.
          </p></b
        >
        Far off they dart their calumnies, as archers shoot their poisoned
        arrows. They studiously and with force prepare their speech as bent
        bows, and then with cool, deliberate aim, they let fly the shaft which
        they have dipped in bitterness. To sting, to inflict anguish, to
        destroy, is their one design. Insult, sarcasm, taunting defiance,
        nicknaming, all these were practiced among Orientals as a kind of art;
        and if in these Western regions, with more refined manners, we are less
        addicted to the use of rough abuse, it is yet to be feared that the less
        apparent venom of the tongue inflicts none the less poignant pain.
        <p align="justify">
          However, in all cases, let us fly to the Lord for help. David had but
          the one resource of prayer against the twofold weapons of the wicked,
          for defense against sword or arrow, he used the one defense of faith
          in God.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 4. That they may shoot in secret at the perfect.
          </p></b
        >
        They lie in ambush, with bows ready bent to aim a coward's shaft at the
        upright man.
        <i
          >Sincere and upright conduct will not secure us from the assaults of
          slander. </i
        >The devil shot at our Lord himself, and we may rest assured he has a
        fiery dart in reserve for us. He was absolutely perfect, we are only so
        in a relative sense, hence in us there is fuel for fiery darts to kindle
        on.
        <p align="justify">
          Observe the baseness of malicious men; they will not accept fair
          combat, they shun the open field, and skulk in the bushes, lying in
          ambush against those who are not so acquainted with deceit as to
          suspect their treachery, and are to manly to imitate their despicable
          modes of warfare.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p></b
        >To <i> secrecy </i>they add <i>suddenness</i>. They give their
        unsuspecting victim no chance of defending himself; they pounce on him
        like a wild beast leaping on its prey. They lay their plans so warily
        that they fear no detection.
        <p align="justify">
          We have seen in daily life the arrow of calumny wounding its victim
          sorely; and yet we have not been able to discover the quarter from
          which the weapon was shot, nor to detect the hand which forged the
          arrowhead, or tinged it with the poison.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is it possible for justice to invent a punishment sufficiently severe
          to meet the case of the dastard who defiles my good name, and remains
          himself in concealment?<i>
            An open liar is an angel compared with this demon. Vipers and cobras
            are harmless and amiable creatures compared with such a reptile. The
            devil himself might blush at being the father of so base an
            offspring.</i

            Verse 5. They encourage themselves in an evil matter.
          </p></b
        >
        Godly men are frequently discouraged, and not infrequently discourage
        one another, but the children of darkness are wise in their generation
        and keep their spirits up, and each one has a cheering word to say to
        his fellow villain. Anything by which they can strengthen each other's
        hands in their one common design they resort to; their hearts are
        thoroughly in their black work.
        <b> <p align="justify">They commune of laying snares privily.</p></b>
        Laying their heads together they count and recount their various wicked
        devices, so as to come at some new and masterly device. They know the
        benefit of cooperation, and are not sparing in it; they pour their
        experience into one common fund, they teach each other fresh methods.
        <b> <p align="justify">They say, Who shall see them?</p></b>So
        sedulously do they mask their attacks, that they defy discovery; their
        pitfalls are too well hidden, and themselves too carefully concealed to
        be found out. So they think, but they forget the all-seeing eye, and the
        all-discovering hand, which are ever near by them.
        <p align="justify">
          Great plots are usually laid bare. As in the <i>Gunpowder Plot</i>,
          there is usually a breakdown somewhere or other; among the
          conspirators themselves truth finds an ally, or the stones of the
          field cry out against them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let no Christian be in bondage through fear of deep laid Jesuitical
          schemes, for surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, nor
          divination against Israel; the toils of the net are broken, the arrows
          of the bow are snapped, the devices of the wicked are foiled.
          Therefore, fear not, you tremblers; for the Lord is at your right
          hand, and you shall not be hurt of the enemy.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 6. They search out iniquities.</p></b>
        Diligently they consider, invent, devise, and seek for wicked plans to
        wreak their malice. These are no common villains, but explorers in
        iniquity, inventors and concoctors of evil. Sad indeed it is that to
        ruin a godly man, evil men will often show as much avidity as if they
        were searching after treasure. The <i> Inquisition </i>could display
        instruments of torture, revealing as much skill as the machinery of our
        modern exhibitions. The deep places of history, manifesting most the
        skill of the human mind, are those in which revenge has arranged
        diplomacy, and used intrigue to compass its diabolical purposes.
        <b> <p align="justify">They accomplish a diligent search.</p></b>Their
        design is perfected, consummated, and brought into working order. They
        have sought and found the sure method of vengeance.<i>
          Exquisite are the refinements of malice! </i
        >Hell's craft furnishes inspiration to the wicked who fashion deceit.
        Earth and the places under it are ransacked for the material of war, and
        profound skill turns all to account.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart is deep.
          </p></b
        >
        No superficial wit is theirs; but sagacity, sharpened by practice and
        keen hatred. Wicked men have frequently the craft to hasten slowly, to
        please in order to ruin, to flatter that before long they may devour, to
        bow the knee that they may ultimately crush beneath their foot.

        <p align="justify">
          He who deals with the serpent's seed, has good need of the wisdom
          which is from above: the generation of vipers twist and turn, wind and
          wiggle—yet evermore they are set upon their purpose, and go the
          nearest way to it when they wander round about.

        >This is the complaint of reason and the moan of unbelief. When faith
        comes in, we see that even in all this the saints are still secure, for

        shall take sure aim at their hearts. One of his arrows shall be enough,
        for he never misses his aim. The Lord turns the tables on his
        adversaries, and defeats them at their own weapons.
        <b> <p align="justify">Suddenly shall they be wounded.</p></b> They were
        looking to surprise the saint, but, lo! they are taken at unawares
        themselves; they desired to inflict deadly wounds, and are smitten
        themselves with wounds which none can heal. While they were bending
        their bows, the great Lord had prepared his bow already, and he let slip
        the shaft when least they looked for such an unsparing messenger of
        justice.
        <p align="justify">
          "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord." The righteous need
          not learn the arts of self-defense or of attack, their avenging is in
