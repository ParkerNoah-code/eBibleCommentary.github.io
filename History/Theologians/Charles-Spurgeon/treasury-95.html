              TITLE. A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath day. <br />
              This admirable composition is both a Psalm and a Song, full of
              equal measures of solemnity and joy; and it was intended to be
              sung upon the day of rest. The subject is the praise of God;
              praise is Sabbatic work, the joyful occupation of resting hearts.
              Since a true Sabbath can only be found in God, it is wise to
              meditate upon him on the Sabbath day. The style is worthy of the
              theme and of the day, its inspiration is from the "fount of every
              blessing"; David spoke as the Spirit gave him utterance. In the
              church of Christ, at this hour, no Psalm is more frequently sung
              upon the Lord's day than the present.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The Sabbath was set apart for adoring the Lord in his finished
              work of creation, hence the suitableness of this Psalm; Christians
              may take even a higher flight, for they celebrate complete
              redemption. No one acquainted with David's style will hesitate to
              ascribe to him the authorship of this divine hymn; the ravings of
              the Rabbis who speak of its being composed by Adam, only need to
              be mentioned to be dismissed. Adam in Paradise had neither harps
              to play upon, nor wicked men to contend with.

              It is good practically, for it leads others to render the same
              homage.
              <i>When duty and pleasure combine, who will not act? </i>To give
              thanks to God is but a small return for the great benefits with
              which he daily loads us; yet as he by his Spirit calls it a good
              thing we must not despise it, or neglect it.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              We thank <i>men </i>when they oblige us, how much more ought we to
              bless the <i>Lord </i>when he benefits us. Devout praise is always
              good, it is never out of season, never superfluous—but it is
              especially suitable to the Sabbath; a Sabbath without thanksgiving
              is a Sabbath profaned.

            </b>
            <p align="justify">
              It is good to give thanks in the form of vocal song. Nature itself
              teaches us thus to express our gratitude to God; do not the birds
              sing, and the brooks warble as they flow? To give his gratitude a
              tongue is wise in man.<i>
                Silent worship is sweet—but vocal worship is sweeter. </i
              >To deny the tongue the privilege of uttering the praises of God
              involves an unnatural strain upon the most commendable prompting
              of our renewed manhood. It is a problem to us how the members of
              the <i>Society of Friends </i>can deprive themselves of so noble,
              so natural, so inspiring a part of sacred worship. Good as they
              are, they miss one good thing when they decline to sing praises
              unto the name of the Lord. Our personal experience has confirmed
              us in the belief that it is good to sing unto the Lord. We have
              often felt like Luther when he said, "Come, let us sing a psalm,
              and drive away the devil."

              </p>
            </b>
            <p align="justify">
              The day should begin with praise: no hour is too early for holy
              song. Loving kindness is a most appropriate theme for those dewy
              hours when morn is sowing all the earth with orient pearl. Eagerly
              and promptly should we magnify the Lord; we leave unpleasant tasks
              as long as we can—but our hearts are so engrossed with the
              adoration of God that we would rise early to attend to it.<i>
                There is a peculiar freshness and charm about early morning
                praises</i
              >. The day is loveliest when it first opens its eyelids, and God
              himself seems then to make distribution of the day's manna, which
              tastes most sweetly if gathered before the sun is hot. It seems
              most fit that if our hearts and harps have been silent through the
              shades of night, we should be eager again to take our place among
              the chosen choir who ceaselessly hymn the Eternal One.

              No hour is too late for praise, the end of the day must not be the
              end of gratitude. When nature seems in silent contemplation to
              adore its Maker, it ill becomes the children of God to refrain
              their thanksgiving.<i> Evening is the time for retrospect</i>,
              memory is busy with the experience of the day, hence the
              appropriate theme for song is the divine faithfulness, of which
              another day has furnished fresh evidences. When darkness has
              settled down over all things, "a shade immense", then there comes
              over wise men a congenial, meditative spirit, and it is most
              fitting that they should take an expanded view of the truth and
              goodness of Jehovah—

              Thus giving variety to praise, the Psalmist felt that every

              Herbert and Martin Luther aided their private devotions by
              instrumental music; and whatever may have been the differences of
              opinion in the Christian church, as to the performance of
              instrumental music in public, we have met with no objection to its
              personal and private use.

            <p align="justify">
              It is, however, much to be feared that attention to the
              <i>mere mechanics of music</i>, noting keys and strings, bars and
              strains, has carried many away from the spiritual harmony, which
              is the soul and essence of praise.
              <i

            <p align="justify">
              It was natural for the psalmist to sing, because he was glad, and
              to sing unto the Lord, because his gladness was caused by a
              contemplation of the divine work. If we consider either
              <i>creation </i>or <i>providence</i>, we shall find overflowing
              reasons for joy; but when we come to review the work of
              <i>redemption</i>, gladness knows no bounds—but feels that she
              must praise the Lord with all her might. There are times when in
              the contemplation of redeeming love, we feel that if we did not
              sing we must die; silence would be as horrible to us as if we were
              gagged by inquisitors, or stifled by murderers.

              I cannot help it, I must and I will rejoice in the Lord, even as
              one who has won the victory and has divided great spoil. In the
              first sentence of this verse he expresses the <i>unity </i>of
              God's work, and in the second the <i>variety </i>of his works; in
              both there is reason for gladness and triumph. When God reveals
              his work to a man, and performs a work in his soul, he makes his
              heart glad most effectually, and then the natural consequence is
              continual praise.

              type must be the adoring seraph, or the ungrateful swine. So far
              from paying respect to great thinkers who will not own the glory
              or being of God, we ought to regard them as comparable to the
              beasts which perish, only vastly lower than mere brutes, because
              their degrading condition is of their own choosing. O God, how

              This is the middle verse of the Psalm, and the great fact which
              this Sabbath song is meant to illustrate. God is at once the
              highest and most enduring of all beings. Others rise to fall—but
              he is the Most High to eternity. Glory be to his name! How great a
              God we worship! Who would not fear you, O High Eternal One! The
              ungodly are destroyed forever, and God is most high forever; evil

              spoken twice it is confirmed by the Lord, it shall surely be, and
              that speedily. All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered;
              their forces shall be dispersed, their hopes broken, and
              themselves driven hither and thither like chaff before the
              tempest. They shall scatter like timid sheep pursued by the lion,
              they will not have the courage to remain in arms, nor the unity to
              abide in confederacy.

              even so are the ungodly cut down and swept away in process of

              the Lord himself, and all the good which they receive comes
              directly from his own right hand, and so is doubly precious in
              their esteem. The psalmist speaks in the first person, and it
              should be a matter of prayer with the reader that he may be
              enabled to do the same.

              The words, "my desire", inserted by the translators, had far

              Here, again, the words "my desire" are not inspired, and are a

              silent as to what he expected to hear; he knew that what he would
              hear would vindicate his faith in his God, and he was content to

              under all adversities retains the joy of his soul, and continues
              to make progress in the divine life. <i>Grass</i>, which makes hay
