          Albeit that this Psalm is in some measure very similar to Psalm 18—yet
          it is a new song, and in its latter portion it is strikingly so. Let
          the reader accept it as a new psalm, and not as a mere variation of an
          old one, or as two compositions roughly joined together. It is true
          that it would be a complete composition if verses 12-15 were dropped;
          but there are other parts, of David's poems which might be equally
          self-contained if certain verses were omitted; and the same might be
          said of many uninspired sonnets. It does not, therefore, follow that
          the latter part was added by another hand, nor even that the latter
          part was a fragment by the same author, appended to the first song
          merely with the view of preserving it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It seems to us to be highly probable that the Psalmist, remembering
          that he had trodden some of the same ground before, felt his mind
          moved to fresh thought, and that the Holy Spirit used this mood for
          his own high purposes. Assuredly the addendum is worthy of the
          greatest Hebrew poet, and it is so admirable in language, and so full
          of beautiful imagery, that people of taste who were by no means
          overloaded with reverence have quoted it times without number, thus
          confessing its singular poetical excellence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To us the whole psalm appears to be perfect as it stands, and to
          exhibit such unity throughout that it would be a literary vandalism,
          as well as a spiritual crime, to rend away one part from the other.

          TITLE. Its title is "Of David", and its language is of David, if ever
          language can belong to any man. As surely as we could say of any poem,
          "this is of Tennyson, or of Longfellow," we may say, "This is of
          David.' Nothing but the disease which closes the eye to manifest fact
          and opens it to imagine, could have led learned critics to ascribe
          this song to anybody but David. Alexander well says, "The Davidic
          origin of this psalm is as marked as that of any in the Psalter."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is to God the devout warrior sings when he extols him as his
          strength and stay (verses 1-2).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Man he holds in small account, and wonders at the Lord's regard for
          him (verses 3-4).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he turns in his hour of conflict to the Lord, who is declared to
          be "a man of war", whose triumphant interposition he implores (verses
          5-8).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He again extols and entreats in verses 9-11, and then closes with a
          delightful picture of the Lord's work for his chosen people, who are
          congratulated upon having such a God to be their God, in verses
          12-15.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Blessed be the LORD my strength.</p></b
        >He cannot delay the utterance of his gratitude, he bursts at once into
        a loud note of praise. His best word is given to his best friend,
        "Blessed be Jehovah."<i>
          When the heart is in a right state it must praise God, it cannot be
          restrained; its utterances leap forth as waters forcing their way from
          a living spring. </i
        >With all his strength David blesses the God of his strength.
        <p align="justify">
          We ought not to receive so great a blessing as strength to resist
          evil, to defend truth, and to conquer error, without knowing who gave
          it to us, and rendering to him the glory of it. Not only does Jehovah
          give strength to his saints, but <i>he is their strength</i>. The
          strength is made theirs because God is theirs. God is full of power,
          and he becomes the power of those who trust him. In him our great
          strength lies, and to him be blessings more than we are able to utter.
          It may be read, "My Rock"; but this hardly so well consorts with the
          following words:
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.
          </p></b
        >
        The word rock is the Hebrew way of expressing strength: the grand old
        language is full of such suggestive symbols. The Psalmist in the second
        part of the verse sets forth the Lord as teacher in the arts of war. If
        we have
        <i>strength </i>we are not much the better unless we have
        <i>skill </i>also. Untrained force is often an injury to the man who
        possesses it, and it even becomes a danger to those who are round about
        him; and therefore the Psalmist blesses the Lord as much for
        <i>teaching </i>as for <i>strength</i>.

        <p align="justify">
          Let us also bless Jehovah if he has in anything made us efficient. The
          tuition mentioned was very practical, it was not so much of the brain
          as of the hands and fingers; for these were the members most needful
          for conflict.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men with little scholastic education should be grateful for deftness
          and skill in their handicrafts. To a fighting man the education of the
          hands is of far more value than mere book learning could ever be. He
          who has to use a sling or a bow needs suitable training, quite as much
          as a scientific man or a classical professor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men are too apt to imagine that an artisan's efficiency is to be
          ascribed to himself; but this is a popular fallacy. A clergyman may be
          supposed to be taught of God, but people do not allow this to be true
          of weavers or workers in brass. Yet these callings are specially
          mentioned in the Bible as having been taught to holy women and earnest
          men when the tabernacle was set up at the first.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            All wisdom and skill are from the Lord, and for them he deserves to
            be gratefully extolled.
          </p></i
        >
        This teaching extends to the smallest members of our frame. The Lord
        teaches fingers as well as hands; indeed, it sometimes happens that if
        the finger is not well trained the whole hand is incapable.
        <p align="justify">
          David was called to be a man of war, and he was eminently successful
          in his battles; he does not trace this to his good generalship or
          valor, but to his being taught and strengthened for the war and the
          fight. If the Lord deigns to have a hand in such unspiritual work as
          fighting, surely he will help us to proclaim the gospel and win souls;
          and then we will bless his name with even greater intensity of heart.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            We will be pupils, and he shall be our Master, and if we ever
            accomplish anything we will give our Instructor hearty thanksgiving.

        <p align="justify">
          This verse is full of personality; it is mercy shown to David himself
          which is the subject of grateful song. It has also a presence about
          it; for Jehovah is now his strength, and is still teaching him; we
          ought to make a point of presenting praise while yet the blessing is
          on the wing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The verse is also preeminently practical, and full of the actual life
          of every day; for David's days were spent in camps and conflicts. Some
          of us who are grievously tormented with rheumatism might cry, "Blessed
          be the Lord, my Comforter, who teaches my knees to bear in patience,
          and my feet to endure in resignation." Others who are on the look out
          to help young converts might say, "Blessed be God who teaches my eyes
          to see wounded souls, and my lips to cheer them"; but David has his
          own peculiar help from God, and praises him accordingly.

          This tends to make the harmony of Heaven perfect when all the singers
          take their parts. If, we all followed the same score, the music would
          not be so full and rich.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b>
        <b>My goodness, and my fortress. </b>Now our royal poet multiplies
        metaphors to extol his God. The word for <i>goodness </i>signifies
        <i>mercy</i>. Whoever we may be, and wherever we may be,
        <i
          >we need mercy such as can only be found in the infinite God. It is
          all of mercy that he is any of the other good things to us, so that
          this is a highly comprehensive title.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          O how truly has the Lord been mercy to many of us in a thousand ways!
          He is goodness itself, and he has been unbounded goodness to us. We
          have no goodness of our own, but the Lord has become goodness to us.
          So is he himself also our fortress and safe abode. In him we dwell as
          behind impregnable ramparts and immovable bastions. We cannot be
          driven out, or starved out; for our fortress is prepared for a siege;
          it is stored with abundance of food, and a well of living water is
          within it. Kings usually think much of their fenced cities, but King
          David relies upon his God, who is more to him than fortresses could
          have been.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">My high tower, and my deliverer.</p></b> As from
        a lofty watchtower the believer, trusting in the Lord, looks down upon
        his enemies. They cannot reach him in his elevated position. He is out
        of bow shot; he is beyond their scaling ladders; he dwells on high.
        <p align="justify">
          Nor is this all; for Jehovah is our <b>Deliverer </b>as well as our
          <b>Defender</b>. These different figures set forth the varied benefits
          which come to us from our Lord.
          <i
            >He is every good thing which we can need for this world or the
            next</i
          >. He not only places us out of harm's way full often, but when we
          must be exposed, he comes to our rescue, he raises the siege, routs
          the foe, and sets us in joyous liberty!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">My shield, and he in whom I trust.</p></b> When
        the warrior rushes on his adversary, he bears his shield upon his arm,
        and thrusts death aside; thus does the believer oppose the Lord to the
        blows of the enemy, and finds himself secure from harm. For this and a
        thousand other reasons our trust rests in our God for everything. He
        never fails us, and we feel boundless confidence in him.
        <b> <p align="justify">Who subdues my people under me.</p></b> He keeps
        my natural subjects subject, and my conquered subjects peaceful under my
        sway. Men who rule others, should thank God if they succeed in the task.
        Such strange creatures are human beings, that if a number of them are
        kept in peaceful association under the leadership of any one of the
        Lord's servants, he is bound to bless God every day for the wonderful
        fact. The victories of <i> peace </i>are as much worthy of joyful
        gratitude as the victories of <i>war</i>. Leaders in the Christian
        church cannot maintain their position except as the Lord preserves to
        them the mighty influence which ensures obedience and evokes
        enthusiastic loyalty. For every particle of influence for good which we
        may possess, let us magnify the name of the Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          Thus has David blessed Jehovah for blessing him. How many times he has
          appropriated the Lord by that little word MY! Each time he grasps the
          Lord, he adores and blesses him; for the one word BLESSED runs through
          all the passage like a golden thread. He began by acknowledging that
          his strength for fighting foreign enemies was of the Lord, and he
          concluded by ascribing his domestic peace to the same source. All
          around as a king he saw himself to be surrounded by the King of kings,
          to whom he bowed in lowly homage, doing suit and service on bent knee,
          with grateful heart admitting that he owed everything to the Rock of
          his salvation.

        >
        What a contrast between Jehovah and man! The Psalmist
        <i
          >turns from the glorious all-sufficiency of God to the insignificance
          and nothingness of man</i
        >. He sees Jehovah to be everything, and then cries, "Lord, what is
        man!" <i>What is puny man in the presence of the Infinite God?</i> What
        can he be compared to? He is too little to be described at all; only
        God, who knows the most minute object, can tell what man is. Certainly
        <i>man </i>is not fit to be the rock of our confidence—he is at once too
        feeble and too fickle to be relied upon. The Psalmist's wonder is that
        God should stoop to know him, and indeed
        <i
          >it is more remarkable than if the greatest archangel should make a
          study of emmets, or become the friend of mites.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          God knows his people with a tender intimacy, a constant, careful
          observation. He foreknew them in love, he knows them by care, and he
          will know them in acceptance at last. Why is this? What has man done?
          What has he been? What is he now that God should know him, and make
          himself known to him as his goodness, fortress, and high tower?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is an unanswerable question.

          The connection of the two verses before us with the rest of the psalm

          everything; he looks to man and sees him to be nothing; and then he

        The heavens are the Lord's own, and he who exalted them can bow them.
        His servant is struggling against bitter foes, and he finds no help in
        men, therefore he entreats Jehovah to come down to his rescue. It is,
        indeed, a coming down for Jehovah to interfere in the conflicts of his
        tried people. Earth cries to Heaven to stoop; nay, the cry is to the
        Lord of Heaven to bow the Heaven, and appear among the sons of earth.
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord has often done this, and never more fully than when in

        His hand should aid his tongue, not as in the case of the wicked,
        cooperating in deceit; but his hand should unite with his mouth in
        truthful praise. David intended to tune his best instruments as well as
        to use his best vocal music. The best is all too poor for so great a
        God, and therefore we must not fall short of our utmost. He meant to use
        many instruments of music, that by all means he might express his great
        joy in God.
        <p align="justify">
          The Old Testament dispensation abounded in types, and figures, and
          outward ritual, and therefore music dropped naturally into its place
          in the "worldly sanctuary"; but, after all, it can do no more than
          represent praise, and assist our expression of it;
          <i
            >the real praise is in the heart, the true music is that of the
            soul. </i
          >When music drowns the voice, and artistic skill takes a higher place
          than hearty singing, it is time that instruments were banished from
          public worship; but when they are subordinate to the song, as here, it
          is not for us to prohibit them, or condemn those who use them, though
          <i>we ourselves greatly prefer to do without them</i>, since it seems
          to us that the utmost simplicity of praise is far more congruous with
          the spirit of the gospel than pomp of organs.

          The private worshiper, singing his solo unto the Lord, has often found
          it helpful to accompany himself on some familiar instrument, and of
          this David in the present psalm is an instance, for he says, "I will
          sing praise unto you"—that is, not so much in the company of others as
          by himself alone. He says not "we", but "I."

        Those whom the Lord sets up, he will keep up. Kings, from their
        conspicuous position, are exposed to special danger, and when their
        lives and their thrones are preserved to them they should give the Lord
        the glory of it. In his many battles David would have perished, had not
        almighty care preserved him. He had by his valor wrought salvation for
        Israel, but he lays his laurels at the feet of his Lord and Preserver.
        <p align="justify">

        it is David who owns without demur to mercy given to himself. He styles
        himself the Lord's servant, accepting this as the highest title he had
        attained or desired. <b> <p align="justify">Verse 11.</p></b> Because of

        This is in measure the refrain of the song, and the burden of the

        He would not strike hands with those who carried a lie in their right
        hand: he would be quit of such at once, if possible. Those who are
        surrounded by such <i>serpents </i>know not how to deal with them, and
        the only available method seems to be prayer to God for a riddance and
        deliverance. David in verse 7, according to the original, had sought the
        help of both the Lord's hands, and well he might, for his deceitful
        enemies, with remarkable unanimity, were with one mouth and one hand
        seeking his destruction. Riddance from the wicked and the gracious
        presence of the Lord are sought with a special eye to the peace and
        prosperity which will follow thereupon. The sparing of David's life
        would mean the peace and happiness of a whole nation. We can scarcely
