        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.262)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, February 6th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "For who maketh thee to differ from another?" -- 1 Corinthians 4:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          OR, AS IT IS in the Greek: "For who distinguisheth thee?" "Who giveth
          thee distinguishing and discriminating mercy?" "Who maketh thee to
          differ from another?" Pride is the inherent sin of man, and yet it is
          of all sins the most foolish. A thousand arguments might be used to
          show its absurdity; but none of these would be sufficient to quench
          its vitality. Alive it is in the heart, and there it will be, till we
          die to this world and rise again without spot or blemish. Yet many are
          the arrows which may be shot at the heart of our boasting. Take for
          instance the argument of creation; how strongly that thrusts at our
          pride. There is a vessel upon the potter's wheel, would it not be
          preposterous for that clay which the potter fashioneth to boast itself
          and say, "How well am I fashioned! how beautifully am I proportioned;
          I deserve much praise!" Why, O lump of clay, whateverthou art, the
          potter made thee; however elegant thy proportions, however matchless
          thy symmetry, the glory is due to him that made thee, not to thyself;
          thou art but the work of his hands. And so let us speak unto
          ourselves. We are the thing formed; shall we say of ourselves that we
          deserve honor because God hath formed us excellently and wondrously?
          No, the fact of our creation should extinguish the sparks of our
          pride. What are we, after all, but as grasshoppers in his sight, as
          drops of the bucket, as lumps of animated dust; we are but the infants
          of a day when we are most old; we are but the insects of an hour when
          we are most strong; we are but the wild ass's colt when we are most
          wise, we are but as folly and vanity when we are most excellent -- let
          that tend to humble us. But surely if these prevail not to clip the
          pinions of our high soaring pride, the Christian man may at least bind
          its wings with arguments derived from the distinguishing love and
          peculiar mercies of God. "Who maketh thee to differ from another?" --
          This question should be like a dagger put to the throat of our
          boasting; -- "and what trust thou that thou didst not receive;" -- it
          would be like a sword thrust through the heart of our self-exaltation
          and pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall now for a moment or two endeavor to put down our pride by
          observing wherein God hath distinguished us and made us to differ, and
          then by noticing that all this cometh of him, and should be a reason
          for humiliation, and not for boasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Many of us differ from others in God's providential dealings
          towards us. Let us think a moment how many there are of God's precious
          and dearly beloved children, who at this moment are in the depths of
          poverty. They are not walking about in sheepskins and goatskins,
          persecuted, afflicted, and tormented; but still they are hungry, and
          no man gives them to eat; they are thirsty, and no man furnishes them
          with drink, their fires are wasted in poverty and their years in
          distress. Some there are of God's children who were once in affluence
          but have been suddenly plunged into the lowest depths of penury; they
          knew what it was to be respected among the sons of men, but now they
          are among the dogs of the flock, and no man careth for them. There are
          some of us who are here present who have all that heart can wish: God
          hath given us food and raiment, the lines have fallen unto us in
          pleasant places, and we have a goodly heritage. Let us gratefully ask
          -- "Who maketh us to differ? "Let us recollect that all we have is the
          gift of his providence. Not to you, O my hands, do I sacrifice because
          ye have toiled for bread; not to you, O ye brains, will I offer
          incense, because ye have thought for my daily livelihood; not to you,
          O my lips, will I offer my adulation, because ye have been the means
          of furnishing me with words. No; unto God, who giveth power to get,
          and to have, and to enjoy; unto him be all the praise for what he hath
          done for us. Never let our songs cease, for his goodness is an ever
          flowing stream. Perhaps none of us can ever know, until the great day
          shall reveal it, how much some of God's servants are tried. To this
          day they have "perils by land, and perils by sea, and perils by false
          brethren;" to this hour they are pinched by want, they are deserted by
          friends, they know what despondency means, and all the ill which
          dejection and disappointment can bring to them; they have dived into
          the lowest depths of the sea of trouble, and have walked for many a
          league over the hot sand of the desert of affliction. And if God hath
          delivered us from these things, and hath made our path more pleasant,
          and hath led us beside the still waters, and into the green pastures,
          -- if he hath distinguished us by the common gifts of his providence
          above many others of his children who are far better and far more holy
          than we, what shall we say? It is owing only to his grace towards us,
          and we will not exalt ourselves above our fellows, we will not be
          high-minded, but condescend to men of low estate; we will not lift our
          necks with the proud, but we will bow down our brows with the humble;
          every man shall be called our brother,not merely those who are arrayed
          in goodly raiment, but those who are clothed in the habiliments of
          toil, they shall be confessed to be our kindred, sprung from the same
          stock; for what have we that we have not received, and what maketh us
          to differ from another? I wish that some of the stiff-necked gentry of
          our churches would at times recollect this. Their condition is smooth
          as oil, and as soft as young down, but their hearts are as high as
          poplars, and their manners as stiff as hedge-stakes. There have been
          many who would do well if they would learn that they have nothing
          beyond what God has given them. And the more God has given them, the
          more they are in debt. Why should a man boast because he is deeper in
          debt than another? Do the debtors in the Queen's Bench say to one
          another, "You are only a hundred pounds in debt, and I a thousand,
          therefore I am a greater gentleman than you?" I think not. But,
          nevertheless, if they did so, they would be as wise as men who boast
          beyond their fellow-creatures because they happen to have more of
          rank, wealth, honor, and position, in this world. "Who maketh thee to
          differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?"
        </p>
        <p>
          But the best way for you to feel this part of the discourse is, to go
          to-morrow into the hospital, and walk along the wards, and see how
          poor men's bodies suffer, and then go into the operating-room and see
          what flesh and blood may have to endure. Then when you have done, go
          round the neighborhood to see the sick who have lain for ten, or
          twelve, or fifteen years upon the same bed, and after that go and
          visit some of God's poverty-stricken children who just exist in this
          world, and it is but a bare existence, maintained on bread and butter
          and a little tea, and but too little of even such things as those. Go
          and see their poor, miserable, unfurnished rooms, their cellars and
          their attics, and that will be a better sermon to you than anything I
          can utter. You will come home and say, "Oh my God, I bless thee for
          thy kindness towards me. These temporal mercies which I once thought
          so little of, I must heartily blest thee for. I must thank thee for
          what thou hast given to me, and I will ascribe it all to thy love, for
          thou makest me to differ. I have nothing that I have not received."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But this is not the most important point for us to observe. We are
          now going to look at, not matters of providence, but the things of
          God's grace. Here it is that we who are now assembled as a church have
          most reason to bless God, and to say, "Who maketh us to differ from
          others?" Take, my dear friends, in your mind's eye the cases of the
          careless, the hardened, and the thoughtless, of even this present
          congregation. Side-by-side with you, my brother, there may sit a man,
          a woman, who is dead in trespasses and sins. To such the music of the
          gospel is like singing to a dead ear, and the dropping of the word is
          as dew upon a rock. There are many in this congregation whose position
          in society, and whose moral character are extremely excellent, and yet
          before God their state is awful. They attend the house of God as
          regularly as we do. They sing as we sing, sit as we sit, and come and
          go as we do, and yet are they without God and without hope in the
          world -- strangers from the commonwealth of Israel, and aliens from
          the covenant of promise. Yet what maketh us to differ? Why is it that
          I this day am not sitting down a callous hearer, hardened under the
          gospel? Why am I not at this very hour hearing the Word with my
          outward ear but rejecting it in my inward heart? Why is it that I have
          not been suffered to reject the invitation of Christ to despise his
          grace -- to go on, Sunday after Sunday, hearing the Word and yet being
          like the deaf adder to it. Oh, have I made myself to differ? God
          forbid that such a proud, blaspheming thought should defile our
          hearts. No, beloved;
        </p>
        <p>"Twas the same love which spread the feast,</p>
        <p>That sweetly forced us in;</p>
        <p>Else we had still refused to taste,</p>
        <p>And perished in our sin."</p>
        <p>
          The only reason, my brother, why thou art at this time an heir of God,
          a joint-heir with Christ, a partaker of sweet fellowship with Jesus,
          an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, is because HE hath made thee to
          differ. Thou wast an heir of wrath, even as others, born in sin and
          shapen in iniquity. Therefore must thou give all the glory to his holy
          name, and cry -- "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be all
          the praise." Even this one thought when fully masticated and digested
          might feed up our gratitude and make us humbly bow before the
          footstool of God's throne with joyful thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Will you please, however, to think of other cases? Who maketh thee
          to differ from others of this assembly who are more hardened than
          those to whom we have alluded? There are some men and women of whose
          salvation, if it were to be wrought by man, we must indeed utterly
          despair; for their hearts are harder than the most stubborn steel. The
          hammer of the Word makes no impression on such souls. The thunders of
          the law roll over their heads, but they can sleep in the midst of the
          tumult -- the lightnings of Sinai flash against their hearts, but even
          those mighty flames seem as if they recoiled from the attack, Do you
          not know such? they are your own children, your husband, your wife,
          some of your own family, and as you look upon them, though you have
          longed, prayed, and wept, and sighed for their souls, you are
          compelled to say in your heart, "I half fear that I shall never see
          them converted." You say with sorrow, "Oh, if they are saved it will
          be a wonder of divine grace indeed. Surely they will never yield their
          souls to God. They seem as callous as if their conscience were seared
          with a hot iron; they appear to have the stamp of condemnation upon
          their brow, as if they were marked and sealed, and had the earnest of
          the pit upon their hearts before they came there. Ay,but stop -- "Who
          maketh thee to differ?" Why am I not at this day among the most
          hardened of men? How is it that my heart is melted so that I can weep
          at the recollection of the Redeemer's suffering? Why is it that my
          conscience is tender, and that I am led to self-examination by a
          searching sermon? How is it that I know how to pray and to groan
          before God on account of sin? What has brought the water from these
          eyes, but the selfsame power which brought the water from the rock?
          And whathath put life into my heart but the self-same Omnipotence
          which scattered manna in a hungry desert? Our hearts had still been
          like the wild beasts of the forest, if it had not been for Divine
          grace. Oh! I beseech you, my dear friend, every time you see a
          hardened sinner, just say within yourself,"There is the picture of
          what I should have been, what I must have been, if all-subduing,
          all-conquering love had not melted and sanctified my heart." Take
          these two cases then, and you have, heaven knows, reason enough to
          sing to the praise of sovereign grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But now another, the lowest class of sinners do not mingle with our
          congregations, but are to be seen in our back streets and lanes, and
          sometimes in our highways. How frightful is the sin of drunkenness,
          which degrades a man into a beast, which sinks him lower than the
          brutes themselves! How shameful is the iniquity of blasphemy, which
          without any object or any chance of profit brings a curse upon its own
          head! How awful are the ways of the lascivious wretch who ruins both
          body and soul at once, and not content with his own destruction ruins
          others with him. Cases that come under our observation in the daily
          newspapers, and that assail us in our daily observation and hearing
          are too vile to be told. How often is our blood chilled with the sound
          of an imprecation, and how frequently our heart is made to palpitate
          with the daring impieties of the blasphemous. Now let us stop; "Who
          maketh thee to differ?" Let us recollect that if we live very near to
          Christ, we should have lived quite as near to hell if it had not been
          for saving grace. Some of you here present are special witnesses of
          this grace, for you have yourself experienced redemption from these
          iniquities. Look back some four years with some of you and recollect
          how different were your surroundings then to what they are now. Mayhap
          four years ago you were in the tap-room singing the song of the
          drunkard as readily as any; but a little while ago you cursed that
          Saviour whom now you love. Only a few months have flitted over your
          head since you ran with the multitude to do evil; but now,"Who maketh
          thee to differ?" "Who hath brought this miracle of grace. Who has led
          you to the stool of the penitent and the table of communion, who hath
          done it? Beloved, you are not slow to answer, for the verdict of your
          heart is undivided; you do not give the glory in part to man and in
          part to God. No, you cry loudly in your hearts, "Blessed be the God
          and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant
          mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of
          Jesus Christ from the dead." Ye are washed, ye are sanctified, and ye
          have been washed in the Redeemer's blood, and sanctified with the
          Spirit. Ye have been made to differ, and ye will confess it; ye have
          been made to differ by distinguishing grace, and distinguishing grace
          alone. And what upholds the rest of us from being what these my
          reclaimed brethren once were, and what they will become again unless
          saving grace keeps them? What preserves the preacher this day from
          being a lecturer to Infidels, dishonoring the grace of God which now
          he glories to magnify? What prevents the deacon from being an
          assistant in the courts of Satan? What forbids those who open the
          doors at the house of our God, and who serve him on the Sabbath-day,
          from being door-keepers in the tents of the sons of Belial? Why
          nothing; they had been there unless grace had prevented them. Grace
          hath done it, and nothing else. When we pass a prostitute in the
          street, we say, "O poor creature! I can pity you. I have not a harsh
          word for you, for I had been as you are had not God preserved me." And
          when you see the reeling drunkard, be not too hasty to condemn,
          recollect you had been as a beast before God unless the Lord had kept
          you, and when ye hear the oath and shudder at it, imagine not that you
          are superior in yourself to the man who curses God, for perhaps you
          once cursed him too; and certainly you would have done had not the
          Holy Spirit sanctified you and implanted in you a hatred of that which
          the wicked so greedily follow. Have you seen a man hanged for murder?
          Have you seen another transported for the most infamous of crimes? If
          you hear of one who sins against society so foully that mankind
          excommunicate him, pause, and say, "Oh! but I should have gone as low
          as that, I should have been as black as he, unless restraining grace
          had kept me back in my unregeneracy, and unless constraining grace had
          pushed me forward in the heavenly race, ever since I have known the
          will of Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And now we will pause again, and think over another evil which
          stares us in the face in connection with every church. There are most
          melancholy cases of backsliding in so large a church as this. We are
          compelled often to discover the character of men and women who once
          seemed fair for heaven, but who manifested that they never had the
          root of the matter in them. Oh! well did the poet say, --
        </p>
        <p>"When any turn from Zion's way,</p>
        <p>Alas! what numbers do!"</p>
        <p>
          No trial is greater to the true minister than the apostacy of his
          flock. All the rage of men is quite unable to bring tears to our eyes,
          but this has done it. Alas! when those whom I have loved have turned
          aside from the way of God, when those who have sat with us at the same
          table, and have joined with us in church communion, have gone out from
          us, and have brought dishonor upon the Church, and upon the name of
          Christ, there has been woe in my inmost spirit. Sometimes there are
          cases as glaring as they are painful, and as vile as they are
          grievous. Some of those, who were once in the midst of God's
          sanctuary, have become drunkards and whoremongers -- and God in heaven
          only knows what. They have sinned against everything that is seemly,
          as well as everything that is holy. At the recollection of these our
          eyes are filled with tears. "Oh that our head were waters, and our
          eyes fountains of tears, that we might weep day and night for the
          slain of the daughter of our people." No mischief-makers are so
          powerful as deserters. None cause so much agony as those who have
          nestled beneath our wings, and then have flown away to feed with
          carrion vultures on the putrid carcases of lust and sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now let us pause. How is it that the minister has not forsaken his
          profession, and gone back like a dog to his vomit, and like the sow
          that was washed to her wallowing in the mire? How is it that the
          deacons of this church have not turned aside unto crooked ways, and
          denied the faith, and become worse than infidels? How is it that so
          many members of this church have been kept so that the wicked one
          toucheth them not? O beloved! I can say for myself, I am a continual
          miracle of divine grace. If thou leave me, Lord, for a moment, I am
          utterly undone.
        </p>
        <p>"Leave, O leave me not alone!</p>
        <p>Still support and comfort me"</p>
        <p>
          Let Abraham be deserted by his God, he equivocates and denies his
          wife. Let Noah be deserted, he becomes a drunkard, and is naked to his
          shame. Let Lot be left awhile, and, filled with wine, he revels in
          incestuous embraces, and the fruit of his body becomes a testimony to
          his disgrace. Nay, let David, the man after God's own heart, be left,
          and Uriah's wife shall soon show the world that the man after God's
          own heart hath still an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the
          living God. Oh! well doth the poet put it --
        </p>
        <p>"Methinks I hear the Saviour say,</p>
        <p>Wilt thou forsake me too?"</p>
        <p>And now let our conscience answer: --</p>
        <p>"Ah, Lord! with such a heart as mine,</p>
        <p>Unless thou hold me fast,</p>
        <p>I feel I must, I shall decline</p>
        <p>And prove like them at last."</p>
        <p>
          Oh be not rashly self-confident, Christian man. Be as confident as you
          can in your God, but be distrustful of yourself. Ye may yet become all
          that is vile and vicious, unless sovereign grace prevent and keep you
          to the end. But remember if you have been preserved, the crown of your
          keeping belongs to the Shepherd of lsrael, and ye know who that is.
          For he hath said "I the Lord do keep it. I will water it every moment:
          lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." "Ye know who is able
          to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before his
          presence with exceeding great joy." Then give all glory to the King
          immortal, invisible, the only wise God your Saviour, who has kept you
          thus.

          6. Allow me one more contrast; once again let your gratitude go with
          me since you and I have joined the church how many who were once our
          companions have been damned whilst we have been saved, how many who
          were no worse than we were by nature have sunk into the lowest pit of
          hell. Conceive their unutterable torments; imagine their inconceivable
          woes; depict before the eye of your fancy their indescribable agonies.
          Descend in spirit for a moment to the gates of fire; enter into the
          abode of despair where justice reigns supreme on her iron throne; pass
          by the dreary cell of those who are everlastingly damned. Behold the
          twisting of that worm that never dies, and the bleeding hearts that
          are crushed within its coils. Look ye at that flame unquenchable and
          behold the souls that are sweltering there in torments to us unknown,
          and look if ye can look, but ye cannot look, for your eyes would be
          stricken with blindness if ye could see their torments. Your hair
          should be blanched withbut a moment of that horrible exhibition. Ah!
          while you stand then and think on that region of death, despair, and
          damnation, recollect that you would have been there if it had not been
          for sovereign grace. You have a harp prepared for you in heaven, a
          crown laid up for you when you have finished your course. You have a
          mansion, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Oh, why
          is it you are not already a fiend; who is it that has given you a good
          hope through grace that you shall never come into that place of
          torment. Oh! tell it the wide world over. Tell it in time and in
          eternity, free grace hath done it. Free grace hath done it from the
          first to the last. I was a brand in the fire, but he plucked me from
          the burning, quenched me in his blood, and now he declares I shall be
          with him for ever in heaven. But oh! pause brethren and think that
          some of your former pot-companions, some of the companions of your
          revere and debaucheries are now in hell, and you are not there, and by
          the grace of God never will be there. Oh! why this, why this? Blessed
          be the Lord my God from this time forth and for ever. Praise ye his
          name. Grace has done it. Grace has done it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, I never shall wear the chain, I ne'er shall be stretched upon that
          rack, nor feel that fire --
        </p>
        <p>"But I shall see his face,</p>
        <p>And never, never sin,</p>
        <p>But from the rivers of his grace</p>
        <p>Drink endless pleasures in."</p>
        <p>
          But I most confidently proclaim that the reason why I shall escape and
          shall be glorified, is not to be found in me, but in him. He hath made
          me to differ. I have nothing but what I have received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now what shall we say to these things. If God has made you to differ,
          the first prayer we should now utter should be, "Lord, humble us. Take
          away pride out of us. O God forgive us, that such beasts as we are
          should ever be proud." We might have been with our father the devil at
          this very hour, if it had not been for Divine love. And if we are now
          in the house of our Father which is in heaven shall we be proud?
          Avaunt thou monster! Go and dwell with the Pharisee. Pride agreeth
          well enough with the man who has in his own esteem been always
          virtuous. Go thou away and live with him who has had good works from
          the first day until now; but away from me.
        </p>
        <p>"I the chief of sinners am,"</p>
        <p>
          and saved by sovereign grace shall I be proud. It is not fit that thou
          shouldest live in my heart, thou monster! Begone! Begonel Find a
          fitter habitation than my soul. Should I be proud after such mercy,
          after such ill-deserving, but such God-receiving. Begone, pride!
          Begone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another lesson: if God alone hath made us to differ, why may he not
          make others to differ too? "After the Lord saved me," said one, "I
          never despaired of anybody;" and let us each say so too. If you were
          brought in why not another? Will you ever give up praying for anybody
          now that you are saved? I once heard one say concerning his child, "I
          think I must give her up, I can scarcely think she ever will be
          converted." Why you have been pardoned yourself; and if the Lord can
          do that, he can do anything. I am sure if the Lord has brought me to
          his feet there does not remain in the world a case that can ever equal
          mine; if he has brought me to receive his free grace, his sovereign
          love, his precious blood, and hath made me to love him, then there can
          be nothing too hard for him. O Lord, if thou hast melted this metal
          heart, and dissolved this stony soul, thou canst break anything. If
          thou hast broken the northern iron and the steel, then what remains
          beyond thy power? Go back then, Christian, armed with this fact, that
          God who hath made thee to differ can make anybody to differ. There can
          be no case beyond his strength; if he brought you in he can bring all
          in. If he doth but stretch out his hand, no man need despair.
          Therefore, "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold
          not thine hand: for thou knowest not whither shall prosper, either
          this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, who hath made me to differ? Hath my Lord done it? -- then let
          me serve him more than others. There was a question asked once by our
          Saviour, "What do ye more than others?" That question might well be
          put to each child of God here present. My dear friends, we must not be
          content with doing as much as other people do; in fact, we must never
          be contented with our doings at all, but always be trying to do more
          for him who hath done so much for us. Should I give my body to be
          burned, my flesh piecemeal to the knife, my nerves to the rack, and my
          heart to the spear, yet should I not give him all that he deserveth.
          No, if I should pass through the horrors of martyrdom, it were but a
          poor tribute to love so amazing, so divine. What are you doing my
          friends, what are you doing my brothers and sisters for Christ? But I
          will not name you, I censure myself if I censure you; but I will
          confess my own iniquities and leave you to confess yours. I do try to
          serve my Master, but I do not serve him as I would. Each act that I
          perform is marred, either by want of prayer for a blessing upon it, by
          want of faith in my Lord, or by pride in looking back upon it. I find
          too continually a tendency to serve myself instead of serving Christ,
          a constant longing rather to get through the work than to do it
          accceptably. And oh! when I think upon all, I must say I am an
          unprofitable servant. Have mercy O gracious Lord on my good works as
          well as on my bad ones, for my good works are but bad in the best and
          cannot be acceptable in themselves. I am certain some of you have a
          little more need to say that than I have. Let us cease boasting any
          more. I know there are some here who are not serving Christ; some
          members in this church are doing nothing. You have not thought of
          doing anything for Christ, have you? You pay your regular
          subscriptions, you do what you are told to do, but do you give to
          Christ secretly? do you devote your substance unto him when no one
          knows it? do you spend your time for him? have you chosen a sphere,
          and have you said, "This is my work, and by the grace of God I will do
          it." Oh! ye cannot tell how much there is to do, and how few, there
          are to do it. I would I could have a church all alive, all active, so
          that there never could be a want but those who have would be ready to
          supply, and never a work but those who are qualified would be ready to
          fulfll. Never fear but we should find too many rather than too few to
          aid its accomplishment. Oh that we had the good spirit of the ancient
          church, the spirit to propagate our Christianity everywhere. There
          needs to be in many of the suburbs of London fresh gospel churches
          springing up. I can point to many places in my own vicinity, seven or
          eight, nine or ten in a row, where there is a chapel needed. In each
          place there are believers living, who do not think about uniting to
          establish a fresh cause; but as long as their peculiar wants are
          satisfied, by journeying a long way off perhaps, they forget the
          hundreds and thousands who are pressing around them. Oh! there is much
          to be done, and very little time to do it in. A very few weeks, and
          those of us who have been loved more than others, those of us who have
          thought we could wash Christ's feet with our tears, and wipe them with
          the hair of our heads, will hare no more opportunities for spreading
          the name and fame of our glorious Redeemer. Let us give of our
          substance to his cause, give of our time to his service and have our
          hearts in his love, and so shall we be blessed, for in returning
          Christ's love we shall feel that his love is shed abroad more fully in
          our hearts and more fully in our understandings.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Holy Spirit add his blessing upon these broken words -- they
          have been broken because they have broken my heart, and therefore I
          could not help their coming out in a broken way. God accept them; and
          dear brothers and sisters, may he bless them to you by helping you to
          love him more, who is my hope, my joy, my consolation, and my all.
