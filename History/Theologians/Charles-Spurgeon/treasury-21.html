          SUBJECT. The title gives us but little information; it is simply,<b>
            To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David</b
          >. Probably written by David, sung by David, relating to David, and
          <i
            >intended by David to refer in its fullest reach of meaning to
            David's Lord</i
          >. It is evidently the fit companion of Psalm Twenty, and is in its
          proper position next to it. Psalm Twenty anticipates what this regards
          as realized. If we pray today for a benefit and receive it, we must,
          before the sun goes down, praise God for that mercy, or we deserve to
          be denied the next time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It has been called David's triumphant song, and we may remember it as
          The Royal Triumphal Ode. "The king" is most prominent throughout, and
          we shall read it to true profit if our meditation of Him shall be
          sweet while perusing it. We must crown him with the glory of our
          salvation; singing of his love, and praising his power. The next psalm
          will take us to the foot of the cross, this introduces us to the steps
          of the throne.

        >Jesus is a Royal Personage. The question, "Are you a King then?"
        received a full answer from the Savior's lips: "You say that I am a
        King. To this end was I born, and for this purpose came I into the
        world, that I might bear witness unto the truth." He is not merely
        <i>a</i> King, but <i> the </i>King—King over minds and hearts,
        <i>reigning with a dominion of love</i>, before which all other rule is
        but mere brute force.
        <p align="justify">

          <i

          Jesus has wrought out the salvation of his people, but as a man he
          found his strength in Jehovah his God, to whom he addressed himself in
          prayer upon the lonely mountain's side, and in the garden's solitary
          gloom. That strength so abundantly given is here gratefully
          acknowledged, and made the subject of joy. The Man of Sorrows is now
          anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows. Returned in
          triumph from the overthrow of all his foes, he offers his own
          rapturous "You, O God, we praise" in the temple above, and joys in the
          power of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Herein let every subject of King Jesus imitate the King; let us lean
          upon Jehovah's strength, let us joy in it by unstaggering faith, let
          us exult in it in our thankful songs. Jesus not only has thus
          rejoiced, but he shall do so as he sees
          <i
            >the power of divine grace bringing out from their sinful
            hiding-places the purchase of his soul's travail</i
          >. We also shall rejoice more and more as we learn by experience more
          and more fully the strength of the arm of our covenant God. Our
          weakness unstrings our harps, but his strength tunes them anew. If we
          cannot sing a note in honor of our own strength, we can at any rate
          rejoice in our omnipotent God.

        of wonder: "How greatly!" The rejoicing of our risen Lord must, like his
        agony, be unutterable. If the mountains of his joy rise in proportion to
        the depth of the valleys of his grief, then his sacred bliss is high as
        the seventh Heaven. 'For the joy which was set before him as he endured
        the cross, despising the shame,'—and now that joy daily grows, for he
        rests in his love and rejoices over his redeemed with singing, as in due
        order they are brought to find their salvation in his blood.
        <p align="justify">
          Let us with our Lord rejoice in salvation, as coming from God, as
          coming to us, as extending itself to others, and as soon to encompass
          all lands. We need not be afraid of too much rejoicing in this
          respect; this solid foundation will well sustain the loftiest edifice
          of joy. The shoutings of the early Methodists in the excitement of the
          joy were far more pardonable than our own lukewarmness.

          </p></b
        >
        The word <i>prevent </i>formerly signified to <i>precede </i>
        or go before, and assuredly Jehovah preceded his Son with blessings.
        Before he died saints were saved by the anticipated merit of his death,
        before he came believers saw his day and were glad, and he himself had
        his delights with the sons of men. The Father is so willing to give
        blessings through his Son, that instead of his being constrained to
        bestow his grace, he outstrips the Mediatorial march of mercy. "I say
        not that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himself loves
        you."
        <p align="justify">
          Before Jesus calls the Father answers, and while he is yet speaking,
          he hears.

            >Mercies may be bought with blood, but they are also freely given. </i
          >The love of Jehovah is not caused by the Redeemer's sacrifice, but
          that love, with its blessings of goodness, preceded the great
          atonement, and provided it for our salvation.

          Reader, it will be a happy thing for you if, like your Lord, you can
          see both providence and grace preceding you, forestalling your needs,
          and preparing your path. Mercy, in the case of many of us, ran before
          our desires and prayers, and it ever outruns our endeavors and
          expectancies, and even our hopes are left to lag behind. Prevenient
          grace deserves a song; we may make one out of this sentence—let us
          try. All our mercies are to be viewed as "blessings;" gifts of a
          blessed God, meant to make us blessed; they are "blessings of
          goodness," not of merit, but of free grace; and they come to us in a
          preceding way, a way of prudent foresight, such as only preceding love
          could have arranged. In this light the verse is itself a sonnet!

          <p align="justify">"You set a crown of pure gold on his head."</p></b
        ><i>Jesus wore the thorn-crown—but now wears the glory-crown. </i>It is
        a "crown," indicating royal nature, imperial power, deserved honor,
        glorious conquest, and divine government. The crown is of the richest,
        rarest, most resplendent, and most lasting order, "gold," and that gold
        of the most refined and valuable sort, "pure gold," to indicate the
        excellence of his dominion.
        <p align="justify">
          This crown is set upon his head most firmly, and whereas other
          monarchs find their diadems fitting loosely, his is fixed so that no
          power can move it, for Jehovah himself has set it upon his brow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Napoleon crowned himself, but Jehovah crowned the Lord Jesus; the

          dominion.

        <p align="justify">
          Some versions read, "a crown of precious stones;" this may remind us
          of those beloved ones who shall be as jewels in his crown, of whom he
          has said, "They shall be mine in the day when I make up my jewels!"

        >
        The first words may suit King David, but the length of days forever and
        ever can only refer to the King Messiah. Jesus, as man, prayed for
        resurrection and he received it, and now possesses it in immortality. He
        died once, but being raised from the dead he dies no more. "Because I
        live, you shall live also," is the delightful intimation which the
        Savior gives us, that we are partakers of his eternal life. We had never
        found this jewel, if he had not rolled away the stone which covered it.

        Immanuel now bears the palm—he once bore the cross. The Father has
        glorified the Son, so that there is no glory like unto that which

        Revelation. See his dominion as it stretches from sea to sea. See his

        Man of Nazareth!
        <p align="justify">
          Mark, reader: salvation is ascribed to God; and thus the Son, as our

        Parkhurst reads, "splendor and beauty." These are put upon Jesus as
        chains of gold, and stars and tokens of honor are placed upon princes
        and great men. As the wood of the tabernacle was overlaid with pure
        gold, so is Jesus covered with glory and honor. If there is a far more
        exceeding and eternal weight of glory for his humble followers—then what
        must there be for our Lord himself! The whole weight of sin was laid
        upon him; it is but fit that the full measure of the glory of bearing it
        away should be laid upon the same beloved person. A glory commensurate
        with his shame he must and will receive, for well has he earned it.

        is noted with calm thanksgiving. "You have put down the mighty from
        their seats," is a note of the same song which sings, "and have exalted
        them of low degree."

          We <i>pity </i>the lost for they are men—but we cannot pity them as
          enemies of Christ.
          <i>None can escape from the wrath of the victorious King</i>, nor is
          it desirable that they should. Without looking for his flying foes he
          will find them with his hand, for his presence is about and around
          them. In vain shall any hope for escape,
          <i
            >he will find out all, and be able to punish all, and that too with

        <p align="justify">
          The finding out relates, we think, not only to the discovery of the
          hiding places of the haters of God, but to the touching of them in
          their tenderest parts, so as to cause the severest suffering. When he
          appears to judge the world, hard hearts will be subdued into terror,
          and proud spirits humbled into shame. He who has the key of human
          nature can touch all its springs at his will, and find out the means
          of bringing the utmost confusion and terror upon
          <i>those who aforetime boastfully expressed their hatred of him</i>.

          Doubtless the blessing of God is often handed down by the righteous to
          their sons, as almost a heirloom in the family—while the dying sinner

        and yet hate it. Intentional evil has a virus in it which is not found
        in sins of ignorance; now as ungodly men with malice aforethought attack
        the gospel of Christ, their crime is great, and their punishment will be
        proportionate. The words "against you" show us that he who intends evil

        deserves, we may invoke his own power to aid us. Be high, O God, but do
