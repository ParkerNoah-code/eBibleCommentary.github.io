          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician, a Psalm or Song of David</b>. We have
          already said enough upon this title when dealing with Psalms 65 and
          66. The present is obviously a song to be sung at the removal of the
          ark; and in all probability was rehearsed when David conducted it with
          holy joy from the house of Obed-Edom to the prepared place on Mount
          Zion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a most soul stirring hymn. The first verses were often the
          battle song of the Covenanters and Ironsides. The whole Psalm fitly
          pictures the way of the Lord Jesus among his saints, and his ascent to
          glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalm is at once surpassingly excellent and difficult. Its
          darkness in some stanzas is utterly impenetrable. Well does a German
          critic speak of it as a Titan very hard to master. Our slender
          scholarship has utterly failed us and we have had to follow a surer
          Guide. We trust our thoughts may not however prove unprofitable.

          DIVISION. With the words of the first two verses the ark is uplifted,
          and the procession begins to move.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In verses 3-6, the godly in the assembly are exhorted to commence
          their joyous songs, and arguments are adduced to help their joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Then the glorious march of Jehovah in the wilderness is sung in verses
          7-10,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          and his victories in war are celebrated in verses 11-14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The joyous shouts are louder as Zion comes in sight, and the ark is
          borne up the hill in verses 15-19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          On the summit of the mount the priests sing a hymn concerning the
          Lord's goodness and justice; the safety of his friends, and ruin of
          his foes in verses 20-23.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Meanwhile the procession is described as it winds up the hill in
          verses 24-27.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The poet anticipates a time of wider conquest in verses 28-31.

          And concludes with a noble burst of song unto Jehovah.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Let God arise.</p></b> In some such
        words Moses spoke when the cloud moved onward, and the ark was carried
        forward. The ark would have been a poor leader if the Lord had not been
        present with the symbol.
        <p align="justify">
          Before we move, we should always desire to see the Lord lead the way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The words suppose the Lord to have been passive for awhile, allowing
          his enemies to rage, but restraining his power. Israel beseeches him
          to "arise," as elsewhere to "awake," "gird on his sword," and other
          similar expressions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We, also, may thus importunately cry unto the Lord, that he would be
          pleased to make bare his arm, and plead his own cause.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Let his enemies be scattered.</p></b> Our
        glorious Captain of the vanguard clears the way readily, however many
        may seek to obstruct it; he has but to arise, and they flee.
        <p align="justify">
          He has easily over thrown his foes in days of yore, and will do so all
          through the ages to come. Sin, death, and Hell know the terror of his
          arm; their ranks are broken at his approach. Our enemies are his
          enemies, and in this is our confidence of victory.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Let them also that hate him flee before him.</p></b
        >To hate the infinitely good God is infamous, and the worst punishment
        is not too severe. Hatred of God is impotent. His proudest foes can do
        him no injury. Alarmed beyond measure, they shall flee before it comes
        to blows. Long before the army of Israel can come into the fray, the
        haters of God shall flee before Him who is the champion of his chosen.
        He comes, he sees, he conquers.
        <p align="justify">
          How fitting a prayer is this for the commencement of a revival! How it
          suggests the true mode of conducting one—the Lord leads the way, his
          people follow, the enemies flee.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. As smoke is driven away.</p></b> Easily
        the wind chases the smoke, completely it removes it, no trace is left;
        so, Lord, do you to the foes of your people. They fume in pride, they
        darken the sky with their malice, they mount higher and higher in
        arrogance, they defile wherever they prevail. Lord, let your breath,
        your Spirit, your Providence, make them to vanish forever from the march
        of your people.
        <p align="justify">
          Philosophic skepticism is as flimsy and as foul as smoke; may the Lord
          deliver his Church from the reek of it.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the
            presence of God.

        >
        Wax is hard when by itself, but put it to the fire, how soft it is.
        <p align="justify">
          Just so, wicked men are haughty until they come into contact with the
          Lord, and then they faint for fear; their hearts melt like wax when
          they feel the power of his anger.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wax, also, burns and passes away; the candle is utterly consumed by
          the flame. So shall all the boastful power of the opposers of the
          gospel be as a thing of nothing. Rome, like the candles on her altars,
          shall dissolve, and with equal certainty shall infidelity disappear.
          Israel saw, in the ark, God on the mercy-seat—power in connection with
          propitiation—and they rejoiced in the omnipotence of such a
          manifestation. This is even more clearly the confidence of the New
          Testament church, for we see Jesus, the appointed atonement, clothed
          with glory and majesty, and before his advance all opposition melts
          like snow in the sun; the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
          hands. When he comes by his Holy Spirit, conquest is the result; and
          when he arises in person, his foes shall utterly perish.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. But let the righteous be glad.</p></b
        >The presence of God on the throne of grace is an overflowing source of
        delight to the godly; let them not fail to drink of the streams which
        are meant to make them glad.
        <b> <p align="justify">Let them rejoice before God.</p></b> The
        courtiers of the happy God should wear the garments of gladness, for in
        his presence is fullness of joy. That presence, which is the dread and
        death of the wicked—is the desire and delight of the saints.
        <b> <p align="justify">Yes, let them exceedingly rejoice.</p></b> Let
        them dance with all their might, as David did, for very joy. No bounds
        should be set to joy in the Lord. "Again, I say, rejoice!" says the
        apostle, as if he would have us add joy to joy without measure or pause.
        <p align="justify">
          When God is seen to shine propitious from above the mercy-seat in the
          person of our Immanuel, our hearts must needs leap within us with
          exultation, if we are indeed among those made righteous in his
          righteousness, and sanctified by his Spirit. Move on, O army of the
          living God, with shouts of abounding triumph, for Jesus leads the van.

        in storm, and earth has seen him marching over its plains with majesty.
        <p align="justify">
          The Hebrew seems to be: "Cast up a highway for him who marches through
          the wilderness," in allusion to the wanderings of the tribes in the
          desert. The marches of God were in the waste howling wilderness. His
          eternal power and Godhead were there displayed in his feeding, ruling,
          and protecting the vast hosts which he had brought out of Egypt. The
          ark brought all this to remembrance, and suggested it as a theme for
          song.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The name JAH is an abbreviation of the name Jehovah; it is not a
          diminution of that name, but an intensified word, containing in it the
          essence of the longer, august title. It only occurs here in our
          version of Scripture, except in connection with other words such as
          HalleluJAH.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And rejoice before him.</p></b>In the presence of
        him who marched so gloriously at the head of the elect nation, it is
        most fitting that all his people should display a holy delight. We ought
        to avoid dullness in our worship. Our songs should be weighty with
        solemnity, but not heavy with sadness. Angels are nearer the throne than
        we, but their deepest awe is consonant with the purest bliss. Our sense
        of divine greatness must not minister terror but gladness to our
        souls—we should rejoice before him.
        <p align="justify">
          It should be our wish and prayer, that in this wilderness world, a
          highway may be prepared for the God of grace. "Prepare the way of the
          Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God!" is the cry
          of gospel heralds, and we must all zealously aim at obedience thereto;
          for where the God of the mercy-seat comes, blessings innumerable are
          given to the sons of men.
        </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is
            God in his holy habitation.
          </p></b
        >
        In the wilderness the people were like an orphan nation, but God was
        more than a father to them. As the generation which came out of Egypt
        gradually died away, there were many widows and fatherless ones in the
        camp, but they suffered no want or wrong, for the righteous laws and the
        just administrators whom God had appointed, looked well to the interests
        of the needy.
        <p align="justify">
          The tabernacle was the Palace of Justice; the ark was the seat of the
          great King. This was a great cause for joy to Israel, that they were
          ruled by the ONE who would not allow the poor and needy to be
          oppressed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To this day and for ever, God is, and will be, the peculiar guardian
          of the defenseless. He is the President of Orphanages, the Protector
          of Widows. He is so <i>glorious </i>that he rides on the heavens, but
          so <i>compassionate </i>that he remembers the poor of the earth. How
          zealously ought his church to cherish those who are here marked out as
          Jehovah's especial charge. Does he not here in effect say, "Feed my
          lambs"? Blessed duty, it shall be our privilege to make this one of
          our life's dearest objects.

          The reader is warned against misquoting this verse; it is generally

          left as God gave it.

          <p align="justify">Verse 6. God sets the solitary in families.</p></b
        >
        The people had been sundered and scattered over Egypt; family ties had
        been disregarded, and affections crushed. But when the people escaped
        from Pharaoh they came together again, and all the fond associations of
        household life were restored. This was a great joy.

        <p align="justify">
          The solitary heart, convinced of sin and made to pine alone, is
          admitted into the family of the Firstborn. The fettered spirit is set
          free, and its prison broken down, when sin is forgiven; and for all
          this, God is to be greatly extolled, for he has done it, and magnified
          the glory of his grace.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">But the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</p></b>
        If any find the rule of Jehovah to be irksome, it is because their
        rebellious spirits kick against his power. Israel did not find the
        desert dry, for the smitten rock gave forth its streams; but even in
        Canaan itself men were consumed with famine, because they cast off their
        allegiance to their covenant God. Even where God is revealed on the
        mercy-seat, some men persist in rebellion, and such need not wonder if
        they find no peace, no comfort, no joy, even where all these abound.
        <p align="justify">
          Justice is the rule of the Lord's kingdom, and hence there is no
          provision for the unjust to indulge their evil lustings<i
            >. A perfect earth, and even Heaven itself, would be a dry land to
            those who can only drink of the waters of sin</i

          rebels cry, "what a weariness it is!" and, under the most soul
          sustaining ministry, they complain of "the foolishness of preaching."
          When a man has a rebellious heart, he must of necessity find all
          around him a dry land.

        He was the Commander in chief of Israel, from whom they received all
        orders, and the march was therefore his march. "His stately step the
        region drear beheld." We may speak, if we will, of the "wanderings of
        the children of Israel," but we must not think them purposeless
        strayings, they were in reality a well arranged and well considered
        march. <b> <p align="justify">SELAH.</p></b> This seems an odd place for
        a musical pause or direction, but it is better to break a sentence than
        spoil praise. The sense is about to be superlatively grand, and,
        therefore, the selah intimates the fact to the players and singers, that
        they may with suitable solemnity perform their parts. It is never
        untimely to remind a congregation that

        quaked greatly." That hill, so lone and high, bowed before the
        manifested God. The God of Israel. The one only living and true God,
        whom Israel worshiped, and who had chosen that nation to be his own
        above all the nations of the earth. The passage is so sublime, that it
        would be difficult to find its equal. May the reader's heart adore the
        God before whom the unconscious earth and sky act as if they recognized
        their Maker and were moved with a tremor of reverence.

          In like manner, to this day, the elect of God in this wilderness state
          are apt to become tired and faint, but their ever loving Jehovah comes
          in with timely supports, cheers the faint, strengthens the weak, and
          refreshes the hungry; so that once again, when the silver trumpets
          sound, the church militant advances with bold and firm step towards

        The victory was due to the Almighty arm alone; he scattered the haughty

          The word white appears to be imported into the text, and by leaving it

          suddenly swept bare by a gust of wind, so that the snow was driven
          hither and thither into the air like the down of thistles, or the

          Another opinion is, that Salmon was covered with dark forests, and
          appeared black, but presented quite another aspect when the snow
          covered it, and that by this noteworthy change from somber shade to
          gleaming whiteness, the poet sets forth the change from war to peace.

        accurately, "a hill of God is Bashan," that is to say, Bashan is an

        greater mount, but not so glorious, for the Lord in choosing Zion had
        exalted it above the loftier hills.

        trophies of his mighty grace. From the gracious character of his reign,
        it comes to pass that to be led into captivity by him is for our
        captivity to cease, or to be itself led captive; a glorious result

          called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make
          war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
          crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
          And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is
          called The Word of God... And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and
          he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the

          that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken,
          and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with
