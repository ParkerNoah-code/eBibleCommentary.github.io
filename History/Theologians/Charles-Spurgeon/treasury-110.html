            <p align="justify">
              This Psalm begins and ends with Hallelujah, "Praise the Lord!" The
              space between these two descriptions of praise is filled up with
              the mournful details of Israel's sin—and the extraordinary
              patience of God. Truly we do well to bless the Lord both at the
              beginning and the end of our meditations when
              <i>sin and grace are the themes</i>.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              This sacred song is occupied with the historical part of the Old
              Testament, and is one of many which are thus composed. Surely this
              should be a sufficient rebuke to those who speak slightingly of
              the historical Scriptures; it in becomes a child of God to think
              lightly of that which the Holy Spirit so frequently uses for our
              instruction. What other Scriptures had David beside those very
              histories which are so depreciated, and yet he esteemed them
              beyond his necessary food, and made them his songs in the house of
              his pilgrimage?
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Israel's history is here written with the view of showing human
              sin, even as the preceding psalm was composed to magnify divine
              goodness. It is, in fact, a national confession, and includes an
              acknowledgment of the transgressions of Israel in <i>Egypt</i>, in
              the <i> wilderness</i>, and in <i>Canaan</i>—with devout petitions
              for forgiveness such as rendered the Psalm suitable for use in all
              following generations, and especially in times of national
              captivity.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              It was probably written by David—at any rate its first and last
              two verses are to be found in that sacred song which David
              delivered to Asaph when he brought up the ark of the Lord (1
              Chronicles 16:34-36).
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              While we are studying this holy Psalm,
              <i
                >let us all along see ourselves in the Lord's ancient people,
                and bemoan our own provocations of the Most High, at the same
                time admiring his infinite patience, and adoring him because of
                it. </i

              gratitude.

              Then comes the story of the nation's sins, which continues until
              the closing prayer and praise of the last two verses. While making
              confession the Psalmist acknowledges:
            </p>

              the sins committed in <i>Egypt </i>and at the

            <p align="justify">

            </b>
            <p align="justify">
              Praise Jah! This song is for the assembled people, and they are
              all exhorted to join in praise to Jehovah. It is not fit for a few
              to praise and the rest to be silent; but all should join. If David
              were present in churches where quartets and choirs carry on all
              the singing, he would turn to the congregation and say, "Praise
              the Lord."
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Our meditation dwells upon human sin; but on all occasions and in
              all occupations it is seasonable and profitable to praise the
              Lord.

            </b>
            <p align="justify">
              To us needy creatures the goodness of God is the first attribute
              which excites praise, and that praise takes the form of gratitude.
              We praise the Lord truly when we give him thanks for what we have
              received from his goodness. Let us never be slow to return unto
              the Lord our praise; to thank him is the least we can do—let us
              not neglect it.

              <p align="justify">For his mercy endures forever.</p>

            <p align="justify">
              Goodness towards sinners assumes the form of mercy, mercy should
              therefore be a leading note in our song.
              <i
                >Since man ceases not to be sinful, it is a great blessing that
                Jehovah ceases not to be merciful</i
              >. From age to age the Lord deals graciously with his church, and
              to every individual in it he is constant and faithful in his
              grace, even for evermore.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              In a short space we have here two arguments for praise, "for he is
              good; for his mercy endures forever," and these two arguments are
              themselves praises.
              <i
                >The very best language of adoration is that which adoringly in
                the plainest words sets forth the simple truth with regard to
                our great Lord</i
              >. No rhetorical flourishes or poetic hyperboles are needed, the
              bare facts are sublime poetry, and the narration of them with
              reverence is the essence of adoration.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              This first verse is the text of all that follows; we are now to
              see how from generation to generation the mercy of God endured to
              his chosen people.

              What tongue of men or angels can duly describe the great displays

              To declare his works is the same thing as to praise him, for his
              own doings are his best commendation. We cannot say one tenth so
              much for him as his own character and acts have already done.
              Those who praise the Lord have an infinite subject, a subject
              which will not be exhausted throughout eternity by the most
              enlarged intellects, nay, nor by the whole multitude of the
              redeemed, though no man can number them.

            <p align="justify">
              The questions of this verse never can be answered; their challenge
              can never be accepted, except in that humble measure which can be
              reached by a holy life and a grateful heart.

              Since the Lord is so good and so worthy to be praised, it must be
              for our happiness to obey him. Multiplied are the blessings which
              must descend upon the whole company of the keepers of the way of
              justice, and especially upon that one rare man who at all times
              follows that which is right.
            </p>
            <i> <p align="justify">Holiness is happiness</p></i>. The way of
            right is the way of peace. Yet men leave this road, and prefer the
            paths of the destroyer. Hence the story which follows is in sad
            contrast with the happiness here depicted, because
            <i
              >the way of Israel was not that of judgment and righteousness—but
              that of folly and iniquity</i

            <p align="justify">
              The Psalmist, while contemplating the perfections of God, was
              impressed with the feeling that the servants of such a being must
              be happy, and when he looked around and saw how the tribes of old
              prospered when they obeyed, and suffered when they sinned—he was
              still more fully assured of the truth of his conclusion. O could
              we but be free of sin—we would be rid of sorrow! We would not only
              be just—but "keep judgment"; we would not be content with
              occasionally acting rightly—but would "do justice at all times."

              die as they die. This feeling would prevent our wishing to escape
              trial, persecution, and chastisement; these have fallen to the lot

              Sometimes the second prayer of this verse seems to be too great

              Here begins a long and particular confession. Confession of sin is
              the readiest way to secure an answer to the prayer of verse 4; God
              visits with his salvation the soul which acknowledges its need of
              a Savior.

              Men may be said to have sinned with their fathers when they
              imitate them, when they follow the same objects, and make their
              own lives to be mere continuations of the follies of their sires.
              Moreover, Israel was but one nation in all time, and the
              confession which follows sets forth the <i>national </i>rather
              than the personal sin of the Lord's people. They enjoyed national
              <i>privileges</i>, and therefore they shared in national

              lessons, and their revelation of the divine power and justice—they
              were unable to perceive. A long sojourn among idolaters had
