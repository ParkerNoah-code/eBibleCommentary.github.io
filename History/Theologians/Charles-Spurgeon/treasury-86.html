          <p align="justify">
            This is the last occasion upon which we shall meet with this
            eloquent writer. The patriotic poet sings again of wars and dangers
            imminent, but it is no godless song of a thoughtless nation entering
            upon war with a light heart. Asaph the seer is well aware of the
            serious dangers arising from the powerful confederate nations, but
            his soul in faith stays itself upon Jehovah, while as a poet
            preacher he excites his countrymen to prayer by means of this sacred
            lyric. The Asaph who penned this song was in all probability the
            person referred to in 2 Chr. 20:14, for the internal evidence
            referring the subject of the Psalm to the times of Jehoshaphat is
            overwhelming. The division in the camp of the confederate peoples in
            the wilderness of Tekoa not only broke up their league, but led to a
            mutual slaughter, which crippled the power of some of the nations
            for many years after. They thought to destroy Israel and destroyed
            each other.

            The Lord will follow up his enemies, alarm them, and chase them
            until they are put to a hopeless rout. He did this, according to the
            prayer of the present Psalm, for his servant Jehoshaphat; and in
            like manner will he come to the rescue of any or all of his chosen.

            Shame has often weaned men from their idols, and set them upon
            seeking the Lord. If this was not the happy result, in the present
            instance, with the Lord's enemies—yet it would be so with his people
            who were so prone to err. They would be humbled by his mercy, and
            ashamed of themselves because of his grace; and then they would with
            sincerity return to the earnest worship of Jehovah their God, who
            had delivered them. Where no good result followed, and the men
            remained as fierce and obstinate as ever, justice was invoked to
            carry out the capital sentence.

            What else could be done with them? It was better that they perished
            than that Israel should be rooted up. What a terrible doom it will
            be to the enemies of God to be "confounded and troubled forever," to
            see all their schemes and hopes defeated, and their bodies and souls
            full of anguish without end: from such a shameful perishing may our
            souls be delivered.

            Hearing of the Lord's marvelous deeds in defeating such a numerous
            confederacy, the very heathen would be compelled to acknowledge the
            greatness of Jehovah. We read in 2 Chronicles 20:30, that the fear
            of God was on all the neighboring kingdoms when they heard that
            Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Jehovah is essentially the Most High. He who is self existent is
            infinitely above all creatures, all the earth is but his footstool.
            The godless race of man disregards this, and yet at times the
            wonderful works of the Lord compel the most unwilling to adore his
            majesty.

          <p align="justify">
            Thus has this soul stirring lyric risen from the words of complaint
            to those of adoration; let us in our worship always seek to do the
            same. National trouble called out the nation's poet laureate, and
            well did he discourse at once of her sorrows, and prayers, and
            hopes. Sacred literature thus owes much to sorrow and distress.<i>
              How enriching is the hand of adversity!
