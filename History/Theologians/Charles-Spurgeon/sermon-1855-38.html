        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.39-40)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Tuesday Evening, September 4, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>In a field, King Edward's Road, Hackney.</p>
        <p>
          "And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and
          shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
          heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
          darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." -- Matthew
          8:11-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a land where plain speaking is allowed, and where the people
          are willing to afford a fair hearing to any one who can tell them that
          which is worth their attention. To-night I am quite certain of an
          attentive audience, for I know you too well to suppose otherwise. This
          field, as you are all aware, is private property; and I would just
          give a suggestion to those who go out in the open air to preach --
          that it is far better to get into a field, or a plot of unoccupied
          building-ground, than to block up the roads and stop business; it is
          moreover, far better to be somewhat under protection, so that we can
          at once prevent disturbance.
        </p>
        <p>
          To-night, I shall, I hope, encourage you to seek the road to heaven. I
          shall also have to utter some very sharp things concerning the end of
          the lost in the pit of hell. Upon both these subjects I will try and
          speak, as God helps me. But, I beseech you, as you love your souls,
          weigh right and wrong this night; see whether what I say be the truth
          of God. If it be not, reject it utterly, and cast it away; but if it
          is, at your peril disregard it; for, as you shall answer before God,
          the great Judge of heaven and earth, it will go ill with you if the
          words of his servant and of his Scripture be despised.
        </p>
        <p>
          My text has two parts. The first is very agreeable to my mind, and
          gives me pleasure; the second is terrible in the extreme; but, since
          they are both the truth, they must be preached. The first part of my
          text is, "I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and west,
          and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom
          of heaven." The sentence which I call the black, dark, and threatening
          part is this: "But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into
          outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let us take the first part. Here is a most glorious promise. I will
          read it again: "Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit
          down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven." I
          like that text, because it tells me what heaven is, and gives me a
          beautiful picture of it. It says, it is a place where I shall sit down
          with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. O what a sweet thought that is for
          the working man! He often wipes the hot sweat from his face, and he
          wonders whether there is a land where he shall have to toil no longer.
          He scarcely ever eats a mouthful of bread that is not moistened with
          the sweat of his brow. Often he comes home weary, and flings himself
          upon his couch, perhaps too tired to sleep. He says, "Oh! is there no
          land where I can rest? Is there no place where I can sit, and for once
          let these weary limbs be still? Is there no land where I can be quiet?
          Yes, thou son of toil and labor,
        </p>
        <p>"There is a happy land</p>
        <p>Far, far away -- "</p>
        <p>
          where toil and labor are unknown. Beyond yon blue welkin there is a
          city fair and bright, its walls are jasper, and its light is brighter
          than the sun. There "the weary are at rest, and the wicked cease from
          troubling." Immortal spirits are yonder, who never wipe sweat from
          their brow, for "they sow not, neither do they reap;" they have not to
          toil and labor.
        </p>
        <p>"There, on a green and flowery mount,</p>
        <p>Their weary souls shall sit;</p>
        <p>And with transporting joys recount</p>
        <p>The labors of their feet."</p>
        <p>
          To my mind, one of the best views of heaven is, that it is a land of
          rest -- especially to the working man. Those who have not to work
          hard, think they will love heaven as a place of service. That is very
          true. But to the working man, to the man who toils with his brain or
          with his hands, it must ever be a sweet thought that there is a land
          where we shall rest. Soon, this voice will never be strained again;
          soon, these lungs will never have to exert themselves beyond their
          power; soon, this brain shall not be racked for thought; but I shall
          sit at the banquet-table of God; yea, I shall recline on the bosom of
          Abraham, and be at ease for ever. Oh! weary sons and daughters of
          Adam, you will not have to drive the ploughshare into the unthankful
          soil in heaven, you will not need to rise to daily toils before the
          sun hath risen, and labor still when the sun hath long ago gone to his
          rest; but ye shall be still, ye shall be quiet, ye shall rest
          yourselves, for all are rich in heaven, all are happy there, all are
          peaceful. Toil, trouble, travail, and labor, are words that cannot be
          spelled in heaven; they have no such things there, for they always
          rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          And mark the good company they sit with. They are to "sit down with
          Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob." Some people think that in heaven we
          shall know nobody. But our text declares here, that we "shall sit down
          with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob." Then I am sure that we shall be
          aware that they are Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. I have heard of a
          good woman, who asked her husband, when she was dying, "My dear, do
          you think you will know me when you and I get to heaven?" "Shall I
          know you?" he said, "why, I have always known you while I have been
          here, and do you think I shall be a greater fool when I get to
          heaven?" I think it was a very good answer. If we have known one
          another here, we shall know one another there. I have dear departed
          friends up there, and it is always a sweet thought to me, that when I
          shall put my foot, as I hope I may, upon the threshold of heaven,
          there will come my sisters and brothers to clasp me by the hand and
          say, "Yes, thou loved one, and thou art here." Dear relatives that
          have been separated, you will meet again in heaven. One of you has
          lost a mother -- she is gone above; and if you follow the track of
          Jesus, you shall meet her there. Methinks I see yet another coming to
          meet you at the door of Paradise; and though the ties of natural
          affection may be in a measure forgotten, -- I may be allowed to use a
          figure -- how blessed would she be as she turned to God, and said,
          "Here am I, and the children that thou hast given me." We shall
          recognize our friends: -- husband, you will know your wife again.
          Mother, you will know those dear babes of yours -- you marked their
          features when they lay panting and gasping for breath. You know how ye
          hung over their graves when the cold sod was sprinkled over them, and
          it was said, "Earth to earth. Dust to dust, and ashes to ashes." But
          ye shall hear those loved voices again: ye shall hear those sweet
          voices once more; ye shall yet know that those whom ye loved have been
          loved by God. Would not that be a dreary heaven for us to inhabit,
          where we should be alike unknowing and unknown? I would not care to go
          to such a heaven as that. I believe that heaven is a fellowship of the
          saints, and that we shall know one another there. I have often thought
          I should love to see Isaiah; and, as soon as I get to heaven,
          methinks, I would ask for him, because he spoke more of Jesus Christ
          than all the rest. I am sure I should want to find out good George
          Whitefield -- he who so continually preached to the people, and wore
          himself out with a more than seraphic zeal. O yes! We shall have
          choice company in heaven when we get there. There will be no
          distinction of learned and unlearned, clergy and laity, but we shall
          walk freely one among another; we shall feel that we are brethren; we
          shall "sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob." I have heard of a
          lady who was visited by a minister on her deathbed, and she said to
          him, "I want to ask you one question, now I am about to die." "Well,"
          said the minister, "what is it?" "Oh!" said she, in a very affected
          way, "I want to know if there are two places in heaven, because I
          could not bear that Betsy in the kitchen should be in heaven along
          with me, she is so unrefined?" The minister turned round and said, "O!
          don't trouble yourself about that, madam. There is no fear of that;
          for, until you get rid of you accursed pride, you will never enter
          heaven at all." We must all get rid of our pride. We must come down
          and stand on an equality in the sight of God, and see in every man a
          brother, before we can hope to be found in glory. Aye, we bless God,
          we thank him that there will be no separate table for one and for
          another. The Jew and the Gentile will sit down together. The great and
          the small shall feed in the same pasture, and we shall "sit down with
          Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          But my text hath a yet greater depth of sweetness, for it says, that
          "many shall come and shall sit down." Some narrow-minded bigots think
          that heaven will be a very small place, where there will be a very few
          people, who went to their chapel or their church. I confess, I have no
          wish for a very small heaven, and love to read in the Scriptures that
          there are many mansions in my Father's house. How often do I hear
          people say, "Ah! straight is the gate and narrow is the way, and few
          there be that find it. There will be very few in heaven; there will be
          most lost." My friend, I differ from you. Do you think that Christ
          will let the devil beat him? That he will let the devil have more in
          hell than there will be in heaven? No; it is impossible. For then
          Satan would laugh at Christ. There will be more in heaven than there
          are among the lost. God says, that "there will be a number that no man
          can number who will be saved;" but he never says, that there will be a
          number that no man can number that will be lost. There will be a host
          beyond all count who will get into heaven. What glad tidings for you
          and for me! For, if there are so many to be saved, why should not I be
          saved? Why should not you? Why should not yon man, over there in the
          crowd, say, "cannot I be one among the multitude?" And may not that
          poor woman there take heart, and say, "Well, if there were but
          half-a-dozen saved, I might fear that I should not be one; but, since
          many are to come, why should not I also be saved?" Cheer up,
          disconsolate! Cheer up, son of mourning, child of sorrow, there is
          hope for thee still! I can never know that any man is past God's
          grace. There be a few that have sinned that sin that is unto death,
          and God gives them up; but the vast host of mankind are yet within the
          reach of sovereign mercy -- "and many of them shall come from the east
          and from the west, and shall sit down in the kingdom of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at my text again, and you will see where these people come from.
          They are to "come from the east and west." The Jews said that they
          would all come from Palestine, every one of them, every man, woman,
          and child; that there would not be one in heaven that was not a Jew.
          And the Pharisees thought that, if they were not all Pharisees, they
          could not be saved. But Jesus Christ said, there will be many that
          will come from the east and from the west. There will be a multitude
          from that far-off land of China, for God is doing a great work there,
          and we hope that the gospel will yet be victorious in that land. There
          will be a multitude from this western land of England, from the
          western country beyond the sea in America, and from the south in
          Australia, and from the north in Canada, Siberia, and Russia. From the
          uttermost parts of the earth there shall come many to sit down in the
          kingdom of God. But I do not think this text is to be understood so
          much geographically as spiritually. When it says that they "shall come
          from the east and west," I think it does not refer to nations
          particularly, but to different kinds of people. Now, "the east and the
          west" signify those who are the very farthest off from religion; yet
          many of them will be saved and get to heaven. There is a class of
          persons who will always be looked upon as hopeless. Many a time have I
          heard a man or woman say of such a one, "He cannot be saved: he is too
          abandoned. What is he good for? Ask him to go to a place of worship --
          he was drunk on Saturday night. What would be the use of reasoning
          with him? There is no hope for him. He is a hardened fellow. See what
          he has done these many years. What good will it be to speak to him?
          Now, hear this, ye who think your fellows worse than yourselves -- ye
          who condemn others, whereas ye are often just as guilty: Jesus Christ
          says, "many shall come from the east and west." There will be many in
          heaven that were drunkards once. I believe, among that blood-bought
          throng, there are many who reeled in and out the tavern half their
          lifetime. But, by the power of divine grace, they were able to dash
          the liquor-cup to the ground. They renounced the riot of intoxication
          -- fled away from it -- and served God. Yes! There will be many in
          heaven who were drunkards on earth. There will be many harlots: some
          of the most abandoned will be found there. You remember the story of
          Whitefield's once saying, that there would be some in heaven who were
          "the devil's castaways;" some that the devil would hardly think good
          enough for him, and yet whom Christ would save. Lady Huntingdon once
          gently hinted that such language was not quite proper. But, just at
          the time, there happened to be heard a ring at the bell, and
          Whitefield went down-stairs. Afterwards he came up and said, "Your
          ladyship, what do you think a poor woman had to say to me just now?
          She was a sad profligate, and she said, O, Mr. Whitefield, when you
          were preaching, you told us that Christ would take in the devil's
          castaways, and I am one of them,'" and that was the means of her
          salvation. Shall anybody ever check us from preaching to the lowest of
          the low? I have been accused of getting all the rabble of London
          around me. God bless the rabble! God save the rabble! then, say I.
          But, suppose they are "the rabble," who need the gospel more than they
          do? Who require to have Christ preached to them more than they do? We
          have lots of those who preach to ladies and gentlemen, and we want
          some one to preach to the rabble in these degenerate days. Oh! here is
          comfort for me, for many of the rabble are to come from the east and
          from the west. Oh! what would you think if you were to see the
          difference between some that are in heaven and some that shall be
          there? There might be found one whose hair hangs across his eyes, his
          locks are matted, he looks horrible, his bloated eyes start from his
          face, he grins almost like an idiot, he has drunk away his very brain
          until life seems to have departed, so far as sense and being are
          concerned; yet I would tell to you, "that man is capable of salvation:
          -- and in a few years I might say "look up yonder;" see you that
          bright star? discern you that man with a crown of pure gold upon his
          head? do you notice that being clad in robes of sapphire and in
          garments of light? That is the self-same man who sat there a poor,
          benighted, almost idiotic being; yet sovereign grace and mercy have
          saved him! There are none, except those, as I have said before, who
          have sinned the unpardonable sin, who are beyond God's mercy. Fetch me
          out the worst, and still I would preach the gospel to them; fetch me
          out the vilest, still I would preach to them, because I recollect my
          Master said, "Go ye out into the highways and hedges, and compel them
          to come in that my house may be filled." "Many shall come from the
          east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
          in the kingdom of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one more word I must notice before I have done with this
          sweet portion -- that is the word "shall." Oh! I love God's "shalls"
          and "wills." There is nothing comparable to them. Let a man say
          "shall," what is it good for? "I will," says man, and he never
          performs; "I shall," says he, and he breaks his promise. But it is
          never so with God's "shalls." If he says "shall," it shall be; when he
          says "will," it will be. Now he has said here, "many shall come." The
          devil says "they shall not come;" but "they shall come." Their sins
          say "you can't come;" God says "you shall come." You, yourselves, say,
          "you won't come;" God says "you shall come." Yes! There are some here
          who are laughing at salvation, who can scoff at Christ and mock at the
          gospel; but I tell you some of you shall come yet. "What!" you say,
          "can God make me become a Christian?" I tell you yes, for herein rests
          the power of the gospel. It does not ask you consent; but it gets it.
          It does not say, Will you have it? But it makes you willing in the day
          of God's power. Not against your will, but it makes you willing. It
          shows you its value, and then you fall in love with it; and
          straightway you run after it and have it. Many people have said, "we
          will not have anything to do with religion." yet they have been
          converted. I have heard of a man who once went to chapel to hear the
          singing, and as soon as the minister began to preach, he put his
          fingers in his ears and would not listen. But by-and-by some tiny
          insect settled on his face, so that he was obliged to take one finger
          out of his ears to brush it away. Just then the minister said, "he
          that hath ears to hear let him hear." The man listened; and God met
          with him at that moment to his soul's conversion. He went out a new
          man, a changed character. He who came in to laugh retired to pray; he
          who came in to mock went out to bend his knee in penitence; he who
          entered to spend an idle hour went home to spend an hour in devotion
          with his God. The sinner became a saint; the profligate became a
          penitent. Who know that there may not be some like that here? The
          gospel wants not your consent, it gets it. It knocks the enmity out of
          your heart. You say, "I do not want to be saved;" Christ says you
          shall be. He makes your will turn round, and then you cry, "Lord,
          save, or I perish." "Ah," might Heaven exclaim, "I knew I would make
          you say that;" and then he rejoices over you because he has changed
          your will and made you willing in the day of his power. If Jesus
          Christ were to stand on the platform to-night, what would many people
          do with him? "O!" say some, "we would make him a King." I do not
          believe it. They would crucify him again, if they had the opportunity.
          If he were to come and say, "Here I am, I love you, will you be saved
          by me?" not one of you would consent if you were left to your will. If
          he should look upon you with those eyes, before whose power the lion
          would have crouched; if he spoke with that voice which poured forth a
          cataract of eloquence like a stream of nectar rolling down from the
          cliffs above, not a single person would come to be his disciple. No;
          it wants the power of the Spirit to make men come to Jesus Christ. He
          himself said, "No man can come to me except the Father who hath sent
          me draw him." Ah! we want that; and here we have it. They shall come!
          They shall come! Ye may laugh, ye may despise us; but Jesus Christ
          shall not die for nothing. If some of you reject him, there are some
          that will not. It there are some that are not saved, others shall be.
          Christ shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure
          of the Lord shall prosper in his hands. Some think that Christ died,
          and yet, that some for whom he died will be lost. I never could
          understand that doctrine. If Jesus, my surety, bore my griefs and
          carried my sorrows, I believe myself to be as secure as the angels in
          heaven. God cannot ask payment twice. If Christ paid my debt, shall I
          have to pay it again? No.
        </p>
        <p>"Free from sin I walk at large</p>
        <p>The Saviour's blood's my full discharge;</p>
        <p>At his dear feet content I lay,</p>
        <p>A sinner saved, and homage pay."</p>
        <p>
          They shall come! They shall come! And naught in heaven, nor on earth,
          nor in hell, can stop them from coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, thou chief of sinners, list one moment, while I call thee to
          Jesus. There is one person here to-night, who thinks himself the worst
          soul that ever lived. There is one who says to himself, "I do not
          deserve to be called to Christ, I am sure!" Soul! I call thee! thou
          lost, most wretched outcast, this night, by authority given me of God,
          I call thee to come to my Saviour. Some time ago, when I went into the
          County Court to see what they were doing, I heard a man's name called
          out, and immediately the man said, "Make way! make way! They call me!"
          And up he came. Now, I call the chief of sinners to-night, and let him
          say, "Make way! make way, doubts! make way, fears! make way, sins!
          Christ calls me! And if Christ calls me, that is enough!"
        </p>
        <p>"I'll to his gracious feet approach</p>
        <p>Whose sceptre mercy gives.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he may command me, "Touch!"</p>
        <p>And then the suppliant lives."</p>
        <p>"I can but perish if I go;</p>
        <p>I am resolved to try,</p>
        <p>For if I stay away, I know</p>
        <p>I must for ever die."</p>
        <p>"But, should I die with mercies sought,</p>
        <p>When I the king have tried,</p>
        <p>That were to die, (delightful thought!)</p>
        <p>As sinner never died."</p>
        <p>
          Go and try my Saviour! Go and try my Saviour! If he cast you away
          after you have sought him, tell in the pit that Christ would not hear
          you. But that you shall never be allowed to do. It would dishonor the
          mercy of the covenant for God to cast away one penitent sinner; and it
          never shall be while it is written, "Many shall come from the east and
          west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the
          kingdom of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second part of my text is heart-breaking. I could preach with
          great delight to myself from the first part; but here is a dreary task
          to my soul, because there are gloomy words here. But, as I have told
          you, what is written in the Bible must be preached, whether it be
          gloomy or cheerful. There are some ministers who never mention
          anything about hell. I heard of a minister who once said to his
          congregation, "If you do not love the Lord Jesus Christ, you will be
          sent to that place which it is not polite to mention." He ought not to
          have been allowed to preach again, I am sure, if he could not use
          plain words. Now, if I saw that house on fire over there, do you think
          I would stand and say, "I believe the operation of combustion is
          proceeding yonder?" No; I would call out, "Fire! fire! and then
          everybody would know what I meant. So, if the Bible says, "The
          children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness," am I
          to stand here and mince the matter at all? God forbid! We must speak
          the truth as it is written. It is a terrible truth, for it says, "the
          children of the kingdom shall be cast out!" Now, who are those
          children? I will tell you. "The children of the kingdom" are those
          people who are noted for the externals of piety, but who have nothing
          of the internals of it. People whom you will see with their Bibles and
          Hymn Books marching off to chapel as religiously as possible, or going
          to church as devoutly and demurely as they can, looking as sombre and
          serious as parish beadles, and fancying that they are quite sure to be
          saved, though their hearts are not in the matter; nothing but their
          bodies. These are the persons who are "the children of the kingdom."
          They have no grace, no life, no Christ, and they shall be cast into
          outer darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, these people are the children of pious fathers and mothers.
          There is nothing touches a man's heart, mark you, like talking about
          his mother. I have heard of a swearing sailor, whom nobody could
          manage, not even the police, who was always making some disturbance
          wherever he went. Once he went into a place of worship, and no one
          could keep him still; but a gentleman went up and said to him, "Jack,
          you had a mother once." With that the tears ran down his cheeks. He
          said, "Ha! bless you, sir, I had; and I brought her gray hairs with
          sorrow to the grave, and a pretty fellow I am to be here to-night." He
          then sat down, quite sobered and subdued by the very mention of his
          mother. Ah, and there are some of you, "children of the kingdom," who
          can remember your mothers. Your mother took you on her knee and taught
          you early to pray; your father tutored you in the ways of godliness.
          And yet you are here to-night, without grace in you heart -- without
          hope of heaven. You are going downwards towards hell as fast as your
          feet can carry you. There are some of you who have broken your poor
          mother's heart. Oh! if I could tell you what she has suffered for you
          when you have at night been indulging in you sin. Do you know what
          your guilt will be, ye "children of the kingdom," if ye perish after a
          pious mother's prayers and tears have fallen upon you? I can conceive
          of no one entering hell with a worse grace than the man who goes there
          with drops of his mother's tears on his head, and with his father's
          prayers following him at his heels. Some of you will inevitably endure
          this doom; some of you, young men and women, shall wake up one day and
          find yourselves in utter darkness, while your parents shall be up
          there in heaven, looking down upon you with upbraiding eyes, seeming
          to say, "What! after all we did for you, all we said, are ye come to
          this?" "Children of the kingdom!" do not think that a pious mother can
          save you. Do not think, because your father was a member of
          such-and-such a church, that his godliness will save you. I can
          suppose some one standing at heaven's gate, and demanding, "Let me in!
          Let me in!" What for? "Because my mother is in there." Your mother had
          nothing to do with you. If she was holy, she was holy for herself; if
          she was evil, she was evil for herself. "But my grandfather prayed for
          me!" That is no use: did you pray for yourself? "No, I did not." Then
          grandfather's prayers, and grandmother's prayers, and father's and
          mother's prayers may be piled on the top of one another till they
          reach the stars, but they never can make a ladder for you to go to
          heaven by. You must seek God for yourself; or rather, God must seek
          you. You must have vital experience of godliness in you heart, or else
          you are lost, even though all your friends were in heaven. That was a
          dreadful dream which a pious mother once had, and told to her
          children. She thought the judgment day was come. The great books were
          opened. They all stood before God. And Jesus Christ said, "Separate
          the chaff from the wheat; put the goats on the left hand, and the
          sheep on the right. The mother dreamed that she and her children were
          standing just in the middle of the great assembly. And the angel came,
          and said, "I must take the mother, she is a sheep: she must go to the
          right hand. The children are goats: they must go on the left." She
          thought as she went, her children clutched her, and said, "Mother, can
          we part? Must we be separated?" She then put her arms around them, and
          seemed to say, "My children, I would, if possible, take you with me."
          But in a moment the angel touched her; her cheeks were dried, and now,
          overcoming natural affection, being rendered supernatural and sublime,
          resigned to God's will, she said, "My children, I taught you well, I
          trained you up, and you forsook the ways of God; and now all I have to
          say is, Amen to you condemnation." Thereupon they were snatched away,
          and she saw them in perpetual torment while she was in heaven. Young
          man, what will you think, when the last day comes, to hear Christ say,
          "Depart, ye cursed?" And there will be a voice just behind him,
          saying, Amen. And, as you inquire whence came the voice, you will find
          it was your mother. Or, young woman, when thou art cast away into
          utter darkness, what will you think to hear a voice saying, Amen. And
          as you look, there sits your father, his lips still moving with the
          solemn curse. Ah! "children of the kingdom," the penitent reprobates
          will enter heaven, many of them; publicans and sinners will get there;
          repenting drunkards and swearers will be saved; but many of the
          "children of the kingdom" will be cast out. Oh! to think that you who
          have been so well trained should be lost, while many of the worse will
          be saved. It will be the hell of hells for you to look up and see
          there "poor Jack," the drunkard, lying in Abraham's bosom, while you,
          who have had a pious mother, are cast into hell, simply because you
          would not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, but put his gospel from
          you, and lived and died without it! That were the very sting of all,
          to see ourselves cast away, when the chief of sinners finds salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now list to me a little while -- I will not detain you long -- whilst
          I undertake the doleful task of telling you what is to become of these
          "children of the kingdom." Jesus Christ says they are to be "cast into
          utter darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, notice, they are to be cast out. They are not said to go; but,
          when they come to heaven's gates, they are to be cast out. As soon as
          hypocrites arrive at the gates of heaven, Justice will say, "There he
          comes! there he comes! He spurned a father's prayers, and mocked a
          mother's tears. He has forced his way downward against all the
          advantages mercy has supplied. And now, there he comes. "Gabriel, take
          the man." The angel, binding you hand and foot, holds you one single
          moment over the mouth of the chasm. He bids you look down -- down --
          down. There is no bottom; and you hear coming up from the abyss,
          sullen moans, and hollow groans, and screams of tortured ghosts. You
          quiver, your bones melt like wax, and your marrow quakes within you.
          Where is now thy might? and where thy boasting and bragging? Ye shriek
          and cry, ye beg for mercy; but the angel, with one tremendous grasp,
          seizes you fast, and then hurls you down, with the cry, "Away, away!"
          And down you go to the pit that is bottomless, and roll for ever
          downward -- downward -- downward -- ne'er to find a resting-place for
          the soles of your feet. Ye shall be cast out.
        </p>
        <p>
          And where are you to be cast to? Ye are to be cast "into outer
          darkness;" ye are to be put in the place where there will be no hope.
          For, by "light," in Scripture, we understand "hope;" and you are to be
          put "into outer darkness," where there is no light -- no hope. Is
          there a man here who has no hope? I cannot suppose such a person. One
          of you, perhaps, says, "I am thirty pounds in debt, and shall be sold
          up by-and-by; but I have a hope that I may get a loan, and so escape
          my difficulty." Says another, "My business is ruined, but things may
          take a turn yet -- I have a hope." Says another, "I am in great
          distress, but I hope that God will provide for me." Another says, "I
          am fifty pounds in debt; I am sorry for it; but I will set these
          strong hands to work, and do my best to get out of it." One of you
          thinks a friend is dying, but you have a hope that, perhaps, the fever
          may take a turn -- that he may yet live. But, in hell, there is no
          hope. They have not even the hope of dying -- the hope of being
          annihilated. They are for ever -- for ever -- for ever -- lost! On
          every chain in hell, there is written "for ever." In the fires, there
          blaze out the words, "for ever." Up above their heads, they read "for
          ever." Their eyes are galled, and their hearts are pained with the
          thought that it is "for ever." Oh! if I could tell you to-night that
          hell would one day be burned out, and that those who were lost might
          be saved, there would be a jubilee in hell at the very thought of it.
          But it cannot be -- it is "for ever" they are "cast into utter
          darkness."
        </p>
        <p>
          But I want to get over this as quickly as I can; for who can bear to
          talk thus to his fellow-creatures? What is it that the lost are doing?
          They are "weeping and gnashing their teeth." Do you gnash you teeth
          now? You would not do it except you were in pain and agony. Well, in
          hell there is always gnashing of teeth. And do you know why? There is
          one gnashing his teeth at his companion, and mutters, "I was led into
          hell by you; you led me astray, you taught me to drink the first
          time." And the other gnashes his teeth and says, "What if I did? You
          made me worse than I should have been in after times." There is a
          child who looks at her mother, and says, "Mother, you trained me up to
          vice." And the mother gnashes her teeth again at the child, and says,
          "I have no pity for you, for you excelled me in it, and led me into
          deeper sin." Fathers gnash their teeth at their sons, and sons at
          their fathers. And, methinks, if there are any who will have to gnash
          their teeth more than others, it will be seducers, when they see those
          whom they have led from the paths of virtue, and hear them saying,
          "Ah! we are glad you are in hell with us, you deserve it, for you led
          us here." Have any of you, to-night, upon your consciences the fact
          that you have led others to the pit? O, may sovereign grace forgive
          you. "We have gone astray like lost sheep," said David. Now a lost
          sheep never goes astray alone, if it is one of a flock. I lately read
          of a sheep that leaped over the parapet of a bridge, and was followed
          by every one of the flock. So, if one man goes astray, he leads others
          with him. Some of you will have to account for others' sins when you
          get to hell, as well as your own. Oh, what "weeping and gnashing of
          teeth" there will be in that pit!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now shut the black book. Who wants to say any more about it? I have
          warned you solemnly. I have told you of the wrath to come. The evening
          darkens, and the sun is setting. Ah! and the evenings darken with some
          of you. I can see gray-headed men here. Are your gray hairs a crown of
          glory, or a fool's cap to you? Are you on the very verge of heaven, or
          are you tottering on the brink of your grave, and sinking down to
          perdition?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me warn you, gray-headed men; your evening is coming. O, poor,
          tottering gray-head, wilt thou take the last step into the pit? Let a
          young child step before thee, and beg thee to consider. There is thy
          staff -- it has nothing of earth to rest upon: and now, ere thou
          diest, bethink thyself this night; let seventy years of sin start up;
          let the ghosts of thy forgotten transgressions march before thine
          eyes. What wilt thou do with seventy wasted years to answer for --
          with seventy years of criminality to bring before God? God give thee
          grace this night to repent and to put thy trust in Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you, middle-aged men, are not safe; the evening lowers with you,
          too; you may soon die. A few mornings ago, I was roused early from my
          bed, by the request that I would hasten to see a dying man. I hurried
          off with all speed to see the poor creature; but when I reached the
          house, he was dead -- a corpse. As I stood in the room I thought, "Ah!
          that man little thought he should die so soon." There were his wife
          and children, and friends -- they little thought he would die; for he
          was hale, strong, and hearty but a few days before. None of you have a
          lease of your lives. If you have, where is it? Go and see if you have
          it anywhere in your chest at home. No! ye may die to-morrow. Let me
          therefore warn you by the mercy of God; let me speak to you as a
          brother may speak; for I love you, you know I do, and would press the
          matter home to your hearts. Oh, to be amongst the many who shall be
          accepted in Christ -- how blessed that will be! and God has said that
          whosoever shall call on his name shall be saved: he casts out none
          that come unto him through Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, ye youths and maidens, one word with you. Perhaps you think
          that religion is not for you. "Let us be happy," say you: "let us be
          merry and joyous." How long, young man, how long? "Till I am
          twenty-one." Are you sure that you will live till then? Let me tell
          you one thing. If you do live till that time, if you have no heart for
          God now, you will have none then. Men do not get better if left alone.
          It is with them as with the garden: if you let it alone, and permit
          weeds to grow, you will not expect to find it better in six months --
          but worse. Ah! men talk as if they could repent when they like. It is
          the work of God to give us repentance. Some even say, "I shall turn to
          God on such-and-such a day. Ah! if you felt aright, you would say, "I
          must run to God, and ask him to give me repentance now, lest I should
          die before I have found Jesus Christ, my Saviour."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, one word in conclusion. I have told you of heaven and hell; what
          is the way, then, to escape from hell and to be found in heaven? I
          will not tell you my old tale again to-night. I recollect when I told
          it you before, a good friend in the crowd said, "Tell us something
          fresh, old fellow." Now really, in preaching ten times a week, we
          cannot always say things fresh. You have heard John Gough, and you
          know he tells his tales over again. I have nothing but the old gospel.
          "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." There is nothing
          here of works. It does not say, "He who is a good man shall be saved,"
          but "he who believes and is baptized." Well, what is it to believe? It
          is to put your trust entirely upon Jesus. Poor Peter once believed,
          and Jesus Christ said to him, "Come on, Peter, walk to me on the
          water." Peter went stepping along on the tops of the waves without
          sinking; but when he looked at the waves, he began to tremble, and
          down he went. Now, poor sinner, Christ says, "Come on; walk on your
          sins; come to me; and if you do, he will give you power. If you
          believe on Christ, you will be able to walk over your sins -- to tread
          upon them and overcome them. I can remember the time when my sins
          first stared me in the face. I thought myself the most accursed of all
          men. I had not committed any very great open transgressions against
          God; but I recollected that I had been well trained and tutored, and I
          thought my sins were thus greater than other people's. I cried to God
          to have mercy; and I feared that he would not pardon me. Month after
          month, I cried to God, and he did not hear me, and I knew not what it
          was to be saved. Sometimes I was so weary of the world that I desired
          to die; but then I recollected that there was a worse world after
          this, and that it would be an ill matter to rush before my Maker
          unprepared. At times I wickedly thought God a most heartless tyrant,
          because he did not answer my prayer; and then, at others, I thought,
          "I deserve his displeasure; if he sends me to hell, he will be just."
          But I remember the hour when I stepped into a little place of worship,
          and saw a tall, thin man step into the pulpit: I have never seen him
          from that day, and probably never shall, till we meet in heaven. He
          opened the Bible and read, with a feeble voice, "Look unto me, and be
          ye saved all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and beside me there
          is none else." Ah, thought I, I am one of the ends of the earth; and
          then turning round, and fixing his gaze on me, as if he knew me, the
          minister said, "Look, look, look." Why, I thought I had a great deal
          to do, but I found it was only to look. I thought I had a garment to
          spin out for myself; but I found that if I looked, Christ would give
          me a garment. Look, sinner, that is to be saved. Look unto him, all ye
          ends of the earth, and be saved. That is what the Jews did, when Moses
          held up the brazen serpent. He said, "Look!" and they looked. The
          serpent might be twisting round them, and they might be nearly dead;
          but they simply looked, and the moment they looked, the serpent
          dropped off, and they were healed. Look to Jesus, sinner. "None but
          Jesus can do helpless sinners good." There is a hymn we often sing,
          but which I do not think is quite right. It says,
        </p>
        <p>"Venture on him, venture wholly;</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude."</p>
        <p>
          Now, it is no venture to trust in Christ, not in the least; he who
          trusts in Christ is quite secure. I recollect that, when dear John
          Hyatt was dying, Matthew Wilks said to him, in his usual tone, "Well,
          John, could you trust your soul in the hands of Jesus Christ now?"
          "Yes," said he, "a million! a million souls!" I am sure that every
          Christian that has ever trusted in Christ can say Amen to that. Trust
          in him; he will never deceive you. My blessed Master will never cast
          you away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot speak much longer, and I have only to thank you for your
          kindness. I never saw so large a number so still and quiet. I do
          really think, after all the hard things that have been said, that the
          English people know who loves them, and that they will stand by the
          man who stands by them. I thank every one of you; and above all, I beg
          you, if there be reason or sense in what I have said, bethink
          yourselves of what you are, and may the Blessed Spirit reveal to you
          your state! May he show you that you are dead, that you are lost,
          ruined. May he make you feel what a dreadful thing it would be to sink
          into hell! May he point you to heaven! May he take you as the angel
          did of old, and put his hand upon you, and say, "Flee! flee! flee!
          Look to the mountain; look not behind thee; stay not in all the
          plain." And may we all meet in heaven at last; and there we shall be
          happy for ever.

          P.S. This sermon was watered by many prayers of the faithful in Zion.
          The preacher did not intend it for publication, but seeing that it is
          now in print, he will not apologize for its faulty composition or
          rambling style; but instead thereof, he would beg the prayers of his
          readers, that this feeble sermon may more exalt the honour of God, by
          the salvation of many who shall read it. "The excellency of the power
          is of God, and not of man."<br />
