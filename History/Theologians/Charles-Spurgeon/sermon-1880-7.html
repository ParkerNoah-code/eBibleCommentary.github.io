        <p>PREACHED BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF INVALID LADIES AT MENTONE, BY</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>"Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick." -- John 11:3.</p>
        <p>
          THAT DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS LOVED is not at all backward to record that
          Jesus loved Lazarus too: there are no jealousies among those who are
          chosen by the Well-beloved. Jesus loved Mary, and Martha, and Lazarus:
          it is a happy thing where a whole family live in the love of Jesus.
          They were a favoured trio, and yet, as the serpent came into Paradise,
          so did sorrow enter their quiet household at Bethany. Lazarus was
          sick. They all felt that if Jesus were there disease would flee at his
          presence; what then should they do but let him know of their trial?
          Lazarus was near to death's door, and so his tender sisters at once
          reported the fact to Jesus, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest
          is sick." Many a time since then has that same message been sent to
          our Lord, for in full many a case he has chosen his people in the
          furnace of affliction. Of the Master it is said, "himself took our
          infirmities, and bare our sicknesses," and it is, therefore, no
          extraordinary thing for the members to be in this matter conformed to
          their Head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Notice, first, A FACT mentioned in the text: "Lord, behold, he whom
          thou lovest is sick." The sisters were somewhat astonished that it
          should be so, for the word "behold" implies a measure of surprise. "We
          love him, and would make him well directly: thou lovest him, and yet
          he remains sick. Thou canst heal him with a word, why then is thy
          loved one sick?" Have not you, dear sick friend, often wondered how
          your painful or lingering disease could be consistent with your being
          chosen, and called, and made one with Christ? I dare say this has
          greatly perplexed you, and yet in very truth it is by no means
          strange, but a thing to be expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need not be astonished that the man whom the Lord loves is sick,
          for he is only a man. The love of Jesus does not separate us from the
          common necessities and infirmities of human life. Men of God are still
          men. The covenant of grace is not a charter of exemption from
          consumption, or rheumatism, or asthma. The bodily ills, which come
          upon us because of our flesh, will attend us to the tomb, for Paul
          saith, "we that are in this body do groan."
        </p>
        <p>
          Those whom the Lord loves are the more likely to be sick, since they
          are under a peculiar discipline. It is written, "Whom the Lord loveth
          he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth." Affliction
          of some sort is one of the marks of the true-born child of God, and it
          frequently happens that the trial takes the form of illness. Shall we
          therefore wonder that we have to take our turn in the sick chamber? If
          Job, and David, and Hezekiah must each one smart, who are we that we
          should be amazed because we are in ill-health?
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is it remarkable that we are sick if we reflect upon the great
          benefit which often flows from it to ourselves. I do not know what
          peculiar improvement may have been wrought in Lazarus, but many a
          disciple of Jesus would have been of small use if he had not been
          afflicted. Strong men are apt to be harsh, imperious, and
          unsympathetic, and therefore they need to be put into the furnace, and
          melted down. I have known Christian women who would never have been so
          gentle, tender, wise, experienced, and holy if they had not been
          mellowed by physical pain. There are fruits in God's garden as well as
          in man's which never ripen till they are bruised. Young women who are
          apt to be volatile, conceited, or talkative, are often trained to be
          full of sweetness and light by sickness after sickness, by which they
          are taught to sit at Jesus' feet. Many have been able to say with the
          psalmist, "It is good for me to have been afflicted, that I might
          learn thy statutes." For this reason even such as are highly favoured
          and blessed among women may feel a sword piercing through their
          hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes this sickness of the Lord's loved ones is for the good of
          others. Lazarus was permitted to be sick and to die, that by his death
          and resurrection the apostles might be benefited. His sickness was
          "for the glory of God." Throughout these nineteen hundred years which
          have succeeded Lazarus' sickness all believers have been getting good
          out of it, and this afternoon we are all the better because he
          languished and died. The church and the world may derive immense
          advantage through the sorrows of good men: the careless may be
          awakened, the doubting may be convinced, the ungodly may be converted,
          the mourner may be comforted through our testimony in sickness; and if
          so, would we wish to avoid pain and weakness? Are we not quite willing
          that our friends should say of us also "Lord, behold, he whom thou
          lovest is sick"?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our text, however, not only records a fact, but mentions A REPORT
          of that fact: the sisters sent and told Jesus. Let us keep up a
          constant correspondence with our Lord about everything.
        </p>
        <p>"Sing a hymn to Jesus, when thy heart is faint;</p>
        <p>Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint."</p>
        <p>
          Jesus knows all about us, but it is a great relief to pour out our
          hearts before him. When John the Baptist's broken-hearted disciples
          saw their leader beheaded, "they took up the body, and went and told
          Jesus." They could not have done better. In all trouble send a message
          to Jesus, and do not keep your misery to yourself. In his case there
          is no need of reserve, there is no fear of his treating you with cold
          pride, or heartless indifference, or cruel treachery. He is a
          confident who never can betray us, a friend who never will refuse us.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is this fair hope about telling Jesus, that he is sure to
          support us under it. If you go to Jesus, and ask, "Most gracious Lord,
          why am I sick? I thought I was useful while in health, and now I can
          do nothing; why is this?" He may be pleased to show you why, or, if
          not, he will make you willing to bear his will with patience without
          knowing why. He can bring his truth to your mind to cheer you, or
          strengthen your heart by his presence, or send you unexpected
          comforts, and give you to glory in your afflictions. "Ye people, pour
          out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us." Not in vain did
          Mary and Martha send to tell Jesus, and not in vain do any seek his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that Jesus may give healing. It would not be wise to
          live by a supposed faith, and cast off the physician and his
          medicines, any more than to discharge the butcher, and the tailor, and
          expect to be fed and clothed by faith; but this would be far better
          than forgetting the Lord altogether, and trusting to man only. Healing
          for both body and soul must be sought from God. We make use of
          medicines, but these can do nothing apart from the Lord, "who healeth
          all our diseases." We may tell Jesus about our aches and pains, and
          gradual declinings, and hacking coughs. Some persons are afraid to go
          to God about their health: they pray for the pardon of sin, but dare
          not ask the Lord to remove a headache: and, yet, surely, if the hairs
          outside our head are all numbered by God it is not much more of a
          condescension for him to relieve throbs and pressures inside the head.
          Our big things must be very little to the great God, and our little
          things cannot be much less. It is a proof of the greatness of the mind
          of God that while ruling the heavens and the earth, he is not so
          absorbed by these great concerns as to be forgetful of the least pain
          or want of any one of his poor children. We may go to him about our
          failing breath, for he first gave us lungs and life. We may tell him
          about the eye which grows dim, and the ear which loses hearing, for he
          made them both. We may mention the swollen knee, and the gathering
          finger, the stiff neck, and the sprained foot, for he made all these
          our members, redeemed them all, and will raise them all from the
          grave. Go at once, and say, "Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is
          sick."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, let us notice in the case of Lazarus A RESULT which we
          should not have expected. No doubt when Mary and Martha sent to tell
          Jesus they looked to see Lazarus recover as soon as the messenger
          reached the Master; but they were not gratified. For two days the Lord
          remained in the same place, and not till he knew that Lazarus was dead
          did he speak of going to Judea. This teaches us that Jesus may be
          informed of our trouble, and yet may act as if he were indifferent to
          it. We must not expect in every case that prayer for recovery will be
          answered, for if so, nobody would die who had chick or child, friend
          or acquaintance to pray for him. In our prayers for the lives of
          beloved children of God we must not forget that there is one prayer
          which may be crossing ours, for Jesus prays, "Father, I will that they
          also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may
          behold my glory." We pray that they may remain with us, but when we
          recognize that Jesus wants them above, what can we do but admit his
          larger claim and say, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt"? In our own
          case, we may pray the Lord to raise us up, and yet though he loves us
          he may permit us to grow worse and worse, and at last to die. Hezekiah
          had fifteen years added to his life, but we may not gain the reprieve
          of a single day. Never set such store by the life of any one dear to
          you, or even by your own life, as to be rebellious against the Lord.
          If you hold the life of any dear one with too tight a hand, you are
          making a rod for your own back; and if you love your own earthly life
          too well, you are making a thorny pillow for your dying bed. Children
          are often idols, and in such cases their too ardent lovers are
          idolaters. We might as well make a god of clay, and worship it, as the
          Hindus are said to do, as worship our fellow-creatures, for what are
          they but clay? Shall dust be so dear to us that we quarrel with our
          God about it? If our Lord leaves us to suffer, let us not repine. He
          must do that for us which is kindest and best, for he loves us better
          than we love ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did I hear you say, "Yes, Jesus allowed Lazarus to die, but he raised
          him up again"? I answer, he is the resurrection and the life to us
          also. Be comforted concerning the departed, "Thy brother shall rise
          again," and all of us whose hope is in Jesus shall partake in our
          Lord's resurrection. Not only shall our souls live, but our bodies,
          too, shall be raised incorruptible. The grave will serve as a refining
          pot, and this vile body shall come forth vile no longer. Some
          Christians are greatly cheered by the thought of living till the Lord
          comes, and so escaping death. I confess that I think this no great
          gain, for so far from having any preference over them that are asleep,
          those who are alive and remain at his coming will miss one point of
          fellowship, in not dying and rising like their Lord. Beloved, all
          things are yours, and death is expressly mentioned in the list,
          therefore do not dread it, but rather "long for evening to undress,
          that you may rest with God."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I will close with A QUESTION -- "Jesus loved Martha, and her
          sister, and Lazarus" -- does Jesus in a special sense love you? Alas,
          many sick ones have no evidence of any special love of Jesus towards
          them, for they have never sought his face, nor trusted in him. Jesus
          might say to them "I never knew you," for they have turned their backs
          upon his blood and his cross. Answer, dear friend, to your own heart
          this question, "Do you love Jesus?" If so, you love him because he
          first loved you. Are you trusting him? If so, that faith of yours is
          the proof that he has loved you from before the foundation of the
          world, for faith is the token by which he plights his troth to his
          beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Jesus loves you, and you are sick, let all the world see how you
          glorify God in your sickness. Let friends and nurses see how the
          beloved of the Lord are cheered and comforted by him. Let your holy
          resignation astonish them, and set them admiring your Beloved, who is
          so gracious to you that he makes you happy in pain, and joyful at the
          gates of the grave. If your religion is worth anything it ought to
          support you now, and it will compel unbelievers to see that he whom
          the Lord loveth is in better case when he is sick than the ungodly
          when full of health and vigour.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not know that Jesus loves you, you lack the brightest star
          that can cheer the night of sickness. I hope you will not die as you
          now are, and pass into another world without enjoying the love of
          Jesus: that would be a terrible calamity indeed. Seek his face at
          once, and it may be that your present sickness is a part of the way of
          love by which Jesus would bring you to himself. Lord, heal all these
          sick ones in soul and in body. Amen.<br />
