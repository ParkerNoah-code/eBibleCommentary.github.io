        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.279)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 16th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say,
          Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him
          take the water of life freely." -- Revelation 22:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE CRY OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION is the simple word, "Come." The
          Jewish law said, "Go, and take heed unto thy steps as to the path in
          which thou shalt walk. Go, and break the commandments, and thou shalt
          perish; Go, and keep them, and thou shalt live." The law was a
          dispensation of the whip, which drove men before it; the gospel is
          just of the opposite kind. It is the Shepherds dispensation. He goeth
          before his sheep, and he bids them follow him, saying unto them,
          "Come." The law repels; the gospel attracts. The law shows the
          distance between God and man; the gospel bridges that distance, and
          brings the sinner across that great fixed gulf which Moses could never
          bridge. The fact is, as you will all have to learn, if you know
          anything of gracious experience, that from the first moment of your
          spiritual life until you are ushered into glory, the cry of Christ to
          you will be, "Come, come unto me." He will always be ahead of you,
          bidding you follow him as the soldier follows his leader. He will
          always go before you to pave your way, and to prepare your path, and
          he will bid you come after him all through life, and in the solemn
          hour of death, when you shall lie panting upon your bed, his sweet
          word with which he shall usher you into the heavenly world shall be --
          "Come, come unto me. Stretch thy wings and fly straight to this world
          of joy where I am dwelling. Come and be with me where I am."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nay, further than this, this is not only Christ's cry to you; but if
          you be a believer, this is your cry to Christ -- "Come! come!" You
          will be longing for his second advent; you will be saying, "Come
          quickly, even so come Lord Jesus." And you will be always panting for
          nearer and closer communion with him. As his voice to you is "Come,"
          even so will be your prayer to him, "Come, Lord, and abide in my
          house. Come, and consecrate me more fully to thy service; come, and
          without a rival reign; come, occupy alone the throne of my heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come," then, is the very motto-word of the gospel. I hope to expand
          that word, this morning, to beat out the golden grain into goldleaf,
          and may God the Holy Spirit speak this day with his minister, and may
          some who have never come to Jesus before, now come to him for the
          first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us go at once to our text -- "Whosoever will, let him take the
          water of life freely." Now, there are four things very plain from our
          text, namely, that first, there is a "water of life;" that secondly,
          the invitation is very wide -- "Whosoever will;" that thirdly, the
          path is clear, for it says, "Whoever will, let him come;" and then
          again, that, fourthly, the only rule that is prescribed is -- let him
          take it "freely." That is the only price demanded, and the only
          condition, which indeed is not a condition, but a death-blow to all
          conditions. "Let him come and take the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, remember I am about to preach a very simple sermon
          this morning, dealing with simple souls. I am longing to see sinners
          brought to Christ, my heart yearns after the multitude of men who see
          no beauty in him that they should desire him. God has saved many in
          this place; may he be pleased this morning to bring some wanderer to
          the Father's house, through the merit of the Son's cross by the
          Spirit's influence. Well, then, THERE IS A "WATER OF LIFE." Man is
          utterly ruined and undone. He is lost in a wild waste wilderness. The
          skin bottle of his righteousness is all dried up, and there is not so
          much as a drop of water in it. The heavens refuse him rain, and the
          earth can yield him no moisture. Must he perish? He looks aloft,
          beneath, around, and he discovers no means of escape. Must he die?
          Must thirst devour him? Must he fall upon the desert and leave his
          bones to bleach under the hot sun? No; for the text declares there is
          a fountain of life. Ordained in old eternity by God in solemn
          covenant, this fountain, this divine well, takes its spring from the
          deep foundations of God's decrees. It gusheth up from the depth which
          coucheth beneath, it cometh from that place which the eagle's eye hath
          not seen, and which the lion's whelp hath not passed over. The deep
          foundations of Godly government, the depth, of his own essential
          goodness and of his divine nature -- these are the mysterious springs
          from which gush forth that fountain of the "water of life" which shall
          do good a to man. The Son hath digged this well and bored through
          massive rocks which prevented this living water from springing upward.
          Using his cross as the grand instrument he has pierced through rocks,
          he has himself descended to the lowest depth, and he hath broken a
          passage by which the love and grace of God, the living water which can
          save the soul, may well up and overflow to quench the thirst of dying
          men. The Son hath bidden this fountain freely flow, hath removed the
          stone which laid upon the mouth thereof, and now having ascended upon
          high he standeth there to see that the fountain shall never stay its
          life-giving course, that its floods shall never be dry, that its
          depths shall never be exhausted. This sacred fountain, established
          according to God's good will and pleasure in the covenant, opened by
          Christ when he died upon the cross, floweth this day to give life and
          health, and joy and peace to poor sinners dead in sin, and ruined by
          the fall. There is a "water of life."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us pause awhile and look at its floods as they come gushing
          upwards, overflowing on every side, and assuaging men's thirst. Let us
          look with joyous eye. It is called the "water of life," and richly
          doth it deserve its name. God's favor is life, and in his presence
          there is pleasure for evermore; but this water is God's favor, and
          consequently life. By this water of life is intended God's free grace,
          God's love for men, so, that if you come and drink, you shall find
          this to be life indeed to your soul, for in drinking of God's grace
          you inherit God's love, you are reconciled to God, God stands in a
          fatherly relation to you, he loves you, and his great infinite heart
          yearns towards you:
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is living water not simply because it is love, and that is
          life, but it saves from impending death. The sinner knows that he must
          die because he is filthy. He has committed sins so tremendous that God
          must punish him. God must cease to be just if he does not punish the
          sins of man. Man when conscious that he has been very guilty, stands
          shivering in the presence of his Maker, feeling in his soul that his
          doom is signed, and sealed, and that he must certainly be cast away
          from all hope, and life, and joy. Come hither then ye sin-doomed; this
          water can wash away your sins, and when your sins are washed away,
          then shall ye live; for the innocent must not be punished. Here is
          water that can make you whiter than driven snow. What though you be
          black as Kedar's smoky tents, here is water that can purge you, and
          wash you to the whiteness of perfection, and make you fair as the
          curtains of king Solomon. These waters well deserve the name of life,
          since pardon is a condition of life. Unpardoned we die, we perish, we
          sink into the depths of hell; pardoned we live, we rise, we ascend to
          the very heights of heaven. See here, then, this ever-gushing fountain
          will give to all who take thereof life from the dead, by the pardon of
          their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," saith the poor convicted soul, "This is not all I want, for if
          all the sins I have ever committed were blotted out, in one ten
          minutes I should commit many more. If I were now completely pardoned,
          it would not be many seconds before I should destroy my soul and sink
          helplessly again." Ay! but see here this is living water, it can
          quench thy thirst of sin; entering into thy soul it shall overcome and
          cover with its floods thy propensities to evil. It shall cover them
          first, it shall afterwards drown them, and at last, it shall utterly
          carry them away, sucking them into its whirlpool-depths where they
          shall never be found any more for ever. Oh sinners! this fountain of
          gospel grace can so wash your hearts that you shall no longer love
          sin, yea, so perfectly can this water refine the soul that it shall
          one day make you as spotless as the angels who stand before the throne
          of God, and you too, like them, shall obey the behests of God,
          hearkening to his commands, and rejoicing to be his servants. This is
          life indeed, for here is a favor, here is pardon, here is sanctity,
          the renewing of the soul by the washing of water, through the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," saith one, "I have a longing within me which I cannot satisfy.
          I feel sure that if I be pardoned yet there is something which I want
          -- which nothing I have ever heard of, or have ever seen or handled
          can satisfy. I have within me an aching void which the world can never
          fill." "There was a time," says one, "when I was satisfied with the
          theater, when the amusements, the pleasures of men of the world, were
          very satisfactory to me. But lo! I have pressed this olive till it
          yields no more the generous oil; it is but the dreggy thick excrement
          thereof that now I can obtain. My joys have faded; the beauty of my
          fat valley hath become as a faded flower. No longer can I rejoice in
          the music of this world." Ah! soul, glad am I that thy cistern has
          become dry, for till men are dissatisfied with this world they never
          look out for the next; till the God of this world has utterly deceived
          them they will not look to him who is the only living and true God.
          But hearken! thou that art wretched and miserable, here is living
          water that can quench thy thirst. Come hither and drink, and thou
          shalt be satisfied; for he that is a believer in Christ finds enough
          for him in Christ now, and enough for ever. The believer is not the
          man who has to pace his room, saying, "I find no amusements and no
          delight." He is not the man whose days are weary, and whose nights are
          long, for he finds in religion such a spring of joy, such a fountain
          of consolation, that he is content and happy. Put him in a dungeon and
          he will find good company; place him in a barren wilderness, still he
          could eat the bread of heaven; drive him away from friendship, he will
          find the "friend that sticketh closer than a brother." Blast all his
          gourds, and he will find shadow beneath the rock of ages; sap the
          foundation of his earthly hopes, but since the foundation of his God
          standeth sure, his heart will still be fixed, trusting in the Lord.
          There is each a fullness in religion, that I can honestly testify from
          experience,
        </p>
        <p>"I would not change my best estate,</p>
        <p>For all that earth calls good or great."</p>
        <p>
          I never knew what happiness was till I knew Christ; I thought I did. I
          warmed my hands before the fire of sin, but it was a painted fire. But
          oh, when once I tasted the Saviour's love, and had been washed in
          Jesus's blood, that was heaven begun below.
        </p>
        <p>"Tis heaven on earth, and heaven above,</p>
        <p>To see his face, to taste his love."</p>
        <p>
          Oh, if ye did but know the joys of religion, if ye did but know the
          sweetness of love to Christ, surely ye could not stand aloof. If ye
          could but catch a glimpse of the believer when he is dancing for joy,
          you would renounce your wildest mirth, your greatest joy, to become
          the meanest child in the family of God. Thus then it is the living
          water, it is the water of life, because it satisfies our thirst, and
          gives us the reality of life which we can never find in anything
          beneath the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here let me add very briefly, he who once drinks of this water of
          life, drinks that which will quench his thirst for ever. You shall
          never thirst again, except it be that you shall long for deeper
          draughts of this living fountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that sweet manner shalt thou thirst. It shalt not be a thirst of
          pain, it shall be a thirst of loving joy -- a happy thirst, you will
          find it a sweet thing to be thirsting after more of Christ's love.
          Become a Christian, and thou shalt be satisfied for life, thou shalt
          then be able to say, -- "Return unto thy rest, O my son, for the Lord
          has dealt bountifully with thee." Thou shalt find an ever-living tree
          upon which thou shalt build thy nest, and no axe shall ever fell it,
          no winds shall ever shake thy quiet resting-place, but thou shalt rest
          for ever on the dear bosom of the Saviour where thou shalt find
          eternal rest, eternal joy and peace. Oh, come and take of him, and
          drink of the water of life freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, moreover, he who drinketh of this living water shall never die.
          His body shall see corruption for a little while, but his soul
          mounting aloft, shall dwell with Jesus. Yea! and his very body when it
          has passed through the purifying process, shall again more glorious
          than when it was sown in weakness. It shall rise in glory, in honor,
          in power, in majesty, and united with the soul, it shall everlastingly
          inherit the joys which Christ has prepared for them that love him.
          This is the living water; I see the fountain flowing now, freely
          flowing, sparkling with all these excellent properties. Who would not
          long to come and drink thereof?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In the second place we observe from the text that the invitation
          is very wide -- "WHOSOEVER WILL, LET HIM TAKE THE WATER OF LIFE
          FREELY." How wide is this invitation! There are some ministers who are
          afraid to invite sinners, then why are they ministers! for they are
          afraid to perform the most important part of the sacred office. There
          was a time I must confess when I somewhat faltered when about to give
          a free invitation. My doctrinal sentiments did at thee time somewhat
          hamper me. I boldly avow that I am unchanged as to the doctrines I
          have preached; I preach Calvinism as high, as stern, and as sound as
          ever; but I do feel, and always did feel an anxiety to invite sinners
          to Christ. And I do feel also, that not only is such a course
          consistent with the soundest doctrines, but that the other course is
          after all the unsound one, and has no title whatever to plead
          Scripture on its behalf. There has grown up in many Baptist churches
          an idea that none are to be called to Christ but what they call
          sensible sinners. I sometimes rebut that by remarking, that I call
          stupid sinners to Christ as well as sensible sinners, and that stupid
          sinners make by far the greatest proportion of the ungodly. But I
          glory in the avowal that I preach Christ even to insensible sinners --
          that I would say even to the dry bones of the valley, as Ezekiel did,
          "Ye dry bones live!" doing it as an act of faith; not faith in the
          power of those that hear to obey the command, but faith in the power
          of God who gives the command to give strength also to those addressed,
          that they may be constrained to obey it. But now listen to my text;
          for here, at least, there is no limitation. But sensible or
          insensible, all that the text saith is, "Whosoever will, let him come
          and take the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>
          The one question I have to ask this morning is, art thou willing? if
          so, Christ bids thee take the water of life. Art thou willing? if so,
          be pardoned, be sanctified be made whole. For if thou art willing
          Christ is willing too, and thou art freely invited to come and welcome
          to the fountain of life and grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now mark, the question has to do with the will. "Oh," says one, "I am
          so foolish I cannot understand the plan of salvation, therefore I may
          not come and drink." But my question has nothing to do with your
          understanding, it has to do with your will. You may be as big a fool
          as you will, but if you are willing to come to Christ you are freely
          invited. If you could not read a single letter in the alphabet, or
          spell out a word in the book, yet may your lips -- ignorant lips
          though they be -- now drink of this water of life. It has nothing to
          do with your understanding; it does not say "Whosoever understandeth
          let him come," but "whosoever will," and I do not doubt but what there
          are many souls who when they first come to Christ have very little
          understanding of the way of salvation, and very little knowledge of
          the way in which he saves; but they come to Christ, the Holy Ghost
          makes them willing to come, and so they are saved. Oh ye who have been
          for many a year wearing the pauper's garb, ye who come here from the
          workhouse, ye that are ignorant, ye that are despised among men -- are
          you willing to be saved? Can you say from your heart, "Lord, thou
          knowest I would have my sins forgiven?" Then come and welcome. Jesus
          bids thee come. Let not thine ignorance keep thee away. He appeals,
          not to thine understanding, but to thy will.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," says one, "I can understand the plan of salvation, but I cannot
          repent as I would. Sir, my heart is so hard, I cannot bring the tear
          to my eye, I cannot feel my sins as I would desire.
        </p>
        <p>"My heart how dreadful hard it is,</p>
        <p>How heavy here it lies;</p>
        <p>Heavy and cold within my breast,</p>
        <p>Just like a rock of ice."</p>
        <p>
          Ay, but this text has nothing to do with your heart; it is with your
          will. Are you willing? Then be your heart hard as the nether millstone
          if thou art willing to be saved I am bidden to invite thee. "Whosoever
          will," not "whosoever feels," but "whosoever will, let him come and
          take the water of life freely." "Yes," says one, "I can honestly say I
          am willing, but my heart will not soften. I wish that grace would
          change me. I can say I wish that Christ would soften my heart. I do
          desire that he would put the living fire within my cold breast and
          make me repent, and make me love him, and make me believe in him. I am
          willing." Well, then, the text is for thee, "Whosoever will, let him
          come." If thou art willing thou art freely invited to Christ. "No,"
          saith one, "but I am such a great sinner. I have been a drunkard; I
          have been a lascivious man; I have gone far astray from the paths of
          rectitude. I would not have all my sins known to my fellow creatures.
          How can God accept of such a wretch as I am, such a foul creature as I
          have been?" Mark thee, man! There is no reference made here to thy
          past life. It simply says, "whosoever will," Art thou willing? Art
          thou willing to be saved? Canst thou say, "Now, Lord, I am willing to
          be saved, give me a new heart; I am willing to give up my sins; I am
          willing to be a Christian; I am willing to believe and willing to
          obey, but oh for this no strength have I, Lord, I have the will; give
          me the power." Then thou art freely invited to come, if thou art but
          willing. There is no barrier between thee and Christ except thy
          stubborn will. If thy will is subdued, and if thou art saying "Yes,
          Lord, I am willing," then art thou freely invited. Oh, reject not the
          invitation, but, come and welcome, sinner come."
        </p>
        <p>
          But saith one, "I cannot come, I cannot believe; I cannot do as I
          would." Well, but it does not say, "Whosoever can, let him come," but
          "whosoever will, let him come." Art thou willing? You know there is
          many a man that has more will than power, but God estimates us not by
          our power, but by our will. You see a man on horseback, he is in haste
          to fetch a doctor for some dying man: the horse is a miserable jade,
          and will not go as rapidly as the man would like, but you cannot scold
          him because you see him whipping and spurring, and thus proving that
          he would go if he could, and so the master takes the man's will for
          the deed. So is it with you, your poor heart will not go, it is a
          sorry, disabled jade, but it would go if it could. So Jesus invites
          you, not according to what you can, but according to what you will.
          "Whosoever will, let him come and take the water of life freely." All
          the stipulation is -- Art thou willing -- truly willing? If so, thou
          art freely welcome. Thou art earnestly invited to take of the water of
          life, and that freely too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely as this goes round the hall, there will be many found who did
          answer to it, and who will say, from all their hearts, "I am willing:
          I am willing." Come let the question go personally round. Let me not
          talk to you in the mass, but let the arrow reach the individual. Grey
          head, give thy reply, and let you fair-haired boy answer also. Are you
          willing now to be saved -- are you willing to forsake sin -- willing
          to take Christ to be your master from this day forth and for ever? Are
          you willing to be washed in his blood? Willing to be clothed in his
          righteousness? Are you willing to be made happy -- willing to escape
          from hell, and willing to enter? Strange that it should be necessary
          to ask such questions, but still it is. Are you willing? Then remember
          that whatever may be against you -- whatever may have defiled you --
          however black, however filthy, however worthless you may be, you are
          invited this day to take of the fountain of the water of life freely,
          for you are willing, and it is said, "Whosoever will, let him come."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah!" saith one, "God knows I am willing, but still I do not think I
          am worthy." No, I know you are not, but what is that to do with it? It
          is not "whosoever is worthy," but "whosoever will, let him come."
          "Well," says one, "I believe that whosoever will may come, but not me,
          for I am the vilest sinner out of hell." But mark thee, sinner, it
          says, "whosoever." What a big word that is! Whosoever! There is no
          standard height here. It is of any height and any size. Little
          sinners, big sinners, black sinners, fair sinners, sinners double
          dyed, old sinners, aggravated sinners, sinners who have committed
          every crime in the whole catalogue, -- whosoever. Doth this exempt
          one? Who can be excluded from this whosoever? It mattereth not who
          thou mayest be, nor what thou mayest have been, if thou art willing to
          be saved; free as the air thou breathest is the love and grace of God.
          "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>Thus have I tried to show you how broad the invitation is.</p>
        <p>
          III. And now I am about to show you, in the third place, how clear the
          path is. "WHOSOEVER WILL, LET HIM TAKE THE WATER OF LIFE FREELY." That
          word "let" is a very curious word, because it signifies two opposite
          things. "Let" is au old-fashioned word which sometimes signifies
          "hinder." "He that letteth shall be taken away," -- that is, "He that
          hindereth." But here, in our text, it means the removing of all
          hindrance. "Let him come:" -- Methinks I hear Jehovah speaking this.
          Here is the fountain of love and mercy. But you are too unworthy, you
          are too vile. Hear Jehovah! He cries, "Let him come, he is willing.
          Stand back! doubts and fears, away with you, let him come; make a
          straight road; let him come if he be but willing." Then the devil
          himself comes forward and striding across the way, he says to the poor
          trembling soul, "I will spill thy blood; thou shalt never have mercy.
          I defy thee; though shalt never believe in Christ, and never be
          saved." But Christ says, "Let him come;" and Satan, strong though he
          be, quails beneath Jehovah's voice, and Jesus drives him away, and the
          path stands clear this morning, nor can sin, nor death, nor hell,
          block up the way, when Jehovah Jesus says, "Let him come."
        </p>
        <p>
          Methinks I see several ministers standing in the way. They are of such
          high doctrine that they dare not invite a sinner, and they therefore
          clog the gospel with so many conditions. They will have it that the
          sinner must feel a certain quantity of experience before he is invited
          to come, and so they put their sermons up and say, "You are not
          invited, you are a dead sinner, you must not come; you are not
          invited; you are a hardened rebel." "Stand back," says Christ, "every
          one of you, though ye be my servants. Let him come, he is willing --
          stand not in his way." It is a sad thing that Christ's ministers
          should become the devil's aiders and abettors, and yet sometimes they
          are, for when they are telling a sinner how much he must feel, and how
          much he must know before he comes to Christ, they are virtually
          rolling big stones in the path, and saying to the willing sinner,
          "Thou mayest not come." In the name of Almighty God, stand back
          everything this morning that keeps the willing sinner from Christ.
          Away with you, away with you! Christ sprinkles his blood upon the way,
          and crises to you, "Vanish, begone! leave the road clear; let him
          come; stand not in his path; make straight before him his way, level
          the mountains and fill up the valleys; make straight through the
          wilderness a highway for him to come, to drink of this water of life
          freely. 'Let him come.'" Oh, is not that a precious word of command!
          for it has all the might of Omnipotence in it. God said, "Let there be
          light and there was light," and he says, "Let him come" and come he
          will and must, that is but willing to come. "Whosoever will, let him
          take of the water of life freely." And now, sinner, remember God says,
          "come." Is there anything in thy way? Remember, he adds, "Let him
          come." He bids everything stand out of thy way. Standing one day in
          the court-house, some witness was required, I forget his name, it may
          have been Brown, for instance, in one moment the name was announced,
          "Brown, Samuel Brown," by-and-bye twenty others take up the cry,
          "Samuel Brown, Samuel Brown." There was seen a man pushing his way
          through, "Make room," said he, "make room, his honor calls me," and
          though there were many in his path, they gave way, because his being
          called was a sufficient command to them, not to hinder him, but to let
          him come. And now, soul, if thou be a willing sinner, though thy name
          it not mentioned -- if thou be a willing sinner, thou art as truly
          called as though thou wert called by name, and therefore, push through
          thy fears. Make elbow room, and come; they that would stop thee are
          craven cowards. He has said "Let him come," and they cannot keep you
          beck; Jehovah has said, "Let him come," and it is yours now to say, "I
          will come. "There is nothing that shall hinder me, I will push through
          every thing, and
        </p>
        <p>'I will to the gracious King,</p>
        <p>Whose scepter mercy gives,'</p>
        <p>I will go to the fountain and take of the water of life freely."</p>
        <p>
          IV. And now this brings me to the last head, the condition which is
          the death of all conditions -- LET US TAKE IT FREELY. Methinks I see
          one here who is saying "I would be saved and I will do what I can to
          be worthy of it." The fountain is free, and he comes with his
          halfpenny in his hand, and that a bad one, and he says, "Here, sir,
          give me a cup of this living water to drink; I am well worthy of it
          for see the price is in my band." Why, man, if thou could'st bring the
          wealth of Potosi, or all the diamonds of Galconda, and all the pearls
          of Ormuz, you could not buy this most costly thing. Put up your money,
          you could not have it for gold or silver. The man brings his merit,
          but heaven is not to be sold to meritmongers. Or perhaps you say "I
          will go to church regularly, I will give to the poor, I will attend my
          meeting-house, I will take a sitting, I will be baptized, I will do
          this and the other, and then no doubt I shall have the water of life."
          Back, miserable herd, bring not your rags and rubbish to God, he wants
          them not. Stand back, you insult the Almighty when you tender anything
          as payment. Back with ye; he invites not such as you to come. He says
          come freely. He wants nothing to recommend you. He needs no
          recommendation. You want no good works. Do not bring any. But you have
          no good feelings. Nevertheless you are willing, therefore come. He
          wants no good feelings of you. You have no belief and no repentance,
          yet nevertheless you are willing.
        </p>
        <p>"True belief and true repentance,</p>
        <p>Every grace that brings us nigh,</p>
        <p>Without money,</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus Christ and buy."</p>
        <p>
          Do not try to get them yourself -- come to him, and he will give them
          to you. Come just as you are; it is "freely," "without money and
          without price." The drinking fountains at the corners of our streets
          are valuable institutions; but I cannot imagine anyone being so
          foolish, as when he comes to the drinking. fountains fumbling for his
          purse, and saying, "I cannot drink because I have not five pounds in
          my pocket." Why, however poor the man is, there is the fountain, and
          poor as he is he may drink of it. It is put there for the public.
          Thirsty souls as they go by, whether they are dressed in fustian or in
          broad cloth, don't look for any warrant for drinking; they come and
          drink of it freely. Here it is; the liberality of some good friend has
          put it there, and they take it and ask no questions whatever. Perhaps
          the only persons that ever need to go thirsty through the street where
          there is a drinking fountain, are the fine ladies and gentlemen who
          are in their carriages. They are very thirsty, and cannot think of
          being so vulgar as to get out to drink. It would bemean them, they
          think, to drink at a common drinking fountain, so they go with parched
          lips. Oh, how many there are that are rich, rich in their own good
          works, that cannot come to Christ. "I will not he saved," they say,
          "in the same way as a harlot or a swearer. What I go to heaven the
          same way as a chimney sweep! Is there no pathway to glory, but the
          path which a Magdalene may take? I will not be saved that way." Then
          you fine gentry may remain without. You are not bidden to come, for
          you are not willing. But remember,
        </p>
        <p>"None are excluded hence,</p>
        <p>But those who do themselves exclude;</p>
        <p>Welcome the learned and polite,</p>
        <p>The ignorant and rude."</p>
        <p>
          "Whosoever wills let him come." Let him bring nothing to recommend
          him. Let him not imagine he can give any payment to God or any ransom
          for his soul; for the one condition that excludes all conditions is,
          "Let him come and take the water of life freely." There is a man of
          God here, who has drank of the river of the water of life many times;
          but he says, "I want to know more of Christ, I want to have nearer
          fellowship with him; I want to enter more closely into the mystery of
          his sacrifice; I want to understand more and more of the fellowship of
          his sufferings, and to be made conformable unto his death." Well,
          believer, drink freely. You have filled your bowl of faith once, and
          you drank the draught off, fill it again, drink again, and keep on
          drinking. Put your mouth to the fountain if you will, drink right on.
          As good Rutherford says in one of his letters, "I have been sinking my
          bucket down into the well full often, but now my thirst after Christ
          has become so insatiable, that I long to put the well itself to my
          lips, and drain it all, and drink right on." Well take it freely as
          much as ever you can. You have come now into the field of Boaz, you
          may pick up every ear that you can find, nay more than that, you may
          carry away the sheaves if you like, and more than that, you may claim
          the whole field to be yours if you will. The eating and drinking at
          Christ's table is like that of Ahasuerus, only in an opposite way. It
          is said of that table, none did compel; it is said of this, none doth
          withhold: none can restrain. If there be a big vessel full of this
          holy water, drink it all up, and if there be one that holdeth twelve
          firkins, drink it, yea, drink it all, and thou shalt find that even
          then there is as much as ever. In Christ there is enough for all,
          enough for each enough for evermore; and none shall ever have need to
          say that there was not enough in Christ for him. Drink freely. So you
          see that there are two meanings -- drink without price, and drink
          without stint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, we have an old proverb that there are certain guests who
          come to our houses who are more free than they are welcome. They make
          free themselves, and go further than we can bid them welcome. But with
          regard to those who come to the fountain of living waters, you may
          make as free as you will and you are welcome; make as free as you can,
          take this water as you will, Christ will not grudge you. He that
          stands by the fountain will never mourn because you drink too much; he
          will never be dissatisfied because such a black fellow as you has
          dared to wash himself in the living stream. No, but the blacker you
          are the more will he rejoice that you have been washed; the more
          thirsty you are the more will his soul be gladdened to have you drink
          even to the full and be satisfied. He is not enriched by withholding;
          rather he is enriched in joy by giving. It is as much a pleasure to
          Christ to save you as it will be to you to be saved. He is just as
          glad to see the poor, the lame, the halt, and the blind sit at his
          table as ever they can be to sit there. He is just as pleased to carry
          men to heaven as they themselves can be when they drink of the river
          of joy at the fountain-head of eternity, "Whosoever will let him take
          the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I do not know what to say further. My text is such a precious
          one that I cannot enter into the fullness of its freeness and
          sweetness. Remember, my dear friends, if you are willing to be saved,
          God requires nothing of you except that you will yield yourselves up
          to Christ. If you are willing to be saved none can prevent; there is
          no obstacle. You are not going like the daughters of Hobab to a well
          from which you will be driven by the coarseness and rudeness of
          shepherds. You are come where Jesus stands -- stands with open arms,
          stands with open mouth, crying to you this day, "If any man thirst let
          him come unto me and drink, and whosoever will let him take the water
          of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now will you refuse the invitation? See that you refuse not him
          that speaketh! Will you go this day and abuse the free mercy of God?
          Shall this very mercy lead you into more sin? Will you be wicked
          enough to say, that because grace is free, therefore you will continue
          in sin year after year?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh do not so; grieve not the Spirit of God; to-day is the accepted
          time; to-day is the day of salvation. If ye turn not he will whet his
          sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. You have been warned,
          your conscience has often pricked you, now this day you are sweetly
          invited. But the time of warnings and invitations will not last for
          ever: they will soon be over, and when your funeral knell is tolling,
          you shall be in that lake of fire, that land of misery and pain, where
          not a drop of water shall ever cool your burning tongue. As you would
          escape from the flames of hell, as you would be delivered from the
          eternal torments which God will certainly hurl upon you like
          hailstones, I beseech thee now consider thy ways, and if now thou art
          willing thou art invited and none can keep thee back from his mercy.
          "Whosoever will let him take the water of life freely." Shall I preach
          in vain? Will you all go away and not take the water of life? Come,
          soul -- is there not one at least that God shall give me this day for
          my hire -- not one? May I not take one of you by the hand, some poor
          sinning erring brother? Come, brother let us go together and drink. O
          may the Holy Ghost incline you. Take it my brother. See on that bloody
          tree Jesus hangs; behold he pays his life a ransom for your sins and
          mine. Believe on him, trust him, commit your soul to him and be saved.
          Will you not say in your soul
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am without one plea</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me</p>
        <p>And that thou bid'st me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O lamb of God I come, I come?"</p>
        <p>
          And as my Master is true and faithful, he cannot cast away one soul
          that cometh, for "him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out."
          O Spirit, now draw reluctant hearts, and now give timid souls courage
          to believe for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
