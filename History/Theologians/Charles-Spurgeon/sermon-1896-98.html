          4. Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent him, Thou art a priest for
          ever, according to the manner of Melchizedek
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          4 Jehovah hath sworn This verse is a satisfactory proof that the
          person here spoken of is none other than Christ. When the Jews, with
          the view of mystifying this prediction, render the term kvhn, chohen,
          a prince, their translation is at once feeble and frivolous. I
          acknowledge, indeed, that those of noble descent or of royal blood are
          in Hebrew denominated khnym, chohanim; but would it have been saying
          any thing to the honor of Christ for David merely to give to him the
          title of a chief, which is inferior to that of royal dignity? Besides,
          what would be the import of saying that he was a prince for ever, and
          according to the manner of Melchizedek? There can be no question then,
          that the Holy Ghost here refers to something specific and peculiar, as
          distinguishing and separating this king from all other kings. This,
          too, is the well known title with which Melchizedek was honored by
          Moses, (Genesis 14:18) I grant, indeed, that anciently among heathen
          nations kings were wont to exercise the priestly office; but
          Melchizedek is called "the priest of the most high God," in
          consequence of his devoutly worshipping the only true God. Among his
          own people, however, God did not permit the blending of these offices.
          Hence Uzziah, David's legitimate successor, was struck with leprosy
          because he attempted to offer incense to God, (2 Chronicles 26:21.)
          The circumstances connected with the lineage of David were vastly
          different from those relating to Melchizedek. What these are it is not
          difficult to ascertain, inasmuch as in this new King the holy office
          of the priesthood shall be united with the crown and the throne. For
          assuredly the imperial majesty was not so conspicuous in such an
          obscure prince as Melchizedek, as on that account to warrant his being
          held out as an example above all others. Salem, the sole seat of his
          throne, and where he reigned by sufferance, was at that time a small
          obscure town, so that with regard to him there was nothing deserving
          of notice saving the conjunction of the crown and the priesthood.
          Ambitious of procuring greater reverence for their persons, heathen
          kings aspired after the honor of the sacerdotal office; but it was by
          divine authority that Melchizedek was invested with both these
          functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          All dubiety as to this being the meaning of David ought to be banished
          from our minds by the authority of the Apostle. And although the Jews
          may maintain the contrary as obstinately as they please, yet reason
          manifestly declares that the beauty of holiness, to which I formerly
          adverted, is here very clearly described. To this a decisive and
          peculiar mark is appended, which elevates Christ above all other kings
          with regard to the dignity of the priesthood, and which at the same
          time tends to point out the difference between his priesthood and that
          of Levi. In connection with his sacerdotal office, mention is made of
          God's oath, who was not wont to mingle his venerable name with matters
          of minor importance; but, on the contrary, to teach us by his own
          example to swear deliberately and reverently, and never unless in
          weighty and important matters. Admitting, then, that God had sworn
          that the Messiah would be the prince and governor of his people,
          according as Melchizedek was, this would have been nothing else than
          an unbecoming profanation of his name. When, however, it is quite
          apparent that something unusual and peculiar was denoted in this
          place, we may therefore conclude that the priesthood of Christ is
          invested with great importance, seeing that it is ratified by the oath
          of God. And, in fact, it is the very turning point upon which our
          salvation depends; because, but for our reliance on Christ our
          Mediator, we would be all debarred from entering into God's presence.
          In prayer, too, nothing is more needful for us than sure confidence in
          God, and therefore he not only invites us to come to him, but also by
          an oath hath appointed an advocate for the purpose of obtaining
          acceptance for us in his sight. As for those who shut the door against
          themselves, they subject themselves to the guilt of impeaching him
          with being a God of untruth and of perjury. It is in this way that the
          Apostle argues the disannulling of the Levitical priesthood; because,
          while that remained entire, God would not have sworn that there should
          be a new order of priesthood unless some change had been contemplated.
          What is more, when he promises a new priest, it is certain that he
          would be one who would be superior to all others, and would also
          abolish the then existing order.

          Some translate the term dvrty, diberathi, according to my word, an
          interpretation which I am not disposed entirely to reject, inasmuch as
          David would be represented as affirming that the priesthood of
          Melchizedek is founded upon the call and commandment of God. But as
          the letter y, yod, is frequently redundant, I, in common with the
          majority of interpreters, prefer translating it simply manner.
          Moreover, as not a few of the fathers have misapprehended the
          comparison between Christ and Melchizedek, we must learn from the
          Apostle what that resemblance is; from which will be readily seen the
          error into which they fell respecting it. For can there be any thing
          more absurd than to overlook all the mysteries about which the Spirit,
          by the mouth of the Apostle, hath spoken, and attend only to such as
          he has omitted? Such persons argue solely about the bread and wine,
          which they maintain were offered both by Melchizedek and Christ. But
          Melchizedek offered bread and wine, not as a sacrifice to God, but to
          Abraham as a repast to refresh him on his march. "In the holy Supper
          there is not an offering of bread and wine as they erroneously
          imagine, but a mutual participation of it among the faithful. As to
          the passage under review, the similitude refers principally to the
          perpetuity of his priesthood, as is obvious from the particle lvlm,
          leolam, that is to say, for ever. Melchizedek is described by Moses as
          if he were a celestial individual; and, accordingly, David, in
          instituting a resemblance between Christ and him, designs to point out
          the perpetuity of his priestly office. Whence it follows, (a point
          which is handled by the Apostle,) that as death did not intercept the
          exercise of his office, he has no successor. And this circumstance
          demonstrates the accursed sacrilege of the Popish mass; for, if the
          Popish priests will assume the prerogative of effecting a
          reconciliation between God and men, they must of necessity denude
          Christ of the peculiar and distinguishing honor which his Father has
          conferred upon him.<br />
