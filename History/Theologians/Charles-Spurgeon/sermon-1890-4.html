          It has been reported at the seat of the apostles by your delegates,
          that certain of our brethren, bishops to wit, are being expelled from
          their churches and seats, and deprived of their goods, and summoned,
          thus destitute and spoiled, to trial; a thing which is void of all
          reason, since the constitutions of the apostles and their successors,
          and the statutes of emperors, and the regulations of laws, prohibit
          it, and the authority of the seat of the apostles forbids it to be
          done. It has been ordained, indeed, in the ancient statutes, that
          bishops who have been ejected and spoiled of their property should
          recover their churches, and, in the first place, have all their
          property restored to them; and then, in the second place, that if any
          one may desire to accuse them justly, he should do so at the like
          risk; that the judges should be discreet, the bishops right-minded and
          harmonious in the Church, where they should be witnesses for every one
          who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer till all
          that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by
          law without detriment. Nor is it strange, brethren, if they persecute
          you, when they persecuted even to death your Head, Christ our Lord.
          Yet even persecutions are to be endured patiently, that ye may be
          known to be His disciples, for whom also ye suffer. Whence, too, he
          says Himself, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for
          righteousness' sake." Sustained by these testimonies, we ought not
          greatly to fear the reproach of men, nor be overcome by their
          up-braidings, since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the
          prophet, saying, "Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, my
          people, in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
          neither be ye afraid of their revilings;" considering what is written
          in the Psalm, "Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the
          secrets of the heart, and the thoughts of such men, that they are
          vanity," "They spoke vanity every one with his neighbour: with
          deceitful lips in their heart, and with an evil heart they spoke. But
          the Lord shall cut off all deceitful lips, and the tongue that
          speaketh proud things; who have said, Our lips are our own; who is
          Lord over us?" For if they kept these things in memory, they would by
          no means break forth into so great wickedness. For they do not this by
          laudable and paternal instruction (probabili et paterna doctrina), but
          that they may wreak their vengeful feeling against the servants of
          God. For it is written, "The way of a fool is right in his eyes;" and,
          "There are ways which seem right unto a man, but the end thereof leads
          to death." Now we who suffer these things ought to leave them to the
          judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works;
          who also has thundered through His servants, saying, "Vengeance is
          mine, I will repay." Assist ye, therefore, one another in good faith,
          and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand
          from the help of a brother, since "by this," saith the Lord, "shall
          all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
          another." Whence, too, He speaks by the prophet, saying, "Behold how
          good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"
          In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in
          God, and in the unity of the faith which distinguishes this pleasant
          dwelling according to truth, which indeed was more beauteously
          illustrated in Aaron and the priests clothed with honour, as ointment
          upon the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to
          the end of wisdom. For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing
          and eternal life. Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this
          utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word
          for love's sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own
          things. For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or
          according to the common proverb to cast out a beam with a beam
          (excutere palum palo). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours.
          May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of God, power
          is given sometimes to sinners to persecute His saints, in order that
          they who are aided and borne on by the Spirit of God may become more
          glorious through the discipline of sufferings. But to those very
          persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will
          doubtless be woe. Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God;
          for injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and
          whose function they execute. But we pray that a door of enclosure be
          placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be
          defiled by their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth
          no hurtful word. Whence also the Lord speaks by the prophet, "I said I
          will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue." May the
          Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ,
          give you this incitement, that with all means in your power you aid
          all the brethren under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and
          esteem, as is meet, their sufferings your own. Afford them the utmost
          assistance by word and deed, that ye may be found His true disciples,
          who enjoined all to love the brethren as themselves.<br />
