        <p>"Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." -- Romans 5:20.</p>
        <p>
          THERE are two very powerful forces in the world, which have been here
          ever since the time when Eve partook of the forbidden fruit in the
          garden of Eden. Those two forces are sin and grace. A very great power
          is sin, a power dark, mysterious, baleful, but full of force. The
          sorrows of mankind, whence came they but from sin? We should have
          known no war, nor pestilence, nor famine, nor would aught of sickness
          or sorrow ever have smitten the human race had not sin sown its evil
          seed in this earth. Sin is the Pandora's box from which all evil has
          come to mankind. See what ravages death has made; its hillocks are
          everywhere. Its mighty scythe mows men down as the mower cuts down the
          grass of the field; but death came by sin and after death comes
          judgment, and, to the ungodly, the doom that never can be desired, the
          eternal wrath whose blackness the wildest tempest cannot imitate. Who
          digged this pit? It was the justice of God on account of sin, and sin
          must therefore be charged with the authorship of sorrow, disease,
          death, and hell. This is no mean power with which we have come into
          conflict; it is a veritable Goliath, stalking along and defyin the
          whole race of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power that is to fight and overcome sin is ever described in the
          Word of God, as the natural goodness of human nature, Pshaw! That is
          but as wax before the fire, or as the fat of rams upon the altar; it
          is consumed in a moment in the fierce heat of sin. The force to combat
          sin is never described, in the truthful pages of God's Word, as the
          power of human endeavor to keep the law. Indeed, this has been tried,
          and it has utterly failed. The way to heaven is not up the steep sides
          of Sinai; that granitic mountain is too rugged and too high for
          unaided human feet to climb. Not there can be found the weapons with
          which a man may slay his sins, and fight his way to everlasting bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only counter force against sin is grace; so my text tells us, and
          we may learn the same truth from a hundred texts besides. And what is
          grace? Grace is the free favor of God, the undeserved bounty of the
          ever-gracious Creator against whom we have offended, the generous
          pardon, the infinite, spontaneous lovingkindness of the God who has
          been provoked and angered by our sin, but who, delighting in mercy,
          and grieving to smite the creatures whom he has made, is ever ready to
          pass by transgression, iniquity, and sin, and to save his people from
          all the evil consequences of their guilt. Here, my brethren and
          sisters in Christ, is a force that is fully equal to the requirements
          of the duel with sin; for this grace, of which I am going to speak, is
          divine grace, and hence it is omnipotent, immortal, and immutable.
          This favor of God never changes; and when once it purposes to bless
          anyone, bless him it will, and none can revoke the blessing. The
          gracious purpose of God's free favor to an undeserving man is more
          than a match for that man's sin, for it brings to bear, upon his sin,
          the blood of the incarnate Son of God, and the majestic and mysterious
          fire of the eternal Spirit, who burns up evil and utterly consumes it.
          With God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost united
          against sin, the everlasting purposes of grace are bound to be
          accomplished, sin must be overcome and my text proved to be true,
          "Where sin abounded, grace did more abound."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To illustrate the great principle of my text, I ask you to notice,
          first, that the context refers us to THE ENTRANCE OF THE LAW. "The law
          entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace
          did much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of giving any historical statement concerning the introduction
          of the law in the days of Moses, I am going to speak about the
          experimental matter of the introduction of the law of God into our
          hearts. Those of you who have been converted remember the time when
          the law of the Lord first entered your heart. The law engraved on the
          two tables of stone, the law recorded in the Bible, does but very
          little for us; but when the law really enters our heart, is does much
          for us. What does it do?
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing the law does to most men is to develop the sin that is
          in them. Paul writes, "I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had
          not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." But,
          as soon as he found that there was a law against a certain sin, by
          some unhallowed instinct of his unrenewed nature, he wanted to do the
          very thing that he was forbidden to do. It was like that with us, the
          first effect of the entrance of the law of God into our hearts was to
          develop the sin that was already within us. "That is a dreadful
          thing," says one Yes, it is; but look at the matter from another
          aspect. Here is a man who has within him a dire disease which will be
          fatal if it is allowed to remain, so the physician gives him some
          medicine which throws the disease out. The man used to have a
          beautiful complexion, but after he has taken that medicine, his face
          is covered with blotches. Is that a bad thing? Yes, the blotches are
          bad, but the hidden disease was worse. While that disease was
          concealed within his system, and was killing him, he probably did not
          even know that is was there. He knew that he was not well, and perhaps
          thought that he was dying as the result of some other complaint; but
          now he sees what the disease is, and everybody sees it, and now that
          which looked like an evil thing may turn out to be for real good to
          the man. So does it often happen mentally, morally, and spiritually. A
          man's wicked heart is full of enmity against God, yet he thinks -- and
          perhaps he is right in thinking -- that he is outwardly a strictly
          moral man; but, lo! the law of God, with its requirements of perfect
          purity and Absolute obedience, enters his heart, and he rebels against
          it, and now the sin is apparent, even to himself. It is likely now
          that this man will repent of sin, it is highly probable that this
          development of his latent sin will lead him to form a different
          opinion of himself from any that he ever had before; and therefore,
          though the sin is evil, and the development of it is evil, yet, where
          sin abounded, grace shall much more abound, and so good shall come out
          of the evil after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the law enters a man's heart, it also brings his sin out in very
          strong relief. He never saw his sin to be so black as he now sees it
          to be. A stick is crooked, but you do not notice how crooked it is
          until you place a straight rule by the side of it. You have a
          handkerchief, and it seems to be quite white; you could hardly wish it
          to be whiter; but you lay it down on the newly-fallen snow, and you
          wonder how you could ever have thought it to be white at all. So the
          pure and holy law of God, when our eyes are opened to see its purity,
          shows up our sin in its true blackness, and in that way it makes sin
          to abound; but this is for our good, for that sight of our sin awakens
          us to a sense of our true condition, leads us to repentance, drives us
          by faith to the precious blood of Jesus, and no longer permits us to
          rest in our self-righteousness; and so it can be said of us that,
          though the entrance of the law has made our sin to abound, "Where sin
          abounded, grace did much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>
          The entrance of the law of God into the heart very generally causes
          great anguish. Well do I remember that experience, and so do some of
          you. When the law entered our hearts, it came not merely with a
          straight rule, and with a perfect pattern of whiteness, to show us our
          deformity and our blackness, but it also came with a heavy whip; and
          it laid that whip about our shoulders, and every time it fell it stung
          us to the quick. A little while ago, I met with a brother who said to
          me, "You cannot too forcibly describe the anguish of a convicted
          conscience; for," said he, "I remember when I reckoned how long it
          would be before I must, in the ordinary course of nature, be in hell.
          I said to myself, 'Suppose I live to be eighty years of age, yet how
          short a time it will be before I must be enduring the infinite wrath
          of God.'" Yes, that is the effect that the law of the Lord often
          produces upon a man when is enters his heart. It brings a mirror
          before him, and says to him "Look in there, and see not only what you
          have done, but also what is the just consequence of your evil deeds."
          A man no longer cavils at God's justice when the law once gets inside
          his heart; it shuts his mouth except for graons and sighs, and he has
          plenty of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be thought, by some people, to be a very sad thing that the law
          should come into a man's heart to break it, and to cause him such
          sorrow and anguish as I am trying to describe. Ah, but it is not so;
          it is a very blessed thing. You cannot expect God to clothe you until
          he has stripped you, nor to heal you until he has cut the proud flesh
          out of your wounds. When a woman is sowing with a fine white silken
          thread, see must have a sharp needle to go first, to make a way for
          the thread to go through after it; and the anguish of spirit, which
          the law creates in the soul, is just the sharp needle which makes a
          way for the fine silken thread of the gospel to enter our heart, and
          so to bless us. Let us thank God if ever we have experienced the
          entrance of his law into our hearts: for, although it makes sin to
          abound, is makes grace much more abound.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the law gets thoroughly into a man's heart, it drives him to
          despair of himself. "Oh!" says he, "I cannot keep that law." Once, he
          thought that he was as good as other people, and a little better than
          most; and he did not know but that, with a little polishing, and a
          little help, he might be good enough, to win the favor of God and go
          to heaven; but when the law entered his heart, it soon smashed his
          idol to atoms. The Dagon of self-righteousness speedily falls before
          the ten commands of God, and is so broken that it can never be mended.
          Men try to set the stump of it up on its pedestal again; but so long
          as the law of the Lord is in the same temple with self-righteousness,
          self-righteousness can never be exalted again. To some people, it
          seems to be a dreadful thing to give a man such a bad opinion of
          himself, but, indeed, it is the greatest blessing that could come to
          him, for when he despairs of himself, he will fly to Christ to save
          him. When the last crust is gone from his cupboard, he will cry to the
          great Giver of the bread of life, whereof, if a man eat, he shall live
          for ever. You must starve the sinner's self-righteousness to mane him
          willing to feed on Christ; and thus the very depths of his despair,
          when he thinks that he must be lost for ever, will only lead him, by
          God's abundant love, to a fuller appreciation of the heights of God's
          grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, when the law of God enters a man's heart, it pronounces a
          curse upon him. That was a singular scene which was beheld over
          against mount Ebal, and over against mount Gerizim, where one company
          read the curses, and another company read the blessings out of the
          book of the law. Now the law can do nothing for a sinner but say to
          him, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are
          written in the book of the law to do them;" but the gospel comes in,
          and it replies to the curse of the law with such words as these,
          "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
          Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord impuneth not iniquity, and in
          whose spirit there is no guile." Let the law curse as is may, the
          gospel's blessing is richer and stronger, for the gospel says,
          "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
          our Lord Jesus Christ;" and "there is therefore now no condemnation to
          them, which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
          after the Spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I change our line of thought, and come closer home to
          Christians, by noticing that the great principle of our text is also
          illustrated in THE AFTER-EXPERIENCE OF THE BELIEVER.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some young converts imagine that, as soon as they believe in Christ
          and find peace with God, they will be perfect; and have no more sin
          within them. Such an erroneous idea will only prepare them for a great
          disappointment, for conversion is not the end of the battle with sin,
          it is only the beginning of that battle. From the moment that a man
          believes in Jesus, and is thereby saved, he begins his life-long
          struggle against his inbred sins. I hear that, there are some brethren
          and sisters who have become perfect, and I am pleased to hear it if it
          is true: but I am glad they are not members of my family, I do not
          think I could live with them very peaceably, as I have generally found
          that the so-called "perfect." People are usually not at all pleasant
          people to be associated with those of us who do not profess to be
          perfect. We wish we were perfect, and we wish that other people were
          perfect; but, hitherto, our investigations have led us to believe that
          the perfection which is claimed by certain persons is in every case a
          mistake, and in many cases is a delusion and a sham.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our opinion is that men, after they are converted, and begin to
          examine themselves in the light of God's Word, if they are at all like
          us, find sin everywhere within them; -- sin in the affections, so that
          the hearts lusteth after evil things; -- sin in the judgment, so that
          it often makes most serious mistakes, and honestly puts bitter for
          sweet, and sweet for bitter -- sin in the desires, so that though we
          try to curb them, they wander hither and thither, whither we would
          not; -- sin in the will, so that Lord Will-be-will proves that he is
          still very proud, and wants to have his own way, -- and is not willing
          to bow submissively to the will of God; -- sin in the memory, so that
          the most godly people can often recollect a snatch of a bad old song
          which they used to hear or to sing, far more readily than they can
          remember a text of Scripture; which they wish to treasure up in their
          memories, for memory has become unhinged, like all the rest of our
          faculties, and is quick to retain evil, and slow to retain that which
          is good. Brethren and sisters in Christ, in what part of our body does
          sin not dwell? Is there any single faculty, or power, or propensity
          that we have which will not lead us astray if we will let it do so?
          Are we not obliged to be always upon our guard against ourselves, and
          to watch ourselves as a garrison of soldiers would have to watch the
          natives of a country whom they had subdued, but who were anxious to
          throw off the yoke of the foreigners who had overcome them. In a
          similar fashion, grace is a foreigner in possession of our nature, and
          it holds by its own superior force what it has won; and only by its
          supernatural strength are we kept from regaining our former position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus you see how sin abounds, even in the heart of a believer; but,
          blessed be God, grace doth much more abound there; for, although the
          will is still strong, there is a higher power that subdues and
          controls it so that our will is being gradually conformed to the will
          of God. Our affections, though they are apt to grovel here below, do
          soar towards Christ, for he really has won our hearts. Our desires do
          go astray, yet their main tendency is towards holiness. Blessed be the
          name of the Lord, unless we are awfully deceived, we do desire to do
          that which is well-pleasing in his sight. Our memory, too, though I
          have already confessed its faultiness, does often enable us to
          remember Jesus Christ, and it never will forget him whoever else it
          may forget. Ay, and our whole nature, though I have truly spoken of
          its faults, is a new nature, which God has wrought within us, -- a
          nature that is akin to the divine, and in this nature grace triumphs
          over sin, so that where sin aboundeth, grace doth much more abound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same truth may be learned in another way. Sin abounds in the
          believer, not merely in the shape of the original sin in which he was
          born, and in the tendency to sin which is ever present with him, but
          sin mars the best thing he ever does. Did you ever examine one of your
          own prayers, did you ever look at it critically after it was finished?
          Shall I tell you what it was like? It was like something that man had
          manufactured, and which, when observed by the naked eyed, looked very
          beautiful. Put a microscope over it, and look at it. Take a needle if
          you like, for that seems to be one of the most polished pieces of
          metal conceivable; and as soon as you place it under the microscope,
          you say, "Why, I have got a rough bar of iron here! Surely it cannot
          be a needle." Yes it is, but you are looking at it now with a power
          far beyond your ordinary sight; and, in like manner, when the grace of
          God opens a man's eyes to see his best actions as they appear in God's
          sight, he sees that those actions are marred by sin. There is not
          anything that he has done which appears to him to be what it ought to
          be when he looks at it aright in the light of God's Word. The most
          consecrated action of his life, the most devout communion with Christ,
          the most intense ardor after God, falls far short of what it ought to
          be, and has something in it which ought not to be there. When the
          grace of God is strong within us, it makes sin appear to abound even
          to our own vision; we see it in every hymn we sing, in every prayer we
          pray, in every sermon we preach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only do we see sin in our best things, but we also discover sin in
          our omissions. We were never troubled about that matter before, but
          now we recollect that what we do not do is often sinful; -- not merely
          the wrong that we commit, but the good that we omit, the good that we
          neglect or forget to do. There is much sin there. Then we begin to
          examine our thoughts, and our trivial utterances, and we see them all
          crusted over with sin. Tested under the light of God's Word,
          everything seems to be honeycombed through and through with sin, so
          that sin indeed aboundeth. Well, what then? Why, then, this blessed
          text comes sweetly home to our hearts. "The blood of Jesus Christ his
          Son cleanseth us from all sin." And now, how gloriously grace abounds!
          Now we prove the power of that precious blood which can wash us whiter
          than snow, so that God himself shall say to each one of us, "There is
          no spot in thee." Beloved brethren and sisters in Christ, I do firmly
          believe that a deep and clear sense of sin is necessary to a right
          estimation of the power of pardoning love. I am sure that it is a
          great blessing to us when we have a deep sense of our sinnership. God
          forbid that we should ever pray as the Pharisee did, "God, I thank
          thee, that I am not as other men are." Far better would it be for us
          to imitate the publican, and cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner."
          None but those who are lost prize the Savior who came to seek and to
          save that which was lost, none but those who feel that they are foul
          and vile rightly value his cleansing blood. O beloved, when your sin
          abounds, then is the time to recollect that grace much more abounds.
          Sinner as you are, you are forgiven, you are "accepted in the
          Beloved," you are saved, you are a child of God, you shall be in
          heaven ere long, to praise for ever the grace that shall be crowned
          with glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more on this point. I believe that many of you have had an
          experience similar to mine, and that there have been times when you
          have been living specially near to God, and walking in the light of
          his countenance, when, on a sudden, the sin that dwelleth in you has
          seemed to attack you just when you least expected it. I know that my
          fiercest temptations often come to me immediately after my highest
          enjoyment of communion with God. They seem to come like a sharp
          draught of cold air the moment you step out of a warm room, and you
          hardly know what to do for the best, you are scarcely prepared for it.
          It will sometimes happen that a tempter, which you thought you had
          quite overcome, will rush upon you like a lion out of a thicket; or a
          passion, which you thought had been most eventually conquered, will
          come sweeping down upon you like a hurricane from the hills, and your
          poor little skiff upon the lake seems well-nigh overwhelmed with its
          furious onslaught. Then, as you look at yourselves, and are surprised
          to find so much sin in yourselves, you know that sin abounds; what do
          you do then? Well, I believe that, at such times, Christians try to
          nestle closer than ever under the wings of God, and they feel humbler,
          and they go to the precious blood of Jesus with a more intense desire
          to prove again its cleansing power; and they cry to the Strong for
          strength, and they feel more than ever they did before their need of
          the Holy Spirit's sanctifying power. Ralph Erskine said that he was
          more afraid of a sleeping devil than of a roaring devil, and there was
          good reason for his fear, for when the devil was roaring, the saints
          would be more on the watch than when he was quiet. The worst
          temptation in the world is not to be tempted at all; but when there is
          a strong temptation, and your soul is fully aware of it, you are on
          your guard against it. The wave of temptation may even wash you higher
          up upon the Rock of ages, so that you cling to it with a firmer grip
          than you have ever done before, and so again where sin abounds, grace
          will much more abound.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I must close with a few general observations upon another
          matter. The great truth revealed in our text is not only illustrated
          by the entrance of the law into the hearts of believers, and in the
          after-life of Christians, but also IN ALL THE BLESSINGS OF SALVATION.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very wonderful, but it is certainly true, that there are many
          persons in heaven in whom sin once abounded. In the judgment of their
          fellow-men, some of them were worse sinners than others. There was
          Saul of Tarsus, there was the dying thief, there was the woman in the
          city who was a sinner, -- a sinner in a very open and terrible sense.
          These, and many more of whom we read in the Scriptures, were all great
          sinners, and it was a great wonder of grace, in every instance, that
          they should be forgiven; but did they make poor Christians when they
          were converted? Quite the reverse; they loved much because they had
          been forgiven much. Amongst the best servants of God are many of those
          who were once the best servants of the devil. Sin abounded in them,
          but grace much more abounded when. It took possession of their hearts
          and lives. They were long led captive by the devil at his will, but
          they never were such servants to Satan as they afterwards became to
          the living and true God. They threw all the fervor of their intense
          natures into the service of their Savior, and so rose superior to some
          of their fellow-disciples, who did not so fully realize how much they
          owed to their Lord. I trust that any here present, who have gone far
          in sin, may be saved by the immeasurable grace of God ere they leave
          this building, and that, throughout the whole of their future lives,
          they may love Jesus Christ better, and serve him more than others who
          have not sinned as deeply as they have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same truth comes out if we think of what sin has done for us. O
          brethren, sin has infected the nature of man with a foul leprosy, a
          deadly disease, but Jesus has cured the disease, and given us a life
          of a holier kind than we ever knew before. Sin has robbed us; but
          Christ has restored to us more than sin ever took away from us. Sin
          has stripped us; but Christ has clothed us in a better robe than our
          natural righteousness could ever have been. Well do we sing of Jesus,
          --
        </p>
        <p>"In him the tribes of Adam boast</p>
        <p>More blessings than their father lost."</p>
        <p>
          Sin has brought us very low, but Christ has lifted us higher than we
          stood before sin cast us down. Sin took away from man his love to God,
          but Christ has given us an intenser love to God than Adam ever had,
          for we love God because he has first loved us, and given his Son to
          die for us, and we have, in his greater grace, a good reason for
          yielding to him a greater love. Sin took away obedience from man, nut
          now that saints obey to a yet higher degree than they could have doen
          before; for I suppose it would not been possible for unfallen man to
          suffer, but now we are capable of suffering for Christ; and many
          martyrs have gone signing to death for the truth, because, while sin
          made them capable of suffering, Christ's grace has made them capable
          of obedience to him in the suffering, and so of doing more to prove
          their allegiance to God than would have been possible if they had
          never fallen. Sin, dear brethren and sisters in Christ, has shut us
          out of Eden; yet let us not weep, for Christ has prepared a better
          paradise for us in heaven; Sin has deprived us of the river that
          rippled o'er sands of gold, and of the green glades of that blessed
          garden into which suffering could never have come unless sin had first
          entered, but God has provided for us "a pure river of water of life,"
          and a lovelier garden than Eden ever was; and there we shall for ever
          dwell through the abounding grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
          which has abounded even over our abounding sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin has separated us from God, but grace has brought us nearer to God
          than we ever were before sin divided us from him. Until Christ became
          man, there was no man on the earth, and there would have been no man,
          who was more to God than man could be to his Maker; but now there
          lives a Man who is more to God than any created being ever could be,
          for that Man is also God, and he sits at the right hand of his Father,
          and shares with him the control of the universe. That Man has brought
          the human race nearer to the Deity than the mere act of creation could
          possibly have done. Glory be to God for Jesus Christ, the Man from
          heaven, the Son of Mary, and the Son of the Highest. Sin wrought us
          untold mischief, but grace has made even that mischief to be a gain to
          us, for now we are sought with blood as, otherwise, we never could
          have been. Now we know both sin and righteousness as we could not
          otherwise have done; and now the whispering of the old serpent, which
          was a lie, has proved to have a truth concealed in it, for we are
          indeed as gods, since we have become partakers of the divine nature by
          virtue of our union with the Christ of God. O wondrous Fall, which
          would have broken us hopelessly had it not been for still more
          marvelous grace! O wondrous restoration which has lifted us up, and
          made us more perfect than we were before we were broken, and elevated
          us to a glory of which we could never have dreamed, had we lived with
          Adam and Eve in paradise, and remained in innocence for ever!
        </p>
        <p>
          One practical remark I want to make before I close; it is this, if you
          have received this grace, which has abounded over your sin, take care
          that you do more for grace than you ever did for sin. It is wonderful
          how much people will do for sin, what they will give, what they will
          spend, and what they will endure to gratify their passions and serve
          their cruel taskmaster, Satan. I should not like to guess what some
          men waste on their lusts; I should not like to make a calculation as
          to what some people spend in a year on what they call their pleasures.
          Well, whatever the amount is, shall they give more, shall they do more
          for their god than we give and do for ours? Shall they be more intense
          in their adoration of Satan than we are in our obedience to God? That
          must never be, nor must we ever permit, them to outdo us in the
          praises of their treasure. They make night hideous with their praises
          of their god, Bacchus; but we do not often annoy them with the songs
          of Zion; it would be as well, perhaps, if we did; but we are often
          cowards in not rendering due praises to our God. They are not ashamed
          to make the welkin ring with their lascivious notes; then let us pluck
          up courage, and solidly assert the glories of our God and the wonders
          of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Especially, let us never be
          ashamed to say, "He loved me, and gave himself for me, and blessed be
          his holy name for ever and ever. Amen."
        </p>
        <p>Romans 5</p>
        <p>
          Verse 1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
          through our Lord Jesus Christ:2
        </p>
        <p>
          This verse deserves to be printed in letters of gold. If you can
          truthfully say this, if it is indeed true of you, you are the happiest
          people under heaven. Let us read the verse again: "Therefore being
          justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
          Christ:"
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we
          stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not only at peace with God, but we are permitted to draw near
          to him, we have access to him, we have access to his favor, to his
          grace. We may come to God when we will; for he is reconciled to us,
          and we are reconciled to him, so we may now think of him with joy and
          gladness.
        </p>
        <p>3. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: --</p>
        <p>
          Somebody seemed to say to the apostle, "You talk about peace with God,
          and access to God; but you are troubled in mind, you are sickly in
          body, you are poor in estate, just as other people are;" so Paul
          replies, "Yes, we know that it is so, "but we glory in tribulations
          also:'" --
        </p>
        <p>3. Knowing that tribulation worketh patience; --</p>
        <p>
          It is sent for our good; we accept our trials as a part of our estate,
          and in some respects, the very richest part of our estate. We get more
          good out of our adversity than out of our prosperity. Our troubles
          have made men of us, whereas our joys might have unmanned us. Trials
          have braced us up, and we glory in them, "knowing that tribulation
          worketh patience;" --
        </p>
        <p>4. And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>
        <p>
          The longer we wait, the brighter do our eyes get. Our very trials when
          they have passed over us, leave us stronger and happier than we were
          before. Our experience works in us hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad
          in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.3
        </p>
        <p>
          What a blessed thing it is that, when troubles are shed abroad outside
          us, the love of God is shed abroad inside us; when we are tried
          without, we are comforted within; and so we are made strong, and we
          have no cause to fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
          the ungodly.4
        </p>
        <p>
          And as he died for us when we were ungodly, what will he not do for us
          now that he has sought us as his own? He gave the highest proof of his
          love to us when we were most unworthy of it, so will he leave us now?
          God forbid!
        </p>
        <p>7. For scarcely --</p>
        <p>
          Now the apostle goes away from his theme, carried away by the still
          greater subject of the love of God in Christ Jesus, and the way of
          reconciliation by Christ, he goes on to that theme: "For scarcely" --
        </p>
        <p>7. For a righteous man will one die: --</p>
        <p>
          However "just" Aristides might be, nobody would die for him. However
          "righteous" a man might be, he would not, by his justice or
          righteousness, win enough affection to induce anybody to die for him.
        </p>
        <p>7. Yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</p>
        <p>
          There might possibly be some who would die for a John Howard, or a man
          of that ilk.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. But God commendeth5 his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
          sinners, Christ died for us.
        </p>
        <p>When we were not even just, much less good, "Christ died for us."</p>
        <p>
          9. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
          from wrath through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he died for us, he will certainly save us. He who died for the
          ungodly will never cast away those whom he has justified. The death of
          Christ for his own people is the guarantee that he will love them even
          to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
          death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by
          his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did he love us when we were his enemies? Then most assuredly he will
          love us now that we are his friends. Did his death save us? Then, will
          not his life also save us? As he took such pains to reconcile us to
          his Father, will he not take equal pains -- nay, "much more" to
          preserve us safe to the end?
        </p>
        <p>11. And not only so, --</p>
        <p>
          Paul seems to go up a ladder, and when he gets to the top of it, he
          sets up another on the top of that one, and proceeds to mount that.
          This is the second time that we have read, "And not only so," --
        </p>
        <p>
          11. But we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we
          have now received the atonement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has made atonements for us, and God has accepted that atonement
          on our behalf. We also have received it ourselves and now we are glad
          in God -- glad that there is a God, glad that there is such a God, and
          glad that he is our God and Father in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
          sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
        </p>
        <p>
          It was by one man's sin that we all fell through the first Adam. Does
          anyone object to the justice of that? I pray you, do not object to
          what is your only hope. If you and I had each one sinned for himself
          or herself apart from Adam, our case would probably have been
          hopeless, like the case of the fallen angels, who sinned individually,
          and fell never to be set up again, but inasmuch as we fell
          representatively in Adam, it prepared the way for us to rise
          representatively in the second Adam, Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior.
          As I fell by another, I can rise by another; as my ruin was caused by
          the first man, Adam, my restoration can be brought about by the second
          Man, the Lord from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          13, 14. For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed
          when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses,
          ever over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
          transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infants die, although they have never sinned; they die, because death
          is the penalty of sin; and as they die for faults not their own, so
          are the saved by righteousness not their own. They die, for Adam
          sinned; they live, for Jesus died.
        </p>
        <p>
          15-17. But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if
          through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
          and the gift by grace which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
          unto many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for
          the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
          offenses unto justification. For if by one man's offense death reigned
          by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the
          gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one,8 Jesus Christ.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam's fall was terribly effectual, it has brought death upon the
          human race age after age; and Christ's death is wonderfully effectual,
          for on behalf of all those for whom he died his atonement so prevail
          as to put their sins away for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          19. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
          obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the wonderful doctrine of "the gospel of Christ." It is
          rejected in these evil days; they call it simple, and I know not what
          beside; but here it is put as plainly as words can put it, "As by one
          man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one
          shall many be made righteous."
        </p>
        <p>20. Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound.</p>
        <p>
          The law was not given to Moses to stop sin, or to forgive sin, but to
          make men see how evil sin is, and to make it evident to them how evil
          they are.
        </p>
        <p>20. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</p>
        <p>
          There was more grace than terror even in the law. It has served a
          gracious purpose, for it was given to make us realize our guilt, and
          so might drive us to seek the grace of God for its forgiveness.
          Salvation is all of grace. Sin cannot conquer grace; it has had a hard
          struggle for it, but grace will ultimately win the victory in all who
          believe in Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
          through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>

          The drift of the whole chapter is to comfort believers in the time of
          trouble by the fact of the great love of God to them in the person of
          Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior.
