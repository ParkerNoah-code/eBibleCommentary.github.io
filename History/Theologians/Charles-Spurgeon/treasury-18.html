          TITLE. "To the Chief Musician a Psalm of David, the servant of the
          Lord, who spoke unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that
          the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the
          hand of Saul."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have another form of this Psalm, with significant variations (2
          Samuel 22), and this suggests the idea that it was sung by David at
          different times when he reviewed his own remarkable history, and
          observed the gracious hand of God in it all. Like Addison's hymn
          beginning, "When all your mercies, O my God,"
          <i
            >this Psalm is the song of a grateful heart overwhelmed with a
            retrospect of the manifold and marvelous mercies of God. </i
          >We will call it THE GRATEFUL RETROSPECT.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The title deserves attention. David, although at this time a king,
          calls himself, "the servant of Jehovah," but makes no mention of his
          royalty; hence we gather that he counted it a higher honor to be the
          Lord's servant than to be Judah's king. Right wisely did he judge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Being possessed of poetic genius, he served the Lord by composing this
          Psalm for the use of the Lord's house; and it is no mean work to
          conduct or to improve that delightful part of divine worship, the
          singing of the Lord's praises.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Would that more musical and poetic ability were consecrated, and that
          our chief musicians were fit to be trusted with devout and spiritual
          psalmody.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It should be observed that the words of this song were not composed
          with the view of gratifying the taste of men, but were spoken unto
          Jehovah.
          <i
            >It were well if we had a more single eye to the honor of the Lord
            in our singing, and in all other hallowed exercises. That praise is
            little worth which is not directed solely and heartily to the Lord.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          David might well be thus direct in his gratitude, for he owed all to
          his God, and in the day of his deliverance he had none to thank but
          the Lord, whose right hand had preserved him. We too should feel that
          to God and God alone we owe the greatest debt of honor and
          thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If it be remembered that the second and the forty-ninth verses are
          both quoted in the New Testament (Hebrews 2:13; Romans 15:9) as the
          words of the Lord Jesus, it will be clear that a greater than David is
          here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Reader, you will not need our aid in this respect; if you know Jesus
          you will readily find him in his sorrows, deliverance, and triumphs
          all through this wonderful psalm.

        Samuel 22, and is a most precious addition, placed above all and after
        all to form the pinnacle of the temple, the apex of the pyramid.<i>

        Dwelling among the crags and mountain fastnesses of Judea, David had

          <p align="justify">
            Believers are often hidden in their God from the strife of tongues
            and the fury of the storm of trouble. The clefts of the Rock of Ages
            are safe abodes.
          </p> </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">"My deliverer,"</p></b> interposing in my hour
        of peril. When almost captured the Lord's people are rescued from the
        hand of the mighty by him who is mightier still. This title of
        "deliverer" has many sermons in it, and is well worthy of the study of
        all experienced saints. <b> <p align="justify">"My God,"</p></b> this is
        all good things in one. There is a boundless wealth in this expression;
        <i>it means, my perpetual, unchanging, infinite, eternal good. </i>He
        who can say truly "my God," may well add, "my Heaven, my all."
        <b> <p align="justify">"My strength,"</p></b> this word is really "<i
          >my rock</i
        >," in the sense of strength and immobility. My sure, unchanging,
        eternal confidence and support. Thus the word rock occurs twice, but it
        is no tautology, for the first time it is a rock for <i>concealment</i>,
        but here a rock for <i>firmness </i>and <i>immutability</i>.
        <b> <p align="justify">"In whom I will trust."</p></b>Faith must be
        exercised, or the preciousness of God is not truly known; and God must
        be the object of faith, or faith is mere presumption.

        stored so that none need go to battle unarmed.
        <b> <p align="justify">"The horn of my salvation,"</p></b>enabling me to
        push down my foes, and to triumph over them with holy exultation.

          Here are many words, but none too many; we might profitably examine
          each one of them had we leisure, but summing up the whole, we may
          conclude with Calvin, that
          <i>David here equips the faithful from head to foot.</i>

        >In this verse the happy poet resolves to invoke the Lord in joyful
        song, believing that in all future conflicts his God would deal as well
        with him as in the past. It is well to pray to God as to one who
        deserves to be praised, for then we plead in a happy and confident
        manner. If I feel that I can and do bless the Lord for all his past
        goodness, then I am bold to ask great things of him.
        <p align="justify">
          That word So has much in it. To be saved <i>singing</i>, is to be
          saved indeed. Many are saved mourning and doubting; but David had such
          faith that he could fight singing, and win the battle with a song
          still upon his lips. How happy a thing to receive fresh mercy with a
          heart already sensible of mercy enjoyed, and to anticipate new trials
          with a confidence based upon past experiences of divine love!

          Verses 4-19. In most poetical language the Psalmist now describes his
          experience of Jehovah's delivering power. Poesy has in all her
          treasures no gem more lustrous than the sonnet of the following
          verses; the sorrow, the cry, the descent of the Divine One, and the
          rescue of the afflicted—are here set to a music worthy of the golden

          The Messiah our Savior is evidently, over and beyond David or any

          studying it we have grown more and more sure that every line here has
          its deepest and profoundest fulfillment in Him. But as we are desirous
          not to extend our comment beyond moderate bounds, we must leave it
          with the devout reader to make the very easy application of the
          passage to our once distressed but now triumphant Lord.

            Verse 4. "The sorrows of death compassed me."

        Death like a cruel conqueror seemed to twist round about him the cords
        of pain. He was environed and hemmed in with threatening deaths of the
        most appalling sort. He was like a mariner broken by the storm and
        driven upon the rocks by dreadful breakers, white as the teeth of death.
        Sad plight for the man after God's own heart, but thus it is that
        Jehovah deals with his sons.

          <p align="justify">"The floods of ungodly men made me afraid."</p></b
        >
        Torrents of ungodliness threatened to swamp all religion, and to hurry
        away the godly man's hope as a thing to be scorned and despised. So far
        was this threat fulfilled, that even the hero who slew Goliath began to
        be afraid. The most seaworthy bark is sometimes hard put to it when the
        <i>storm fiend </i>is abroad. The most courageous man, who as a rule
        hopes for the best, may sometimes fear the worst.

          Beloved reader, he who pens these lines has known better than most men
          what this verse means, and feels inclined to weep, and yet to sing,

        Prayer is that back gate which is left open even when the city is

        There are several readings of this sentence. The word is capable of

        Internal strife is very hard to deal with. A civil war is war in its
        most miserable form; it is a subject for warmest gratitude when concord
        rules within. Our poet praises Jehovah for the union and peace which
        smiled in his dominions, and if we have peace in the three kingdoms of
        our spirit, soul, and body, we are in duty bound to give Jehovah a
        song.<i> Unity in a church should assuredly excite like gratitude. </i

        >The neighboring nations yielded to the sway of Judah's prince. Oh, when
        shall all lands adore King Jesus, and serve him with holy joy? Surely
        <i>there is far more of Jesus than of David here</i>. Missionaries may
        derive rich encouragement from the positive declaration that heathen
        lands shall own the Headship of the Crucified.

        Thus readily did the once struggling captain become a far-renowned
        victor, and thus easy shall be our triumphs. We prefer, however, to
        speak of Jesus. In many cases the gospel is speedily received by hearts
        apparently unprepared for it. Those who have never heard the gospel
        before, have been charmed by its first message, and yielded obedience to
        it;
        <i
          >while others, alas! who are accustomed to its joyful sound, are
          rather hardened than softened by its teachings</i

        As our Savior, the Lord should more than ever be glorified. We should
        publish abroad the story of the covenant and the cross—the Father's
        <i>election</i>, the Son's <i>redemption</i>, and the Spirit's
        <i>regeneration</i>. He who rescues us from deserved ruin should be very
        dear to us. In Heaven they sing "Unto him that loved us and washed us in

        >To rejoice in personal revenge is unhallowed and evil, but David viewed
        himself as the instrument of vengeance upon the enemies of God and his

        have been worthy of censure. That sinners perish is in itself a painful
        consideration, but that the Lord's law is avenged upon those who break
        it is to the devout mind a theme for thankfulness.
        <p align="justify">
          We must, however, always remember that vengeance is never ours.
          Vengeance belongs unto the Lord, and he is so just and withal so
          longsuffering in the exercise of it, that we may safely leave its
          administration in his hands.

        clear evidence that David's Lord is here, but David is here too, and is
        to be viewed as an example of a holy soul making its boast in God even
        in the presence of ungodly men. Who are the despisers of God that we
        should stop our mouths for them? We will sing to our God whether they
        like it or no, and force upon them the knowledge of his goodness.

          "Great deliverance." The word "deliverance" is plural, to show the
          variety and completeness of the salvation; the adjective "great" is
          well placed if we consider from what, to what, and how we are saved.
          All this mercy is given to us in our King, the Lord's Anointed, and
          those are blessed indeed who as his seed may expect mercy to be built
          up for evermore. The Lord was faithful to the literal David, and he
          will not break his covenant with the spiritual David, for that would
          far more involve the honor of his crown and character.
