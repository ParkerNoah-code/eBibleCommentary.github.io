          1. Simon the Samaritan was that magician of whom Luke, the disciple
          and follower of the apostles, says, "But there was a certain man,
          Simon by name, who beforetime used magical arts in that city, and led
          astray the people of Samaria, declaring that he himself was some great
          one, to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
          saying, This is the power of God, which is called great. And to him
          they had regard, because that of long time he had driven them mad by
          his sorceries." This Simon, then -- who feigned faith, supposing that
          the apostles themselves performed their cures by the art of magic, and
          not by the power of God; and with respect to their filling with the
          Holy Ghost, through the imposition of hands, those that believed in
          God through Him who was preached by them, namely, Christ Jesus --
          suspecting that even this was done through a kind of greater knowledge
          of magic, and offering money to the apostles, thought he, too, might
          receive this power of bestowing the Holy Spirit on whomsoever he
          would, -- was addressed in these words by Peter: "Thy money perish
          with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be
          purchased with money: thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter,
          for thy heart is not right in the sight of God; for I perceive that
          thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity." He,
          then, not putting faith in God a whit the more, set himself eagerly to
          contend against the apostles, in order that he himself might seem to
          be a wonderful being, and applied himself with still greater zeal to
          the study of the whole magic art, that he might the better bewilder
          and overpower multitudes of men. Such was his procedure in the reign
          of Claudius Cæsar, by whom also he is said to have been honoured with
          a statue, on account of his magical power. This man, then, was
          glorified by many as if he were a god; and he taught that it was
          himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, but descended in
          Samaria as the Father while he came to other nations in the character
          of the Holy Spirit. He represented himself, in a word, as being the
          loftiest of all powers, that is, the Being who is the Father over all,
          and he allowed himself to be called by whatsoever title men were
          pleased to address him.

          2. Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all sorts of heresies derive
          their origin, formed his sect out of the following materials: --
          Having redeemed from slavery at Tyre, a city of Phoenicia, a certain
          woman named Helena, he was in the habit of carrying her about with
          him, declaring that this woman was the first conception of his mind,
          the mother of all, by whom, in the beginning, he conceived in his mind
          [the thought] of forming angels and archangels. For this Ennoea
          leaping forth from him, and comprehending the will of her father,
          descended to the lower regions [of space], and generated angels and
          powers, by whom also he declared this world was formed. But after she
          had produced them, she was detained by them through motives of
          jealousy, because they were unwilling to be looked upon as the progeny
          of any other being. As to himself, they had no knowledge of him
          whatever; but his Ennoea was detained by those powers and angels who
          had been produced by her. She suffered all kinds of contumely from
          them, so that she could not return upwards to her father, but was even
          shut up in a human body, and for ages passed in succession from one
          female body to another, as from vessel to vessel. She was, for
          example, in that Helen on whose account the Trojan war was undertaken;
          for whose sake also Stesichorus was struck blind, because he had
          cursed her in his verses, but afterwards, repenting and writing what
          are called palinodes, in which he sang her praise, he was restored to
          sight. Thus she, passing from body to body, and suffering insults in
          every one of them, at last became a common prostitute; and she it was
          that was meant by the lost sheep.

          3. For this purpose, then, he had come that he might win her first,
          and free her from slavery, while he conferred salvation upon men, by
          making himself known to them. For since the angels ruled the world ill
          because each one of them coveted the principal power for himself, he
          had come to amend matters, and had descended, transfigured and
          assimilated to powers and principalities and angels, so that he might
          appear among men to be a man, while yet he was not a man; and that
          thus he was thought to have suffered in Judæa, when he had not
          suffered. Moreover, the prophets uttered their predictions under the
          inspiration of those angels who formed the world; for which reason
          those who place their trust in him and Helena no longer regarded them,
          but, as being free, live as they please; for men are saved through his
          grace, and not on account of their own righteous actions. For such
          deeds are not righteous in the nature of things, but by mere accident,
          just as those angels who made the world, have thought fit to
          constitute them, seeking, by means of such precepts, to bring men into
          bondage. On this account, he pledged himself that the world should be
          dissolved, and that those who are his should be freed from the rule of
          them who made the world.

          4. Thus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both lead
          profligate lives and practise magical arts, each one to the extent of
          his ability. They use exorcisms and incantations. Love-potions, too,
          and charms, as well as those beings who are called "Paredri"
          (familiars) and "Oniropompi" (dream-senders), and whatever other
          curious arts can be had recourse to, are eagerly pressed into their
          service. They also have an image of Simon fashioned after the likeness
          of Jupiter, and another of Helena in the shape of Minerva; and these
          they worship. In fine, they have a name derived from Simon, the author
          of these most impious doctrines, being called Simonians; and from them
          "knowledge, falsely so called," received its beginning, as one may
          learn even from their own assertions.

          5. The successor of this man was Menander, also a Samaritan by birth,
          and he, too, was a perfect adept in the practice of magic. He affirms
          that the primary Power continues unknown to all, but that he himself
          is the person who has been sent forth from the presence of the
          invisible beings as a saviour, for the deliverance of men. The world
          was made by angels, whom, like Simon, he maintains to have been
          produced by Ennoea. He gives, too, as he affirms, by means of that
          magic which he teaches, knowledge to this effect, that one may
          overcome those very angels that made the world; for his disciples
          obtain the resurrection by being baptized into him, and can die no
          more, but remain in the possession of immortal youth.<br />
