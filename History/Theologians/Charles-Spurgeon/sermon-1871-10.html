        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.977)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Thursday Evening, April 21st, 1870 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>In aid of the Baptist Young Men's Missionary Association.</p>
        <p>
          "I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have
          not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy
          righteousness within my heart, I have declared thy faithfulness and
          thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth
          from the great congregation." -- Psalm 40:9,10.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHO IS THE SPEAKER that gives utterance to these marvellous words? In
          the first instance they must be understood to proceed from our Lord
          Jesus Christ. By the Spirit of prophecy in the Old Testament they were
          spoken of him, and by the Spirit of interpretation in the New
          Testament they have been applied to him. Mark, then, how vehemently he
          here declares that he has fully discharged the work which he was sent
          to accomplish. When, in the days of his flesh, he was crying to his
          Father for preservation in a season of dire distress, he might well
          ask that he should then be helped, since all the previous strength he
          possessed had been laid out in his Father's service. But because this
          profession emphatically belongs to our Savior we need not suppose that
          it exclusively belongs to him. On the other hand, Christ being our
          forerunner and our example, we are encouraged to emulate the high
          calling and the dutiful obedience he so perfectly exhibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. UNDOUBTEDLY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, AS WE READ HIS HISTORY IN THE
          FOUR EVANGELISTS, MOST GLORIOUSLY FULFILLED HIS LIFE-MISSION.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was constantly testifying to the gospel of God, the gospel of his
          righteousness and of his grace. From the first moment when he, being
          full of the Holy Ghost, began to preach the gospel, until the day when
          he was taken up into heaven, while he blessed his disciples, he was
          instant in season and out of season. There were no waste moments of
          time, no neglected opportunities, no talents held in reserve. "I must
          work," was his motto. The zeal of God's house consumed him. It was his
          meat and his drink to do the will of him that sent him. A marvellous
          study is this life of Christ on earth; and as one looks at it thought
          begets thought, for --
        </p>
        <p>"Kindred objects kindred thoughts inspire,</p>
        <p>As summer clouds flash forth electric fire."</p>
        <p>
          Mark ye not how he concentrated every attribute of his nature, ever
          faculty of his mind, and every power of his body in the one work he
          had undertaken -- to do his Father's will? He seems all his life
          through to have challenged the enquiry, "Wist ye not that I must be
          about my Father's business?" He was continually preaching the gospel.
          "Never man spake as this man," may apply to the quantity as well as
          the quality of his utterances. All places seemed to be alike suitable
          to his ministry. Your gowns and your pulpits, your chancels and naves,
          your aisles and transepts were of no account with him. He wanted no
          toga or rostrum, nor did he need a preconcerted arrangement of the
          assembly to lend grace to his discourses when he made known the word
          of God to the people and astonished them with his doctrine. He could
          speak anywhere -- even along the crowded thoroughfare, where the
          multitudes thronged him. He went down the lowest streets, and from the
          poorest beggars he didn't turn aside. He was not thwarted by the
          sneers, and sarcasms, and subtle questioning of the Pharisees and
          Sadducees. One thought possessed him, and he persistently wrought it
          out. His life-sermon as so thorough that nothing of earthly splendor
          could allure or distract him, or break the thread. He was always and
          everywhere either pleading with God for men, or else pleading with men
          for God. The reiterated expressions of these two verses are
          emphatically the truth: the asseverations are vehement, yet the effect
          is a noble vindication of integrity. "I have preached righteousness in
          the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou
          knowest. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
          declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
          lovingkindness, and thy truth from the great congregation." He was the
          great Witness for God, the great Testifier, who went proclaiming
          everywhere the kingdom of God, and the good tidings of salvation to
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not these words likewise suggest to you the thought that Christ
          testified frequently to the greatest crowds? "I have preached
          righteousness in the great congregation. . . . I have not concealed
          thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation." On the
          hill-top, where his disciples came unto him and he began with his
          benediction of "Blessed," the multitude that gathered together, when
          he sat down and taught them, was doubtless imposing. The people
          sometimes thronged to hear him in such numbers that the historian
          describes them as innumerable, and tells us that they trod one upon
          another. From the statement given us, that there were at one time five
          thousand and at another time four thousand men, besides women and
          children, collected together in the desert place and the wilderness,
          when he fed them, we might reasonably infer that in populous places
          the crowds assembled on a yet vaster scale. Of course, the whole
          population off Judea, scattered all over the land, was scarcely equal
          to the population of this city, and therefore greater crowds may be
          collected in London than could have been gathered in Jerusalem; yet
          the concourse there must at times have been exceedingly great and the
          spectacle unusually grand, especially when at the great feast our Lord
          stood up before the people, and rang out, in words clear and distinct
          -- "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink." Why, for years
          afterwards, the very tones of his voice must have haunted the memories
          of those who stood and listened to him, if they rejected the message.
          It is not easy to stand up before a crowded assembly; let those who
          think so come and try. Oftentimes it tests a man's valor. It brings
          him many trials to his spirit to be prepared for the work. But our
          Lord Jesus Christ was fully equipped for his blessed ministry. He was
          a great preacher, with a great message, full of a great love, with a
          great Father by whom he was commissioned, sustained, cheered. All the
          qualities of his character and conduct were congruous. With a great
          assembly he was at home; for his sympathy was mighty in its aggregate
          and minute in its detail. At the same time, Christ did not want a
          great congregation to enable him to preach. The first verse of our
          text, if I catch the heart of its meaning, seems to me to intimate
          that he could speak personally to one or to two: "Lo, I have not
          refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest." From the court of human
          conscience to the court of divine omniscience the appeal is carried.
          Fame hath not heard of this private fidelity. Howbeit he that dwelleth
          in the heavens takes cognisance of it. "O Lord, thou knowest, and
          canst bear witness to it. When there was but one woman at the well's
          brink, I refrained not my lips." When there were but two -- his
          disciples, as he was going to Emmaus -- he opened his mouth. Whether
          they were those whom he had made or would make his disciples, he had a
          word for all at all times and at all seasons. In this we ought to
          imitate the Master. Be ready to tell of Christ not only when your
          heart is prepared for it at a set time, but at all times, whether you
          have prepared for it or not. Your spirit should be always on the
          alert; you should always be on the watch for souls. Fain would I be
          like the eagle that is on its way to the eyrie, and looks for it long
          before it comes in sight, and no sooner discerns it than, like a
          lightning-flash, it darts off and alights upon it. O for a heart that
          is set on winning souls, that is set on glorifying God, that is set on
          coming nearer to the model and being more conformed in this matter
          unto Christ our Head! Our Lord could truly assert that he had not kept
          back the gospel; he had preached it publicly to the crowds, and he had
          declared it privately, as opportunity allowed. That he never did seal
          his lips or stifle his testimony, he could call God to witness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does not the tenth verse, in its first clause, intimate that Christ's
          preaching was never heartless preaching? "I have not hid thy
          righteousness within my heart." As if he had said, "It is in my heart,
          but I have never concealed it there. What I have received of thee, O
          my Father, I have made known unto the people: forsooth, thy will,
          which I have observed in heaven, and engaged to fulfill on earth; thy
          righteousness, as it appears in the justice of thy throne and the
          benevolence of thy laws; thy faithfulness, as it is verified in the
          stability of thy covenant and the perpetuity of thine ordinances; thy
          salvation, as it was prepared in thy counsels of old, and is displayed
          when thou makes bare thy right hand and thy holy arm; thy
          lovingkindness which flows in one perpetual stream of mercy; and thy
          truth, which sets the final seal to thy testimonies; -- all these have
          I treasured in my heart, not to hide them from the children of men,
          but to manifest them for the glory of thy name and the welfare of thy
          people." Is it so? Then this solemn protest before God is of vital
          interest to us. Henceforth every word, every statute, every precept of
          the gospel, comes to us distilled through the heart of Christ. I like
          the idea of pouring our sermons out of our own hearts. They must gone
          from our hearts, or they will not go to our hearers' hearts. But, oh,
          how full of gracious secrets our hearts ought to be, priceless
          secrets, which though hidden from the wise and prudent, are revealed
          unto babes! Jesus, we thank thee for this, that thou hast not
          concealed thy Father's lovingkindness and truth from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, too, our Master kept always to vital matters. We notice here how
          he uses words which show that his teaching had a distinct reference to
          God. "I have not hid thy righteousness; I have declared thy
          faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy
          lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation." Our Lord in
          his teaching never seems to have diverged from the great central
          truth. We are too apt to be taken up with the mere externals, and if
          we do not become mere sectarians, it is just possible that points of
          our creed of the least importance occupy the most prominent place in
          our thought and conversation. Our Lord, with eagle eye, descries what
          is most important for men to know, and upon that he dwells. Sinners
          must know of God's righteousness; they will never know their
          sinfulness else, or knowing it they will think it to be a little
          thing. The righteousness of God comes like a stream of light into the
          soul, and reveals its corruption. God's salvation, again, must be
          shown in its true colors. It does not owe its origin, its
          accomplishment, or its application to our works or our merits, but it
          proceeds from God's grace, and redounds to his glory. I hold that this
          should be the cherished motive of the gospel preacher, to glorify God!
          While it should be the chief end and aim of Christians ordinarily, it
          is to be the chief end and aim of the preacher extraordinarily. Beyond
          everyone else, he is concerned with that which, beyond everything
          else, brings glory to him who is first, last, midst, and without end.
          Jesus Christ preached God's righteousness, and showed God's
          righteousness even in salvation, and then he preached that salvation
          fully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor, dear friends, did he withhold his testimony of the other
          attributes of God. Think for an instant of God's faithfulness. Oh,
          what a delightful theme! As immutability is a glory that belongs to
          all his attributes, so faithfulness pertains to all his purposes and
          promises. Well may his people everywhere rely upon his fidelity. Well
          may we tell that we serve no mutable God. "He is not a man that he
          should lie; neither the Soul of Man that he should repent. Hath he
          said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make
          it good?" Moreover he will rest in his love, "for the Lord will not
          forsake his people for his great name's sake." He is "the Father of
          lights, with whom is, no variableness, neither shadow of turning." His
          promises and his threatenings abide steadfast. Side by side with the
          faithfulness of God there is witness of his lovingkindness. Oh, what a
          glorious revelation! the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is
          the God of pity and of pardon, the God of love. Not of love as with
          us, in a mere effeminate sense, as though it were only an impulse of
          human admiration that would wink at iniquities. He is Love, love in
          the essence, love essentially divine; love consistent with holiness,
          that hums like flames of fire. In justice deep and terrible is God; in
          majesty he doth ride on the wings of the wind. This God of tempest, is
          the God of God, and this is the God whom Jesus preached; and while he
          did not conceal the sterner attributes of the Almighty, yet he did not
          forget to depict the heart of mercy and the hand that is ready to
          help. The God whom he preached is full of gentleness and tenderness.
          May we learn to believe in the God and Father whom his only begotten
          Son Jesus Christ delighted to make known, and if called to testify of
          Him may we testify fully and heartily as Jesus did.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sum up all, we may say that our Lord's three years' ministry was
          matchless in its perfection, such as he could look back upon without a
          single regret, but with unsullied complacency. It was matchless as to
          its doctrines, and as to its completeness it was unsurpassed. More
          might be said of his manner, which was full of tenderness to the men
          among whom he walked, and of his majestic oratory, which we may admire
          and seek to imitate, but which we can reach only at a distance, for it
          is peerless beyond all competition, it stands alone; "Never yet man
          spake like this man," shall be true of him to the world's end. All his
          life long there is no flaw, there is no excess. "I have finished the
          work which thou gavest me to do," he could truly say, as he laid down
          his earthly ministry, and ascended to exercise his ministrations
          before the throne. In the retrospect of his labors there was no
          occasion for self-reproach, no cause for a fault to be found, even by
          the accuser of the brethren. All was to be joy and rejoicing when he
          had completed his life-work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus much concerning our Lord. I have only opened the door for you to
          enter. I wonder whether it will ever be given to us to be able to say,
          as Christians, in our humbler measure, what he said, as the very
          Christ in such exalted strains?
        </p>
        <p>II. Let us now use the text IN REFERENCE TO OURSELVES.</p>
        <p>
          It ought to be the ambition of every believer here, in a sense more or
          less extensive, to be able to say, "I have preached righteousness; I
          have not refrained my lips; I have not hid thy righteousness within my
          heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not
          concealed thy and thy truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is quite certain that many careless Christians will never be able
          to lay this unction to their heart. In all our churches there is a
          very large proportion of idle people. I hope they are saved; the Lord
          knows whether they are or not, but whatever else they are saved from,
          certainly they are not saved from laziness. We have in the visible
          church a large proportion of flesh that is not living, or if it is
          alive it gives very little indication of life. Now, I do like as
          pastor to be in fellowship with a living church, all alive, and
          everybody active. Though it may be our happy lot to have a goodly
          preponderance in this church of living men and women, I know there is
          a considerable portion of added flesh about it. Albeit, there are some
          portions of the body which may be said to be ornamental, it is equally
          true that they also have some distinct service; there is not one of
          them put there to do nothing. Some Christians seem to think themselves
          "a thing of beauty and a joy for ever" to the church, and that they
          have nothing to do in it for the common weal. They must imagine that
          they are ornaments, for certainly they are of no use, so far as any
          good offices are concerned. It used to be almost thought that the
          whole duty of man consisted in taking your sitting, paving your
          quarter's rent, filling up your place, and listening with more or less
          attention to the sermons that were preached. As to the idea of
          everybody doing something for Christ, and the exhortation to them as
          good soldiers of the cross not to shirk their duty, these people said
          that it was sheer madness. To do or dare, to labor or suffer in the
          cause of the Captain of our salvation, was no article of their creed.
          Sleepy souls, they presently become victims of their own infatuation.
          As men who habituate themselves to take opium, they grow soporific.
          Then their Christianity becomes like a dream. It may be they are
          filled with flattering illusions, but in full many a case they are
          scared with strange spectres that issue in the short sighs, weak
          cries, and dismal groans of doubt and fear. Alas for them! they will
          not be able to say, "I have preached righteousness; lo, I have not
          refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy
          righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and
          thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth."
          Nay, nay; when their conscience is awakened, they shall have poignant
          regrets that they have neglected so many glorious opportunities of
          bringing crowns to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor will cowardly people be able to make this protest. Many Christians
          are of a retiring disposition, and their retiring disposition is
          exemplified somewhat in the same way as that of the soldier who felt
          himself unworthy to stand in the front ranks. He felt that it would be
          too presumptuous a thing for him to be in front, where the cannon
          balls were mowing down men on the right hand and on the left, and
          therefore he would rather be in the van-guard. I always look upon
          those very retiring and modest people as arrant cowards, and I shall
          venture to call them so. I ask not every man and woman to rush into
          the front ranks of service, but I do ask every converted man and woman
          to take some place in the ranks, and to be prepared to make some
          sacrifice in that position they choose or think themselves fit to
          occupy. But ah! there are some who shrink back from any post that
          demands toil or vigilance. When they were young their ardor was never
          kindled, the spirit of enterprise was never stirred within them. Had
          they shown any mettle then, they might have been lion-hearted now; had
          they done Nothing then, their career of usefulness might have been in
          full vigor now. But alas for the man upon whom there is the rust of
          wasted years; he waits, he doubts, he parleys still, and shelters
          himself under a fictitious humility. Would God I had more courage
          myself, but I will tell you one thing, I dare not fold my arms, nor
          dare I hold my tongue; it seems to me so awful a thing not to be doing
          good, and it seems to me so dastardly a thing to shrink back when
          opportunities lie in one's path. I do wish that some of you would
          learn to imitate the character of the godly man --
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who holds no parley with unmanly fears; Where duty bids, he
          confidently steers,
        </p>
        <p>Faces a thousand dangers at her call</p>
        <p>And, trusting in his God, surmounts them all."</p>
        <p>
          The cowards will not be able to say, "I have preached righteousness:
          lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid
          thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness
          and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy
          truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor, again, will spasmodic people be able to adopt this language.
          There are some people who, if there is a revival, are so marvellously
          zealous and earnest that we are ready to clap our hands, but all on a
          sudden they stop. That Sunday-school class they were just getting into
          right order, but before there was an opportunity to reap the fruit
          they felt it was not precisely what they were called to. That Young
          Men's Bible Class -- yes, that was a happy thought, the pastor was
          delighted; but, unfortunately, some little difficulty occurred that
          you had not foreseen, and that also has fallen through. So it has been
          in other cases. Know therefore that those who cannot, like the Master,
          look back upon a continuous and persevering testimony, will not be
          able to speak with a clear conscience as he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          But although so many classes of those who profess and call themselves
          Christians will not be able to take a happy retrospect of their lives,
          yet there are not wanting those who could do so. I have known men of
          one talent who without any self-righteousness could say, "I have
          preached righteousness; I have not regained my lips, O Lord, thou
          knowest. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
          declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy
          lovingkindness and thy truth." Dear good men in many a country village
          whose Dames will never be known to fame have gathered just a few
          people together and have preached on, on, on for years, and when they
          come to die in the Lord and rest from their labors, their works will
          follow them, and their life-service will be as acceptable as the
          services of, many men with ten times the talents and ten times the
          scope for their exercise. Perhaps the Master will say to them, "Well
          done!" with a stronger emphasis than to some who were better known.
          That poor girl whose only work she could do for Christ was to teach
          those two little children who were entrusted to her, and that nursery
          maid with but one gift, and one only, may be able to say, "I have
          preached righteousness; lo! I have not refrained my lips: I have
          declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy
          lovingkindness and thy truth." You one-talent servants, you have this
          within your reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          And those, too, with an extremely narrow sphere may be able to say
          this. It is not, perhaps, the man who can stand and talk to thousands,
          but it may be you in the family -- the housewife, the kitchen maid,
          the serving-man, or the woman who has been bed-ridden for years, whose
          only audience will be a few poor neighbors, or perhaps, now and then,
          a generous friend -- it is you within these narrow spheres who may yet
          be able to say, "I have preached righteousness; I have not refrained
          my lips, O Lord, thou knowest; I have not hid thy righteousness within
          my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have
          not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth." I have sat by a
          bedside where I have envied the poor woman despite the agonies and
          pains of body she suffered, because she yet could praise and magnify
          the lovingkindness revealed to her there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, we may be, able to quote these words, some of us to
          whom greater talents have been committed. Though we may feel that we
          have not preached as earnestly as we could have wished; that we have
          not done our utmost towards those whom we have taught; that in our
          house-to-house visitation we have not been so earnest with poor souls
          as we might have been in this respect, for alas! alas! we are all
          unprofitable servants; yet we can say, "I have preached righteousness;
          I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy
          righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and
          thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Fervently do I hope that those of you with the largest opportunities
          may yet be privileged to make this good profession with all sincerity.
          I am not afraid for those friends who have but narrow spheres --
          sometimes I wish that mine were such -- I am not afraid for those in
          humbler fields, but oh, if with such spheres, and such churches as God
          here and there allots to some of his servants, they can thus give
          account of their stewardship, it will be grace indeed, and to grace
          alone will the honor be due. Yet let us hope that we too may be able
          to say, "I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo,
          I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy
          righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and
          thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth
          from the great congregation."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is with an overwhelming sense of the importance as well as the
          moral grandeur of this profession that I repeat it to you again and
          again; for when we are able to feel this, and to say it humbly and
          confidently, with good faith and without guile, IT CASTS MUCH
          COMFORTABLE LIGHT ON MANY SOLEMN subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          How awful to remember that every hour there are hundreds of men and
          women who are dying without Christ. Turn to the bills of mortality of
          this one city. Be our sentiments ever so charitable, let us judge with
          the utmost liberality, the dreadful fact fills our mind, and every
          knell speaks it to our heart, "They go out of this world unforgiven;
          they go before their Maker's bar without a hope!" I think our hearts
          would break with the dread recollection of this if we could not say,
          "I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I have
          not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy
          righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and
          thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth
          from the great congregation."
        </p>
        <p>
          And how many deaths there always are among our hearers! What comfort
          can any Christian who knows you have, if you die unsaved, unless he is
          able to appeal to God, and say, "My Father, I did all I could to teach
          that soul the way of salvation; I did all I could to persuade him to
          accept the Christ of God"?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, whenever you see any of your neighbors, your relatives,
          your acquaintance die, can you forbear to ask yourselves, shall their
          blood be required at my hands? Are your skirts stained? Are there no
          blood drops there? Come, look them down, and say if you can ponder
          with a clear conscience the fact of a sinner dying in a Christless
          state without your being able to say, "I have done all I could to
          bring that soul to Christ"?
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for that dreadful outlook -- the hereafter of the lost -- would
          that we could believe the softer theories which some so eagerly
          embrace! We would, but dare not. We believe that those who die in
          their sins when they pass from this life into the next, shall find
          that second death to be no extinction of existence, but an eternity of
          sin and of misery, Ah! how can any of us bear to think of this if we
          feel that we are morally responsible for any one soul that is damned?
          Yet are we so, I speak but the bare truth, until we have delivered
          ourselves from that responsibility by faithful earnestness. Is there a
          Cain here who says, "Am I my brother's keeper?" I shall not appeal to
          your most sympathetic soul, but leave you to your Judge. But to the
          Christian I say, "No man liveth to himself." When you think of a
          spirit in despair, cast out for ever from the presence of his God and
          from the glory of his power, may you, friends, be able to say, "Great
          God, though I understand not thy ways, for thy judgments are a great
          deep; yet I warned the sinner, I admonished him to lay hold on Christ,
          and if he perished it was not for want of preaching to or for praying
          over; my warnings and tears were never spared. I did what was in me to
          prevent his ruin." Put in that light, we may look at least with some
          degree of serenity upon the doctrine of divine sovereignty. I must
          confess that the sovereignty of God is a great mountain whose top we
          cannot scale. I often marvel at the coldness with which some men talk
          of the sovereignty of God, as though it were of small concern whether
          men were lost or saved. They seem to take these things as easily as if
          they were only talking of blocks of wood, or fields filled with tares.
          I do not think that we can equitably plead the divine sovereignty as a
          counterpart to our futile efforts, till we can say, "I have done all
          that was possible to bring that soul to God, I have prayed over him
          and wept over him, and now if he perish I must believe that this man
          wilfully rejected Christ, that his iniquities are upon his own head,
          and that in him, as a vessel of wrath, God will get glory as well as
          in vessels of mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doom of the heathen is a subject in like manner of which it were
          too painful for any of us to speak unless we can say, "I have, as far
          as lieth in me, sought to do something for them." This is a thing
          about which we ought not to think with any ease, unless we feel that
          we would fain save them, and give them the knowledge of the gospel of
          Jesus Christ; and to carry out this, our cherished purpose, we will do
          the best we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uprisings of error often cause us dismay. Every now and then we
          see some old form of error spring up that was stamped out, as we
          supposed, in the days of our ancestors. Not unfrequently a foul old
          heresy is brought out as a brand new discovery, and all the world
          admires it, and wonders whence it came. Now, whenever these old
          heresies crop up, and are brought out as new, and lead men astray, it
          is a great comfort when you and I are able to say, "I have preached
          righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I have not refrained my
          lips, O Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy righteousness within my
          heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not
          concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
          congregation." Let men propagate whatever errors they choose, if we
          have no share in misleading the people, and are continually engaged in
          instructing them, we may wrap ourselves in our integrity, and lay the
          matter before our God to vindicate our righteous cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apathy of the church, which has lasted so long, is truly
          disheartening. With many a deep-drawn sigh do we bewail it. O that we
          could get the church to awake! You might sound the trump of the
          archangel before you could rouse full many to the appalling
          destitution by reason of which the people perish for lack of
          knowledge. Even the cries of lost souls, and the shrieks of the
          sinners in this Metropolis, rushing headlong to the pit that is
          bottomless, do not startle some of us. Yes, but if we can say, "I have
          preached righteousness; I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou
          knowest. I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation," then we
          may take courage to work nobly and to persevere under terrible
          difficulties. Though for awhile we should see no conversions; and
          though for a season the ploughshare should break against the rock, or
          against even the very adamant itself, yet still if we can say, "I have
          preached righteousness, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou
          knowest. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
          declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy
          lovingkindness and thy truth" -- we are exonerated from blame; nay,
          more, we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ in the testimony we have
          delivered. Yes, brethren, I apprehend that amongst the sweetest
          dying-bed recollections, and amongst the minor comforts, in taking our
          farewell of the world as it is, not the least will be that of having
          been constant and faithful all our lives to the gospel of Jesus
          Christ.

          Give me a few minutes longer while I turn this sermon into the special
          direction which it was intended to take. I do not know that there are
          many more "young men" present to-night than there are usually at our
          week-day lecture. I generally find when I preach a sermon for any of
          our societies it so happens that everybody connected with the society
          seems to stay away. They would be willing enough to come if it were
          for the Primitive Methodist, or any other denomination. They are in
          love with everybody else except their own relations. I do not say this
          by way of censure, but surely if there be a people under heaven
          without a grain of clannishness it is that denomination to which we
          belong. If it had been a sermon for Jews or Turks the building would
          have been crowded; but as it is for ourselves it does not signify.
          However, if they are not present for whom it was intended, they may
          probably read the sermon; so I will add a few words expressly for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Young man, it may be that you are one of those who ought to become a
          missionary; it may be that you ought to dedicate your life to some
          work for God either at home or abroad. Well, if it be so, do not
          mistake your path in life. We do not urge you to rush into the
          ministry, much less into the foreign ministry, unless you are called
          to it, for that is the very last place for a man to be in who is not
          called to the work. Act as a Christian young man for once in your life
          by asking whether it may not be your vocation to bear the cross of
          Christ into lands where as yet it is unknown. Surely, whatever answer
          you may feel called upon to give you will be ready for it. You will at
          least be willing to give yourself up to the very hardest form of
          service to which you maybe called. I should like you, then, to be sure
          about this on the outset lest you should in the turn of the road miss
          the path and so not be able to say at the last: "I have preached
          righteousness; lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.
          I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy
          faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy
          lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation." I should
          not like you, if meant by the gifts of God for a great missionary, to
          die a millionaire. I should not like it, were you fitted to be a
          missionary, that you should drivel down into a king; for what are all
          your kings, what are all your nobles, what are all your stars, what
          are all your garters, what are all your diadems and your tiaras, when
          you put them all together, compared with the dignity of winning souls
          for Christ, with the special honor of building for Christ, not on
          another man's foundation, but preaching Christ's gospel in regions yet
          far beyond? I reckon him to be a man honored of men who can do a
          foreign work for Christ, but he who shall go farthest in
          self-annihilation and in the furtherance of the glory of Christ, he
          shall be a king among men, though he wear no crown that carnal eyes
          can see. Ask yourselves the question then, Christian young men,
          whether that is your vocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should it happen that you feel convinced this is not your calling,
          remember you may still in your daily business be able to say these
          words. Some of my friends here never will be able to say them. They
          have been church members for twenty years, and during all those twenty
          years they have not preached righteousness, they have refrained their
          lips, they have hidden his righteousness, they have not declared his
          faithfulness and his salvation, they have concealed his lovingkindness
          and his truth. You, young men and women, have an opportunity of doing
          what is gone from them. Though they might publish Christ abroad from
          now till they die, there are twenty years they must ever regret and
          look back upon as waste land for which they will have to give an
          account at the last. You have, it may be, those twenty years before
          you, and it is a noble thing to begin working young, and so long as
          ever you live to go on building on that work. I have heard it said
          that you should not put young converts to work for which they are not
          qualified. Ah! say I, put the youngsters in; they will never learn to
          swim if they are not put in at once. Why should you, young men and
          women, be received as church members at all unless you are prepared to
          do something for Christ? Work becomes you as well as worship. I mean,
          of course, if not disqualified by sickness, and even then there is a
          sphere for testimony. You can make a sick bed a pulpit to preach
          Christ, while by patience and resignation you show forth his praise.
          No one should join a church without seeking out something to do for
          the glory of Jesus Christ. Do start your lives, young men, with high
          purpose, that you may close them with holy cheer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to do this, you will need much more zeal than you are likely
          to possess by making resolutions, and much more grace than you will
          ordinarily get without much self-denial and devout consecration. You
          have need to be baptised into the Holy Ghost and in fire. I do like
          those converts who are thoroughly purged from the corruptions of the
          world, and thoroughly converted to God, every faculty of the mind and
          every member of the body being surrendered to Christ, all of them as
          instruments of righteousness. We seem to get some people who are not
          half converted. I hope their hearts are converted, but the effect is
          not to drain their pockets or to set their hands to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need, dear friends, to go much to Jesus Christ, to live much in
          communion with him, for this life-service has many expenses, and you
          have no ready money. You must go to the great exchequer of the King of
          kings and draw from its inexhaustible treasury. Do so. Do resolve to
          live lavishly in the service of Christ, and the divine storehouse will
          supply all that you need, be your ambition as large as it may.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are habits, it is true, to be acquired which must be the result
          of growth, for they cannot be matured without the manifold experience
          of sunshine and shower, summer and winter, heat and cold; to all of
          these you will be exposed. But when once you have yielded ourselves to
          those divine influences which foster life, you will prove that by all
          these things men live. To this I can bear you witness. Drudgery ceases
          to be irksome when the ruling passion of laboring for the Lord has
          begun to ferment in your breasts, and the sweet assurance that your
          labor is not in vain in the Lord has quickened a sacred enthusiasm in
          your spirit. It may be that in your apprenticeship you have to
          encounter many hardships, but it shall be that in the full discharge
          of your vocation you will reap a harvest of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          God help you never to refrain from preaching the truth, never to
          withhold any part of it; may you be clear in all these matters as
          before the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! yours will be cheerful dying if you familiarise yourselves with
          such noble living as this. You will have a welcome entrance into
          heaven if such has been your life on earth. The pastor, when he can
          preach no more the gospel, will say, "I preached when there was time,
          and now I will sing when sermons all are o'er." You Sunday-school
          teachers cannot teach any longer, but your Sabbath recreations below
          will prove the sweet prelude to your Sabbatic felicities above. Tract
          distributors, now that all your work is over, you will say, "I did but
          distribute the leaves of the tree of life for the healing of the
          people, but now I feed myself on all its luscious fruits."
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not say that rewards are given as mere rewards of merit, but this
          I do assuredly know, there are rewards given in respect of service
          through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and I pray you seek the
          prize. So run that you may obtain it. May you be able to say, "While I
          was down below where service could be done for my Master --
        </p>
        <p>"In works which perfect saints above,</p>
        <p>And holy angels cannot do,"</p>
        <p>
          with all my might I labored to excel, and now I enter into the bliss
          of him who helped and strengthened me, who revealed his grace in me,
          and counted me worthy to put me into some part of the ministry of his
          church."
        </p>
        <p>
          God bless you, dear friends, and make you earnest to tell to others
          those things he has made known unto you, for our Lord Jesus Christ's
          sake. Amen.
