        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.410)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, September the 22nd, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their
          tokens, that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they
          shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. Who shall declare his way
          to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?" -- Job
          21:29-31.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE SERMON WHICH I PREACHED two Lord's days ago upon the accidents,
          has caused considerable consternation among pious people with weak
          heads. Their idea that an calamities are judgments, is so inveterate a
          prejudice, and so favourite a dogma, that our exposure of its
          absurdity is, in their opinion, eminently calculated to encourage sin
          and quiet the consciences of offenders. Now, I feel quite at ease in
          this matter, and am confident that I have done service to our great
          cause, even though the timid should be alarmed, and the superstitious
          should be annoyed. Our gracious God and Father has seen fit to give us
          a whole book of the Bible upon the subject; the main drift of the Book
          of Job is to prove that temporal afflictions are not evidences of the
          Lord's displeasure, and I beg the modern Bildads and Zophars to
          reconsider their position, lest they too should be found to be
          "speaking wickedly for God, and talking deceitfully for him." -- Job
          13:7. In my very soul I feel that if evil days shall come upon me, if
          poverty, desertion, and disease should place me upon Job's dunghill, I
          shall point to that sermon with pleasure, and say to those who will
          tell me that God is angry with me, and has judged me to be unworthy,
          "Nay, ye know not what ye say, for the judgment is not passed already,
          nor is this the field of execution; neither disease, nor bereavements,
          nor poverty, can prove a man to be wicked, nor do they even hint that
          the chosen are divided from the hearts of Christ." O my beloved
          friends, settle it in your hearts that men are not to be judged
          according to their present circumstances, and learn like David to
          understand their end. It will save you from writing bitter things
          against yourselves in the time of trouble, and prevent your scanning
          the works of Providence, and measuring the infinite by line and
          plummet.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is mainly my business, today, to deal with those who may wickedly
          continue in sin because their judgment tarries. If the Lord does not
          in this world visit the ungodly with stripes, this is but the surer
          evidence that in the world to come there is a solemn retribution for
          the impenitent. If the affliction which is here accorded to men be not
          the punishment of sin, we turn to Scripture and discover what that
          punishment will be, and we are soon informed that it is something far
          heavier than any calamities which occur in this life, -- something
          infinitely more tremendous than the most disastrous accident, the most
          shocking mutilation, or the most painful death. I know that there be
          some in these days who are like those in the time of the royal
          preacher, of whom he said, "because sentence against an evil work is
          not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully
          set in them to do evil." Should I be addressing some this morning who
          have found a stupid quiet for their consciences in the fact that God
          does not here usually visit men's sins upon their heads, let me put it
          to them whether such peace is reasonable. There is a city which has
          revolted. A great king has threatened them with entire destruction for
          the revolt. He does not, in hurried passion, send against them a
          handful of soldiers to inflict instant and petty chastisement, he
          waits awhile, and marshals all his hosts, till every battalion has
          been put in array, till every mighty man has girded on his armor.
          Fools! will ye draw consolation from the delay of your destroyer? Will
          ye say, because he has not ridden forth against you on the very day of
          your rebellion that therefore this is a time of revelry and mirth?
          Nay, rather, inasmuch as he is gathering his hosts for the battle, let
          it cause you to tremble, for he shall break down your walls, and give
          your whole company to the sword. Imagine yourselves voyagers, far out
          upon the sea. A black cloud darkens in the sky, you say you fear not
          the cloud because it is not at present pouring forth the rain-flood.
          But that is the reason why ye should fear it, for the cloud is waiting
          until it grows and spreads, till under the wing of darkness the egg of
          cloud has been hatched into the black screaming eagle of the storm.
          See you, the clouds are hurrying from east and west, mustering for the
          strife! Mark you not the sea heaving heavily in sympathy with heaven's
          convulsions? Behold how all the dread artillery of heaven is gathering
          up for one tremendous shock. Fools! do ye say ye will not fear because
          the thundercloud has not yet burst, because as yet the breath of wind
          has not transformed itself into the blast of hurricane? It is
          gathering, sirs, congregating its forces and accumulating its fury,
          and the longer that it gathers, the more terrible shall be the moment
          when it bursts upon your devoted heads. And so to-day, God's clouds
          that float in the sky, the calamities of Providence, are not pouring
          on you the tempest of wrath; but is this a reason why ye should be at
          peace? Nay! the clouds are gathering, every sin is adding to the mass,
          every day of God's long-suffering is covering heaven in blacker sable,
          every moment that he spares he does but prepare to punish in more
          tremendous force; and dread and direful shall be the day, when at last
          omnipotence itself shall come to the assistance of outraged justice,
          and you shall feel that God is God as much in punishing sin, as in the
          making of the worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a fable of the old Jewish rabbis, that when the angel Gabriel
          flew he used both wings, because he always came with good tidings; but
          that when Michael flew, bearing God's sword to smite through the loins
          of king", he always flew with one wing. But Michael arrives as surely
          at his destined goal as Gabriel himself. The feet of the avenging
          deities may seem to be shod with lead for tardiness, and their tread
          may be as noiseless as wool, but they are as sure as the feet of
          mercy. I know, when God comes to bless, the axles of his chariot are
          hot with speed, and his steeds are white with foam, and when he comes
          to curse he travels slowly, with many a sigh, for he willeth not the
          death of any, but had rather "that he should turn unto him and live;"
          but remember, in judgment he comes in all his might, and he shall be
          discovered to be not less a God when he smiteth than when he giveth
          the kisses of his lips, and lifts the pardoned sinner into acceptance
          and favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall now deal with the sorrowful topic of the punishment of sin in
          the world to come. I have preached less upon this subject than almost
          upon any other, and yet always is it thrown in our teeth that we
          delight to dwell upon these horrors. I never come to this subject
          without the deepest distress of heart, and God alone shall know how
          many tears it costs these eyes when I have to deal out as God's
          faithful ambassador the thunders of his law. I delight to preach of
          Calvary, and of divine love, and of grace unsearchable. But this theme
          is to me the burden of the Lord, we must not, we dare not keep it
          back; fidelity to conscience, truthfulness to God, love to the souls
          of men, constrains us to make this a part of our ministry, not keeping
          back any part of the price.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall divide the discourse this morning into three parts, first, I
          shall speak of the punishment of sin, by way of affirmation, or prove
          that it must be so; secondly, by way of explanation, of what kind and
          nature this punishment must be; and then, thirdly, by way of
          expostulation, pleading with those who are yet in the land of mercy,
          that they would hasten to the voice of wisdom, and that God's grace
          may turn them from the error of their ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, by wag of affirmation -- THERE MUST BE A PUNISHMENT
          FOR SIN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job says, that this is a truth so written upon the very nature of man,
          that even those who go by the way, the ignorant traveler and wayfarer,
          dares not for a moment deny that such is the case. "Have ye not asked
          them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens?" And truly
          it is so. If there be one intuitive truth which man perceives without
          need of argument, it is that sin deserves to be punished, and since
          sin in not punished here, it fellows that the punishment must be
          endured in the world to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us, however, very briefly, review the argument. Sin must be
          punished from the very nature of God. God is; if God is God, he must
          be just. You can no more separate the idea of justice from the idea of
          God, than you can omniscience, or omnipresence, or omnipotence. To
          suppose of a God who was not omnipotent, is to make a supposition
          which is contradictory in its terms; for the term "God" includes that
          thought. And to suppose an unjust God, is to imagine an absurdity, --
          you have used, I repeat it, contradictory terms; -- justice is
          included in the very thought of God. See how the oppressed always
          recognize this. The slave who has long been trampled under the feet of
          a tyrannical master, with his back fresh from the gory lash, lifts up
          his eye to God the avenger, for he feels instinctively that God must
          be just. Nationalities who have made appeals to arms, but have been
          subdued again to serfdom, at last in their despair cry out to God, for
          this is the bottom of man's thoughts, and the one which is sure to
          come forth when pain has emptied out his lighter notions, that God
          doth execute righteousness and judgment "for all that are oppressed."
          So, too, when man would aver a thing to be true he calls upon God to
          be his witness, because in his innermost nature he feels that God will
          be a just and impartial witness. If he thought not so, it would be
          ridiculous to call upon God to witness to his asseveration. Note how
          the tearful eye, the groaning mind, the bursting heart, all turn
          instinctively to the Judge of all the earth. Man feels that God must
          be just. But how just? How just, if crowned beads that do injustice
          shall go unpunished? How just, if the adulterer, the thief, the liar,
          and the hypocrite unpunished here, should go unpunished in the world
          to come. Where is thy justice, God, if this world be all? We say,
          "Alas for love if, thou were an end nought beyond, O earth!" and we
          may add, alas, for justice too; for where could it live, where could
          it dwell, unless there were a world to come, in which God will right
          the wrongs, and avenge himself upon an who have trampled on his laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does his very nature show this, but those acts of God, which
          are recorded in Revelation, prove incontestably that he will by no
          means spare the guilty. There have been judgment. I am not now
          appealing to the crotchets and opinions of ill-judging man, but to the
          inspired chronicles, for I will quote those judgments alone which the
          Word of God calls such. Adam sinned. Twas but the touching of an
          apple; Eden was blasted, Adam was exiled. The world sinned; they ate,
          they drank, they married, and were given in marriage; they forgot the
          Most High. The fountains of the great deep gave forth their floods;
          the cisterns of heaven emptied out their cataracts. All the world was
          drowned; and the last shriek of the strong swimmer yielding at last to
          universal death, told out to us that God is just. Look across to the
          allies of the plain. When they had wholly given themselves up to
          unnatural lusts, God rained fire and brimstone out of heaven upon
          Sodom and Gomorrha. And when he did so, what did he but write in
          letters of fire this word -- "God is just, he furiously avengeth and
          terribly punisheth sin." Behold, too, Pharaoh and all his hosts
          drowned in the Red Sea. For what purpose was Pharaoh but that God
          might show forth his power in him -- might prove to the world that
          there were vessels of wrath, and that God knew how to fill them to the
          brim, and break them as with a rod of iron. Look to Palestine, and
          behold its kings put to death by the sword of the Lord and his servant
          Joshua. What means a land stained in blood? It meaneth this, that the
          race had offended much against heaven; and God, that man might have
          some glimpses of his terrible justice, declared that he would root out
          the races of Canaan, and would have war with Amalek from generation to
          generation. It is impossible to reconcile Old Testament history with
          the effeminate notion of neological divinity, that God is only a
          universal Father, but not a governor and a judge. If these gentlemen
          will quietly read some of those awful passages in the Old Testament,
          they cannot -- unless they should deny the inspiration of the passage,
          or attempt to tone down in meaning -- they cannot but confess that
          they see there far less a loving parent than a God dressed in arms, of
          whom we may say, "The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name. Thy
          right hand, O Lord, thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces
          thine enemies." A God without justice is what this modern church is
          seeking after. These new doctrines would fashion a deity destitute of
          those sublime attributes, which keep the world in awe, and command for
          him the reverence of his creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings me to my third argument. Not only do the nature and the
          acts of God prove that he will punish sin, but the very necessities of
          the world demand it. Imagine the contrary. Put in all our Christian
          pulpits men who should teach to sinners that there is no punishment
          for sin. Let them say to them, "What you suffer here is to be looked
          upon as God's judgment on your offense; but there is no world to come
          in which your sins will be visited upon your heads." Friends, you may
          at once advise the government to multiply the number of our jails
          tenfold. If there be no punishment for sin in another world, if it be
          so light and trifling an offense that the little sufferings of this
          life are sufficient atonement for it, then you have thrown up the
          floodgates which have hitherto dammed up the overflowing floods; you
          will soon see society swept from its moorings, there will be no
          possibility that men will seek to be honest, when they find that
          honesty or dishonesty are terms which have but a trifling difference
          between them. If sin be so slight a thing, men will think virtue to be
          a slight thing too, and if there be so little punishment for crime,
          they will soon think that there can be but little reason for virtue,
          and where will be our commonwealths, and our social compacts? The best
          lawgivers, however amiably disposed they may be, find that they must
          back up their laws with penalties. A state which should be founded
          upon laws without penalties could not last a week, or if it lasted,
          you would find that while the laws would be disregarded there would be
          more death and more suffering than there had been before. When was the
          guillotine most at work, but when there was loudest boast of liberty,
          and men's living without law. When would there be the most of murder,
          but when there should no more be heard the threat of condemnation, and
          when they who were assassins might be permitted to go abroad
          untouched. There must be punishment for the world's own good, to say
          nothing of the nature of God, which for its dignity and holiness
          necessarily demands that very offense and transgression should receive
          its just recompense of reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, I affirm the punishment of sin from the atonement of
          Christ. Friends, if there be no necessity that sin should be punished,
          why did Jesus die? Why, Father, didst thou send thy only begotten and
          well-beloved Son, and lay upon him the iniquities of us an? Was he
          needed for an example? He might have been our example without dying,
          in fact if this were all, virtue, crowned and glorified, might have
          been quite as noble an incentive to goodness, as virtue mocked and
          crucified. He was needed that he might take our sins, and having taken
          our sins, it became absolutely necessary that Jesus Christ should die.
          In the death of Christ, if sin must not necessarily be punished, I see
          nothing but the death of a martyr, like James, or Peter, or Polycarp,
          the death of a man murdered for being better than his fellows. And why
          do we make this fuss and noise about salvation by the death of Christ
          if that be all. Why has the Christian church existed to be a false
          witness, to testify to a fiction? Why has her blood been shed these
          many centuries, to maintain that the blood of Jesus Christ taketh away
          the sin of the world, if the sin could he taken away without
          punishment? The wounds of Christ have no meaning, his precious blood
          has no value, his thorn-crowned head is not worthy of worship, nor is
          his death worthy of daily ministry, unless it be that he suffered "the
          just for the unjust to bring us to God;" God in Christ punished the
          sins of his people; and if he did it in Christ, unpardoned sinner,
          rest assured he will do it in you. If the imputed sins of Christ
          brought him the agonies of Gethsemane, what will your sins bring you?
          If guilt that was not his own brought him an exceeding heaviness,
          "even unto death," what will your sins bring you, sins remember which
          are your own? "He that spared not his own Son" wilt never spare
          rebels. He who did not spare his Son a single lash or a single stroke,
          will certainly make no exemption in your favor, if you live and die
          impenitent and reject the gospel of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, my dear friends, permit me to say that those who think that
          sin is not to be punished, are generally the worst of men. Men hate
          hell for the reason that murderers hate the gallows. The miscreant
          Youngman, who was executed on the top of yonder gaol, informed the
          chaplain that he objected on principle to all capital punishment, an
          objection natural enough when it was his own inevitable doom. They who
          dissent from the doctrine of divine justice, are interested in forming
          that opinion; the wish is father to the thought, they would have their
          sin unpunished, they hope it may be, and then they say it will be. You
          will not hear a thief's objection to a policeman; you do not imagine
          that a criminal's objection to a judge is very valid, and the sinner's
          objection to hell lies only here, that he will not repent, and he
          therefore fears the dread certainty that he shall be punished. Besides
          even these worst of men, who pretend not to believe, do believe. Their
          fears betray the secret conviction of their consciences, and on their
          dying beds, or in a storm, whenever they have thought they were about
          to see with their own eyes the stern realities of eternity, their
          fears have proved them to be as strong believers as those who profess
          the faith. Infidelity is not honest. It may profess to be, but it is
          not. I think that our judges are right in not accepting the oath of an
          infidel. It is not possible that he should be honest in the notion
          that there is no God. When God is around him in every leaf, in every
          tree, and in every star in the sky; it is not possible that a man
          should be honest when he calls himself an atheist. Nor do we believe
          that any man can speak the dictates of his inmost heart, when he says
          that sin will never be punished, and that he may sin with impunity.
          His conscience gives him the lie, he knows it must be so, and that God
          will visit his offenses upon his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not enlarge further, except to say in gathering up the
          thoughts, impenitent sinner, be thou sure of this; there shall not a
          sin of thine fall to the ground unremembered, "For every idle word
          that thou shall speak God will bring thee into judgment," how much
          more for every blasphemous word and for every rebellious act. Do not
          wrap thyself up in the delusive thought that sin will escape
          unpunished. Even if it should be so, then the Christian is as well off
          as you are, but since righteousness will be laid to the line, and
          judgment to the plummet, what will become of you? Be wise before it is
          too late. Believe to-day what you will find out to be a fact ere long.
          God has revealed it to you, his revelation has tokens and signs which
          prove its divine origin. Believe what He has revealed; do not say in
          your heart "I never will believe there is a hell unless one should
          come from it." Do you not see, that if one should come from it then
          you would not believe at all, because you would say, "If one person
          came from hell, then another may, and I may myself." It would take
          away all your dread of future punishment if any spirit should come
          back from it, and therefore it is you that you should not have that be
          given you. Yet methinks the shrieks of dying sinners, the cries which
          some of you have heard coming up from the death beds of blasphemers,
          ought to be enough evidence that there is a world to come whereof we
          speak, and that there are terrors of the law which are happily
          concealed to-day from your eyes and from your ears, but which you may
          soon know, and know far better than the best words can teach you, by
          your own feelings, by your own everlasting despair, and banishment
          from God.

        <p>
          II. I turn now to the second portion of the discourse: THE NATURE OF
          THIS PUNISHMENT by way of explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          How will God punish sin? The text says, "The wicked is reserved to the
          day of destruction, they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath."
          The old Puritanic preachers, such men as Alleyne, who wrote the
          "Alarm," and others of his class -- always gave a very cross picture
          of the world to come. They could never represent it except by
          brimstone flames, and dancing fiends, and such like horrors. They were
          conscientious in the drawing of the picture, and to them the terrors
          of the Lord gross, corporeal, unscriptural ideas of hell, but rather
          let us feel that it is a great mystery, concerning which we must
          rather follow Scripture than imagination. The first punishment which
          will be executed upon man for his sins, will be punishment to his
          soul. The soul leaves the body, the body is here enclosed in the
          coffin, rotting in the tomb; the disembodied spirit will appear before
          its God. It will then know at once what its future destination shall
          be. The great assize will not then have been held, the Judge will not
          have officially pronounced the sentence, but the soul anticipating the
          sentence will antidote its execution. Memory will begin to reflect
          upon past sins, past mercies unimproved, past opportunities neglected,
          and past offenses which have long been forgotten. Then the conscience
          will begin to thunder. "Thou didst this wantonly," saith Conscience.
          "Thou didst it against light and knowledge, thou didst despise Christ,
          thou didst neglect the day of mercy, thou hast been a suicide, thou
          hast destroyed thyself." Then the fears will come in, the fears of the
          day of judgment, when the body shall be reunited with the soul. And
          those fears will sting the man with thoughts like these. "What wilt
          thou say when He comes to judge thee? How will thou bear the eyes of
          Him that shall read thee through and through? Now thou knowest that
          what was preached to thee on earth is true. Thou art no infidel now.
          Now the truth is not kept out of thy soul by the dulness of thy
          fleshly body; thou seest thou knowest it. What will become of thee
          when earth shall pass away and heaven shall shake, and hell shall gape
          to receive its prey?" So the spirit shall be virtually in hell before
          the body goes there. This shall be the first punishment of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, when the day predestined shall have come, the trump of the
          archangel shall ring through the aid -- the trump this time of the
          second resurrection -- for the dead in Christ shall have already
          risen, and have reigned with Christ upon the earth. Then rings the
          elation note that wakes the dead. They start up, and the soul returns
          to its old house, the body. Then it receives its sentence. It is
          brought forth as the text says, "to the day of wrath," -- it had been
          reserved in chains before, in blackness and darkness, it is now
          brought forth to receive the sentence, that the body may begin its
          hell. Then, mark you, beyond a doubt, for we cannot understand
          Scripture, and especially the words of Christ without it, the body
          shall have pains meet for its offenses. Your members were servants of
          your lusts, they shall be partakers of the wage of your soul -- the
          feet that carried you in the paths of sin, shall tread the fiery road,
          the eyes which gazed with lustful glance, shall now be made to weep
          the scalding tear, the teeth which ministered to your gluttony, shall
          now gnash for pain, the tongues which talked so exceeding proudly
          against God, shall be "tormented in this flame." There shall be
          certainly a punishment for the body as well as for the soul, for what
          else did Christ mean when he said, "Fear him who is able to destroy
          both body and soul in hell." I shall not enlarge upon what sort of
          punishment this will be, suffice me to say, that whatever it is, it
          will be just. The sinner in hell shall not endure one iota more than
          he deserves, he shall have the due reward of his deeds -- no more. God
          is not unjust to punish men arbitrarily, -- I know of no arbitrary
          condemnation. There is no such thing as sovereign damnation; it will
          be justice -- inflexible, I grant you, but yet not such as shall pass
          the bounds of due and right desert. God will give to man only the
          harvest of his own deeds. He sowed the wind, and he shall reap the
          whirlwind. You shall not have the consolation in hell of saying that
          you did not deserve it, for in hell you will be made to feel, "I
          brought this on myself, I destroyed myself, it is true I am in pain,
          but I am the father of my own pains; I planted the tree which yields
          the bitter fruit, I digged about it and I watered it, I did the work,
          I labored, and this is my wages;" and you will have to feel there and
          then, that in every pang that rends the heart God is infinitely just.
          And then, whatever the pain may be, we know that while it is just, it
          will be terrible. Whose are those awful words, "He shall burn up the
          chaff with unquenchable fire! "Is this the language of Moses? No, of
          Christ. It is a remarkable fact, that the most frightful descriptions
          of punishment, of another world are from the lips of the Savior. Had
          Peter spoken them, you would have said Peter was harsh in spirit. It
          was the Master spake them. He who wept over Jerusalem said, "These
          shall go away into everlasting punishment;" he spoke of "burning up
          the chaff;" he spoke of "binding hand and foot and giving them up to
          the tormentors." In the compass of revelation there are no words so
          grim and terrible in their awful suggestiveness, as the words of Him
          "who went about doing good," and wept and cried, "Come unto me, and ye
          that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
        </p>
        <p>
          And we know, again that this punishment will be eternal. This is the
          very pith of it. There were no hell, if it were not eternal, full the
          hope of an end would be the end of fear. If there could be an end to
          hell at any time, there would be an end to it at once, for no man
          would feel that desperate despair, if there were a hope that it should
          come to a close. But it is eternity, eternity, eternity, that makes
          punishment bad. This is the bell which tolls the funeral of every hope
          -- eternity, eternity, eternity. To sail across a sea of fire for
          ever, never reaching a haven; to sink, but never reach the bottom, or
          to rise to heights of greater agony, and never reach the summit. Oh,
          brethren, brethren, it is not the wrath of God in this world that you
          have so much to fear, the wrath's to come, the wrath's to come. And it
          is not the wrath that the soul shall be filled with when it has been
          there a thousand years, it is the wrath's to come. They will go on
          sinning and God will go on averaging, they will go on blaspheming and
          they shall go on gnawing their tongues, they shall go on hating God
          and they shall go on feeling his anger, they shall go from bad to
          worse in character, and doubtless from ball to worse in agony. O God,
          help us to escape from this awful thing -- the wrath, the wrath to
          come!
        </p>
        <p>III. I close now by offering SOME FEW WORDS OF EXPOSTULATION.</p>
        <p>
          You will kindly look at the thirty-first verse. He says "Who shall
          declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath
          done!" Now there are many men who think they shall come off soot free,
          because in this life there are none who will dare to mention their
          sins to their face. The covetous man is very seldom rebuked for his
          covetousness. If a man lives an unclean life, he does not usually read
          books which would prick his conscience. If a man acts dishonorably in
          his trade, if another should tell him of it, he would be exceedingly
          insulted. It is true a faithful minister will often make men feel
          uneasy in their sins, for he will be led by God's direction to give
          such a description of the offenses and of the punishment, that he will
          make sinners tremble in their shoes. But still are there not some
          among you here to-day who can sin with both your hands, and there is
          no Elijah to say, "Thou art the man. "You have none to meet you in
          Naboth's vineyard, and say to you, "Hast thou killed and taken
          possession? "There is perhaps hardly a "still small voice:" there used
          to be one. The agonizing face of your wife when first you had forsaken
          the way of virtue; the ghastly look of your mother as you were
          bringing down her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave, the sorrowful
          gaze of your little children when first their father became a
          drunkard, these were still voices to you, but they are hushed now.
          When God gives you up, then indeed your damnation slumbereth not. But
          remember, however cheaply you can sin now, God will not fear insulting
          you; he will bring your sins to your remembrance and there shall be no
          consideration of your dignity. He vein not consult your feelings, he
          will not look upon you as a great one; he will bring your sins to
          remembrance in no courtly phrases and in no polished terms. You shall
          find that the lips of Justice know not how to make distinctions
          between you and the basest menial whom once you despised. Now, if a
          man should speak your character it would be libel; but when God speaks
          it, you shall not threaten him. What thinkest thou that he will fear
          and tremble before thee? Who art thou, O man, that the lips of the
          Eternal God should be silent about thee? Who art thou that he should
          fail to draw thy character in black or crimson hues? He will convict
          thee to thy face, and thou shalt be utterly unable to plead guiltless
          of thy sins. And then the text says "Who shall repay him? "Ah! there
          is no hand which dares repay you now; you have gone unpunished yet. No
          law can touch you, you say; ah! but there is a law divulge which
          overrides the law that is human; and if the arm of human justice be
          too short, the arm of God is as long as it is strong, and he will
          reach you, and to the last jot and little pay you your due reward. You
          shall not escape, even in the slightest degree. No pleas and prayers,
          no tears and excuses, shall have any avail with him, but till justice
          shall have had its uttermost farthing, thou shalt by no means come out
          thence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, sinner, why wilt thou dare the wrath of God? Why wilt thou
          run this fearful risk? Why wilt thou make thy bed in hell? Why wilt
          thou dwell in everlasting burnings? Is it wise, or art thou mad, and
          is thy reason gone? Have I preached to you a bugbear and a fable? --
          if so, go thy way and sin. But oh! if it be true -- and it must be,
          unless you are prepared to reject that precious book and the very name
          of Christian -- if it be true! Soul, I pray thee let me feel for thee,
          if thou wilt not feel for thyself. Why dash thyself upon the point of
          Jehovah's javelin? Why destroy thyself against the bosses of his
          buckler? What can there be that makes thee so in love with ruin? Why
          wilt thou hug the grave, and embrace destruction? Soul, again I say,
          art thou mad? -- art thou mad? -- art thou mad? May the Lord teach
          thee reason, and may he help thee to flee to the only refuge where a
          sinner may find mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall close when I have tried to set out the way of Mercy. I have
          read in the old Histories of England, that Edward the Second, one of
          our kings, was exceedingly enraged against one of his courtiers; being
          out hunting one day, he threatened the courtier with the severest
          punishment. There was a river between them at the time, and the
          courtier thinking that he was perfectly safe, ventured to offer some
          jeering remark upon the king -- telling him that at any rate he would
          not be likely to chastise him until he got at him. The king feeling
          his anger hot within him, told him that the water should not long
          divide them, leaped into the middle of the stream, and with some
          difficulty gained the other side. The courtier in great alarm fled in
          terror, and the king pursued him with might and main, spurring his
          horse to the utmost. Nor did his anger cease; he carried his drawn
          sword in his hand with the intention of killing him. At last the
          courtier, seeing that there was no hope for any escape, knelt down
          upon the grass, and laying bare his neck, said, "I heartily deserve to
          die, mercy, King! mercy! "He sent back his sword into the scabbard in
          a moment, and said, "Whilst you sought to escape me I determined to
          destroy you, but when I see you humble at my feet I freely forgive
          you." Even so is it with the King of heaven. Sinners, ye say there is
          this life between you and God, ah! but how soon will the white horse
          of Justice pass the stream, and then flee, flee as you may today, he
          will surely overtake you. He now is swift to destroy, let it be yours
          on your knees to make confession of your sin and say, "I deserve thy
          wrath, Great King, I deserve thy wrath," and if to this thou art
          enabled to add the plea of the precious blood of Christ, the sword of
          Justice will return into its scabbard, and he will say, "I am just,
          and yet the justifier of the ungodly." For Jesus died, and inasmuch as
          Jesus Christ has died, Justice is satisfied on the account of all
          believers. Go thy way, thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee.
          "What must I do to saved?" saith one. This is all thou hast to do, and
          this the Holy Spirit will work in thee. "Believe in the Lord Jesus
          Christ with all thine heart." "What is that?" say you. "I believe him
          to be divine; I believe that he is able to save." That will not save
          you, there must be something more than that. "What then?" "Believe in
          him," -- carry out practically your belief that he is able to save by
          trusting yourself in his hands. To exhibit again an old picture which
          has often been used, there is a child in a burning house, hanging from
          the upper window. A strong man stands beneath and offers to catch him,
          if he will but drop from yonder hot window sill to which he still
          clings. "Drop, my child," saith he, "I will catch you." The child
          believes the strength of his preserver; that does not save him. He
          trusts to the strength, he lets go his hold and falls, is caught and
          is preserved, that is faith. Let go your hold of your good works, your
          good thoughts, and all else, and tried in Christ. He never did let one
          soul dash itself to earth yet, that did but fall into his hands. Oh!
          for grace for every one of us to say in the words of Watts, --
        </p>
        <p>"A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>On Christ's kind arms I fall;</p>
        <p>He is my strength and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus and my all."<br /></p>
