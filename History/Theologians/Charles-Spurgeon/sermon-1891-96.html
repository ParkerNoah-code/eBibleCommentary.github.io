          The editor of this American Series confines himself in general to such
          occasional and very brief annotations as may suggest to students and
          others the practical views which are requisite to a clear
          comprehension of authors who wrote for past ages; for a sort and
          condition of men no longer existing, whose extinction as a class is,
          indeed, largely due to these writings. But he reserved to himself the
          privilege of correcting palpable mistakes, especially in points which
          bear upon questions of our own times.
        </p>
        <p>
          That our learned translators have unaccountably admitted a very
          inaccurate translation of the crucial paragraph in book iii. cap. iii.
          sect.2, I have shown in the footnote at that place. It is evident, (1)
          because they themselves are not satisfied with it, and (2) because I
          have set it side by side with the more literal rendering of a writer
          who would have preferred their reading if it could have borne the test
          of criticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the authors of the Latin translation may have designed the
          ambiguity which gives the Ultramontane party an apparent advantage;
          but it is an advantage which disappears as soon as it is examined, and
          hence I am content to take it as it stands. Various conjectures have
          been made as to the original Greek of Irenæus; but the Latin answers
          every purpose of the author's argument, and is fatal to the claims of
          the Papacy. Let me recur to the translation given, in loco, from a
          Roman Catholic, and this will be seen at once.
        </p>
        <p>For he thus renders it: --</p>
        <p>
          1. In this Church, "ever, by those who are on every side, has been
          preserved that tradition which is from apostles." How would such a
          proposition have sounded to Pius IX. in the Vatican Council? The faith
          is preserved by those who come to Rome, not by the Bishop who presides
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. "For to this Church, on account of more potent principality, it is
          necessary that every Church (that is, those who are, on every side,
          faithful) resort." The greatness of Rome, that is, as the capital of
          the Empire, imparts to the local Church a superior dignity, even as
          compared with Lyons, or any other metropolitical Church. Everybody
          visits Rome: hence you find there faithful witnesses from every side
          (from all the Churches); and their united testimony it is which
          preserves in Rome the pure apostolic traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Latin, thus translated by a candid Roman Catholic, reverses the
          whole system of the Papacy. Pius IX. informed his Bishops, at the late
          Council, that they were not called to bear their testimony, but to
          hear his infallible decree; "reducing us," said the Archbishop of
          Paris, "to a council of sacristans."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sustaining these views by a few footnotes, I add (1) a literal
          rendering of my own, and then (2) a metaphrase of the same, bringing
          out the argument from the crabbed obstructions of the Latin text.
          This, then, is what Irenæus says: (a) "For it is necessary for every
          Church (that is to say, the faithful from all parts) to meet in this
          Church, on account of the superior magistracy; in which Church, by
          those who are from all places, the tradition of the apostles has been
          preserved." Or, more freely rendered: (b) "On account of the chief
          magistracy [of the empire], the faithful from all parts, representing
          every Church, are obliged to resort to Rome, and there to come
          together; so that [it is the distinction of this Church that], in it,
          the tradition of the apostles has been preserved by Christians
          gathered together out of all the Churches." Taking the entire argument
          of our author with the context, then, it amounts to this: "We must
          ask, not for local, but universal, testimony. Now, in every Church
          founded by the apostles has been handed down their traditions; but, as
          it would be a tedious thing to collect them all, let this suffice.
          Take that Church (nearest at hand, and which is the only Apostolic
          Church of the West), the great and glorious Church at Rome, which was
          there founded by the two apostles Peter and Paul. In her have been
          preserved the traditions of all the Churches, because everybody is
          forced to go to the seat of empire: and therefore, by these
          representatives of the whole Catholic Church, the apostolic traditions
          have been all collected in Rome: and you have a synoptical view of all
          Churches in what is there preserved." Had the views of the modern
          Papacy ever entered the head of Irenæus, what an absurdity would be
          this whole argument. He would have said, "It is no matter what may be
          gathered elsewhere; for the Bishop of Rome is the infallible oracle of
          all Catholic truth, and you will always find it by his mouth." It
          should be noted that Orthodoxy was indeed preserved there, just so
          long as Rome permitted other Churches to contribute their testimony on
          the principle of Irenæus, and thus to make her the depository of all
          Catholic tradition, as witnessed "by all, everywhere, and from the
          beginning." But all this is turned upside down by modern Romanism. No
          other Church is to be heard or considered; but Rome takes all into her
          own power, and may dictate to all Churches what they are to believe,
          however novel, or contrary to the torrent of antiquity in the
          teachings of their own founders and great doctors in all past time.<br />
