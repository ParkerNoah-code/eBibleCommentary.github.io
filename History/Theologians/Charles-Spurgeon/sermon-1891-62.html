          1. Having therefore the truth itself as our rule and the testimony
          concerning God set clearly before us, we ought not, by running after
          numerous and diverse answers to questions, to cast away the firm and
          true knowledge of God. But it is much more suitable that we, directing
          our inquiries after this fashion, should exercise ourselves in the
          investigation of the mystery and administration of the living God, and
          should increase in the love of Him who has done, and still does, so
          great things for us; but never should fall from the belief by which it
          is most clearly proclaimed that this Being alone is truly God and
          Father, who both formed this world, fashioned man, and bestowed the
          faculty of increase on His own creation, and called him upwards from
          lesser things to those greater ones which are in His own presence,
          just as He brings an infant which has been conceived in the womb into
          the light of the sun, and lays up wheat in the barn after He has given
          it full strength on the stalk. But it is one and the same Creator who
          both fashioned the womb and created the sun; and one and the same Lord
          who both reared the stalk of corn, increased and multiplied the wheat,
          and prepared the barn.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If, however, we cannot discover explanations of all those things in
          Scripture which are made the subject of investigation, yet let us not
          on that account seek after any other God besides Him who really
          exists. For this is the very greatest impiety. We should leave things
          of that nature to God who created us, being most properly assured that
          the Scriptures are indeed perfect, since they were spoken by the Word
          of God and His Spirit; but we, inasmuch as we are inferior to, and
          later in existence than, the Word of God and His Spirit, are on that
          very account destitute of the knowledge of His mysteries. And there is
          no cause for wonder if this is the case with us as respects things
          spiritual and heavenly, and such as require to be made known to us by
          revelation, since many even of those things which lie at our very feet
          (I mean such as belong to this world, which we handle, and see, and
          are in close contact with) transcend our knowledge, so that even these
          we must leave to God. For it is fitting that He should excel all [in
          knowledge]. For how stands the case, for instance, if we endeavour to
          explain the cause of the rising of the Nile? We may say a great deal,
          plausible or otherwise, on the subject; but what is true, sure, and
          incontrovertible regarding it, belongs only to God. Then, again, the
          dwelling-place of birds -- of those, I mean, which come to us in
          spring, but fly away again on the approach of autumn -- though it is a
          matter connected with this world, escapes our knowledge. What
          explanation, again, can we give of the flow and ebb of the ocean,
          although every one admits there must be a certain cause [for these
          phenomena]? Or what can we say as to the nature of those things which
          lie beyond it? What, moreover, can we say as to the formation of rain,
          lightning, thunder, gatherings of clouds, vapours, the bursting forth
          of winds, and such like things; or tell as to the storehouses of snow,
          hail, and other like things? [What do we know respecting] the
          conditions requisite for the preparation of clouds, or what is the
          real nature of the vapours in the sky? What as to the reason why the
          moon waxes and wanes, or what as to the cause of the difference of
          nature among various waters, metals, stones, and such like things? On
          all these points we may indeed say a great deal while we search into
          their causes, but God alone who made them can declare the truth
          regarding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, therefore, even with respect to creation, there are some things
          [the knowledge of] which belongs only to God, and others which come
          within the range of our own knowledge, what ground is there for
          complaint, if, in regard to those things which we investigate in the
          Scriptures (which are throughout spiritual), we are able by the grace
          of God to explain some of them, while we must leave others in the
          hands of God, and that not only in the present world, but also in that
          which is to come, so that God should for ever teach, and man should
          for ever learn the things taught him by God? As the apostle has said
          on this point, that, when other things have been done away, then these
          three, "faith, hope, and charity, shall endure." For faith, which has
          respect to our Master, endures unchangeably, assuring us that there is
          but one true God, and that we should truly love Him for ever, seeing
          that He alone is our Father; while we hope ever to be receiving more
          and more from God, and to learn from Him, because He is good, and
          possesses boundless riches, a kingdom without end, and instruction
          that can never be exhausted. If, therefore, according to the rule
          which I have stated, we leave some questions in the hands of God, we
          shall both preserve our faith uninjured, and shall continue without
          danger; and all Scripture, which has been given to us by God, shall be
          found by us perfectly consistent; and the parables shall harmonize
          with those passages which are perfectly plain; and those statements
          the meaning of which is clear, shall serve to explain the parables;
          and through the many diversified utterances [of Scripture] there shall
          be heard one harmonious melody in us, praising in hymns that God who
          created all things. If, for instance, any one asks, "What was God
          doing before He made the world?" we reply that the answer to such a
          question lies with God Himself. For that this world was formed perfect
          by God, receiving a beginning in time, the Scriptures teach us; but no
          Scripture reveals to us what God was employed about before this event.
          The answer therefore to that question remains with God, and it is not
          proper for us to aim at bringing forward foolish, rash, and
          blasphemous suppositions [in reply to it]; so, as by one's imagining
          that he has discovered the origin of matter, he should in reality set
          aside God Himself who made all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. For consider, all ye who invent such opinions, since the Father
          Himself is alone called God, who has a real existence, but whom ye
          style the Demiurge; since, moreover, the Scriptures acknowledge Him
          alone as God; and yet again, since the Lord confesses Him alone as His
          own Father, and knows no other, as I shall show from His very words,
          -- when ye style this very Being the fruit of defect, and the
          offspring of ignorance, and describe Him as being ignorant of those
          things which are above Him, with the various other allegations which
          you make regarding Him, -- consider the terrible blasphemy [ye are
          thus guilty of] against Him who truly is God. Ye seem to affirm
          gravely and honestly enough that ye believe in God; but then, as ye
          are utterly unable to reveal any other God, ye declare this very Being
          in whom ye profess to believe, the fruit of defect and the offspring
          of ignorance. Now this blindness and foolish talking flow to you from
          the fact that ye reserve nothing for God, but ye wish to proclaim the
          nativity and production both of God Himself, of His Ennoea, of His
          Logos, and Life, and Christ; and ye form the idea of these from no
          other than a mere human experience; not understanding, as I said
          before, that it is possible, in the case of man, who is a compound
          being, to speak in this way of the mind of man and the thought of man;
          and to say that thought (ennoea) springs from mind (sensus), intention
          (enthymesis) again from thought, and word (logos) from intention (but
          which logos? for there is among the Greeks one logos which is the
          principle that thinks, and another which is the instrument by means of
          which thought is expressed); and [to say] that a man sometimes is at
          rest and silent, while at other times he speaks and is active. But
          since God is all mind, all reason, all active spirit, all light, and
          always exists one and the same, as it is both beneficial for us to
          think of God, and as we learn regarding Him from the Scriptures, such
          feelings and divisions [of operation] cannot fittingly be ascribed to
          Him. For our tongue, as being carnal, is not sufficient to minister to
          the rapidity of the human mind, inasmuch as that is of a spiritual
          nature, for which reason our word is restrained within us, and is not
          at once expressed as it has been conceived by the mind, but is uttered
          by successive efforts, just as the tongue is able to serve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But God being all Mind, and all Logos, both speaks exactly what He
          thinks, and thinks exactly what He speaks. For His thought is Logos,
          and Logos is Mind, and Mind comprehending all things is the Father
          Himself. He, therefore, who speaks of the mind of God, and ascribes to
          it a special origin of its own, declares Him a compound Being, as if
          God were one thing, and the original Mind another. So, again, with
          respect to Logos, when one attributes to him the third place of
          production from the Father; on which supposition he is ignorant of His
          greatness; and thus Logos has been far separated from God. As for the
          prophet, he declares respecting Him, "Who shall describe His
          generation?" But ye pretend to set forth His generation from the
          Father, and ye transfer the production of the word of men which takes
          place by means of a tongue to the Word of God, and thus are
          righteously exposed by your own selves as knowing neither things human
          nor divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But, beyond reason inflated [with your own wisdom], ye
          presumptuously maintain that ye are acquainted with the unspeakable
          mysteries of God; while even the Lord, the very Son of God, allowed
          that the Father alone knows the very day and hour of judgment, when He
          plainly declares, "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man,
          neither the Son, but the Father only." If, then, the Son was not
          ashamed to ascribe the knowledge of that day to the Father only, but
          declared what was true regarding the matter, neither let us be ashamed
          to reserve for God those greater questions which may occur to us. For
          no man is superior to his master. If any one, therefore, says to us,
          "How then was the Son produced by the Father?" we reply to him, that
          no man understands that production, or generation, or calling, or
          revelation, or by whatever name one may describe His generation, which
          is in fact altogether indescribable. Neither Valentinus, nor Marcion,
          nor Saturninus, nor Basilides, nor angels, nor archangels, nor
          principalities, nor powers [possess this knowledge], but the Father
          only who begat, and the Son who was begotten. Since therefore His
          generation is unspeakable, those who strive to set forth generations
          and productions cannot be in their right mind, inasmuch as they
          undertake to describe things which are indescribable. For that a word
          is uttered at the bidding of thought and mind, all men indeed well
          understand. Those, therefore, who have excogitated [the theory of]
          emissions have not discovered anything great, or revealed any abstruse
          mystery, when they have simply transferred what all understand to the
          only-begotten Word of God; and while they style Him unspeakable and
          unnameable, they nevertheless set forth the production and formation
          of His first generation, as if they themselves had assisted at His
          birth, thus assimilating Him to the word of mankind formed by
          emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But we shall not be wrong if we affirm the same thing also
          concerning the substance of matter, that God produced it. For we have
          learned from the Scriptures that God holds the supremacy over all
          things. But whence or in what way He produced it, neither has
          Scripture anywhere declared; nor does it become us to conjecture, so
          as, in accordance with our own opinions, to form endless conjectures
          concerning God, but we should leave such knowledge in the hands of God
          Himself. In like manner, also, we must leave the cause why, while all
          things were made by God, certain of His creatures sinned and revolted
          from a state of submission to God, and others, indeed the great
          majority, persevered, and do still persevere, in [willing] subjection
          to Him who formed them, and also of what nature those are who sinned,
          and of what nature those who persevere, -- [we must, I say, leave the
          cause of these things] to God and His Word, to whom alone He said,
          "Sit at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool." But
          as for us, we still dwell upon the earth, and have not yet sat down
          upon His throne. For although the Spirit of the Saviour that is in Him
          "searcheth all things, even the deep things of God," yet as to us
          "there are diversities of gifts, differences of administrations, and
          diversities of operations;" and we, while upon the earth, as Paul also
          declares, "know in part, and prophesy in part." Since, therefore, we
          know but in part, we ought to leave all sorts of [difficult] questions
          in the hands of Him who in some measure, [and that only,] bestows
          grace on us. That eternal fire, [for instance,] is prepared for
          sinners, both the Lord has plainly declared, and the rest of the
          Scriptures demonstrate. And that God foreknew that this would happen,
          the Scriptures do in like manner demonstrate, since He prepared
          eternal fire from the beginning for those who were [afterwards] to
          transgress [His commandments]; but the cause itself of the nature of
          such transgressors neither has any Scripture informed us, nor has an
          apostle told us, nor has the Lord taught us. It becomes us, therefore,
          to leave the knowledge of this matter to God, even as the Lord does of
          the day and hour [of judgment], and not to rush to such an extreme of
          danger, that we will leave nothing in the hands of God, even though we
          have received only a measure of grace [from Him in this world]. But
          when we investigate points which are above us, and with respect to
          which we cannot reach satisfaction, [it is absurd ] that we should
          display such an extreme of presumption as to lay open God, and things
          which are not yet discovered, as if already we had found out, by the
          vain talk about emissions, God Himself, the Creator of all things, and
          to assert that He derived His substance from apostasy and ignorance,
          so as to frame an impious hypothesis in opposition to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Moreover, they possess no proof of their system, which has but
          recently been invented by them, sometimes resting upon certain
          numbers, sometimes on syllables, and sometimes, again, on names; and
          there are occasions, too, when, by means of those letters which are
          contained in letters, by parables not properly interpreted, or by
          certain [baseless] conjectures, they strive to establish that fabulous
          account which they have devised. For if any one should inquire the
          reason why the Father, who has fellowship with the Son in all things,
          has been declared by the Lord alone to know the hour and the day [of
          judgment], he will find at present no more suitable, or becoming, or
          safe reason than this (since, indeed, the Lord is the only true
          Master), that we may learn through Him that the Father is above all
          things. For "the Father," says He, "is greater than I." The Father,
          therefore, has been declared by our Lord to excel with respect to
          knowledge; for this reason, that we, too, as long as we are connected
          with the scheme of things in this world, should leave perfect
          knowledge, and such questions [as have been mentioned], to God, and
          should not by any chance, while we seek to investigate the sublime
          nature of the Father, fall into the danger of starting the question
          whether there is another God above God.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. But if any lover of strife contradict what I have said, and also
          what the apostle affirms, that "we know in part, and prophesy in
          part," and imagine that he has acquired not a partial, but a
          universal, knowledge of all that exists, -- being such an one as
          Valentinus, or Ptolemæus, or Basilides, or any other of those who
          maintain that they have searched out the deep things of God, -- let
          him not (arraying himself in vainglory) boast that he has acquired
          greater knowledge than others with respect to those things which are
          invisible, or cannot be placed under our observation; but let him, by
          making diligent inquiry, and obtaining information from the Father,
          tell us the reasons (which we know not) of those things which are in
          this world, -- as, for instance, the number of hairs on his own head,
          and the sparrows which are captured day by day, and such other points
          with which we are not previously acquainted, -- so that we may credit
          him also with respect to more important points. But if those who are
          perfect do not yet understand the very things in their hands, and at
          their feet, and before their eyes, and on the earth, and especially
          the rule followed with respect to the hairs of their head, how can we
          believe them regarding things spiritual, and super-celestial, and
          those which, with a vain confidence, they assert to be above God? So
          much, then, I have said concerning numbers, and names, and syllables,
          and questions respecting such things as are above our comprehension,
          and concerning their improper expositions of the parables: [I add no
          more on these points,] since thou thyself mayest enlarge upon them.
