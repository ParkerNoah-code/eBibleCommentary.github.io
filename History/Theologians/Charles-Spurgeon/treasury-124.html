            >This psalm has no special title, nor is any author's name
            mentioned. It is the longest psalm, and this is a sufficiently
            distinctive name for it. In size, it equals twenty-two psalms of the
            average length of the Songs of Degrees. It is not just long, though,
            for it equally excels in breadth of thought, depth of meaning, and
            height of passion. It is like the celestial city whose height and
            breadth are equal.
            <i
              >The city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the
              breadth
            </i>
            (Revelation 21:16). Many superficial readers have supposed that it
            harps upon one string and abounds in pious repetitions and
            redundancies, but this perspective arises from the shallowness of
            the reader's own mind.</font

            >Those who have carefully studied each line of this divine hymn are
            amazed at the variety, insight, and depth of thought. Using only a
            few words, the writer has produced variations and combinations of
            meaning that display his holy familiarity with his subject and the
            sanctified ingenuity of his mind. He never repeats himself, for if
            the same sentiment occurs, it is used in a fresh way and exhibits
            another interesting shade of meaning. The more one studies it, the
            fresher it becomes. As those who drink the water of the Nile like it
            better every time they take a drink, so this psalm becomes fuller
            and more fascinating the more you turn to it.</font

            >This psalm contains no unnecessary word. The grapes of this cluster
            are almost bursting full with the new wine of the kingdom. The more
            you look into this mirror of a gracious heart, the more you will see
            in it. Calm on the surface, like the sea of glass before the eternal
            throne, it yet contains within its depths an ocean of fire. Those
            who devoutly gaze into it will not only see the brightness, but will
            also feel the glow of the sacred flame. It is loaded with holy
            wisdom, and it is as weighty as it is bulky.</font

            >Again and again while studying it, we have cried,
            <i>O the depth of the riches!</i> (Romans 11:33). Yet these depths
            are hidden beneath an apparent simplicity, as Augustine has well and
            wisely said, which makes the exposition all the more difficult. Its
            obscurity is hidden beneath a veil of light, and so the only ones
            who discover it are those who sincerely and earnestly not only look
            on the Word, but like the angels, also look into it.</font

            letter, the following eight stanzas begin with the next letter, and
            so the whole psalm proceeds by <i>octaves </i>through the entire
            twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Along with this, there
            are multitudes of parallel phrases and other word structures and
            patterns with which the Hebrew mind is pleased—formalities very
            similar to those in which our older poets indulged.</font

            mind and helpful to the memory. The psalmist is often plain or
            elegant in his manner, but he doesn't avoid being unconventional or
            formal if by doing so his manner of instruction can be more easily
            understood. He does not despise even abbreviated and contrived modes
            of speech if he can firmly set his teaching upon the mind by their
            use.</font

            strictest sense this composition is conditioned; nevertheless, in
            the highest sense is it an utterance of spiritual life; and in thus
            finding these seemingly opposed elements, intimately commingled as
            they are throughout this Psalm, a lesson full of meaning is silently
            conveyed to those who shall receive it—that the conveyance of the
            things of God to the human spirit is in no way damaged or impeded,
            much less is it deflected or violated by its subjugation to those
            modes of utterance which most of all bespeak their adaptation to the
            infancy and the childlike capacity of the recipient.<br />

            >The style among modern writers is, as much as possible, to reject
            David's authorship of every one of the psalms. As the critics of
            this school of thought are usually unsound in doctrine and
            unspiritual in tone, we move in the opposite direction, due to a
            natural suspicion of everything that comes from such an
            unsatisfactory group.</font

            >We believe that David wrote this psalm. It is Davidic in tone and
            expression, and it matches with David's experience in many
            interesting points. In our youth, our teacher called it "David's
            pocketbook," and we lean toward the opinion then expressed, that we
            have here the royal diary written at various times throughout a long
            life. No, we cannot give up this psalm to the enemy.
            <i>This is David's spoil</i> (1 Samuel 30:20). After reading an
            author for a long time, one gets to know his style and acquires a
            certain measure of discernment by which he can detect the author's
            work, even if his name is concealed. We feel a kind of critical
            certainty that the hand of David is in this thing and that it is
            altogether his own.<br />

            >The <i>one theme </i>of this psalm is <i>the Word of the Lord</i>.
            The psalmist sets his subject in many lights and treats it in a
            variety of ways, but he seldom fails to mention the Word of the Lord
            in each verse by one of the many names by which he knows it. Even if
            the name isn't there, the subject is still wholeheartedly pursued in
            every verse. He who wrote this wonderful song was saturated with
            those books of Scripture that he possessed.</font

            >Andrew Bonar tells of a simple Christian in a farmhouse who had
            read the Bible through three times while also taking the time to
            meditate on it. This is precisely what this psalmist had done. He
            had done more than simply read it, but had also meditated on it.
            Like Luther, David had shaken every fruit tree in God's garden and
            gathered golden fruit. Martin Luther explained how he studied the
            Bible: "First I shake the whole apple tree, that the ripest might
            fall. Then I climb the tree and shake each limb, and then each
            branch, and then each twig, and then I look under each leaf."

            fear that we, too, often do the same. This is a miserable way to
            treat the pages of inspiration. May the Lord prevent us from
            repeating that sin while reading this priceless psalm!</font

            matter. The earlier verses lend themselves to suggest the author was
            a young man, while many of the later passages indicate old age and
            wisdom. In every portion, however, it is the fruit of deep
            experience, careful observation, and earnest meditation. If David
            didn't write it, there must have lived another believer of exactly
            the same mind-set as David who was just as passionately addicted to
            psalmody, and who loved the Holy Scripture just as much.</font

            do this, we would do well to commit it to memory. Philip Henry was a
            Nonconformist minister in the 1600s. His daughter wrote in her
            diary, "I have of late taken some pains to learn by heart Psalm 119,
            and have made some progress therein." She was a sensible, godly
            woman.</font

            Henry Martyn mentions it again and again in his diary. For instance:
            "I experienced a solemn gladness in learning this part of the 119th
            Psalm." During a time of political trouble, William Wilberforce
            wrote: "Walked from Hyde Park Corner repeating the 119th Psalm in
            great comfort." Pascal, in the reading of this holy song, seemed to
            pass out of himself in holy rapture.</font

            moral discipline of all the virtues shines brightly. And as all
            moral instruction is delightsome, therefore this Psalm, because
            excelling in this kind of instruction, should be called delightsome,
            inasmuch as it surpasses the rest. The other Psalms, truly, as

          young man, full of hot passions and lacking in knowledge and

          was never a more important question for any man, and never a better
          time to ask it than at the start of life.</font

            to end by showing a clear course from the first step to the last.
            However, his way is already unclean by actual sin that he has
            already committed, and </font

            is right, and of continuing in the right way until spiritual
            maturity is ultimately reached. This is difficult for any man, so
            how will a youth accomplish it? The way, or life, of a man has to be
            cleansed from the sins of his youth that are behind him, and it must
            be kept clear of the sins that temptation will place before him.
            This is the work; this is the difficulty.</font

            obstacles can be overcome. Do not let him think that he knows the
            road to easy victory. Let him not dream that he can keep himself by
            his own wisdom. Instead, he will do well to follow the psalmist and
            become an earnest inquirer asking how he may cleanse his way. Let
            him become a practical disciple of the holy God, who alone can teach

          blesses God for all that He has revealed to him and worked in him. He
          praises God with warmth of reverent love and depth of holy wonder.
          These are also words of perception written from contemplating the
          great Jehovah's infinite happiness within himself. The Lord is and
          must be blessed, for He is the perfection of holiness. This is
          probably the reason this is used as a plea at this point. It is as if

            prayer for every day. It is a step above that of verse 10,
            <i>O let me not err</i>, in the same way that verse 10 is a rise
            above that of verse 8, <i>O do not utterly forsake me</i>. It finds
            its answer in verses 98 to 100:
            <i

          This is one of God's judgments. He is sure to deal out a terrible

          David to abhor pride. He dreaded the rebuke of God and the curse of

          asked for comfort or lifting up, but he knew that these would come out
          of increased life, and therefore he sought that blessing that is the
          root of the rest.</font

            down, the main thing is to increase his stamina and put more life
            into him; then his spirit revives and his body stands straight. When
            life is revived, the whole person is renewed. Shaking off the dust
            is a little thing by itself, but when it follows after quickening,
            it is a blessing of the greatest value, just as a good frame of mind
            flows from established health; it is among the most excellent of our
            mercies.</font

          No doubt he viewed this as the only way of deliverance from the power
          of falsehood. If the law is not in our hearts, the lie will enter in.
          David seems to have remembered those times when, according to the ways
          of the East, he had practiced deceit for his own preservation, and he
          saw that he had been weak and erring on that point. Therefore, he was
          bowed down in spirit and begged to be quickened and delivered from
          sinning in that way anymore. Holy men cannot review their sins without

          David prayed about his heart, and one would think the eyes would
          surely have been influenced by the heart, thus eliminating the need to
          make them the objects of a special prayer, but the psalmist is
          resolved to make doubly sure.<i>

          David desired mercy as well as teaching, for he was guilty as well as
          ignorant. He needed much mercy and wide-ranging mercy, and that is why
          the request is in the plural (<i>Let your mercies</i>, KJV). He needed
          mercies from God rather than from man, and so he asks for
          <i>your mercy</i>. The way of grace appeared to be blocked, and so he
          begs that the mercies may have their way cleared by God and may
          <i> come </i>to him.</font

            the writer feared that mercy would be given to others, but not to
            himself. Therefore he cries, "Let them come
            <i>unto me." Bless me, even me also, O my father</i> (Genesis
            27:38). The words are synonymous to our well-known verse:</font

            before us, we are bound to rise toward it with our whole nature, and
            until it is fully accomplished, we should at least lift up our hands
            in prayer toward it. Where holy hands and holy hearts go, the whole
            person will one day follow.</font

          David doesn't ask for a new promise, but he asks to have the old Word
          fulfilled. He is grateful that he has received such a good Word, and
          he embraces it with all his heart. He now entreats the Lord to deal
          with him according to it. He doesn't say, "remember my service to
          you," but <i> remember the word unto your servant</i>. The words of
          masters to servants are not always those that servants want their
          lords to say as they think of their servants, because they usually
          take note of the faults and failings of the work done, showing that it

            obey, and He will combine it with a remembrance of His word of
            promise so that our hearts will be comforted. If God's Word to us as
            His servants is so precious, what will we say about His Word to us

            conscience, the repentant person cries, "Lord, remember Your word of
            pardon, and therefore remember my sins and iniquities no more."
            There is a world of meaning in that word <i>remember</i>, as it is

            <i>unto your servant</i>. It would all be in vain for us if the

          The argument is that God, having given grace to hope in the promise,
          will never disappoint that hope. He cannot have caused us to hope
          without reason. If our hope is based on His Word, we have a sure basis
          to build upon. Our gracious Lord will never mock us by exciting false
          hopes. <i>Hope deferred makes the heart sick</i> (Proverbs 13:12);
          that is the reason for the petition for immediate remembrance of the
          cheering word. Even more than that, it is the hope of a servant, and
          it is not possible that a great and good master would disappoint his
          dependent. If such a master's word were not kept, it would only be
          through an oversight. This is the reason for the anxious cry,
          <i>Remember</i>.

          David prays, "Lord be good and do good to me, that I may both be good

          delighted to learn. He credited this to the goodness of the Lord, and
          he hoped that for the same reason he would be allowed to remain in the
          school and continue learning until he could perform every lesson
          perfectly. His chosen textbook was the royal statutes, and he wanted
          no other book.</font

            goodness, that he might be taught a <i>perfect knowledge </i> of the
            law and <i>complete conformity </i>to it. He who grieves because he

            Slander is a cheap and handy weapon if the objective is the
            destruction of a virtuous reputation. When many proud people come
            together and conspire to create, exaggerate, and spread a malicious
            falsehood, they generally succeed in wounding their victim, and it
            is no fault of theirs if they do not altogether destroy him.

          Through carnal indulgence, their hearts have grown unfeeling and
          coarse, but You have saved me from such a fate through Your correcting
          hand. Proud men become puffed up through fleshly luxuries, and this
          makes them prouder still. They revel in their prosperity and fill
          their hearts with the indulgences of the flesh until they become
          insensitive, soft, and self-indulgent.
          <i>A greasy heart is hard and insensitive</i>. It is a fatness that
          makes a person weak and foolish. It is a fatty degeneration of the
          heart that leads to feebleness and death. The fat in such men is
          killing the life in them. John Dryden wrote:</font

          always should be a clear contrast between the believer and the one who
          places his principal happiness in fleshly pleasures. That contrast is
          seen in the affections of the heart as much as in the actions of the
          life. <i>Their heart is as fat as grease</i>, and our heart is
          delighted with the law of the Lord.

            doing the will of the Lord his God.
            <i>When law becomes delight, obedience is bliss</i>. Holiness in the
            heart causes the soul to eat the fat of the land. To have the law
            for our delight will breed in our hearts the very opposite effects
            of pride. Deadness, sensuality, and stubbornness will be cured, and
            we will become teachable, sensitive, and spiritual. How careful we
            should be to live under the influence of the divine law so that we

          We have come to know and to keep these statutes by feeling the sting
          of the rod. We prayed for the Lord to teach us (verse 66), and now we
          see how He has already been doing it. Truly He has dealt
          <i>well </i>with us, for He has dealt wisely with us. We have been
          kept from the ignorance of the greasy-hearted by our trials, and this,
          if nothing else, is good cause for constant gratitude. To be fattened
          by prosperity is not good for the proud, but to have the truth learned
          through adversity is good for the humble. Very little is to be learned
          without affliction. If we want to be scholars, we must be sufferers.

          It is profitable for us to remember our creation. It is pleasant to
          see that the divine hand has had much to do with us, for it never
          makes a move apart from divine thought. It inspires reverence,
          gratitude, and affection toward God when we view Him as our Maker, who
          with careful skill and the power of His hands formed us and made us.
          <i>He took a personal interest in us, making us with His own hands</i

          Lord manifested love and wisdom. Therefore, we find reasons for

          <i> the proud</i> because he knew that the Lord always takes vengeance
          on those who are proud, and He vindicates the cause of those whom they
          oppress.

          David felt that salvation would come, for God cannot break His promise
          nor disappoint the hope which His Word has excited. Truly the
          fulfillment of His Word is near at hand when our hope is firm and our
          desire fervent. Hope alone can keep the soul from losing strength or
          courage by using the smelling salts of the promise. Yet hope does not
          extinguish the desire for a speedy answer to prayer. It increases our
          persistence, for it both stimulates zeal and sustains the heart
          burdened with delays. To faint for salvation and to be kept from
          utterly failing in the hope of it is the frequent experience of the
          Christian. We are <i>faint yet pursuing </i> (Judges 8:4).

          Meditating upon the Word of God was both the cause and the effect of
          his love for God's law. He meditated on God's Word because he loved
          it, and he loved it more because he meditated on it. He so
          passionately loved it that he couldn't get enough of it; all day long
          was not too long for him to read and meditate upon it. His morning
          prayer, his noonday thought, and his evening song were all out of Holy
          Scripture. In his worldly business he still kept his mind saturated
          with the law of the Lord.

          David lived in the midst of danger. He always had to be fighting for
          existence—hiding in caves or contending in battles. This is a very
          uncomfortable and difficult state of affairs, and people are apt to
          think any means justifiable to end such a condition. However, David
          did not turn aside to find safety in sin, for he says,
          <i>yet I do not forget your law</i>.</font

            carried the law in his heart. No danger to our body should make us
            endanger our soul by forgetting what is right. Trouble makes many
            people forget their duty, and it would have had the same effect on
            the psalmist if he had not been quickened (verse 107) and received
            teaching (verse 108). His safety lay in his memory of the Lord's
            law. He certainly was not forgotten by his God, for his God was not
            forgotten by him. It is a special
            <i

              holiness out of our lives</i

          God was David's shelter and shield. He ran to God for refuge from vain
          thoughts. There he hid from their tormenting intrusion, and in solemn
          silence of the soul he found God to be his place of sanctuary. When
          moving about the world, if David could not be alone with God as in a
          hiding place, the man of God could have the Lord with him as his
          shield, and in this way he could ward off the poisoned arrows of evil
          suggestions.</font

            then he found deliverance. Notice that he doesn't talk about God's
            Word as being his double defense, but he ascribes his safeguard to
            God Himself.<i> YOU are my hiding place and my shield. </i>When we
            are afflicted by subtle spiritual assaults, like those that arise
            from vain thoughts, we will do well to flee directly to the real

          It was so necessary that the Lord should hold up His servant that he
          couldn't even live without it. If the Lord would withdraw His

          would die also. It is a sweet comfort that this great need for
          upholding is provided for in the Word, and we don't have to ask for it
          as if it isn't promised by the covenant of mercy. We must simply plead

            it. Note that when David chased away the evildoers, he did not feel
            safe when alone. He knew he needed to be preserved from his own
            weakness as well as from other men's evil examples, and so he prayed

          never happen in our case, since we trust a faithful God. We may be
          ashamed of our thoughts, our words, and our deeds, for they spring

          He judges them to be the scum of the earth, and He treats them

          away from their honors, away from the earth, and finally, away from

          make judgments at all, preferring their pleasures to their duties.
          Many more of them sold their judgments to the highest bidders by
          taking bribes or being partial toward certain people. Some rulers gave
          neither judgment nor justice, while others offered judgment without
          justice. David gave both judgment and justice, and he saw that his
          sentences were carried out. He could claim before the Lord that he had
          dealt out even-handed justice and was doing so still. On this fact, he
          founded a plea with which he backed the prayer:

            would show mercy to a servant, even if he deals severely with a
            stranger. The Lord lowers Himself to deal with and communicate with
            His servants. He does not reject His servants, but communes with
            them in a loving and tender way, for in any other way we would be

            of sorrow, but they were rivers of waters and torrents of woe.</font

          our very idea of God. We cannot imagine an unrighteous God. Let us

          the act of divine providence, we can fall back on the certain fact
          that God is righteous, and His dealings with us are righteous too. It
          would be our glory to sing this brave confession when everything

          perfectly keep the law, for where would such people be found? Rather,
          it deals with those who love it, whose hearts and hands are conformed
          to its precepts and demands. These people always strive with all their
          hearts to walk in obedience to the law, and even though they are often
          persecuted, they have peace, yes, <i>great peace,</i> for they have
          learned the secret of the reconciling blood, they have felt the power
          of the comforting Spirit, and they stand before the Father as people
          accepted. The Lord has granted them to feel His peace,<i>
            which surpasses all understanding</i
          >
          (Philippians 4:7). They have many troubles and are likely to be
          persecuted by the proud, but their usual state of mind is that of deep
          calm—a peace too great for these light afflictions to break.</font

          one, worth writing about with enthusiasm, like the psalmist does

          David had stored up, preserved, and followed both the
          <i>practical </i>and <i>doctrinal </i>parts of God's Word. It is a
          blessed thing to see the two forms of the divine Word equally known,
          equally valued, and equally confessed. There should be no picking and
          choosing as to the mind of God. We know those who try to be careful
          regarding the precepts, but who seem to think that the doctrines of
          the gospel are mere matters of opinion that they can form for
          themselves. This is not a perfect condition of things.</font

          to err. Or else he is appealing to God like this in order to bear

          small consolation to feel that our heavenly Father knows all about us,
          and that if princes speak against us and worldly people fill their

          mercies are such that they can be either said or sung. When the tongue
          speaks about God's Word, it has a most fruitful subject. Such speaking
          will be like a tree of life, the leaves of which will be for the
          healing of the people (Ezekiel 47:12; Revelation 22:2). People will
          gather together to listen to such talk, and they will treasure it up
          in their hearts.</font

            day forward, <i>My tongue shall speak of your words</i>! Then we
            would break through our sinful silence. We would no longer be
            cowardly and half-hearted, but we would be true witnesses for
            Jesus.</font
