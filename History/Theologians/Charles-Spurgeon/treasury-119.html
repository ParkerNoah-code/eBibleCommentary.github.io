          SUBJECT.<br />
          In the former psalm the past wonders which God had wrought were
          recounted to his honor, and in the present psalm he is entreated to
          glorify himself again, because the heathen were presuming upon the
          absence of miracles, were altogether denying the miracles of former
          ages, and insulting the people of God with the question, "Where is now
          their God?" It grieved the heart of the godly that Jehovah should be
          thus dishonored, and treating their own condition of reproach as
          unworthy of notice, they beseech the Lord at least to vindicate his
          own name.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist is evidently indignant that the worshipers of foolish
          idols should be able to put such a taunting question to the people who
          worshiped the only living and true God; and having spent his
          indignation in sarcasm upon the images and their makers, he proceeds
          to exhort the house of Israel to trust in God and bless his name.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As those who were dead and gone could no longer sing psalms unto the
          Lord among the sons of men, he exhorts the faithful who were then
          living to take care that God is not robbed of his praise, and then he
          closes with an exulting Hallelujah. Should not living men extol the
          living God?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">DIVISION.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          For the better expounding of it, the psalm may be divided into an
          entreaty of God to vindicate his own honor, verses 1, 2; <br />
          a contemptuous description of the false gods and their worshipers,
          verses 3-8; <br />
          an exhortation to the faithful to trust in God and to expect great
          blessings from him, verses 9-15; <br />
          an explanation of God's relationship to their present condition of
          things, verse 16; <br />
          and a reminder, that, not the dead—but the living, must continually
          praise God here below.<br />
          <br />
          EXPOSITION
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It will be well to remember that this psalm was sung at the Passover,
          and therefore it bears relationship to the deliverance from Egypt. The
          burden of it, seems to be a prayer that the living God, who had been
          so glorious at the Red Sea and at the Jordan, should again for his own
          name's sake display the wonders of his power.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1.</p></b>
        <b>Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us—but unto your name give glory. </b
        >The people undoubtedly wished for relief from the contemptuous insults
        of idolaters—but their main desire was that Jehovah himself should no
        longer be the object of heathen insults. The saddest part of all their
        trouble was that their God was no longer feared and dreaded by their
        adversaries. When Israel marched into Canaan, a terror was upon all the
        people round about, because of Jehovah, the mighty God; but this dread
        the nations had shaken off since there had been of late no remarkable
        display of miraculous power. Therefore Israel cried unto her God that he
        would again make bare his arm as in the day when he cut Rahab and
        wounded the dragon.
        <p align="justify">
          The prayer is evidently tinctured with a consciousness of
          unworthiness; because of their past unfaithfulness, they hardly dared
          to appeal to the covenant, and to ask blessings for themselves—but
          they fell back upon the honor of the Lord their God—an old style of
          argument which their great lawgiver, Moses, had used with such effect
          when he pleaded, "Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For
          mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
          consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath,
          and repent of this evil against your people." Joshua also used the
          like argument when he said, "What will you do for your great name?" In
          such manner also let us pray when no other plea is available because
          of our sense of sin; for the Lord is always jealous of his honor, and
          will work for his name's sake when no other motive will move him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>repetition </i>of the words, <i>Not unto us</i>, would seem to
          indicate a very serious desire to renounce any glory which they might
          at any time have proudly appropriated to themselves, and it also sets
          forth the vehemence of their wish that God would at any cost to them
          magnify his own name. They loathed the idea of seeking their own
          glory, and rejected the thought with the utmost detestation; again and
          again disclaiming any self-glorifying motive in their supplication.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For your mercy, and for your truth's sake.</p></b
        >These attributes seemed most in jeopardy. How could the heathen think
        Jehovah to be a merciful God if he gave his people over to the hands of
        their enemies? How could they believe him to be faithful and true if,
        after all his solemn covenant engagements, he utterly rejected his
        chosen nation?
        <p align="justify">
          God is very jealous of the two glorious attributes of grace and truth,
          and the plea that these may not be dishonored has great weight with
          him. In these times, when the first victories of the gospel are only
          remembered as histories of a dim and distant past, skeptics are apt to
          boast that the gospel has lost its youthful strength, and they even
          presume to cast a slur upon the name of God himself. We may therefore
          rightly entreat the divine interposition that the apparent blot may be
          removed from his escutcheon, and that his own word may shine forth
          gloriously as in the days of old. We may not desire the triumph of our
          opinions, for our own sakes, or for the honor of a sect—but we may
          confidently pray for the triumph of truth, that God himself may be
          honored.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. Why should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
          </p></b
        >
        Why should the nations be allowed with a sneer of contempt to question
        the existence, and mercy, and faithfulness of Jehovah? They are always
        ready to blaspheme; we may well pray that they may not derive a reason
        for so doing from the course of providence, or the decline of the
        church. When they see the godly downtrodden while they themselves live
        at ease, and act the part of persecutors, they are very apt to speak as
        if they had triumphed over God himself, or as if he had altogether left
        the field of action and deserted his saints. When the prayers and tears
        of the godly seem to be unregarded, and their miseries are rather
        increased than assuaged—then do the wicked multiply their taunts and
        jeers, and even argue that their own wretched irreligion is better than
        the faith of Christians, because for the present their condition is so
        much preferable to that of the afflicted saints. And, truly, this is the
        very sting of the trials of God's chosen when they see the veracity of
        the Lord questioned, and the name of God profaned because of their
        sufferings. If they could hope that some good result would come out of
        all this they would endure it with patience; but as they are unable to
        perceive any desirable result consequent thereon, they inquire with holy
        anxiety. "Why should the heathen be permitted to speak thus?"
        <p align="justify">
          It is a question to which it would be hard to reply, and yet no doubt
          there is an answer.
          <i
            >Sometimes the nations are permitted thus to blaspheme, in order
            that they may fill up the measure of their iniquity</i
          >, and in order that the subsequent interposition of God may be
          rendered the more illustrious in contrast with their profane
          boastings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do they say, "Where is now their God?" They shall know by and by, for
          it is written, "Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries"; they shall know
          it also when the righteous shall "shine forth as the sun in the
          kingdom of their Father."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do they say, "Where is the promise of his coming?" That coming shall

          In our own case, by our own <i>lukewarmness </i>and the neglect of
          faithful gospel preaching, we have permitted the uprise and spread of
          modern doubt, and we are bound to confess it with deep sorrow of soul;
          yet we may not therefore lose heart—but may still plead with God to
          save his own truth and grace from the contempt of men of the world.
          <i
            >Our honor and the honor of the church are small matters—but the
            glory of God is the jewel of the universe, of which all else is but
            the setting</i
          >; and we may come to the Lord and plead his jealousy for his name,
          being well assured that he will not allow that name to be dishonored.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why should the pretended wise men of the period be permitted to say
          that they doubt the existence of God? Why should they say that answers
          to prayer are pious delusions, and that the resurrection and the deity
          of our Lord Jesus are moot points? Why should they be permitted to
          speak disparagingly of atonement by blood and by price, and reject
          utterly the doctrine of the wrath of God against sin, even that wrath
          which burns forever and ever? They speak exceeding proudly, and only
          God can stop their arrogant blusterings: let us by extraordinary
          intercession prevail upon him to interpose, by giving to his gospel
          such a triumphant vindication as shall utterly silence the perverse
          opposition of ungodly men.

        the vain jangling of men—and looking down with silent scorn upon the
        makers of the babel. Supreme above all opposing powers, the Lord reigns
        upon a throne high and lifted up. Incomprehensible in essence, he rises
        above the loftiest thought of the wise. Absolute in will and infinite in
        power, he is superior to the limitations which belong to earth and time.
        <p align="justify">
          This God is our God, and we are not ashamed to own him, albeit he may
          not work miracles at the beck and call of every vainglorious boaster

          Once they bade his Son come down from the cross and they would believe
          in him, now they would have God overstep the ordinary bounds of his
          providence and come down from Heaven to convince them. But other
          matters occupy his august mind besides the convincement of those who
          willfully shut their eyes to the superabundant evidences of his divine
          power and Godhead, which are all around them. If our God is neither
          seen nor heard, and is not to be worshiped under any outward
          symbol—yet is he none the less real and true, for he is where his
          adversaries can never be—in the heavens, whence he stretches forth his
          scepter, and rules with boundless power.

        <b> <p align="justify">He has done whatever he has pleased.</p></b> Up
        until this moment his decrees have been fulfilled, and his eternal
        purposes accomplished. He has not been asleep, nor oblivious of the
        affairs of men. He has worked, and he has worked effectually, none have
        been able to thwart, nor even so much as to hinder him.
        <b> <p align="justify">"Whatever he has pleased"</p></b>—however
        distasteful to his enemies, the Lord has accomplished all his good
        pleasure without difficulty; even when his adversaries raved and raged
        against him they have been compelled to carry out his designs against
        their will. Even proud Pharaoh, when most defiant of the Lord was but as
        clay upon the potter's wheel, and the Lord's end and design in him were
        fully answered.
        <p align="justify">
          We may well endure the jeering question, "Where is now their God?"

          We may make an application of all this to the times in which we are
          now living. The god of modern thought is the creation of the thinker
          himself, evolved out of his own consciousness, or fashioned according
          to his own notion of what a god should be. Now, it is evident that
          such a being is no God. It is impossible that there should be a God at
          all, except the God of revelation. A god who can be fashioned by our
          own <i> thoughts </i>is no more a God than the image manufactured or
          produced by our own <i>hands</i>. The true God must of necessity be
          his own revealer. It is clearly impossible that a being who can be
          comprehended by the reason of man should be the infinite and
          incomprehensible God. Their idols are <i>blinded reason </i>and
          <i>diseased thought</i>, the product of men's muddled brains, and they
          will come to nothing.

        The idols cannot utter even the faintest sound, they cannot communicate
        with their worshipers, they can neither promise nor threaten, command
        nor console, explain the past nor prophesy the future. If they had no
        mouths they might not be expected to speak—but having mouths and
        speaking not, they are mere dumb idols, and not worthy to be compared
        with the Lord God who thundered at Sinai, who in old time spoke by his
        servants the prophets, and whose voice even now breaks the cedars of
        Lebanon.
        <b> <p align="justify">Eyes have they—but they see not.</p></b>They
        cannot tell who their worshipers may be or what they offer. Certain
        idols have had jewels in their eyes more precious than a king's
        ransom—but they were as blind as the rest of the fraternity. A god who
        has eyes, and cannot see, is a blind deity; and blindness is a calamity,
        and not an attribute of godhead. He must be very blind who worships a

        The Psalmist might have pointed to the monstrous ears with which some
        heathen deities are disfigured. Truly they have ears; but no prayer of
        their votaries, though shouted by a million voices, can ever be heard by
        them. How can gold and silver hear, and how can a rational being address

        God; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, or
        perhaps he sleeps, and must be awaked." In sacred scorn he mocks at
        those who burn sweet spices, and fill their temples with clouds of
        smoke, all offered to an image whose nose cannot perceive the perfume.
        He seems to point his finger to every part of the countenance of the
        image, and thus pours contempt upon the noblest part of the idol, if any
        part of such a thing can be noble even in the least degree.

        they can neither distribute benefits nor dispense judgments, and the

          Luther's hard speeches were well deserved by the Papists; they must be
          mere dolts to worship the rotten relics which are the objects of their
          veneration.

        <p align="justify">
          The <i>god of modern thought </i>exceedingly resembles the deities
          described in this Psalm. Pantheism is wondrously akin to Polytheism,
          and yet differs very little from Atheism. The god manufactured by our
          great thinkers is a mere myth: he has no eternal purposes, he does not
          interpose on the behalf of his people, he cares but very little as to
          how much man sins, for he has given to the initiated "a larger hope"
          by which the most incorrigible are to be restored. He is what the last
          set of critics chooses to make him, he has said what they choose to
          say, and he will do what they please to prescribe. Let this creed and
          its devotees alone, and they will work out their own refutation, for
          as now their god is fashioned like themselves, they will by degrees
          fashion themselves like their god; and when the principles of justice,
          law, and order shall have all been effectually sapped, we may possibly
          witness in some form of socialism, similar to that which is so sadly
          spreading in Germany, a repetition of the evils which have in former
          ages befallen nations which have refused the living God, and set up
          gods of their own.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 9. O Israel, trust in the LORD.</p></b>
        Whatever others do, let the elect of Heaven keep fast to the God who
        chose them. Jehovah is the God of Jacob, let his children prove their
        loyalty to their God by their confidence in him. Whatever our trouble
        may be, and however fierce the blasphemous language of our enemies, let
        us not fear nor falter—but confidently rest in him who is able to
        vindicate his own honor, and protect his own servants.
        <b> <p align="justify">He is their help and their shield.</p></b> He is
        the friend of his servants, both actively and passively, giving them
        both aid in labor and defense in danger. In the use of the pronoun
        "their," the Psalmist may have spoken to himself, in a sort of
        soliloquy: he had given the exhortation, "trust in Jehovah," and then he
        whispers to himself, "They may well do so, for he is at all times the
        strength and security of his servants."
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 10. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD.
          </p></b
        >
        You who are nearest to him, trust him most. Your very calling is
        connected with his truth and is meant to declare his glory, therefore
        never entertain a doubt concerning him—but lead the way in holy
        confidence. The priests were the leaders, teachers, and exemplars of the
        people, and therefore above all others they should place an unreserved
        reliance upon Israel's God.
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist is glad to add that they did so, for he says,
          <b>He is their help and their shield. </b>It is good to exhort those
          to faith who have faith: "These things have I written unto you that
          believe on the name of the Son of God; ...that you may believe on the
          name of the Son of God." We may stir up pure minds by way of
          remembrance, and exhort men to trust in the Lord because we know that
          they are trusting already.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 11.</p></b> The next verse is of the same
        tenor—<b>You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD</b>, whether belonging
        to Israel, or to the house of Aaron, or not, all those who reverence
        Jehovah are permitted and commanded to confide in him.
        <b> <p align="justify">He is their help and their shield.</p></b>He aids
        and protects all those who worship him in filial fear, to whatever
        nation they may belong. No doubt these repeated exhortations were
        rendered necessary by the trying condition in which the children of
        Israel were found: the sneers of the adversary would assail all the
        people, they would most bitterly be felt by the priests and ministers,
        and those who were secret proselytes would groan in secret under the
        contempt forced upon their religion and their God. All this would be
        very staggering to faith, and therefore they were bidden again and again
        and again to trust in Jehovah. This must have been a very pleasant song
        to households in Babylon, or far away in Persia, when they met together
        in the night to eat the Paschal supper in a land which knew them not,
        where they wept as they remembered Zion.
        <p align="justify">
          We seem to hear them repeating the threefold word, "Trust in Jehovah,"
          men and women and little children singing out their scorn of the
          dominant idolatry, and declaring their adhesion to the one God of
          Israel. In the same manner in this day of blasphemy and scoffing, it
          becomes us all to abound in testimonies to the truth of God. The
          skeptic is loud in his unbelief, let us be equally open in the avowal
          of our faith.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 12. The Lord has been mindful of us</p></b
        >, or "Jehovah has remembered us." His past mercies prove that we are on
        his heart, and though for the present he may afflict us—yet he does not
        forget us. We have not to put him in remembrance as though he found it
        hard to recollect his children—but he has remembered us and therefore he
        will in future deal well with us.
        <b> <p align="justify">He will bless us.</p></b>The word "us" is
        supplied by the translators, and is superfluous, the passage should run,
        <b
          >He will bless; he will bless the house of Israel he will bless the
          house of Aaron. </b
        >The repetition of the word "bless" adds great effect to the passage.
        The Lord has many blessings, each one worthy to be remembered, he
        blesses and blesses and blesses again. Where he has once bestowed his
        favor, he continues it. His blessing delights to visit the same house
        very often and to abide where it has once lodged.
        <p align="justify">
          Blessing does not impoverish the Lord—he has multiplied his mercies in
          the past, and he will pour them forth thick and threefold in the
          future. He will have a general blessing for all who fear him, a
          peculiar blessing for the whole house of Israel, and a double blessing
          for the sons of Aaron. It is his nature to bless, it is his
          prerogative to bless, it is his glory to bless, it is his delight to
          bless! He has promised to bless, and therefore be sure of this, that
          he will bless and bless and bless without ceasing.

        So long as a man fears the Lord it matters nothing whether he be prince
        or peasant, patriarch or pauper, God will assuredly bless him. He
        supplies the needs of every living thing, from the leviathan of the sea
        to the insect upon a leaf, and he will allow none of the godly to be
        forgotten, however small their abilities, or mean their position.
        <p align="justify">
          This is a sweet cordial for those who are little in faith, and own
          themselves to be mere babes in the family of grace. There is the same
          blessing for the least saint, as for the greatest. Yes, if anything,
          the "small" shall be first; for as the necessity is the more pressing,
          the supply shall be the more speedy.

        Just as in Egypt he multiplied the people exceedingly, so will he
        increase the number of his saints upon the earth. Not only shall the
        faithful be blessed with converts, and so with a spiritual seed; but
        those who are their spiritual children shall become fruitful also, and
        thus the multitude of the elect shall be accomplished.
        <p align="justify">
          God shall increase the people, and shall increase the joy. Even to the
          end of the ages the race of true believers shall be continued, and
          shall increasingly multiply in number and in power. The first blessing
          upon mankind was, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
          earth"; and it is this blessing which God now pronounces upon those
          who fear him. Despite the idols of philosophy and sacramentarianism,
          the truth shall gather its disciples, and fill the land with its
          defenders.

        This is another form of the blessing of Melchizedek: "Blessed be Abram
        of the Most High God, possessor of Heaven and earth"; and upon us
        through our great Melchizedek this same blessing rests.
        <p align="justify">
          It is an omnipotent blessing, conveying to us all that an Almighty God
          can do, whether in Heaven or on earth. This fullness is infinite, and
          the consolation which it brings is unfailing. He who made Heaven and
          earth can give us all things needful while we dwell below, and bring
          us safely to his palace above. Happy are the people upon whom such a
          blessing rests; their portion is infinitely above that of those whose
          only hope lies in a piece of gilded wood, or an image of sculptured
          stone.

            Verse 16. The Heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's.

        >There he specially reigns, and manifests his greatness and his glory:
        <b> but the earth has he given to the children of men. </b>He has left
        the world during the present dispensation in a great measure under the
        power and will of men, so that things are not here below in the same
        perfect order as the things which are above. It is true the Lord rules
        over all things by his providence—but yet he allows and permits men to
        break his laws and persecute his people for the time being, and to set
        up their dumb idols in opposition to him. The free agency which he gave
        to his creatures necessitated that in some degree he should restrain his
        power and allow the children of men to follow their own evils ways; yet
        nevertheless, since he has not vacated Heaven, he is still master of
        earth, and can at any time gather up all the reins into his own hands.
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps, however, the passage is meant to have another meaning,
          namely, that God will increase his people, because he has given the
          earth to them, and intends that they shall fill it. Man was
          constituted originally God's viceregent over the world, and though as
          yet we see not all things put under him, we see Jesus exalted on high,
          and in him the children of men shall receive a loftier dominion even
          on earth than as yet they have known. "The meek shall inherit the
          earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace": and
          our Lord Jesus shall reign among his ancients gloriously.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All this will reflect the exceeding glory of him who reveals himself
          personally in Heaven, and in the mystical body of Christ below. The
          earth belongs to the sons of God, and we are bound to subdue it for
          our Lord Jesus, for he must reign. The Lord has given him the heathen
          for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his
          possession.

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 17. The dead praise not the LORD</p></b>—So
        far as this world is concerned. They cannot unite in the Psalms and
        hymns and spiritual songs with which the church delights to adore her
        Lord. The preacher cannot magnify the Lord from his coffin, nor the
        Christian worker further manifest the power of divine grace by daily
        activity while he lies in the grave.
        <b> <p align="justify">Neither any that go down into silence.</p></b>
        The tomb sends forth no voice; from moldering bones and flesh consuming
        worms there arises no sound of gospel ministry nor of gracious song. One
        by one the singers in the consecrated choir of saints steal away from
        us, and we miss their music. Thank God, they have gone above to swell
        the harmonies of the skies—but as far as we are concerned, we have need

        We who are still living will take care that the praises of God shall not
        fail among the sons of men. Our afflictions and depressions of spirit
        shall not cause us to suspend our praises; neither shall old age, and
        increasing infirmities damp the celestial fires, nay, nor shall even
        death itself cause us to cease from the delightful occupation.

        <p align="justify">
          The spiritually dead cannot praise God—but the life within us
          constrains us to do so. The ungodly may abide in silence—but we will
          lift up our voices to the praise of Jehovah. Even though for a time he
          may work no miracle, and we may see no peculiar interposition of his
          power—yet on the strength of what he has done in ages past we will
          continue to laud his name "until the day breaks, and the shadows flee
          away," when he shall once more shine forth as the sun to gladden the
          faces of his children. The present time is auspicious for commencing a
          life of praise, since today he bids us hear his voice of mercy.

        of wisdom, for this duty ought not to be delayed; and it is the dictate
        of gratitude, for there are pressing reasons for prompt thankfulness.
        Once begin praising God and we have entered upon an endless service.<i>
          Even eternity cannot exhaust the reasons why God should be glorified. </i

        the dead cannot, and the wicked will not, and the careless do not praise
        God—yet we will shout "Hallelujah" forever and ever. Amen.
