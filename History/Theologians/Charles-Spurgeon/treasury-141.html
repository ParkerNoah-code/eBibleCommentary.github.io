        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          GENERAL REMARKS. This Psalm has no title. It is mainly made up of
          selections from other Scriptures. It has been called a <i>mosaic</i>,
          and compared to a tessellated pavement. At the outset, its first two
          verses are taken from Psalm 134:1-3; while the latter part of Psalm
          135:2 and the commencement of Psalm 135:3 put us in mind of Psalm
          116:19; and Psalm 135:4 suggests Deuteronomy 7:6. Does not Psalm 135:5
          remind us of Psalm 95:3? As for Psalm 135:7, it is almost identical
          with Jeremiah 10:13, which may have been taken from it. The passage
          contained in Psalm 135:13 is to be found in Exodus 3:15, and Psalm
          135:14 in Deuteronomy 32:36. The closing verses, Psalm 135:8-12, are
          in Psalms 136. From Psalm 135:15 to the end, the strain is a
          repetition of Psalm 115:1-18
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This process of tracing the expressions to other sources might be
          pushed further without straining the quotations; the whole Psalm is a
          compound of many choice extracts, and yet it has all the continuity
          and freshness of an original poem. The Holy Spirit occasionally
          repeats himself; not because he has any lack of thoughts or words, but
          because it is expedient for us that we hear the same things in the
          same form. Yet, when our great Teacher uses repetition, it is usually
          with instructive variations, which deserve our careful attention.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. The first fourteen verses contain an exhortation to praise
          Jehovah . . .<br />
          for his goodness (verse 3), <br />
          for his electing love verse 4), <br />
          for his greatness (verses 5-7) <br />
          for his judgments (verses 8-12), <br />
          for his unchanging character (verse 13), and <br />
          for his love towards his people (verse 14).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is followed by a denunciation of idols (verses 15-18), and a
          further exhortation to bless the name of the Lord. It is a song full
          of life, vigor, variety, and devotion.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Praise the LORD</p></b>, or,
        <i>Hallelujah</i>. Let those who are themselves full of holy praise,
        labor to excite the like spirit in others. It is not enough for us to
        praise God ourselves, we are quite unequal to such a work; let us call
        in all our friends and neighbors, and if they have been slack in such
        service, let us stir them up to it with loving exhortations.
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise the name of the LORD.</p></b> Let his
        character be extolled by you, and let all that he has revealed
        concerning himself be the subject of your song; for this is truly his
        name.
        <p align="justify">
          Especially let his holy and incommunicable name of "Jehovah" be the
          object of your adoration. By that name he sets forth his
          self-existence, and his immutability; let these arouse your praises of
          his Godhead. Think of him with love, admire him with heartiness, and
          then extol him with ardor. Do not only magnify the Lord because he is
          God; but study his character and his doings, and thus render
          intelligent, appreciative praise.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise him, O you servants of the Lord.</p></b>
        If others are silent, you must not be; you must be the first to
        celebrate his praises. You are "servants", and this is part of your
        service; his "name" is named upon you, therefore celebrate his name with
        praises. You know what a blessed Master he is, therefore speak well of
        him.
        <p align="justify">
          Those who shun his service are sure to neglect his praise; but as
          grace has made you his own personal servants, let your hearts make you
          his court musicians.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here we see the servant of the Lord arousing his fellow servants by
          three times calling upon them to praise. Are we, then, so slow in such
          a sweet employment? Or is it that when we do our utmost, it is all too
          little for such a Lord? Both are true. We do not praise enough; we
          cannot praise too much. We ought to be always at it; answering to the
          command here given—Praise, Praise, Praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let the Three-in-one have the praises of our spirit, soul, and body.
          For the past, the present, and the future—let us render threefold
          hallelujahs.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. You that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of
            the house of our God.
          </p></b
        >
        You are highly favored; you are the servants of the palace, nearest to
        the Father of the heavenly family, privileged to find your home in his
        house; therefore you must, beyond all others, abound in thanksgiving.
        <p align="justify">
          You "stand;" or abide in the temple; you are constant occupants of its
          various courts; and therefore from you we expect unceasing praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Should not ministers be celebrated for celebrating the praises of
          Jehovah? Should not church officers and church members excel all
          others in the excellent duty of adoration? Should not all of every
          degree who wait even in his outer courts, unite in his worship? Ought
          not the least and feeblest of his people to proclaim his praises, in
          company with those who live nearest to him? Is it not a proper thing
          to remind them of their obligations? Is not the Psalmist wise when he
          does so in this case and in many others?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who can call Jehovah "our God" are highly blessed, and therefore
          should abound in the work of blessing him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps this is the sweetest word in these two verses. "This God is
          our God forever and ever." "<b>Our God</b>" signifies possession,
          communion in possession, assurance of possession, delight in
          possession. Oh the unutterable joy of calling God our own!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. Praise the LORD.</p></b>Do it again;
        continue to do it; do it better and more heartily; do it in growing
        numbers; do it at once.

        <p align="justify">
          There are good reasons for praising the Lord, and among the first is
          this—for the LORD is good. He is so good that there is none good in
          the same sense or degree. He is so good that
          <i>all good is found in him, flows from him, and is rewarded by him</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The word <i>God </i>is brief for <i>good</i>; and truly God is the
          essence of goodness. Should not his goodness be well spoken of? Yes,
          with our best thoughts, and words, and hymns—let us glorify his name.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Sing praises unto his name, for it is pleasant.
          </p></b
        >
        "Pleasant" may apply to the singing and to the name—they are both
        pleasant. The vocal expression of praise by sacred song is one of our
        greatest delights. We were created for this purpose, and hence it is a
        joy to us. It is a charming duty to praise the lovely name of our God.
        All pleasure is to be found in the joyful worship of Jehovah. All joys
        are in his sacred name as perfumes lie slumbering in a garden of
        flowers. The <i>mind </i>expands, the <i>soul </i>is lifted up, the
        <i>heart </i>warms, the whole being is filled with delight when we are
        engaged in singing the high praises of our Father, Redeemer, Comforter.
        <p align="justify">
          When in any occupation goodness and pleasure unite, we do well to
          follow it up without stint—yet it is to be feared that few of us sing
          to the Lord at all in proportion as we talk to men.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 4. For the LORD has chosen Jacob unto himself.
          </p></b
        >
        Jehovah has chosen Jacob. Should not the sons of Jacob praise him who
        has so singularly favored them?
        <i>Election is one of the most forcible arguments for adoring love. </i
        >Chosen! Chosen unto himself!—who can be grateful enough for being
        concerned in this privilege "Jacob have I loved", said Jehovah, and he
        gave no reason for his love except that he chose to love. Jacob had then
        done neither good nor evil—yet thus the Lord determined, and thus he
        spoke.
        <p align="justify">
          If it be said that the choice was made upon foresight of Jacob's
          character, it is, perhaps, even more remarkable; for there was little
          enough about Jacob that could deserve special choice. By nature Jacob
          was by no means the most lovable of men.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            No, it was sovereign grace which dictated the choice
          </p></i
        >. But, mark, it was not a choice whose main result was the personal
        welfare of Jacob's seed. The nation was chosen by God unto himself, to
        answer the divine ends and purposes in blessing all mankind. Jacob's
        race was chosen to be the Lord's own, to be the trustees of his truth,
        the maintainers of his worship, the mirrors of his mercy.
        <i
          >Chosen they were; but mainly for this end, that they might be a
          peculiar people, set apart unto the service of the true God</i

        <b> <p align="justify">And Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p></b
        >God's choice exalts; for here the name is changed from Jacob, the
        supplanter, to Israel, the prince. The love of God gives a new name and
        imparts a new value; for the comparison to a royal treasure is a most
        honorable one. As kings have a special regalia, and a selection of the
        rarest jewels, so the Lord deigns to reckon his chosen nation as his
        wealth, his delight, his glory.
        <p align="justify">
          What an honor to the <i>spiritual Israel </i>that they are all this to
          the Lord their God! We are a people near and dear unto him; precious
          and honorable in his sight. How can we refuse our loudest, heartiest,
          sweetest music? If we did not extol him, the stones in the street
          would cry out against us!
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is
            above all gods.
          </p></b
        >
        The <i>greatness </i>of God is as much a reason for adoration as his
        <i>goodness</i>, when we are once reconciled to him. God is great
        <i>positively</i>, great <i>comparatively</i>, and great
        <i> superlatively</i>. He is "above all gods."
        <p align="justify">
          Of this the Psalmist had an assured personal persuasion. He says
          positively, "I know." It is knowledge worth possessing. He knew by
          observation, inspiration, and realization. He was no agnostic, he was
          certain and clear upon the matter. He not only knows the greatness of
          Jehovah, but that as the Adonai, or Ruler, "our Lord" is infinitely
          superior to all the imaginary deities of the heathen, and to all great
          ones besides.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many have thought to worship Jehovah, and other gods with him; but
          this holy man tolerated no such notion. Others have thought to combine
          their religion, with obedience to the unrighteous laws of tyrannical
          princes. This, also, the sweet singer of Israel denounced; for he
          regarded the living God as altogether above all men, who as
          magistrates and princes have been called <i>gods</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observe here the fourth of the five "fors." Psalm 135:3-5,14 contain
          reasons for praise, each set forth with "for." A fruitful meditation
          might be suggested by this.

            Verse 6. Whatever the LORD pleased, that did he in Heaven, and in

          </p></b
        >
        His will is carried out throughout all space. The King's warrant runs in
        every portion of the universe. The heathen divided the great domain; but
        Jupiter does not rule in Heaven, nor Neptune on the sea, nor Pluto in
        the lower regions; Jehovah rules over all. His decree is not defeated,
        his purpose is not frustrated; in no one point is his good pleasure set
        aside.
        <p align="justify">
          The word "whatever" is of the widest range and includes all things,
          and the four words of place which are mentioned comprehend all space;
          therefore the declaration of the text knows neither limit nor
          exception.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Jehovah works his will. He pleases to do, and he performs the deed.

        <b> <p align="justify">None can stay his hand.</p></b> How different
        this from the gods whom the heathen fabled to be subject to all the
        disappointments, failures, and passions of men! How contrary even to
        those so called Christian conceptions of God which subordinate him to
        the will of man, and make his eternal purposes the football of human
        caprice. Our theology teaches us no such degrading notions of the
        Eternal as that he can be baffled by man.
        <p align="justify">
          "His purpose shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure." No region
          is too high, no abyss is too deep, no land too is distant, no sea is
          too wide for his omnipotence. His divine pleasure travels quickly over
          all the realm of nature, and his behests are obeyed.

        >
        Here we are taught<i> the power of God in creation. </i>The process of
        evaporation is passed by unnoticed by the many, because they see it
        going on all around them; the usual ceases to be wonderful to the
        thoughtless, but it remains a marvel to the instructed. When we consider
        upon what an immense scale evaporation is continually going on, and how
        needful it is for the existence of all life, we may well admire the
        wisdom and the power which are displayed therein.
        <p align="justify">
          All around us from every point of the horizon the vapor rises,
          condenses into clouds, and ultimately descends as rain. Whence the
          vapors <i>originally </i>ascended from which our showers are formed,
          it would be impossible to tell; most probably the main part of them
          comes from the tropical regions, and other remote places at "the ends
          of the earth." It is the Lord who causes them to rise, and not a mere
          natural law. What is law without a force at the back of it?
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">He makes lightnings for the rain</p></b>. There
        is an intimate connection between lightning and rain, and this would
        seem to be more apparent in Palestine than even with ourselves; for we
        constantly read of thunderstorms in that country as attending heavy down
        pours of rain.
        <p align="justify">
          Lightning is not to be regarded as a lawless force, but as a part of
          that wonderful machinery by which the earth is kept in a fit
          condition—a force as much under the control of God as any other, a
          force most essential to our existence.

        <b> <p align="justify">He brings the wind out of his treasuries.</p></b>
        This great force which seems left to its own wild will, is really under
        the supreme and careful government of the Lord. As a monarch is
        specially master of the contents of his own treasure, so is our God the
        Lord of the tempest and hurricane. As princes do not spend their
        treasure without taking note and count of it, so the Lord does not
        permit the wind to be wasted, or squandered without purpose.

        <p align="justify">
          Observe how the Psalmist brings before us the personal action of
          Jehovah: "he causes", "he makes", "he brings." Everywhere the Lord
          works all things, and there is no power which escapes his supremacy.
          It is well for us that it is so.

        The nations of Canaan joined in the desperate resistance offered by
        their monarchs, and so they were smitten; while their kings, the
        ringleaders of the fight, were slain. Those who resist the divine

        the nations and the might of the kings availed nothing against the Lord.
        He is prepared to mete out vengeance to those who oppose his designs.
        Those who dream of him as too tender to come to blows have mistaken the
        God of Israel. He intended to bless the world through his chosen people,
        and he would not be turned from his purpose. Cost what it might, he

        >
        Jehovah is Lord Paramount, and permits men to hold their lands upon
        lease, terminable at his pleasure. The nations of Canaan had become
        loathsome with abominable vices, and they were condemned by the great
        Judge of all the earth to be cut off from the face of the country which
        they defiled. The twelve tribes were charged to act as their
        executioners, and as their fee they were to receive Canaan as a
        possession.
        <p align="justify">
          Of old the Lord had given this land to Abraham and his seed by a
          covenant of salt, but he allowed the Amorites and other tribes to
          sojourn in it until their iniquity was full, and then he bade his
          people come and take their own out of the holders' hands. Canaan was
          their heritage because they were the Lord's heritage, and he gave it
          to them actually because he had long before given it to them by
          promise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord's chosen still have a heritage from which none can keep them
          back. Covenant blessings of inestimable value are secured to them;
          and, as surely as God has a people, his people shall have a heritage.

          clear that his memorial contained in promises and covenant would never
          be out of his sight. His name endures in all its truthfulness, for

        communion ensure intense gratitude on the part of his chosen.

          The temple of holy solemnities which is Christ, and the city of the
          Great King, which is the church, may fitly be regarded as the
          head-quarters of the praises of Jehovah, the God of Israel. "Praise
          the Lord." Hallelujah. Amen, and Amen.
