          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician</b>. Who he was matters not, and who
          we may be is also of small consequence, so long as the Lord is
          glorified.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">On upon stringed instruments.</p></b> This is the
        fifth Psalm so entitled, and no doubt like the others was meant to be
        sung with the accompaniment of "harpers harping with their harps." No
        author's name is given, but he would be a bold man who should attempt to
        prove that David did not write it. We will be hard pushed before we will
        look for any other author upon whom to father these anonymous odes which
        lie side by side with those ascribed to David, and wear a family
        likeness to them. <b> <p align="justify">A Psalm or Song</p></b>.
        Solemnity and vivacity are here united. A Psalm is a song, but all songs
        are not Psalms; this is both one and the other.<br />
         
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. May God be merciful unto us.</p></b>This
        is a fit refrain to the blessing of the High Priest in the name of the
        Lord, as recorded in Numbers 6:24-25, "The Lord bless you, and keep you:
        the Lord make his face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you."
        <p align="justify">
          It begins at the beginning with a cry for mercy.
          <i>
            Forgiveness of sin is always the first link in the chain of mercies
            experienced by us. </i
          >Mercy is a foundation attribute in our salvation. The best saints and
          the worst sinners may unite in this petition.<i>
            It is addressed to the God of mercy, by those who feel their need of
            mercy, and it implies the death of all legal hopes or claims of
            merit.</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And bless us.</p></b>Next, the church begs for a
        blessing; <i>bless us</i>—a very comprehensive and far reaching prayer.
        When we bless God we do but little, for our blessings are but words—but
        when God blesses he enriches us indeed, for his blessings are gifts and
        deeds.
        <b> <p align="justify">And cause his face to shine upon us.</p></b>But
        his blessing alone is not all his people crave, they desire a personal
        consciousness of his favor, and pray for a smile from his face.
        <p align="justify">
          These three petitions include all that we need here or hereafter. This
          verse may be regarded as the prayer of Israel, and spiritually of the
          Christian church. The largest charity is shown in this Psalm, but it
          begins at home. The whole church, each church, and each little
          company, may rightly pray, <i>bless us. </i>It would, however, be very
          wrong to let our charity end where it begins, as some do; our love
          must make long marches, and our prayers must have a wide sweep, we
          must embrace the whole world in our intercessions.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b>Lift up the heart, lift up the
        voice. A higher key, a sweeter note is called for.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. That your way may be known upon earth.
          </p></b
        >As showers which first fall upon the hills, afterwards run down in
        streams into the valleys, so the blessing of the Most High comes upon
        the world through the church. We are blessed for the sake of others, as
        well as ourselves. God deals in a way of mercy with his saints, and then
        they make that way known far and wide, and the Lord's name is made
        famous in the earth.
        <p align="justify">
          Ignorance of God is the great enemy of mankind, and the testimonies of
          the saints, experimental and grateful, overcome this deadly foe. God
          has set a way and method of dealing out mercy to men, and it is the
          duty and privilege of a revived church to make that way to be
          everywhere known.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Your salvation among all nations.</p></b> This
        all nations need, but many of them do not know it, desire it, or seek
        it. Our prayer and labor should be, that the knowledge of salvation may
        become as universal as the light of the sun. Despite the gloomy notions
        of some, we cling to the belief that the kingdom of Christ will embrace
        the whole habitable globe, and that all flesh shall see the salvation of
        God—for this glorious consummation we agonize in prayer.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. Let the people praise you, O God.</p></b
        >Cause them to own your goodness and thank you with all their hearts.
        Let nations do this, and do it continually, being instructed in your
        gracious way.
        <b> <p align="justify">Let all the people praise you.</p></b>May every
        man bring his music, every citizen his canticle, every peasant his
        praise, every prince his psalm. All are under obligations to you, to
        thank you will benefit all, and praise from all will greatly glorify
        you; therefore, O Lord, give all men the grace to adore your grace, and
        the goodness to see your goodness.
        <p align="justify">
          What is here expressed as a prayer in our translation, may be read as
          a prophecy, if we follow the original Hebrew.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 4. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy
          </p></b
        >, or, they shall joy and triumph. When men know God's way and see his
        salvation, it brings to their hearts much happiness. Nothing creates
        gladness so speedily, surely, and abidingly—as the salvation of God.
        <p align="justify">
          Nations never will be glad until they follow the leadership of the
          great Shepherd; they may shift their modes of government from
          monarchies to republics, and from republics to communes, but they will
          retain their wretchedness until they bow before the Lord of all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a sweet word is that to sing for joy! Some sing for form, others
          for show, some as a duty, others as an amusement, but to sing from the
          heart, because overflowing joy must find a vent, this is to sing
          indeed. Whole nations will do this when Jesus reigns over them in the
          power of his grace. We have heard hundreds and even thousands sing in
          chorus, but what will it be to hear whole nations lifting up their
          voices, as the noise of many waters and like great thunders. When
          shall the age of song begin? When shall groans and murmurs be
          exchanged for holy hymns and joyful melodies?
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">For you shall judge the people righteously.</p></b
        >
        Wrong on the part of governors is a fruitful source of national woe, but
        where the Lord rules, rectitude is supreme. He does ill to none. His
        laws are righteousness itself. He rights all wrongs and releases all who
        are oppressed. Justice on the throne is a fit cause for national
        exultation.
        <b> <p align="justify">And govern the nations upon earth.</p></b>He will
        lead them as a shepherd leads his flock, and through his grace they
        shall willingly follow, then will there be peace, plenty, and
        prosperity. It is a great condescension on God's part to become the
        Shepherd of nations, and to govern them for their good. It is a fearful
        crime when a people, who know the salvation of God, apostatize and say
        to the Lord, "Depart from us." There is some cause for trembling lest
        our nation should fall into this condemnation; may God forbid.
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b>Before repeating the chorus, the
        note is again elevated, that full force may be given to the burst of
        song and the accompaniment of harps.
        <p align="justify">
          "Strings and voices, hands and hearts,<br />
          In the concert bear your parts;<br />
          All that breathe, your Lord adore,<br />
          Praise him, Praise him, evermore!"
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. May the peoples praise you, O God; may all the peoples
            praise you.
          </p></b
        >These words are no vain repetition, but are a chorus worthy to be sung
        again and again. The great theme of the psalm is the participation of
        the Gentiles in the worship of Jehovah; the psalmist is full of it, he
        hardly knows how to contain or express his joy.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. Then shall the earth yield her increase.
          </p></b
        >
        Sin first laid a curse on the soil, and grace alone can remove it. Under
        tyrannical governments lands become unproductive; even the land which
        flowed with milk and honey is almost a wilderness under Turkish rule.
        Bbut, when the principles of true religion shall have elevated mankind,
        and the dominion of Jesus shall be universally acknowledged, the science
        of tillage shall be perfected, men shall be encouraged to labor,
        industry shall banish poverty, and the soil shall be restored to more
        than its highest condition of fertility.
        <p align="justify">
          We read that the Lord turns "a fruitful land into barrenness," for the
          wickedness of them that dwell therein, and observation confirms the
          truth of the divine threatening; but even under the law it was
          promised, "The Lord shall make you plenteous in every work of your
          hand, in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land for
          good."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is certainly an intimate relation between <i>moral </i>and
          <i>physical </i>evil, and between <i>spiritual </i>and
          <i>physical </i>good. It seems that the prophet bard, hearing the
          nations praise the Lord, speaks of the bounteous harvest as already
          given in consequence. On the supposition that all the people praise
          Jehovah, the earth has yielded her increase.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">And God, even our own God, shall bless us.</p></b
        >
        He will make earth's increase to be a real blessing. Men shall see in
        his gifts, the hand of that same God whom Israel of old adored, and
        Israel, especially, shall rejoice in the blessing, and exult in her own
        God.
        <p align="justify">
          We never love God aright until we know him to be <i>ours</i>, and the
          more we love him the more we long to be fully assured that he is ours.
          What dearer name can we give to him than "my own God." The spouse in
          the song has no sweeter canticle than "my beloved is my and I am his."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Every believing Jew must feel a holy joy at the thought that the
          nations shall be blessed by Abraham's God; but every Gentile believer
          also rejoices that the whole world shall yet worship the God and
          Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who is our Father and our
          God.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 7. God shall bless us.</p></b>The
        <i>prayer </i>of the first verse, is the <i>song </i>of the last. We
        have the same phrase twice, and truly the Lord's blessing is manifold;
        he blesses and blesses and blesses again. How many are his beatitudes!
        How choice his blessings! They are the peculiar heritage of his chosen
        people.
        <p align="justify">
          In this verse we find a song for all future time. God shall bless us
          is our assured confidence; he may smite us, or strip us, or even slay
          us—but he must bless us. He cannot turn away from doing good to his
          elect.
        </p>
        <b>

        >The far off shall fear. The ends of the earth shall end their idolatry,
        and adore their God. All tribes, without exception, shall feel a sacred
        awe of the God of Israel. Ignorance shall be removed, insolence subdued,
        injustice banished, idolatry abhorred—and the Lord's love, light, life,
        and liberty, shall be over all, the Lord himself being King of kings and
        Lord of lords! Amen, and Amen.
