          "Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
          bring forth." -- Proverbs 27:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          GOD'S MOST holy Word was principally written to inform us of the way
          to heaven, and to guide us in our path through this world, to the
          realms of eternal life and light. But as if to teach us that God is
          not careless concerning our doings in the present scene, and that our
          benevolent Father is not inattentive to our happiness even in this
          state, he has furnished us with some excellent and wise maxims, which
          we may put in practice, not only in spiritual matters, but in temporal
          affairs also. I have always looked upon the book of Proverbs with
          pleasure, as being a book not only teaching us the highest spiritual
          wisdom, but as also more especially speaking on the "now" -- the time
          that is present with us -- giving us maxims that will make us wise for
          this world, and that will instruct us in conducting our affairs whilst
          we are here amongst our fellow-men. We need some temporal wisdom as
          well as spiritual illumination; it need not always be that the
          children of the kingdom should be more foolish than the children of
          darkness. It is well that we should be wise to order our common
          affairs aright, as well as to set out house in order for the grave;
          and hence we find in Scripture maxims and teachings for them both.
          Since God has been pleased thus to instruct us in the avocations of
          life, I shall not, then, be out of place, if I use my text, in some
          degree, in a merely temporal manner, and endeavour to give advice to
          my friends concerning the business of this life. Afterwards, I shall
          dwell upon it more spiritually. There is first, the abuse of to-morrow
          forbidden in the text; in the second place, I shall mention the right
          use of to-morrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, there is THE ABUSE OF TO-MORROW mentioned in the text;
          and we shall look upon it first in a worldly point of view, and yet, I
          trust, in a way of wisdom. "Boast not thyself of to-morrow." Oh! my
          brethren, whoso'er ye be, whether ye be Christians or no, this passage
          hath a depth of wisdom in it for you. "Boast not thyself of
          to-morrow," and this, for many very wise reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, because it is extremely foolish to boast at all.
          Boasting never makes a man any the greater in the esteem of others,
          nor does it improve the real estate either of his body or soul. Let a
          man brag as he will, he is none the greater for his bragging; nay, he
          is the less, for men invariably think the worse of him. Let him boast
          as much as he pleases of anything that he possesses, he shall not
          increase its value by his glorying. He cannot multiply his wealth by
          boasting of it; he cannot increase his pleasures by glorying in them.
          True, to be content with those pleasures, and feel a complacency in
          them, may render them very sweet; but not so with such a treasure as
          this, for it is a treasure which he has not yet, and, therefore, how
          foolish is he to glory in it! There is an old, old proverb, which I
          dare not quote here; it is something to do with chickens. Perhaps you
          can recollect it; it bears very well upon this text, for to-morrow is
          a thing that we have not yet obtained, and, therefore, not only if we
          had it would it be foolish to boast of it, but because we have it not,
          and may never have it, it becomes the very extremity of foolishness to
          glory in it. Glory, O man, in the harvest that may come to thee next
          year when thy seed is sown; but glory not in to-morrow, for thou canst
          sow no seeds of morrows. Morrows come from God; thou hast no right to
          glory in them. Glory if thou wilt, O fowler, that the birds have once
          flown to thy net, for they may come again; but glory not too soon, for
          they my find another decoy that shall be better to their taste than
          thine, or they may rove far off from thy snare. Though many a day has
          come to thee, think not that another will certainly arrive. Days are
          not like links of a chain; one does not ensure the other. We have one,
          but we may never see its fellow; each may be the last of its kind.
          Each springs of a separate birth. There are no twin days. To-day hath
          no brother, it stands alone, and to-morrow must come alone, and the
          next and the next, also, must be born into this world without a
          brother. We must never look upon two days at once, nor expect that a
          whole herd of days shall be brought forth at one time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need not boast of to-morrow, for it is one of the frailest things
          in all creation, and, therefore, the least to be boasted of. Boast of
          the bubbles on the breaker, boast of the foam upon the sea, boast of
          the clouds that skim the sky, boast of what thou wilt, O man, but
          boast not of to-morrow, for it is too unsubstantial. To-morrow, it is
          a fleeting thing. Thou hast not seen it; why dost thou boast of it?
          To-morrow, it is a fleeting thing. Thou hast not seen it; why dost
          thou boast of it? To-morrow, it is the cup which the idiot dreams
          lieth at the foot of the rainbow. It is not there, nor hath he found
          it. To-morrow -- it is the floating island of Loch Lomond; many have
          talked of it, but none have seen it. To-morrow -- it is the wrecker's
          beacon, enticing men to the rock of destruction. Boast not thyself of
          to-morrow; it is the frailest and most brittle thing thou canst
          imagine. Not glass were half so easily broken as thy to-morrow's joys
          and thy to-morrow's hopes; a puff of wind shall crush them, while yet
          they seem not to be full blown. He said, good easy man, full surely my
          greatness is a ripening, but there came a frost -- a killing, frost
          which nipped his shoot and then he fell. Boast not of to-morrow; thou
          hast it not. Boast not of to-morrow; thou mayest never have it. Boast
          not of to-morrow; if thou hadst it, it would deceive thee. Boast not
          of to-morrow, for to-morrow thou mayest where morrows will be dreadful
          things to tremble at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boast not thyself of to-morrow, not only because it is extremely
          foolish, but because it is exceedingly hurtful. Boasting of to-morrow
          is hurtful to us every way. It is hurtful to us now. I never knew a
          man who was always hoping to do great things in the future, that ever
          did much in the present. I never knew a man who intended to make a
          fortune by-and-bye, who ever saved sixpence a week now. I never knew a
          man who had a very great and grand hopes on the death of some old
          grandmother, or the coming-in of some property from chancery, or the
          falling to him of something because his name was Jenyns, I never saw
          him very prosperous in the mean time. I have heard of a man going to
          be rich to-morrow, and boasting of it; but I never knew him do much.
          Such men spend so much time in building castles in the air, that they
          have no stones left wherewith to build so much as a cottage on the
          ground. They were wasting all their energies on to-morrow,
          consequently they had no time to reap the fields of the present, for
          they were waiting for the heavy harvests of the future. The heavily
          laden boats of to-day come in with abundance of fish from the depths
          of time; but they said of them, "They are nothing; there will be
          heavier draughts to-morrow; there will be greater abundance then. Go
          away, little ships; an argosy shall come home to-morrow -- a very
          fleet of wealth;" and so they let to-day's wealth go by because they
          expected the greater wealth of to-morrow; therefore, they were hurt
          even for the present.
        </p>
        <p>
          And worse than that. Some men were led into extraordinary extravagance
          from their hopes of the future. They spend what they are going to
          have, or rather what they never will have. Many have been ruined by
          the idle dream of speculation; and what is that but boasting of
          to-morrow? They have said, "True, I cannot pay for this which I now
          purchase; but I shall to-morrow, for to-morrow I shall roll in wealth,
          to-morrow, perhaps, I shall be the richest of men. A lucky turn of
          business (as they term it) will lift me off this shoal." So they keep
          still, and not only do they refuse to toil, to push themselves off the
          sand, but worse than that, they are throwing themselves away and
          wasting what they have, in the hope of better times coming in the
          future. Many a man has been made halt, and lame, and blind, and dumb,
          in the present, because he hoped to be greater than a man in the
          future. I always laugh at those who say to me, "Sir, rest a while; you
          will work all the longer of it. Stay while, lest you wast your
          strength, for you may work to-morrow." I bid them remember that such
          is not the teaching of Scripture, for that says, "Whatsoever thy hand
          findeth to do, do it with thy might;" and I would count myself worse
          than a fool, if I should throw away my to-days in the expectation of
          to-morrows, and rest upon the couch of idleness to-day, because I
          thought the chariot of to-morrow would make up for all my sloth. No,
          beloved, if we love our God, we shall find enough to do, if we have
          all our to-morrows, and use all our to-days too. If we serve our God
          as we ought to serve him, considering what he has done for us, we
          shall find that we shall have more than our handsfull, let our life be
          spared as long as Methuselah's -- enough for every moment, enough for
          every hour, long as life may be. But hoping to do things in the future
          takes away our strength in the present, unnerves our resolution, and
          unstrings our diligence. Let us take care that we are not hurt in the
          present by boasting of to-morrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, remember, that if you boast of to-morrow, it will not only hurt
          you to-day, but hurt you to-morrow also. Do you know why? because, as
          sure as you are alive, you will be disappointed with to-morrow, if you
          boast of it before it comes. To-morrows would be very good things if
          you did not give them such a very good character. I believe one of the
          very worst things a minister can possess is to have anybody to
          recommend him; for the people say, "Here comes a man, how he will
          preach, how eloquent he will be!" The poor creature cannot come up to
          their expectations, and so they are disappointed. So with to-morrow;
          you give him such flattering enconiums; "Oh! he is everything; he is
          perfection." To-days -- they are nothing; they are the very sweepings
          of the floors; but to-morrows -- they are the solid gold. Todays --
          they are exhausted mines, and we get little from them; but to-morrows
          -- they are the very mines of wealth. We have only to get them, and we
          are rich, immensely rich. The to-morrows are everything; and then the
          to-morrows come laden with mercy and big with blessings of God; but,
          notwithstanding, we are disappointed, because to-morrow is not what we
          expected it to be, even when to-morrow is marvellously abundant. But
          sometimes to-morrow comes with storms, and clouds, and darkness, when
          we expected it to be full of light and sunshine, and oh, how terrible
          is our feeling then, from the very reason that we expected something
          different. It is not at all a bad beatitude, "Blessed is the man that
          expecteth nothing, for he shall never be disappointed."
        </p>
        <p>
          If we know how to practise that, and expect nothing, we shall not be
          disappointed, it is certain; and the less we expect, and the less we
          boast of our expectations, the more happy will the future be; because
          we shall have far less likelihood of being disappointed. Let us
          recollect, then, that if we would kill the future, if we would ruin
          the to-morrows, if we would blast their hopes, if we would take away
          their honey, we must press them in the hand of boasting, and then we
          shall have done it. "Boast not thyself of to-morrow;" for thou
          spoilest the to-morrow by boasting of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, remember, what disastrous circumstances have occurred to men
          in this life after to-morrow had gone, from boasting of to-morrows.
          Ay, there is many a man that set all his hope upon one single thing;
          and the to-morrow came which he did not expect -- perhaps a black and
          dark to-morrow, and it crushed his hopes to ashes; and how sad he felt
          afterwards! He was in his nest; he said, "Peace, peace, peace;" and
          sudden destruction came upon his happiness and his joy. He had boasted
          of his to-morrow by over security, and see him there, what a very
          wreck of a man he is, because he had set his hope on that; now his joy
          is blasted. Oh! my friends, never boast too much of the to-morrows,
          because if you do, your disappointment will be tremendous, when you
          shall find your joys have failed you, and your hopes have passed away.
          See there that rich man; he has piled heaps on heaps of gold; but now
          for a desperate venture, he is about to have more than he ever
          possessed before, and he reckons on that to-morrow. Nothingness is
          his; and what is his disappointment? because he boasted of imagined
          wealth. See that man! his ambition is to raise his house, and
          perpetuate his name; see that heir of his -- his joy, his life, his
          fulness of happiness. A handful of ashes and a coffin are left to the
          weeping father. Oh! if he had not boasted too much of the certainty of
          that son's life, he had not wept so bitterly, after the to-morrow had
          swept over him, with all its blast and mildew of his expectations. See
          yonder, another; he is famous, he is great; to-morrow comes a slander,
          and his fame is gone, and his name disgraced. Oh! had he not set his
          love on that, he had not cared whether men cried, "crucify," or
          "hallelujah;" he had disregarded both alike. But believing that fame
          was a stable thing, whereas its foot is on the sand, he reckoned on
          to-morrows; and mark how sad he walks the earth, because to-morrow has
          brought him nothing but grief. "Boast not thyself of to-morrow."
        </p>
        <p>
          And I would have you remember just one fact; and that I think to be a
          very important one; that very often when men boast of to-morrow, and
          are over confident that they shall live, they not only entail great
          sorrow upon themselves, but upon others also. I have, when preaching,
          frequently begged of my friends to be quite sure to make their wills,
          and see to their family affairs. Many are the solemn instances which
          should urge you to do so. One night a minister happened to say, in the
          course of his sermon, that he held it to be a Christian duty for every
          man to have his house set in order, so that if he were taken away, he
          would know, that as far as possible, everything would be right. And
          there was one member of his church there, who said to himself, "What
          my minister has said is true. I should not like to see my babes and my
          wife left with nothing, as they must be if I were to die." So he went
          home. That night he made his will and cleared up his accounts. That
          night he died! It must have been a joyful thing for the widow, in the
          midst of her sadness, to find herself amply provided for, and
          everything in order for her comfort. Good Whitfield said he could not
          lie down in bed of a night, if he did not know that even his gloves
          were in their place; for he said he should not like to die with
          anything in his house out of order. And I would have every Christian
          very careful, to be so living one day, that if he were never to see
          another, he might feel that he had done the utmost that he could, not
          only to provide for himself, but also for those who inherit his name
          and are dear to him. Perhaps you call this only worldly teaching; very
          good; you will find it very much like heavenly teaching one of these
          dark days, if you do not practise it. "Boast not thyself of
          to-morrow."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now I come to dwell upon this in a spiritual manner, for a
          moment or two. "Boast not thyself of to-morrow." Oh! my beloved
          friends, never boast of to-morrow with regard to your soul's
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          They do so in the first place, who think that it will be easier for
          them to repent to-morrow than it is to-day. Felix said there would be
          a more convenient season, and then he would again send for Paul, that
          he might hear him seriously. And many a sinner thinks that just now it
          is not easy to turn and to repent, but that by-and-bye it will be.
          Now, is not that a very string of falsehoods? In the first place, is
          it ever easy for a sinner to turn to God? Must not that be done, at
          any time, by divine power? And again, if that be not easy for him now,
          how will it be easier in after life? Will not his sins bind fresh
          fetters to his soul, so that it will be even more impossible for him
          to escape from his iron bondage? If he be dead now, will he not be
          corrupt before he reaches to-morrow? And when to-morrow comes, to
          which he looks forward as being easier for a resurrection, will not
          his soul be yet more corrupt, and, therefore, if we may so speak, even
          further from the possibility of being raised? Oh! sirs, ye say it is
          easy for ye to repent to-morrow; why, then, not to-day? Ye would find
          the difficulty of it, if you should try it; yea, you would find your
          own helplessness in that matter. Possibly you dream that on a future
          day repentance will be more agreeable to your feelings. But how can
          you suppose that a few hours will make it more pleasant? If it be
          vinegar to your taste now, it shall be so then; and if ye love your
          sins now, ye will love them better then; for the force of habit will
          have confirmed you in your course. Every moment of your lives is
          driving in another rivet to your eternal state. So far as we can see,
          it becomes less and less likely (speaking after the manner of men)
          that the sinner should burst his chains each sin that he commits; for
          habit has bound him yet faster to his guilt, and his iniquity has got
          another hold upon him. Let us take care, then, that we do not boast of
          to-morrow, by a pretence that it will be so much easier to repent
          to-morrow; whereas, it is one of Satan's lies, for it will only be the
          more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          He boasts of to-morrow, again, who supposes that he shall have plenty
          of time to repent and to return to God. Oh! there are many who say,
          "When I come to die, I shall be on my death-bed, and then I shall say,
          Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner.'" I remember an aged minister
          telling me a story of a man whom he often warned, but who always said
          to him, "Sir, when I am dying, I shall say Lord, have mercy on me;'
          and I shall go to heaven as well as anybody else." Returning home from
          market one night, rather "fou" with liquor, he guided his horse with a
          leap right over the parapet of a bridge into the river; the last words
          he was heard to utter, were a most fearful imprecation; and in the bed
          of the river he was found dead, killed by the fall. So it may be with
          you. You think you will have space for repentance, and it may be that
          sudden doom will devour you: or, perhaps, even while you are sitting
          there in the pew, your last moment is running out. There is your
          hour-glass. See! it is running. I marked another grain just then, and
          then another fell; it fell so noiselessly, yet methought I heard it
          fall. Yes! there it is! The clock's tick is the fall of that grain of
          dust down from your hour-glass. Life is getting shorter every moment
          with all of you; but with some the sand is almost out; there is not a
          handful left. A few more grains. See, now they are less, two or three.
          Oh! in a moment it may be said, "The is not one left." Sinner! never
          think that thou hast time to spare! thou never hadst; man never had.
          God says, "Haste thee," when he bids men flee from Sodom. Lot had to
          haste; and depend upon it, when the Spirit speaks in a man's heart, he
          doth always bid him haste. Under natural convictions, men are very
          prone to tarry; but the Spirit of God, when he speaks in the heart of
          man, always says, "to-day." I never knew a truly anxious soul yet, who
          was willing to put off till to-morrow. When God the Holy Ghost has
          dealings with a man, they are always immediate dealings. The sinner is
          impatient to get deliverance; he must have pardon now; he must have
          present mercy, or else he fears that mercy will come too late to him.
          Let me beseech you, then, (and may God the Holy Spirit grant that my
          entreaty may become successful in your case) let me beseech every one
          of you to take this into consideration -- that there is never time to
          spare, and that your thought that there is time to spare, is an
          insinuation of Satan; for when the Spirit pleads with man, he pleads
          with him with demands of immediate attention. "To-day, if you will
          hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Boast not thyself of to-morrow," O sinner, as I doubt not thou art
          doing in another fashion. "Boast not thyself of to-morrow," in the
          shape of resolves to do better. I think I have given up resolutions
          now; I have enough of the debris and the rubbish of my resolutions to
          build a cathedral with, if they could but be turned into stone. Oh!
          the broken resolutions, the broken vows, all of us have had! Oh! we
          have raised castles of resolutions, structures of enormous size, that
          outvied Babylon itself, in all its majesty. Says one, "I know I shall
          be better to-morrow; I shall renounce this vice and the other; I shall
          forsake this lust; I shall give up that darling sin; true, I shall not
          do so now -- a little more sleep and a little more slumber; but I know
          I shall do it to-morrow." Fool! thou knowest not that thou shalt see
          to-morrow. Oh! greater fool! thou oughtest to know, that what thou art
          not willing to do to-day, thou wilt not be willing to do to-morrow. I
          believe there are many souls that have been lost by good intentions,
          which were never carried out. Resolutions strangled at their birth
          brought on men the guilt of spiritual infanticide; and they have been
          lost, with resolutions sticking in their mouths. Many a man has gone
          down to hell with good resolution on his lip, with a pious resolve on
          his tongue. Oh! if he had lived another day, he said he would have
          been so much better; if he had lived another week, oh, then he thought
          he would begin to pray. Poor soul! if he had been spared another week,
          he would only have sunk the deeper into sin! But he did not think so,
          and he went to hell with a choice morsel rolling under his tongue --
          that he should do better directly, and that meant to amend by-and-bye.
          There are many of you present, I dare say, who are making good
          resolutions. You are apprentices: well, you are not going to carry
          them out till you get to be journeymen. You have been breaking the
          Sabbath: but you intend to leave it off when you are in another
          situation. You have been accustomed to swear: you say, "I shall not
          swear any more when I get out of this company, they try my temper so."
          You have committed this or that petty theft: to-morrow you will
          renounce it, because to-morrow you will have enough, and you can
          afford to do it. But of all the lying things -- and there are many
          things that are deceptive -- resolutions for to-morrow are the worst
          of all. I would not trust one of them; there is nothing stable in
          them; you might sooner sail to America across the Atlantic on a sere
          leaf, than float to heaven on a resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the frailest thing in the world, tossed about by every
          circumstance, and wrecked with all its precious freight -- wrecked to
          the dismay of the man who ventured his soul in it -- wrecked, and
          wrecked for aye. Take care, my dear hearers, that none of you are
          reckoning on to-morrows. I remember the strong but solemn words of
          Jonathan Edwards, where he says, "Sinner, remember, thou art at this
          moment standing over the mouth of hell upon a single plank, and that
          plank is rotten; thou art hanging over the jaws of perdition by a
          solitary rope, and lo! the strands of that rope are creaking --
          breaking now, and yet thou talkest of to-morrows!" If thou wert sick,
          man, wouldst thou send for thy physician to-morrow? If thine house
          were on fire, wouldst thou call "fire" to-morrow? If thou wert robbed
          in the street on thy road home, wouldst thou cry "stop thief"
          to-morrow? No, surely; but thou art wiser than that in natural
          concerns. But man is foolish, oh! too foolish in the things that
          concern his soul; unless divine and infinite love shall teach him to
          number his days, that he may apply his heart unto true wisdom, he will
          still go on boasting of to-morrows, until his soul has been destroyed
          by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just one hint to the child of God. Ah! my beloved brother or sister,
          do not, I beseech thee, boast of to-morrow thyself. David did it once:
          he said, "My mountain standeth firm, I shall never be moved." Do not
          boast of your to-morrows. You have feathered your nest pretty well;
          ay, but you may have a thorn in it before the sun has gone down, and
          you will be glad enough to fly aloft. You are very happy and joyful,
          but do not say you will always have as much faith as you have now --
          do not be sure you will always be as blessed. The next cloud that
          sweeps the skies may drive many of your joys away. Do not say you have
          been kept hitherto, and you are quite sure you will be preserved from
          sin to-morrow. Take care of to-morrows. Many Christians go tumbling on
          without a bit of thought; and then, on a sudden, they tumble down and
          make a mighty mess of their profession. If they would only look sharp
          after the to-morrows -- if they would only watch their paths instead
          of star-gazing and boasting about them, their feet would be a great
          deal surer. True, God's child need not think of to-morrow as regards
          his soul's eternal security, for that is in the hand of Christ and
          safe for ever; but as far as his profession, and comfort, and
          happiness are concerned, it will well become him to take care of his
          feet every day. Do not get boasting; if you get boasting of to-morrow,
          you know the Lord's rule is always to send a canker where we put our
          pride. And so if you boast of to-morrow, you will have a moth in it
          before long. As sure as ever we glory in our wealth, it becomes
          cankered, or it takes to itself wings and flies away; and as certainly
          as we boast of to-morrow, the worm will gnaw its root, as it did
          Jonah's gourd, and the to-morrow under which we rested shall, with
          dropping leaves, only stand a monument to our disappointment. Let us
          take care, Christian brethren, that we do not waste the present time
          with hopes of to-morrow -- that we do not get proud, and so off our
          guard, by boasting of what we most assuredly shall be then, as we
          imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the last place, if to-morrows are not to be boasted
          of, are they good for nothing? No, blessed be God! There are great
          many things we may do with to-morrows. We may not boast of them, but I
          will tell you what we may do with them if we are the children of God.
          We may always look forward to them with patience and confidence, that
          they will work together for our good. We may say of the to-morrows, "I
          do not boast of them, but I am not frightened at them; I would not
          glory in them, but I will not tremble about them."
        </p>
        <p>"What may be my future lot,</p>
        <p>Well I know concerns me not;</p>
        <p>This doth set my heart at rest,</p>
        <p>What my God appoints is best."</p>
        <p>
          We may be very easy and very comfortable about to-morrow; we may
          remember that all our times are in his hands, that all events are at
          his command; and though we know not all the windings of the path of
          providence, yet He knows them all. They are all settled in his book,
          and our times are all ordered by his wisdom; whether they be
        </p>
        <p>"Times of trial and of grief;</p>
        <p>Times of triumph and relief;</p>
        <p>Times the tempter's power to prove,</p>
        <p>Times to taste a Saviour's love:</p>
        <p>All must come, and last, and end,</p>
        <p>As shall please my heavenly Friend."</p>
        <p>
          And, therefore, we may look upon the to-morrows as we see them in the
          rough bullion of time, about to be minted into every day's
          expenditure, and we may say of them all, "They shall all be gold; they
          shall all be stamped with the King's impress, and, therefore, let them
          come; they will not make me worse -- they will work together for my
          good."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, more, a Christian may rightly look forwards to his to-morrows,
          not simply with resignation, but also with joy. To-morrow to a
          Christian is a happy thing, it is one stage nearer glory. To-morrow!
          It is one step nearer heaven to a believer; it is just one knot more
          that he has sailed across the dangerous sea of life, and he is so much
          the nearer to his eternal port -- his blissful heaven. To-morrow, it
          is a fresh lamp of fulfilled promise that God has placed in his
          firmament, that the Christian may hail it as a guiding star, in the
          future, or at least as a light to cheer his path. To-morrow, the
          Christian may rejoice at it; he may say of to-day, "O day, thou mayest
          be black, but I shall bid thee good-bye, for lo, I see the morrow
          coming, and I shall mount upon its wings, and shall flee away and
          leave thee and thy sorrows far behind me."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, moreover, the Christian may await to-morrow with even more than
          simple hope and joy; he may look forward to it with ecstacy in some
          measure, for he does not know but that to-morrow his Lord may come.
          To-morrow Christ may be upon this earth, "for in such an hour as ye
          think not the Son of Man cometh." To-morrow, all the glories of
          millennial splendour may be revealed; to-morrow, the thrones of
          judgment may be set, and the King may summon the people to judgment.
          To-morrow, we may be in heaven; to-morrow, we may be on the breast of
          Christ; to-morrow, ay, before then, this head may wear a crown, this
          hand may wave the palm, this lip may sing the son, this foot may tread
          the streets of gold, this heart may be full of bliss, immortal,
          everlasting, eternal. Be of good cheer, oh, fellow-Christian;
          to-morrow can have nothing black in it to thee, for it must work for
          thy good, but it may have in it a precious, precious jewel. It is an
          earthen pitcher, and it may have in it some dark black waters, but
          their bitterness is taken away by the cross. But mayhap, also, it may
          have in it the precious jewel of eternity; for wrapt up within
          to-morrow may be all the glories of immortality. Anoint thine head
          with fresh oil of gladness at the prospect of each coming day. Boast
          not of to-morrow, but often comfort thyself with it. Thou hast a right
          to do so; it cannot be a bad tomorrow to thee; it may be the best day
          of thy life, for it may be thy last.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, another hint. To-morrow ought to be observed by Christians in
          the way of providence. Though we may not boast of to-morrow, yet we
          may seek to provide for the morrow. On one occasion I pleaded for a
          benefit society, and not knowing a more appropriate text, I selected
          this, "Take no thought for the morrow, for to-morrow shall take
          thought for the things of itself." Some of my hearers, when I
          announced my text, feared the principle of it was altogether hostile
          to anything like an insurance, or providing for the future, but I just
          showed them that it was not, as I looked upon it. It is a positive
          command that we are to take no anxious thought concerning to-morrow.
          No, how can I do that? How can I put myself into such a position that
          I can carry out this command of taking no thought for the morrow! If I
          were a man struggling in life, and had it in my power to insure for
          something which would take care of wife and family in after days, if I
          did not do it, you might preach to me all eternity about not taking
          thought for the morrow; but I could not help doing it, when I saw
          those I loved around me unprovided for. Let it be in God's word, I
          could not practise it; I should still be at some time or other taking
          thought for the morrow. But let me go to one of the many of the
          excellent institutions which exist, and let me see that all is
          provided for, I come home and say, "Now, I know how to practise
          Christ's command of taking no thought for the morrow; I pay the
          policy-money once a year, and I take no further thought about it, for
          I have no occasion to do so now, and have obeyed the very spirit and
          letter of Christ's command." Our Lord meant that we were to get rid of
          cares; now it is apparent that those distressing cares are removed,
          and we are able to live above anxiety by that single process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if that is so, if there is anything that enables us to carry out
          Christ's commands, is it not in the very bowels of the commandments to
          do that? If God has pleased to put into the hearts of wise men to
          devise something that should in some way ameliorate the misfortunes of
          their kind, and relieve them from the distresses and casualties of
          God's providence, how can it but be our duty to avail ourselves of
          that wisdom which, doubtless, God gave to men, that we might thereby
          in these times be enable to carry out in the fullest extent the
          meaning of that passage, "Take no thought for the morrow." Why, if a
          man says, "I shall take no thought for the morrow, I will just spend
          all I get, and not think of doing anything or taking any thought for
          the morrow," how is he going to pay his rent? Why, the text could not
          be carried out, if it meant what some people think. It cannot mean
          that we should carelessly live by the day, or else a man would spend
          all his money on Monday, and have nothing left for the rest of the
          week; but that would be simple folly. It means that we should have no
          anxious, distressing thought about it. I am preaching about benefit
          societies; I would not attempt to recommend many of them, and I do not
          believe in the principles of half of them; I believe a great deal of
          mischief is done by their gatherings in alehouses and pothouses; but
          wherever there is a Christian society, I must endeavour to promote its
          welfare, for I look on the principle as the best means of carrying out
          the command of Christ, "Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow
          shall take thought for itself." Allow me to recommend this Asylum to
          your liberality as a refuge in adversity for those who were careful in
          prosperity. It is a quiet retreat for decayed members of Benefit
          Societies, and I am sorry to inform you that many of its rooms are
          vacant, not from want of candidates, but from a lack of funds. It is a
          pity that so much public property should lie unemployed. Help the
          committee then to use the houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, now, in concluding, let me remind the Christian that there is one
          thing he has not do, and that is, he has not to provide salvation, nor
          grace, nor sustenance, nor promises for the morrow. No, beloved; but
          we often talk as if we had. We say, "How shall I persevere through
          such and such a trial?" "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
          You must not boast of to-day's grace, as though it were enough for
          to-morrow. But you need not be afraid. With to-morrow's difficulties
          there will be to-morrow's help; with to-morrow's foes, to-morrow's
          friends; with to-morrow's dangers, to-morrow preservations. Let us
          look forward, then, to to-morrow as a thing we have not to provide for
          in spiritual matters, for the atonement is finished, the covenant
          ratified, and therefore every promise shall be fulfilled, and be "yea
          and amen" to us, not only in one to-morrow, but in fifty thousand
          to-morrows, if so many could run over our heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now just let us utter the words of the text again, very solemnly
          and earnestly. O young men in all your glory! O maidens in all your
          beauty! "Boast not yourselves of to-morrow." The worm may be at your
          cheeks very soon. O strong men, whose bones are full of marrow! O ye
          mighty men, whose nerves seem of brass, and your sinews of steel!
          "Boast not of to-morrow." "How, fir tree," for cedars have fallen ere
          now; and though you think yourselves great, God can pull you down.
          Above all, ye grey heads, "Boast not yourselves of to-morrow," with
          one foot hanging over the unfathomable gulf of eternity, and the other
          just tottering on the edge of time! I beseech you do not boast
          yourselves of to-morrow. In truth I do believe that grey heads are not
          less foolish on this point than very childhood. I remember reading a
          story of a man who wanted to buy his neighbour's farm next to him, and
          he went to him and asked him whether he would sell it. He said, "No; I
          will not;" so he went home, and said, "Never mind, Farmer So-and-so is
          an old man; when he is dead, I shall buy it." The man was seventy, and
          his neighbour sixty-eight; he thought the other would be sure to die
          before him. It is often so with men. They are making schemes that will
          only walk over their graves, when they will not feel them. The winds
          shall soon howl across the green sward that covers their tomb, but
          they shall not hear its wailing. Take care of the "to-days." Look not
          through the glass of futurity; but look at the things of to-day.
          "Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
          bring forth."
