        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2690)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, September 2nd, 1900,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>On a Thursday Evening, in the summer of 1858.</p>
        <p>
          NOTE: This edition of this sermon is taken from an earlier published
          edition of Spurgeon's 1858 message. The sermon that appears in The
          Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, vol.46, was edited and abbreviated
          somewhat. For edition we have restored the fuller text of the earlier
          published edition, while retaining a few of the editorial refinements
          of the Met Tab edition.

        <p>"My meditation of him shall be sweet." -- Psalm 104:34.</p>
        <p>
          DAVID, certainly, was not a melancholy man. Eminent as he was for his
          piety and for his religion, he was equally eminent for his joyfulness
          and gladness of heart. Read the verses that precede my text, "I will
          sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God
          while I have my being. My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be
          glad in the Lord." It has often been insinuated, if it has not been
          openly said, that the contemplation of divine things has a tendency to
          depress the spirits. Religion, many thoughtful persons have supposed,
          doth not become the young; it checks the ardor of their youthful
          blood. It may be very well for men with gray heads, who need something
          to comfort and solace them as they descend the hill of life into the
          grave; it may be well enough for those who are in poverty and deep
          trial; but that it is at all congruous with the condition of a
          healthy, able-bodied, successful and happy man, this is generally said
          to be out of the question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there is no greater falsehood. No man is so happy, but he would
          be happier still if he had religion. The man with a fullness of
          earthly pleasure, whose barns are full of store, and whose presses
          burst with new wine, would not lose any part of his happiness, had he
          the grace of God in his heart; rather, that joy would add sweetness to
          all his prosperity; it would strain off many of the bitter dregs from
          his cup; it would purify his heart, and freshen his taste for
          delights, and show him how to extract more honey from the honeycomb.
          Religion is a thing that can make the most melancholy joyful at the
          same time that it can make the joyous ones more joyful still. It can
          make the gloomy bright, as it gives the oil of joy in the place of
          mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
          Moreover, it can light up the face that is joyous with a heavenly
          gladness; it can make the eye sparkle with tenfold more brilliance;
          and happy as the man may be, he shall find that there is sweeter
          nectar than he has ever drunk before, if he comes to the fountain of
          atoning mercy; if he knows that his name is registered in the book of
          everlasting life. Temporal mercies will then have the charm of
          redemption to enhance them. They will be no longer to him as shadowy
          phantoms which dance for a transient hour in the sunbeam. He will
          account them more precious because they are given to him, as it were,
          in some codicils of the divine testament, which hath promise of the
          life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. While goodness
          and mercy follow him all the days of his life, he will stretch forth
          his grateful anticipations to the future, when he shall dwell in the
          house of the Lord forever. He will be able to say, as our Psalmist
          does, "I will sing unto the Lord. I will sing praise to my God while I
          have my being. My meditation of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking these few words as the motto of our sermon to-night, we shall
          speak, first, concerning a profitable exercise -- "meditation".
          Secondly, concerning a very precious subject: "my meditation of him";
          and, thirdly, concerning a very blessed result: -- "My meditation of
          him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>I. First, here is A VERY PROFITABLE EXERCISE -- meditation.</p>
        <p>
          Meditation is a word that more than half of you, I fear, do not know
          how to spell. You know how to repeat the letters of the word; but I
          mean to say, you can not spell it in the reality of life. You do not
          occupy yourselves with any meditation. What do many of you that are
          merchants know concerning this matter? You rise up in the morning,
          just in time to take your accustomed seat in the omnibus; you hasten
          to your counting-house for your letters, and there you continue all
          day long, for business when you are busy, or for gossip when business
          is dull, and at night you go home too tired and jaded for the
          wholesome recreation of your minds, Week by week, month by month, and
          year by year, it is still with you one everlasting grind, grind,
          grind. You have no time for meditation; and you reckon, perhaps, that
          if you were to set apart half an hour in the day, to ponder the
          weighty matters of eternity, it would be to you a clear loss of time.
          It is very wise of' you to economize your minutes, but I suppose if
          half an hour in a day could earn you a hundred pounds, you would not
          say you could not afford it, be cause you know how to estimate
          pecuniary profit. Now, if you really knew equally how to count the
          great profit, of meditation, you would deem it a positive gain to
          yourselves to spend some time therein, for meditation is most
          profitable to the spirit; it is an extremely healthful and excellent
          occupation. Far from being idle time, it is judicious employment of
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not imagine that the meditative man is necessarily lazy;
          contrariwise, he lays the best foundation for useful works. He is not
          the best student who reads the most books, but he who meditates the
          most upon them; he shall not learn most of divinity who hears the
          greatest number of sermons, but he who meditates the most devoutly
          upon what he does hear; nor shall he be so profound a scholar who
          takes down ponderous volumes one after the other, as he who, reading
          little by little, precept upon precept, and line upon line, digests
          what he learns, and assimilates each sentiment to his heart by
          meditation -- receiving the word first into his understanding, and
          afterwards receiving the spirit of the thing into his own soul. When
          he reads the letters with his eye it is merely mechanical, but that he
          may read them to his own heart he retires to meditate. Meditation is
          thus a very excellent employment; it is not the offspring of
          listlessness or lethargy but it is a satisfactory mode of employing
          time, and very remunerative to the spirit. Let us for a moment or two
          tell you some of its uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I think meditation furnishes the mind somewhat with rest. It is
          the couch of the soul. The time that a man spends in necessary rest,
          he never reckons to be wasted, because he is refreshing and renovating
          himself for further exertion. Meditation, then, is the rest of the
          spirit. "Oh," says one, "I must have rest. Here have I been, fagging
          and toiling incessantly for months; I must have a day's excursion; I
          must do this thing, and the other." Yes, and such recreation, in its
          proper place, is desirable; we ought to have seasons of innocent
          recreation; but, at the same time, if many of us knew how to spend a
          little time daily in the calm repose of contemplative retirement, we
          should find ourselves less exhausted by the wear and tear of our
          worldly duties, -- to meditate, would be to us a salutary recreation,
          and instead of running ourselves out of breath, and laboring till a
          respite is compulsory, we should spread our intervals of ease and
          refreshing over the whole year, and secure a small portion every day,
          by turning aside from the bustling crowd to meditate upon whatever
          subject we wish to occupy the most honorable place in our mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as a change of posture relieves the weariness of the body, a
          change of thoughts will prevent your spirits becoming languid. Sit
          down in a silent chamber at eventide, throw the window up, and look at
          God's bright stars, and count those eyes of heaven; or, if you like it
          better, pause in the noon-tide heat, and look down upon the busy crowd
          in the streets, and count the men like so many ants, upon the ant-hill
          of this world; or, if you care not to look about you, sit down and
          look within yourself; count the pulses of your own heart, and examine
          the motions of your own breast. At times, 'tis well to muse upon
          heaven; or if thou art a man who lovest to revel in the prophetic
          future, turn over the mystic page, and study the sacred visions
          recorded in the Book of Daniel, or the Book of Revelation. As thou
          dost enter into these hallowed intricacies, and dost meditate upon
          these impressive symbols, thou wilt rise up from thy study mightily
          refreshed. You will find it like a couch to your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will return to your business in a better spirit; you may expect
          (other things being equal) to earn more that day, than you ever earned
          before, by the painful system of uninterrupted drudgery; for the
          diversion of thought will rest, string up, and brace your nerves, and
          enable you to do more work, and do it better too. Meditation is the
          couch of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, meditation is the machine in which the raw material of
          knowledge is converted to the best uses. Let me compare it to a
          wine-press. By reading, and research, and study we gather the grapes;
          but it is by meditation we press out the juice of those grapes, and
          obtain the wine. How is it that many men who read very much know very
          little? What a host of pedantic scholars we have, who can recount book
          after book, from old Hesiod to the last volume in Ward's catalogue,
          but they know little or nothing after all. The reason is, they read
          tome upon tome, and stow away knowledge with lumbering confusion
          inside their heads, till they have laid so much weight on their brain
          that it can not work. Instead of putting facts into the press of
          meditation, and fermenting them till they can draw out inferences,
          they leave them to rot and perish. They extract none of the sweet
          juice of wisdom from the precious fruits of the vine-tree. A man who
          reads only a tenth part as much, but who takes the grapes of Eschol
          that he gathers, and squeezes them by meditation, will learn more in a
          week than your pedant will in a year, because he muses on what he
          reads. I like, when I have read a book for about half an hour, to walk
          awhile, and think it over. I shut up the volume, and say, "Now, Mr.
          Author, you have made your speech, let me think over what you have
          said. A little meditation will enable me to distinguish between what I
          knew before and the fresh subject you communicate to me -- between
          your facts and your opinions -- between your arguments and those I
          should make from the same premises. Animals, after they have eaten,
          lie down and ruminate; they first crop the grass, and afterwards
          digest it. So meditation is the rumination of the soul; thereby we get
          that nutriment which feeds and supports the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          When thou hast gathered flowers in the field or garden, arrange them
          and bind them together with the string of memory; but take heed that
          thou dost put them into the water of meditation, else they will soon
          fade, and be fit only for the dunghill. When thou hast gathered pearls
          from the sea, recollect that thou wilt have gathered with them many
          worthless shells, and much mud; count them over, therefore, and sort
          them in thy memory; keep what are worth preserving, and even then thou
          must open the oyster to extract the pearl, and polish it to make it
          appear more beautiful. Thou mayest not string it in the necklace of
          thy minds until it has been rubbed and garnished by meditation. Thus,
          we need meditation to make use of what we have discovered. As it is
          the rest of the soul, so it is, at the same time, the means of making
          the best use of what the soul has acquired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, meditation is to the soul what oil was to the body of the
          wrestlers. When those old athletes went out to wrestle, they always
          took care before they went to oil themselves well -- to make their
          joints supple and fit for labor. Now, meditation makes the soul supple
          -- makes it so that it can use things when they come into the mind.
          Who are the men that can go into a controversy and get the mastery?
          Why, the men who meditate when they are alone. Who are the men that
          can preach? Not those who gad about and never commune with their own
          hearts alone; but those who think earnestly, as well when no one is
          near them as when there is a crowd around them. Who are the authors
          who write your books, and keep up the constant supply of literature?
          They are meditative men. They keep their bones supple and their limbs
          fit for exercise by continually bathing themselves in the oil of
          meditation. How important, therefore, is meditation as a mental
          exercise, to have our minds in constant readiness for any service!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus pointed out to you that meditation is in itself useful to
          every man. But you did not come here to listen to a merely moral
          essay; you came to hear something about the Gospel of God; and what I
          have said already is but an introduction to what I have to say
          concerning the great necessity of meditation in religion. As
          meditation is good for the mind, even upon worldly topics and natural
          science, much more is it useful when we come to spiritual learning.
          The best and most saintly of men have been men of meditation. Isaac
          went out into the fields at eventide to meditate. David says, "As for
          me, I will meditate on thy statutes." Paul, who meditated continually,
          says to Timothy, "Give thyself to meditation." To the Christian
          meditation is most essential. I should almost question the being of a
          Christian, and I should positively deny his well-being who lived
          without habitual meditation. Meditation and prayer are twin sisters,
          and both of them appear to me equally necessary to a Christian life. I
          think meditation must exist where there is prayer, and prayer would be
          sure to exist where there is meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brethren, there is nothing more wanting to make Christians grow in
          grace now-a-days than meditation. Most of you are painfully negligent
          in this matter. You remind me of a sermon that one of my quaint old
          friends in the country once preached from that text -- "The slothful
          man roasteth not that which he took in hunting." He told us that many
          people who would hunt for a sermon, were too lazy to roast it by
          meditation. They knew not how to put the jack of memory through it,
          and then to twist it round by meditation before the fire of piety, and
          so to cook it and make it fit for your soul's food. So it is with many
          of you after you have caught the sermon: you allow it to run away. How
          often do you, through lack of meditation, miss the entire purpose for
          which the sermon was designed. Unless ye meditate upon the truths we
          declare unto you, ye will gather little sweetness, ye will acquire
          little profit, and, certainly, ye will be in no wise established
          therein to your edification. Can you get the honey from the comb until
          you squeeze it! You may be refreshed by a few words while you listen
          to the sermon, but it is the meditation afterwards which extracts the
          honey, and gets the best and most luscious savor therefrom.
          Meditation, my friends, is a part of the life-blood of every true
          Christian, and we ought to abound therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me tell you that there ought to be special times for meditation. I
          think every man should set apart a portion of time every day for this
          gracious exercise. But, then, again I am met with an apology; you
          assure me that you have so much to do you cannot afford it. I
          generally treat with lightness the excuses of those who cannot afford
          time for obvious duties. If you have got no time you should make it.
          Let us see now, What time do you get up in the morning? Could you not
          manage to get up a quarter of an hour earlier? Well, yes! How long do
          you take for your dinner? So long. Then you read some trashy
          publication, possibly. Well, why could you not spend that time in
          tranquil communion with your own soul ? The Christian will ever be in
          a lean state if he has no time for sacred musings before his God.
          Those men who know most of God are such as meditate most upon him.
          Those who realize most experimentally the doctrines of grace, are
          those who meditate and soar beyond the reach of all sublunary things.
          I think we shall never have much advancement in our churches until the
          members thereof begin to accept habitually the counsel, "Come, my
          people, enter into thy chambers;" or that other, "Commune with your
          own heart in your chamber, and be still." Till the din and noise of
          business somewhat abate, and we give ourselves to calmer thought, and
          in the solemn silence of the mind find at once our heaven and our God,
          we must still expect to have regiments of dwarfs, and only here and
          there a giant. Giant minds can not be nourished by casual hearing;
          gigantic souls must have meditation to support them. Would ye be
          strong? Would ye be mighty? Would ye be valiant for the Lord, and
          useful in his cause? Take care that ye follow the occupation of the
          Psalmist, David, and meditate. This is a happy occupation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, let us consider A VERY PRECIOUS SUBJECT: "My
          meditation of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian! thou needest no greater inducement to excite thee than the
          subject here proposed: "My meditation of him shall be sweet." Whom
          does that word "him" mean? I suppose it may refer to all the three
          persons of the glorious Trinity? My meditation upon Jehovah shall be
          sweet! And, verily, if you set down to meditate upon God the Father,
          and reflect on his sovereign, immutable, unchangeable love towards his
          elect people -- if you think of God the Father as the great author and
          originator of the plan of salvation -- if you think of him as the
          mighty being who has said that by two immutable things, wherein it is
          impossible for him to lie, he hath given us strong consolation who
          have fled for refuge to Christ Jesus -- if you look to him as the
          giver of his only-begotten Son, and who, for the sake of that Son, his
          best gift, will, with him also, freely give us all things -- if you
          consider him as having ratified the covenant, and pledged himself
          ultimately to complete all its stipulations, in the ingathering of
          every chosen ransomed soul, you will perceive that there is enough to
          engross your meditation for ever, even were your attention limited to
          the manner of the Father's love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, if you choose to do so, you may meditate upon God the Holy Spirit.
          Consider his marvellous operations on your own heart -- how he
          quickened it when you were dead in trespasses and sins -- how he
          brought you nigh to Jesus when you were a lost sheep, wandering far
          from the fold -- how he called you with such a mighty efficacy that
          you could not resist his voice -- how he drew you with the cords of
          love. If you think how often he has helped you in the hour of peril --
          how frequently he has comforted you with the promise in times of
          distress and trouble; and, if you think that, like holy oil, he will
          always supply your lamp, and until life's last hour he will always
          replenish you with his influences, proving himself still your teacher
          and your guide till you get up yonder, where you shall see your
          Saviour face to face, in the blessed presence of the Father, and of
          the Son and of the Holy Ghost -- in such revelation you might find a
          vast and infinite subject for your meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to-night, I prefer rather to confine this word "him" to the person
          of our adorable Saviour. "My meditation of him shall be sweet." Ah! if
          it be possible that the meditation upon one person of the Trinity can
          excel the meditation upon another, it is meditation upon Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>"Till God in human flesh I see,</p>
        <p>My thoughts no Comfort find;</p>
        <p>The holy, just and sacred three</p>
        <p>Are terrors to my mind.</p>
        <p>"But if Immanuel's face appear,</p>
        <p>My hope, my joy begins;</p>
        <p>His name forbids my slavish fear,</p>
        <p>His grace forgives my sins."</p>
        <p>
          Thou precious Jesus! what can be a sweeter theme for me, than to think
          of thine exalted being -- to conceive of thee as the Son of God, who
          with the golden compasses struck out a circle from space, and
          fashioned this round world? To think of thee as the God who holds this
          mighty orb upon thy shoulders, and art the King of Glory, before whom
          angels bow with modest homage; and yet to consider thee as likewise
          "bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh" --
        </p>
        <p>"In ties of blood with sinners one;"</p>
        <p>
          to conceive of thee as the Son of Mary, born of a Virgin, wearing
          flesh like men, clothed in garments of humanity like mortals of our
          feeble race; to picture thee in all thy suffering life, in all the
          anguish of thy death; to trace thee in all thy passion; to view thee
          in the agony of Gethsemane, enduring the bloody sweat, the sore
          amazement; and then to follow thee to the pavement, and thence up the
          steep side of Calvary, bearing the cross, braving the shame, when thy
          soul was made an offering for my sins, when thou didst die the
          reconciling death 'midst horrors still to all but God unknown. Verily,
          here is a meditation for my soul, which must be "sweet" for ever. I
          might begin, like the Psalmist David, and say, "My heart is inditing
          of a good matter; it bubbleth up, while I speak of things which I have
          made touching the king; my tongue is as the pen of a ready writer."
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ! "My meditation of him shall be sweet." Consider Christ in any
          way you please, and your meditation of him will be sweet. Jesus may be
          compared to some of those lenses you have seen, which you may take up
          and hold one way, and you see one light, and another way, and you see
          another light, and whichever way you turn them you will always see
          some precious sparkling of light, and some new colors starting up to
          your view. Ah! take Jesus for your theme; sit down and consider him;
          think of his relation to your own soul, and you will never get to the
          end of that one subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of his eternal relationship with you; recollect that the saints
          of Jesus were from condemnation free, in union with the Lamb, before
          the world was made. Think of your everlasting union with the person of
          Jehovah Jesus before this planet was sent rolling through space, and
          how your guilty soul was accounted spotless and clean, even before you
          fell; and after that dire lapse, before you were restored,
          justification was imputed to you in the person of Jesus Christ. Think
          of your known and manifest relationship to him since you have been
          called by his grace. Think how he has become your brother; how his
          heart has beaten in sympathy with yours; how he has kissed you with
          the kisses of his love, and his love has been to you sweeter than
          wine. Look back upon some happy, sunny spots in your history, where
          Jesus has whispered, "I am yours," and you have said, "My beloved is
          mine." Think of some choice moments, when an angel has stooped from
          heaven, and taken you up on his wings, and carried you aloft, to sit
          in heavenly places where Jesus sits, that you might commune with him.
          Or think, if it please you, of some pensive moments, when you have had
          what Paul sets so much store by -- fellowship with Christ in his
          sufferings. Think of seasons when the sweat has rolled from your brow,
          almost as it did from that of Jesus -- yet not the sweat of blood --
          when you have knelt down, and felt that you could die with Christ,
          even as you had risen with him. And then, when you have exhausted that
          portion of the subject, think of your relationship in Christ, which is
          to be developed in heaven. Imagine the hour to have come when ye shall
          --
        </p>
        <p>"greet the blood-besprinkled band,</p>
        <p>on the eternal shore,"</p>
        <p>and for ever range the --</p>
        <p>"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,</p>
        <p>Array'd in living green."</p>
        <p>
          Picture to your mind that moment when Jesus Christ shall salute you as
          "more than a conqueror," and put a pearly crown upon your head, more
          glittering than stars. And think of that transporting hour, when you
          will take that crown from off your own brow, and climbing the steps of
          Jesus' throne, you shall put it on his head, and crown him once more
          Lord of your soul, as well as "Lord of all." Ah! if you come and tell
          me you have no subject for meditation, I will answer, Surely, you have
          not tried to meditate; for "My meditation of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose you have done thinking of him as he is related to you;
          consider him next as he is related to the wide world. Recollect that
          Jesus Christ says he came into the world to save the world, and
          undoubtedly he will one day save the world, for he who redeemed it by
          price and by power will restore it and renew it from the effects of
          the fall. Oh! think of Jesus in this relationship as the repairer of
          the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in. He will come again to
          our earth one day; and when he comes he will find this world defaced
          still with the old curse upon it -- the primeval curse of Eden. He
          will find plague, and pestilence, and war here still; but when he
          comes, he shall bid men "beat their swords into plowshares, and their
          spears into pruning-hooks;" war shall be obliterated from among the
          sciences; he shall speak the word, and there shall be a company that
          will publish it. "The knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, as
          the waters cover the sea." Jesus Christ shall come! Christians! be ye
          waiting for the second coming of your Lord Jesus Christ! and whilst ye
          wait, meditate upon that coming. Think, O my soul, of that august day,
          when thou shalt see him with all his pompous train, coming to call the
          world to judgment, and to avenge himself upon his enemies. Think of
          all his triumphs when Satan shall be bound, and death shall be
          crushed, and hell shall be conquered, and when he shall be saluted as
          the universal Monarch, "Lord over all, blessed for ever. Amen." "My
          meditation of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! Christian! you are not afraid to be alone a little while now, for
          want of subjects of meditation! Some persons say they cannot bear to
          be an hour in solitude; they have got nothing to do, nothing to think
          about. No Christian will ever talk so, surely; for if I can but give
          him one word to think of -- Christ -- let him spell that over for
          ever; let me give him the word Jesus, and only let him try to think it
          over, and he shall find that an hour is nought, and that eternity is
          not half enough to utter our glorious Saviour's praise. Yea, beloved,
          I believe when we get to heaven we shall want no subject for
          meditation there, except Jesus Christ. I know there are some divines
          and learned philosophers who have been telling us that when we go to
          heaven we shall occupy our time in flying from star to star, and from
          one planet to another; that we shall go and see Jupiter, and Mercury,
          and Venus, and all the host of celestial bodies. We shall behold all
          the wonders of creation; we shall explore the depths of science, as
          they tell us, and there are no limits to the mysteries we shall
          understand. My reply to people who imagine thus of heaven, is, that I
          have no objection it should be so, if it will afford them any
          pleasure; I hope you will have, and I know my Father will let you
          have, whatsoever will make you happy. But, while you are viewing
          stars, I will sit down and look at Jesus; and if you told me you had
          seen the inhabitants of Saturn and Venus, and the man in the moon, I
          would say, Ah! yes --
        </p>
        <p>"But in His looks a wonder stands,</p>
        <p>The noblest glory of God's hands;</p>
        <p>God in the person of His Son</p>
        <p>Hath all His mightiest works outdone."</p>
        <p>
          But you will say, You win become tired, surely, of looking at him. No,
          I should reply; I have been looking at but one of his hands, and I
          have not yet thoroughly examined the hole where one of the nails went
          in; and when I have lived ten thousand years more I will take his
          other hand, and sit down and look at each gaping wound, and then I may
          descend to his side and his feet: --
        </p>
        <p>"Millions of years my wond'ring eyes</p>
        <p>Shall o'er his beauties rove,</p>
        <p>And endless ages I'll adore</p>
        <p>The wonders of His love."</p>
        <p>
          You may go flitting about as far as you like; I will sit there, and
          look at the God in human flesh, for I believe that I shad learn more
          of God and more of his works in the person of Jesus than you could
          with all the advantage of traveling on wings of light, though you
          should have the most elevated imaginations and the most gigantic
          intellects to help you in your search. Brethren, our meditation of
          Christ will be sweet. There will be little else we shall want of
          heaven besides Jesus Christ. He will be our bread, our food, our
          beauty, and our glorious dress. The atmosphere of heaven will be
          Christ; everything in heaven will be Christ-like: yea Christ is the
          heaven of his people. To be in Christ and to be with Christ is the
          essence of heaven: --
        </p>
        <p>"Not all the harps above</p>
        <p>Can make a heavenly place,</p>
        <p>Should Christ His residence remove</p>
        <p>Or but conceal His Face."</p>
        <p>
          Here is the object of our meditation. Our meditation of him shall be
          sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Let me proceed to point out a blessed result -- "Our meditation
          of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          This depends upon the character very much. Ah! I know some persons
          come into chapel, who are very glad when they hear the minister
          pronounce the benediction, and dismiss the assembly; they are very
          glad when all is over, and they would rather hear the parting doxology
          than the text. As for a meditation on Christ, instead of saying it is
          sweet, they would say, It is precious dry. If they happen to hear an
          anecdote or a tale, they do not mind remembering that; but a
          meditation which should be entirely on Christ, would be dry enough to
          them, and they would be glad to hear it brought to a close. Ah! that
          is because of the taste you have in your mouth. There is something
          wrong about your palate. You know, when we have been taking some kind
          of medicine, and our mouth has been impregnated with a strong flavor,
          whatever we eat acquires that taste. So it is with you. You have got
          your mouth out of taste with some of the world's poor dainties; you
          have some of the powder of the apples of Sodom hanging on your lips,
          that spoils the glorious flavor of your meditation on Jesus. In fact,
          it prevents your meditating on Christ at all. It is only a hearing of
          the meditation with your ears, not a receiving it with your hearts.
          But here the Psalmist says, "My meditation of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          What a mercy, dear friends, that there is something sweet in this
          world for us! We need it. For I am sure, as for most other things in
          the world, they are very, very bitter. There is little here that seems
          sweet at first, but what has some bitter flavor afterward; and there
          are too many things that are actually bitter, and void of any relish.
          Go through the great laboratory of this world and how many will be the
          cases that you will see marked bitter! There are perhaps more of aloes
          put in our Cup than of any other ingredient. We have to take a great
          quantity of bitters in the course of our lives. What a mercy then it
          is, that there is one thing that is sweet! "My meditation of him shall
          be sweet; so sweet, beloved, that all the other bitters are quite
          swallowed up in its sweetness. Have I not seen the widow, when her
          husband has departed, and he who was her strength, the stay of her
          life and her sustenance, has been laid in the grave -- have I not seen
          her hold up her hands, and say, "Ah! though he is gone, still my Maker
          is my husband; 'The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;' blessed
          be his name!" What was the reason of her patient submission? Because
          she had a sweet meditation to neutralize the bitterness of her
          reflections. And do I not remember, even now, seeing a man, whose
          property had been washed away by the tide, and his lands swallowed up,
          and become quicksands, instead of being any longer profitable to him?
          Beggared and bankrupt, with streaming eyes, he held up his hands, and
          repeated Habbakuk's words, "Though the fig-tree shall not blossom,
          &amp;c., &amp;c., yet will I rejoice in the Lord. I will joy in the
          God of my salvation. "Was it not because his meditation on Christ was
          so sweet that it absorbed the bitterness of his trouble? And oh! how
          many, when they have come to the dark waters of death, have found that
          surely their bitterness was past, for they perceived that death was
          swallowed up in victory, through their meditation upon Jesus Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if any of you have come here with your mouths out of taste,
          through affliction and trouble, if you have been saying with Jeremiah,
          "Thou has filled my mouth with gravel stones and made me drunken with
          worm-wood" -- if so, take a little of his choice cordial; I assure you
          it is sweet; Lacrymae Christi, as it is called. If thou wilt take
          these tears of Jesus and put them in thy mouth, they will take away
          all the unpleasant flavor. Or again, I bid you take this meditation
          upon Christ, as a piece of scented stuff that was perfumed in heaven.
          It matters not what thou hast in thy house; this shall make it
          redolent of Paradise -- shall make it smell like those breezes that
          once blew through Eden's garden, wafting the odor of flowers. Ah!
          there is nothing that can so console your spirits, and relieve all
          your distresses and troubles, as the feeling that now you can meditate
          on the person of Jesus Christ. "My meditation of him shall be sweet."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my dear hearers, shall I send you away without asking you whether
          you have ever had such a meditation upon out Lord and Saviour Jesus
          Christ? I do not like to preach a sermon, without pressing it home to
          the conscience of my hearers. I never like to bring you out a sword
          and show it you, and say, "There is a sword, and it is sharp;" I
          always like to make you feel that it is sharp, by cutting you with it.
          Would to God the sword of the Spirit might penetrate many of your
          hearts now! When I see so many gathered together even on a week-day, I
          am astonished. But wherefore have ye come, my brethren? What went ye
          out for to see? a reed shaken with the wind? What have ye come out for
          to see? a prophet? Nay, but I say that you have come to see something
          more than a prophet. You have come to see and hear somewhat of Jesus
          Christ, our Saviour and our Lord. How many of you meditate on Christ?
          Christian men and women, do you not live below your privileges, many
          of you? Are you not living without having choice moments of communion
          with your Jesus? Methinks, if you had a free pass to heavens palace,
          you would use it very often; if you might go there and hold communion
          with some person whom you dearly loved, you would often be found
          there. But here is your Jesus, the king of heaven, and he gives you
          that which can open the gates of heaven and let you in to hold company
          with him, and yet you live without meditating upon his work,
          meditating upon his person, meditating upon his offices, and
          meditating upon his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian men and women! I say to you, is it not time we should begin
          to live nearer to God ? What is to become of our churches? I do not
          know what to think of Christendom at large. As I travel through the
          country and go here and there, I see the churches in a most awfully
          dwindled state. True, the Gospel is preached in most; but it is
          preached as it might be by bumble-bees in pitchers -- always the same
          monotonous sound, and no good is done. I fear that the fault lies in
          the pews, as well as in the pulpit. If hearers are meditative,
          preachers must be meditative. It is very true that water does not run
          up-hill; but when you begin to meditate and pray over the word, your
          ministers will see that you have gone beyond them, and they will set
          to and meditate themselves, and give you the Gospel just as it comes
          fresh from their hearts, food for people's souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for the rest of you -- you who have never meditated on Jesus
          Christ -- what do you think shall become of you when your bitterness
          shall be in your mouth? When you taste death, how do you hope to
          destroy its ill flavor? Yet "that last, that bitter cup which mortal
          man can taste" is but a dire presentiment. When you have to drink that
          gall in hell for ever -- when the cup of torments which Jesus did not
          drain for you will hate to be drained by yourself -- what will you do
          then? The Christian can go to heaven, because Christ has drunk
          destruction dry for him; but the ungodly and unconverted man will have
          to drink the dregs of the wine of Gomorrah. What will you do then? The
          first drops are bad enough, when you sip here the drops of remorse on
          account of sin; but that future cup in hell -- that terrific mixture
          which God deals out to the lost in the pit -- what will you do when
          you have to drink that? when your meditation will be, that you
          rejected Jesus, that you despised his Gospel, that you scoffed at his
          word? What will you do in that dread extremity? Many of you business
          men! will your ledger serve you with a sweet meditation in hell?
          Lawyer will it be sweet for you to meditate on your deeds when you go
          there? Laboring man! will it be a sweet meditation to thee, to think
          that thy wages were spent in drunkenness, or thy Sabbath profaned, and
          thy duties neglected? And thou, professor! will it be a sweet
          meditation to sit down and think of thine hypocrisy? And ah! ye
          carnally-minded men, who are indulging the flesh, and pampering the
          appetite, and not serving the Lord, "whose God is your belly, and
          whose glory is in your shame," will your career furnish a sweet
          meditation to you at last?
        </p>
        <p>
          Be assured of this: your sins must be your meditation, then, if Christ
          is not your meditation now. May there be great searchings of heart
          this night! How often do your convictions disperse like the smoke from
          the chimney, or the chaff from the winnower's hand; they soon vanish.
          It will not profit you to live at this rate -- hearing sermons and
          forgetting them. Take heed to the voice of warning, lest God should
          say, "He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall be
          suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy." O wicked men! wicked
          men! one word to you, all of you who know not God, and ye shall go. I
          will give you a subject for your meditation to-night. It shall be a
          parable. A certain tyrant sent for one of his subjects, and said to
          him, "What is your employment?" He said, "I am a blacksmith." "Go
          home," said he, "and make me a chain of such a length" He went home;
          it occupied him several months, and he had no wages all the while he
          was making the chain, only the trouble and the pains of making it.
          Then he brought it to the monarch, and he said, "Go and make it twice
          as long." He gave him nothing to do it with, but sent him away. Again
          he worked on, and made it twice as long. He brought it up again, and
          the monarch said, "Go and make it longer still." Each time he brought
          it, there was nothing but the command to make it longer still. And
          when he brought it up at last, the monarch said, "Take it, bind him
          hand and foot with it, and cast him into a furnace of fire." There
          were his wages for making the chain. Here is a meditation for you
          to-night, ye servants of the devil! Your master the devil is telling
          you to make a chain. Some of you have been fifty years welding the
          links of the chain; and he says, "Go and make it longer still. Next
          Sunday morning you will open that shop of yours, and put another link
          on; next Saturday night you will be drunk, and put another link on;
          next Monday you win do a dishonest action, and so you will keep on
          making fresh links to this chain; and when you have lived twenty more
          years, the devil will say, "More links on still!" And then, at last,
          it will be, "Take him, and bind him hand and foot, and cast him into a
          furnace of fire." "For the wages of sin is death." There is a subject
          for your meditation. I do not think it will be sweet; but if God makes
          it profitable, it will do good. You must have strong medicines
          sometimes, when the disease is bad. God apply it to your hearts!
          Amen.<br />
