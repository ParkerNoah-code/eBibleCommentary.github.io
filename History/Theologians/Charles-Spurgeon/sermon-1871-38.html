        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1005)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, August 13th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are
          her house. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the
          rooks for the conies." -- Psalm 104:17-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS PSALM IS ALL through a song of nature, the adoration of God in
          the great outward temple of the universe. Some in these modern times
          have thought it to be a mark of high spirituality never to observe
          nature; and I remember sorrowfully reading the expressions of a godly
          person, who, in sailing down one of the most famous rivers in the
          world, closed his eyes, lest the picturesque beauties of the scene
          should divert his mind from scriptural topics. This may be regarded by
          some as profound spirituality; to me it seems to savor of absurdity.
          There may be persons who think they have grown in grace when they have
          attained to this; it seems to me that they are growing out of their
          senses. To despise the creating work of God, what is it but, in a
          measure, to despise God himself? "Whoso mocketh the poor despiseth his
          Maker." To despise the Maker, then, is evidently a sin; to think
          little of God under the aspect of the Creator is a crime. We should
          none of us think it a great honor to ourselves if our friends
          considered our productions to be unworthy of admiration, and rather
          injurious to their minds than improving. If when they passed our
          workmanship they turned their eyes away, lest they should suffer
          injury by looking at it, we should not regard them as very respectful
          to ourselves; surely the despising of that which is made is somewhat
          akin to the despising of the Maker himself. David tells us that "The
          Lord shall rejoice in his works." If he rejoices in what he has made,
          shall not those who have communion with him rejoice in his works also?
          "The works of the Lord are great, sought out of them that have
          pleasure therein." Despise not the work, lest thou despise the worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prejudice against the beauties of the material universe reminds
          me of the lingering love to Judaism, which acted like a spell upon
          Peter of old. When the sheet knit at the four corners descended before
          him, and the voice said, "Rise, Peter; kill, and eat," he replied that
          he had not eaten anything that was common or unclean. He needed that
          the voice should speak to him from heaven again and again before he
          would fully learn the lesson, "What God hath cleansed that call not
          thou common." The Jew thinks this and that unclean, though Christ has
          cleansed it; and certain Christians appear to regard nature as
          unclean. The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, the glorious
          sunrise and sunset, the snow-clad Alps, the ancient forests, the
          mysterious glaciers, the boundless ocean, God hath cleansed them: call
          them not common. Here on this earth is Calvary where the Savior died,
          and by his sacrifice, offered not within walls and roofs, he made this
          outer world a temple wherein everything doth speak of God's glory. If
          thou be unclean, all things will be unclean to thee; but if thou hast
          washed thy robe and made it white in the blood of the Lamb, and if the
          Holy Spirit hath overshadowed thee, then this world is but a nether
          heaven; it is but the lower chamber of which the upper story glows
          with the full splendor of God, where angels see him face to face, and
          this lower story is not without glory, for in the person of Christ
          Jesus we have seen God, and have communion and fellowship with him
          even now.
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears to me that those who would forbear the study of nature, or
          shun the observation of its beauties, are conscious of the weakness of
          their own spirituality. When the hermits and monks shut themselves out
          from the temptations of life, foolish persons said, "These are strong
          in grace." Not so, they were so weak in grace that they were afraid to
          have their graces tried. They ran away from the battle like the
          cowards they were, and shut themselves up because they knew their
          swords were not of the true Jerusalem metal, and they were not men who
          could resist valiantly. Monasticism was the confession of a weakness
          which they endeavored to cover with the vain show of humility, and the
          presence of superior sanctity. If my graces are strong, I can look
          upon the outward world, and draw forth its good without feeling its
          evil, if evil there be; but if my religion is mainly fictitious, then
          hypocrisy dictates to me the affectation of unusual spirituality, or
          at any rate I have not grace enough to rise from a contemplation of
          the works of God to a nearer fellowship with God himself. It cannot be
          that nature of itself debases me, or diverts me from God; I ought to
          suspect a deficiency in my self when I find that the Creator's
          handiworks have not a good effect upon my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, rest assured brethren, that he who wrote the Bible, the
          second and clearest revelation of his divine mind, wrote also the
          first book, the book of nature; and who are we that we should derogate
          from the worth of the first because we esteem the second. Milton's
          "Paradise Regained" is certainly inferior to his "Paradise Lost," but
          the Eternal God has no inferior productions, all his works are
          master-pieces. There is no quarrel between nature and revelation,
          fools only think so: to wise men the one illustrates and establishes
          the other. Walking in the fields at eventide, as Isaac did, I see in
          the ripening harvest the same God of whom I read in the word that he
          covenanted that seed-time and harvest should not cease. Surveying the
          midnight skies, I remember him who, while he calls the stars by their
          names, also bindeth up the broken in heart. Who will may neglect the
          volume of creation, or the volume of revelation, I shall delight in
          them both as long as I live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us, then, follow David this morning, for when he wrote our text,
          he evidently traveled amongst the works of God, admiring and adoring.
          Let us go with him, and see if there be not something to be learned
          among the birds and storks, the wild goats and the conies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Our first observation from our text shall be this: FOR EACH PLACE
          GOD HAS PREPARED A SUITABLE FORM OF LIFE. For the fir trees, the
          stork; for the high hills, the wild goat, or steinbock; for the rocks,
          the conies, or rabbits. Almost every part of God's world was meant to
          be the abode of some creature or another. On earth, a countless
          company wait upon the Lord for meat; and as for the sea, it contains
          "creeping things innumerable, both small and great beasts." Among the
          trees which shade the brooks, the birds are singing; in the tall
          sombre pine, the silent storks are building their nests; on the lofty
          crags, virgin as yet to human foot, the chamois leaps from ledge to
          ledge; and away, where human voice was never heard, the marmot, the
          mouse, and the rabbit (whichever creature the Hebrew may mean) find
          their dwelling-place among the rocks. The teaching of this fact is
          clear. We shall find that for all parts of the spiritual universe God
          has provided suitable forms of divine life. Think out that thought a
          moment. Each age has its saints. The first age had its holy men, who
          walked with God: and when the golden age had gone, and men everywhere
          had polluted themselves, God had his Noah. In after days, when men had
          again multiplied upon the face of the earth, and sin abounded, there
          was Job in the land of Uz, and Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob dwelling
          in tents in the land which had been given to them by promise. On
          whatever period of the world's history you choose to place your finger
          you may rest assured that as God is there, so is there also some form
          of the divine life extant; some of God's twice born creatures are to
          be found even in the most barren ages. If you come to a period like
          that of Ahab, when a lonely Elijah bitterly complains, "I, only I am
          left, and they seek my life to destroy it," you shall hear a still
          small voice that saith, "Yet have I reserved unto myself seven
          thousand men that have not bowed the knee to Baal." God has still his
          elect remnant in the most wicked times to whom he has given a banner,
          because of the truth. When the light was almost gone from Israel, and
          formalism had eclipsed the sun of Judaism, there were still a Simeon
          and an Anna waiting for the coming of the Messiah. Times of fearful
          persecution, when to mention the name of Christ was to sentence
          yourself to death, have not been devoid of saints, but rather in the
          hottest times of oppression God has brought forth heroes equal to the
          emergency. The fiercer the trial the stronger the men. The church of
          God, like the fabled Salamander, has lived and flourished amid the
          flames, and has seemed to feed upon the flames that threatened to
          devour her. As on the crags where it appears impossible for life to
          exist God places wild goats, so on the high crags of persecution he
          upholds men whose feet are like hind's feet, and who glory as they
          tread upon their high places. Oppression brings out the heavenly
          manhood of the saints and lets the devil see what strength God can put
          into the weakness of man. There have been times of heresy too -- such
          as the age of rampant Arianism, but saints have outlived it. God has
          provided for such an emergency brave defenders of the faith. What a
          man was Athanasius, when standing upright and alone he said, "I know
          that Jesus Christ is very God, and if all the world believe the
          contrary, I, Athanasius, stand against the world." Sardis may have a
          name to live and be dead, but the Lord saith, "thou hast a few names
          even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall
          walk with me in white, for they are worthy." Is not this an
          encouraging truth, for as it has been in the past it is in the
          present, and it will be in the future. Do not give way to gloomy
          forebodings as to the church's future welfare. Whine not with those
          who deplore these evil days, and prognosticate overwhelming ills. We
          are told that we are passing through a crisis, but I recollect that it
          was a crisis twenty years ago, and our grandsires could tell us of a
          crisis every year of the last fifty. The fact is there is no such
          crisis as is talked of. The crisis is past, for Christ said, "Now; is
          the crisis of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast
          out." When Jesus went to Golgotha and bled and died, the crisis of the
          church and of the world was over; the victory of truth and of Christ
          was secured beyond all hazard. Even if times should darken and the
          night should grow thicker and thicker, rest assured that he who has
          the conies for the rocks, and goats for the high hills, and finds for
          the forests the stork, will find for every age a suitable form of
          Christian life that shall bring glory to his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it has been in every age, so is it in every position in which men
          are found. Go into all classes of society, and you shall find that the
          Christian religion, if received in truth, is equally well adapted for
          all conditions. Here and there upon the throne have been found those
          that have feared God, and have gone from a crown on earth to a crown
          in heaven. There can be no better qualification for swaying a kingdom
          than obedience to the King of kings. Go straight down from the palace
          to the poor-house, little enough of comfort there, but the richest
          consolation which can be found for the meanest pauper, will be brought
          by that hand which was nailed to the tree. He it is that can console
          the sorrows of poverty as well as sanctify the risks of wealth. Go ye
          where ye will amongst the busy, whose cares buzz around them, and you
          shall find no relief for aching heads like a contemplation of the love
          of Christ: or go amongst those who have leisure, and spend it in
          solitude, no meditation can be so sweet to while away their hours as
          the meditation which springs out of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Glory
          be to God, no man need say, "My trade does not permit me to be a
          Christian;" if it be so, you have no business to follow that trade,
          for no lawful calling is without its saint. Up there among the
          precipices the wild goat finds safe footing, and so amid dignity and
          honor saints can survive, and in the dark rock-rifts of this
          sin-smitten city, as conies live among the rocks, so Christian men are
          useful and happy. Where the believer is persecuted on every side, he
          shall not be forsaken, and where, through the example of the wicked,
          his heart is grieved, he shall be preserved like righteous Lot. As God
          maintains life in every region, so doth he maintain spiritual life in
          every position and every calling. Have comfort in this you who are
          placed in circumstances unfavourable to grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, you shall find spiritual life in every church. I know it is the
          notion of the bigot, that all the truly godly people belong to the
          denomination which he adorns. Orthodoxy is my doxy; heterodoxy is
          anybody else's doxy who does not agree with me. All the good people go
          to little Bethel, and nowhere else: they all worship at Zoar, and they
          sing out of such-and-such a selection, and as for those who cannot say
          Shibholeth, and lay a pretty good stress on the "h," but who pronounce
          it "Sibboleth;"let the fords of the Jordan be taken, and let them be
          put to death. True, it is not fashionable to roast them alive, but we
          will condemn their souls to everlasting perdition, which is the next
          best thing, and may not appear to be quite so uncharitable. Many
          suppose that because there is grievous error in a church, concerning
          an ordinance or a doctrine, therefore no living children of God are
          there. Ah, dear brethren, this severe opinion arises from want of
          knowing better. A mouse had lived in a box all its life, and one day
          crawled up to the edge of it, and looked round on what it could see.
          Now the box only stood in a lumber room, but the mouse was surprised
          at its vastness, and exclaimed: "How big the world is!" If some bigots
          would get out of their box, and only look a little way round them,
          they would find the realm of grace to be far wider than they dream. It
          is true that these pastures are a most proper place for sheep, but yet
          upon yonder hill-tops wild goats are pastured by the Great Shepherd.
          It is true that yonder plains covered with verdure are best fitted for
          cattle, but the Lord of all has his beasts in the forest, and his
          conies among the rocks. You may have to look a long while before you
          find these living things, but he sees them when you do not, and it is
          a deal more important to a cony for God to see it, than it is for a
          man to see it; and so it is an infinitely more weighty matter for a
          child of God for his Father to know that he is his child, than for his
          brother to know it. If my brother will not believe me to be a
          Christian, he cannot help being my brother; he may do what he will in
          his unkindness, but if I am one of God's children, and he also is one,
          the tie of brotherhood cannot be broken between us. I love to think
          that the Lord has his hidden ones -- even in churches that have sadly
          degenerated from the faith; and, although it is yours and mine to
          denounce error unsparingly, and with the iconoclastic hammer to go
          through the land and break the idols of all the churches in pieces as
          far as God gives us strength, yet there is not a lamb amongst Christ's
          flock that we would disdain to feed -- there is not the least of all
          his people, however mistaken in judgment, whom our soul would not
          embrace an ardent love. God, in nature, has placed life in singular
          spots, and so has he put spiritual life into strange out-of-the-way
          places, and has his own chosen where least we should look for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, there are to be found God's people in every city. Some of
          you are going away, it may be, to the ends of the earth, and this word
          may be comfortable to you. The Lord has an elect people everywhere.
          The wild goats are on the rocks, and the conies amongst the stones,
          and the storks in the trees. Go you where you will, you shall find
          that God has a living people; or if you should be sent to a country
          where as yet there are no converted men or women, let not that
          discourage you, but rather say, "I am sent with the purpose of finding
          out God's elect, who as yet are hidden in sin. I am to be the
          instrument of finding out the Lord's own blood-bought but hidden ones
          here." When thou goest into a city that is given to idolatry, thou
          shalt hear it said to thee, "I have much people in this city;" go,
          therefore, and labor to find out the much people. Introduce the
          gospel, tell of the love of Jesus, and you shall soon find that your
          efforts are rewarded by the discovery of those who shall love your
          Savior, and delight in the same truth which now charms your heart. Do
          not believe that there is a rock without its wild goat; do not think
          that there is a fir-forest without its stork; or that there are to be
          found trees by the brook without their birds. Expect to find where God
          dwells that there are some who are sojourners with him, as all their
          fathers were.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall leave the first point, repeating the sentence, for each place
          there a form of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, the text teaches us plainly that EACH CREATURE HAS ITS
          APPROPRIATE PLACE. Birds with their nests for the cedars of Lebanon,
          storks for the fir trees, wild goats for the high hills, and conies
          for the rocks. Each of these creatures looks most beautiful at home.
          Go into the Zoological Gardens, and see the poor animals there under
          artificial conditions, and you can little guess what they are at home.
          A lion in a cage is a very different creature from a lion in the
          wilderness. The stork looks wretched in his wire pen, and you would
          hardly know him as the same creature if you saw him on the housetops
          or on the fir trees. Each creature looks best in its own place. Take
          that truth, now, and use it for yourself. Each man has by God a
          providential position appointed to him, and the position ordained for
          each Christian is that in which he looks best; it is the best for him
          and he is the best for that; and if you could change his position, and
          shift him to another, he would not be half as happy, nor half as
          useful, nor half so much himself. Put the stork on the high hills, put
          the wild goat on the fir trees -- what monstrosities! Take my dear
          brother who has been a working-man this last twenty years, and always
          been a spiritually-minded man, and make him Lord Mayor of London, and
          you would spoil him altogether. Take a good hearer and set him
          preaching, and he would make a sorry appearance. A man out of place is
          not seen to advantage, you see the wrong side of him, the gracious
          side is hidden. The position in which God has placed me is the best
          for me. Let me remember this when I am grumbling and complaining. It
          may be I have got past that foolish discontent which is altogether
          selfish, but perhaps I repine because I think, if I were in a
          different position, I could glorify God more. This species of
          discontent is very insinuating, but let us beware of it. It is foolish
          to cry, "if I were placed in a different position, I could do so much
          more for God!" You could not do so much as you can do now. I am sure
          the goat would not show the wisdom of God so well in a fir tree, as he
          would up on a high hill; and you would not display the grace of God so
          well anywhere else as you can do where you are. Ah, says the young
          Christian, "I am only an apprentice; if I were a master man, I think I
          could then glorify God." Sir, if you cannot magnify him in your
          apprenticeship, you will not do so when you become a journeyman. "Oh,
          but my shop is so little, my trade brings me in such a small amount, I
          can give but little, and I have such few opportunities of doing good."
          Be slow to leave your calling till you have plain indications from
          providence that you ought to do so, for many a man in moving from his
          place has been as a bird that has wandered from her nest. God knows
          better than you what is best for you; bow your soul to his sovereign
          will. God appoints our position infinitely better than we could
          appoint it, even it we could have the choosing of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My beloved friends, it is not only that each form of life has its own
          best position as to providence, but it is so as to experience. God has
          not made two creatures precisely alike. You shall gather leaves from a
          tree, and you shall not find two veined in precisely the same way. In
          Christian experience it is the same. Wherever there is living
          Christian experience, it is different from everybody else's experience
          in some respect. In a family of children each child may be like its
          father, and yet each child shall be different from each other child;
          and amongst the children of God, though they all have the likeness of
          Christ in a measure, yet are they not all exactly the one like the
          other. You read the other day the life of John Bunyan, and you said,
          "Oh, if I had experience like John Bunyan, then I should know I was a
          child of God." This was foolish. The biographies that are published in
          our magazines in many cases do some good, but more mischief; for there
          are Christian people who begin at once to say, "Have I felt precisely
          thus? Have I felt exactly that? -- If not, I am lost." Hast thou felt
          thyself a sinner and Christ a Savior? Art thou emptied of self and
          dost thou look to Christ alone? Well, if no other soul hath trod the
          same path as thou hast done, thou art in a right path; and though thy
          experience may have eccentricities in it that differ from all others,
          it is right it should be so. God has not made the wild goat like the
          cony, nor has he made the stork like any other bird, but he has made
          each to fit the place it is to occupy, and he makes your experience to
          be suitable to the bringing out some point of his glory, which could
          not be brought out otherwise. Some are full of rejoicing, others are
          often depressed; a few keep the happy medium; many soar aloft, and
          then dive into the deeps again; let these varied experiences, as they
          are all equally clear phases of the same divine lovingkindness, be
          accepted, and let them be rejoiced in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same holds good as to individuality of character. Each creature
          has its appropriate place, and I believe that each constitution is
          meant, under the power of grace, to be suitable for a man's position.
          I might wish to be of a different temperament from what I am -- I
          sometimes think so, but in wiser moments, I would not wish to alter
          anything in myself but that which is sinful. Martin Luther might have
          wished that he had been as gentle as Melancthon, but then we might
          have had no reformation: Melancthon might certainly sometimes have
          wished that he had been as energetic as Martin Luther, but then Luther
          might have lacked his most tender comforter, if Melancthon had been as
          rough as he. Peter might have been improved if he had not been so
          rough, and John might possibly have been improved if he had been
          somewhat more firm; but after all, when God makes Peter he is best as
          Peter, and when he makes John he is best as John, and it is very
          foolish when Peter wants to be John, and when John pines to be Peter.
          Dear brethren, the practical matter is, be yourselves in your
          religion. Never attempt to counterfeit another's virtues, nor try to
          square your experience according to another man's feelings, nor
          endeavor to mould your character so that you may look as if you were
          like a certain good man whom you admire. No, ask the Lord, who made a
          new man of you, to let your manhood come out as he meant it, and
          whichever grace he meant to be prominent, let it be prominent. If you
          are meant to play the hero and rush into the thick of the battle, then
          let courage be developed; or if he designed you to lie in the hospital
          and suffer, then let patience have its perfect work; but ask the Lord
          to mould you after his own mind, that as he finds a stork for a fir
          tree and a fir tree for a stork; a hill for a wild goat, and a wild
          goat for a hill; he will find a place for you, the man, and find for
          you, the man, the place that he has created for you, There his name
          shall be most glorified, and you shall be safest. Kick not against the
          pricks, but take kindly to the yoke, and serve your day and generation
          till your Master calls you home.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, briefly, a third point. It appears from the text that EVERY
          CREATURE THAT GOD HAS MADE IS PROVIDED WITH SHELTER. Birds fly to the
          trees, and the stork to the fir, the wild goat to the high hills, and
          the cony to the rocks. There is a shelter for every one of these
          creatures, great and small. Think a moment, then, if God has made each
          creature happy, and given a place of refuge to each creature, then,
          depend upon it, he has not left man's soul without a shelter. And here
          is an important truth, for every man is certainly in danger, and every
          thinking man knows it. My God, dost thou shield and shelter the cony
          in the rock, and is there no rock for me to shelter in? Assuredly thou
          hast not made man and left him without a refuge; when thou givest to
          the rock-rabbit the cleft in which he may hide himself, there must be
          a shelter for man. This must certainly be true, because you and I, if
          we have observed our inner life, must have felt conscious that nothing
          here below can fill an immortal soul. You have prospered in business,
          and have enjoyed good health; but for all that, in quiet moments of
          reflection, you feel a craving for something not to be found beneath
          the sun. Have you not felt yearnings after the Infinite, -- hungerings
          which bread cannot satisfy; thirstings which a river could not quench?
          And are you never conscious -- I know I am as a man, I speak not as a
          Christian now -- of cold shiverings of fear, which make the entire
          manhood to tremble? The mind looks forward and considers, "And shall I
          live for ever? When my body moulders, shall I continue? Am I a vessel
          launched upon the river of existence, and shall I be borne onward to a
          shoreless and mysterious sea? And what will be that sea, and will it
          be a calm, or tossed with storms?" Or, to change the figure, "I shall
          sleep, but in that sleep of death, what dreams may come?" Have you
          never felt all that, and said within yourself, "O that there were a
          place where I could hide myself, never to tremble more! O that I could
          grasp something that would satisfy my insatiable lodgings! O that I
          could get my foot upon a rook, and no longer feel that a quicksand is
          beneath me! O that I knew of truth sure and indisputable, and
          possessed a treasure that would enrich me for ever." Well, then, if
          you have such longings as these, surely there must be a provision to
          meet them. The stork has an instinct for building a nest of a certain
          sort; it is too large a nest to be placed on a bush, she needs a tree;
          there is a tree somewhere then, for God never made a stork for a tree
          but he made also a tree for the stork. Here is a wild goat: you put it
          down on a flat meadow, and it is not happy. Give it the greenest
          pasture, it looks up and pines. Rest assured that since those little
          feet are meant to traverse rocks and crags, there are rocks and crags
          that are meant for those feet to leap upon. A chamois argues an Alps,
          and the conclusion is verified by fact. Yonder little cony cannot live
          anywhere but among the stones; it delights to conceal itself in the
          fissures of the rock; then be assured there are rocks meant for
          conies. So for me, with my thirstings, my longings, my pipings, my
          mysterious instincts -- there is a God somewhere, there is a heaven
          somewhere, there is an atonement somewhere, there is a fullness
          somewhere to meet my emptiness. Man wants a shelter, there must be a
          shelter; let us show you what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, there is a shelter for man from the sense of past guilt. It
          is because we are guilty that we are fearful: we have broken our
          Maker's law, and therefore we are afraid. But our Maker came from
          heaven to earth; Jesus, the Christ of God, came here, and was made
          man, and bore that we might never bear his Father's righteous wrath,
          and whosoever believeth in Jesus shall find perfect rest in those dear
          wounds of his. Since Christ suffered for me, my guilt is gone, my
          punishment was endured by my Substitute, therefore do I hear the voice
          that saith, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people! Say unto them, that
          their warfare is accomplished; for they have received at the Lord's
          hand double for all their sins." And as for future fears, he who
          believes in Jesus finds a refuge from them in the Fatherhood of God.
          He who trusts Christ, says: "Now I have no fear about the present, nor
          about the future. Let catastrophe follow catastrophe, let the world
          crash, and all the universe go to ruin; beneath the wings of the
          Eternal God I must be safe. All things must work together for my good,
          for I love God, and have been called according to his purpose." What a
          blessed shelter this is! The little conies in their rock-clefts are
          perfectly at ease, and so we, when we enter fully into the truth of
          our adoption of God, are filled with unutterable peace. And as for the
          present, with its cares, and griefs, and heart-throbs, there is the
          Holy Ghost abiding in us, the Comforter, and we fly to him, and
          receive consolations so rich and powerful, that this day we feel at
          peace in the midst of discomforts, and if perplexed we are not in
          despair. Brethren, there is a shelter in the atonement of Christ, in
          the Fatherhood of God, in the abiding presence of the Comforter --
          there is a shelter for man -- would God that all of us had found it!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now just a moment of your attention will be wanted for the
          fourth observation, that FOR EACH CREATURE THE SHELTER IS APPROPRIATE.
          The tree for the bird; the fir tree, a particular and special tree,
          for the stork; a high hill for the steinbock or ibex, and the rocks
          for the hyrax or rabbit. Whatever creature it may be, each shall have
          his own suitable shelter. But you will reply to me, is there a
          shelter, then, for each individual man? Did you not say that there was
          only one shelter for manhood? If I did not say it, I certainly will
          say it now. There is only one shelter under heaven or in heaven for
          any man of woman born, but yet there is a shelter suitable for each.
          Christ Jesus suits all sorts of sinners, all sorts of sufferers. He is
          a Savior as suitable for me as if he came to save me and no one else;
          but he is a Redeemer as remarkably suitable to every other of his
          redeemed ones. Note, then, that there is a refuge in Christ Jesus for
          those simple trustful natures that take the gospel at once and believe
          it. These are like the little birds that fly to the trees and build
          their nests and begin to sing. These are the commonest sort of
          Christians, but in some respects they are the best. They hear the
          gospel, believe it to be God's word, accept it, and begin to sing.
          Jesus Christ exactly suits them, he is a shelter for those chosen
          birds of the air, whom your heavenly Father daily feed. But there are
          others of larger intellect, who require unusual support ere they can
          build their nest and be at ease. These, like the stork, need a special
          support, and they find it in the gospel. Since they are more weighty
          with doubt and perplexity, they need substantial verities to rest on;
          these find great fir-tree doctrines and cedar-like principles in the
          Bible, and they rest in them. Many of us this day are resting on the
          immutable things wherein it is impossible for God to lie. We rest upon
          the substitution of Christ, and repose in the completeness of the
          atonement. Some get hold of one great principle and some another in
          connection with the grace of God; and God has been pleased to reveal
          strong, immovable, eternal, immutable principles in his Word which are
          suitable for thoughtful and troubled minds to rest on. Moreover, we
          have in the church of God persons of great reasoning powers: these
          love the craggy paths of thought, but when they come to Christ and
          trust in him, though they are like the wild goat and love the high
          places, they find in the Scriptures good ground for them. The doctrine
          of election, and all the mysteries of predestination, the deep and
          wonderful doctrines that are spoken of by the apostle Paul; where is
          the man of thought who will not be at home among these if he loves
          sublimity? If you have that turn of mind which delights to deal with
          the high things of God, which have been the perplexity of men and
          angels, you shall find yourself at home, and what is better, safe with
          the gospel. If you are in Christ, you shall have good, solid, safe
          material for the profoundest meditations. Perhaps, instead of being
          bold and daring and thoughtful, you are not comparable to the wild
          goat but you are "a very timid trembling little creature like the
          cony. If anyone claps his hands, away runs the cony; he fears always.
          But there is a shelter for conies; and so in the grace of God for very
          timid trembling people, there is a suitable refuge. Here is a
          delightful shelter for some of you to run into. "Fear not, I am with
          thee; be not dismayed, I am thy God." Here is another -- "Him that
          cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." Many a poor trembler has
          hidden under that condescending word. If I cannot find shelter in one
          text, what a blessing it is the Bible is full of promises, and there
          are promises in the Bible which seem made for a certain form of mind,
          as if the Holy Ghost cast his thoughts and his words into all sorts of
          moulds to suit the habits of thought and mind of all whom he would
          bless. O trembling soul, though thou art half afraid to say that thou
          belongest to Jesus, yet come and rest in him, hide in the rift of his
          side, and thou art safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Now we must close, and we do so with this observation, that EACH
          CREATURE USES ITS SHELTER, for the storks have made their nests in the
          fir trees, and the wild goats climb the high hills, and the conies
          hide among the rocks. I never heard of one of these creatures that
          neglected its shelter -- they love their natural abodes; but I have
          heard of men who have neglected their God, I know women who have
          forgotten Christ. We say, "silly sheep." Ah, if the sheep knew all
          about us, they would wonder we should call them silly. The cony in
          danger which does not seek its rock is foolish; but the soul in danger
          which does not seek its Savior is insane -- insane, nay, if there can
          be a madness which is as much beyond madness, as madness is beyond
          sanity, then such is the raving lunacy of a man who neglects the
          Savior. I have never heard of any of these creatures that they despise
          the shelter provided. The birds are satisfied with the trees, and the
          stork with the firs, and even the cony with its rock-hole; but, alas!
          there are men who despise Christ. God himself becomes the shelter of
          sinners, and yet sinners despise their God. The Son of God opens his
          side and lays bare his heart that a soul may come and shelter there in
          the crimson cleft, and yet that soul for many a day refuses to accept
          the shelter. Oh, where are tears? Who shall give us fit expressions
          for our sorrow that men should be such monsters to themselves, and to
          their God? The ox knoweth its owner, and the ass its master's crib;
          but men know not God. The stork knows its fir tree, the wild goat its
          crag, and the cony knows its cleft, but the sinner knows not his
          Christ. Ah, manhood, what has befallen thee? What strange wine of
          Gomorrah hast thou drank which has thus intoxicated thee!
        </p>
        <p>
          One other thing, I never heard of a stork that when it met with a fir
          tree demurred as to its right to build its nest there, and I never
          heard of a cony yet that questioned whether it had a permit to run
          into the rock. Why these creatures would soon perish if they were
          always doubting and fearing as to whether they had a right to use
          providential provisions. The stork says to himself, "ah, here is a fir
          tree;" he consults with his mate -- "Will this do for the nest in
          which we may rear our young?" "Ay" says she, and they gather the
          materials, and arrange them. There is never any deliberation, "May we
          build here?" but they bring their sticks and make their nest. So the
          wild goat on the crag does not say, "Have I a right to be here?" No!
          he must be somewhere, and there is a crag which exactly suits him; and
          he springs upon it. Yet though these dumb creatures know the provision
          of their God, the sinner does not recognize the provisions of his
          Savior. He quibbles and questions, "May I?" and "I am afraid it is not
          for me," and "I think it cannot be meant for me; and I am afraid it is
          too good to be true." And yet nobody ever said to the stork,
          "Whosoever buildeth on this fir tree shall never have his nest pulled
          down." No inspired word has ever said to the cony, "Whosoever runs
          into this rock-cleft shall never be driven out of it;" if it had been
          so, it would make assurance doubly sure. And yet here is Christ
          provided for sinners, just the sort of a Savior sinners need, and the
          encouragement is added, "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise
          cast out;" "Whosoever will let him come, and take the water of life
          freely." O dear brothers and sisters, do not be standing out against
          the generosity of a sin-pardoning God, who bids the sinner come and
          welcome. Come, believe in Jesus, and find salvation now. O that you
          would come, it is what God has provided for your wants. Come, take it,
          for he bids you come. "The Spirit and the bride say come, and
          whosoever will let him come and take the water of life freely." To
          believe is to trust Jesus, to trust his suffering, to trust his
          atonement, and rely upon him alone for salvation. May God enable you
          to do it for Christ's sake. Amen.
