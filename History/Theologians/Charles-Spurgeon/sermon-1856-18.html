        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.72)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 30, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
          through the depths, as through the wilderness." -- Psalm 106:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          SEVERAL Sabbaths ago we preached upon the deliverance of the children
          of Israel out of Egypt, by the blood of the passover: and we told you
          then, that we believed that event to be typical of the coming forth of
          God's people from that spiritual house of bondage, that furnace of
          mental suffering whence they are delivered by the omnipotent grace of
          God, at the time of their conversion. This morning we pursue the
          narrative. No doubt the children of Israel supposed that now all was
          over; the Egyptians has sent them away, entreating them to depart, and
          loading them with riches. Terror had smitten the heart of Egypt, for
          from the king on the throne to the prisoner in the dungeon, all was
          dismay and fear on account of Israel. Egypt was glad for them when
          they departed. Therefore the children of Israel said within
          themselves, "We shall now march to Canaan at once; there will be no
          more dangers, no more troubles, no more trials; the Egyptians
          themselves have sent us away, and they are too much afraid of us ever
          to molest us again. Now shall be tread the desert through with hasty
          footstep; and when a few more days have passed, we shall enter into
          the land of our possession -- the land that floweth with milk and
          honey." "Not quite so speedily," says God; "the time is not arrived
          yet for you to rest. It is true I have delivered you from Egypt; but
          there is much you have to learn before you will be prepared to dwell
          in Canaan. Therefore I shall lead you about, and instruct you, and
          teach you." And it came to pass that the Lord led the children of
          Israel about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea, till
          they arrived over against Baalzephon, where on either side the craggy
          mountains shut them in. Pharoah hears of it; he comes upon them, to
          overcome them; and they stand in terrible fright and jeopardy of them,
          to overcome them; and they stand in terrible fright and jeopardy of
          their lives. Now, beloved, it is usually so with the believer: he
          marches out of Egypt spiritually at the time of his conversion, and he
          says within himself, "Now I shall always be happy." He has a bright
          eye, and a light heart, for his fetters have been dashed to the
          ground, and he feels no longer the lash of conscience upon his
          shoulder. "Now," says he, "I may have a short life, but it will be a
          happy one."
        </p>
        <p>"A few more rolling years at most,</p>
        <p>Will land me on fair Canaan's coast.'</p>
        <p>
          And then I shall have no more warfare, no more fighting, no more
          disturbance; but I shall be at peace." "Not quite as thou desirest,"
          says God. "Oh! thou little one; I have more to teach thee ere thou art
          prepared for my palace." Then he commences to lead us about, and bring
          us into straits and perils. The sins which we thought had utterly left
          us are hunting us behind, while impassible floods block up the way.
          Even trembling Israel halting by the Red Sea is but a faint emblem of
          that terrible position into which the child of God usually falls,
          within a few weeks or months after he has come out of the land of
          Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall preach this morning a sermon, which I hope will be useful to
          such of you as have lately come to know the Lord. You were expecting
          to build tabernacles, in which to dwell on the summit of the mountains
          of joy for ever; but you find, on the contrary, that you have very
          great troubles and conflicts; and perhaps now you have a more terrible
          trial than you ever experienced in all your life before. I will
          endeavour to show you, that this is just what you might have expected;
          that there will be a Red Sea very soon after you come out of your
          house of bondage. Others of you, my dear friends, have passed through
          all these things many years ago. You can say, --
        </p>
        <p>"Many days have passed since then,</p>
        <p>Many changes I have seen,</p>
        <p>Yet have been upheld till now;</p>
        <p>Who could hold me up but thou?"</p>
        <p>
          But I am sure you will be glad to re-visit the spot, where God
          delivered you from your distresses. We find it very pleasant to look
          upon the place where we were taught in our school-boy days, or to
          visit the haunts of our childhood. So you who are grey-headed in the
          cause of your Master, will not find it very tedious work to go back a
          little way, and look to that Red Sea which God rebuked and dried up,
          that you might be led through it even as through the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming, then, to the subject; the children of Israel had their
          difficulties, and so generally the child of God has his very soon
          after he comes out of Egypt. But then they had their refuges; and
          moreover, God had a great and grand design to answer in all the
          troubles into which they were brought.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Taking the first point, the children of Israel just now had THREE
          DIFFICULTIES -- three exceeding great dangers. And so I believe that
          every heir of heaven, within a very short period after the time of his
          deliverance, will meet with the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first they had was a great trial sent by God himself. There was
          the Red Sea in the front of them. Now, it was not an enemy that put
          the sea there; it was God himself. We may therefore think, that the
          Red Sea represents some great and trying providence, which the Lord
          will be sure to place in the path of every new-born child; in order to
          try his faith, and to test the sincerity of his trust in God. I do not
          know, beloved, whether your experience will back up mine: but I can
          say this, that the worst difficulty I ever met with, or I think I can
          ever meet with, happened a little time after my conversion to God. And
          you must generally expect, very soon after you have been brought to
          know and love him, that you will have some great, broad, deep Red Sea
          straight before your path, which you will scarcely know how to pass.
          Sometimes it will occur in the family. The husband says, for instance
          -- if he is an ungodly man -- "You shall not attend such-and-such a
          place of worship; I positively forbid you to be baptized, or to join
          that church;" there is a Red Sea before you. You had done nothing
          wrong; it is God himself who places that Red Sea before your path. Or
          perhaps before that time, you were carrying on a business which now
          you cannot conscientiously continue; and there is a Red Sea which you
          have to cross in renouncing your means of livelihood. You don't see
          how it is to be done; how you are to maintain yourself, and to provide
          things honest in the sight of all men. Or perhaps your employment
          calls you amongst men with whom you lived before on amicable terms,
          and now on a sudden, they say, "Come! won't you do as you used to do?"
          There, again, is a Red Sea before you. It is a hard struggle; you do
          not like to come out and say, "I cannot, I shall not, for I am a
          Christian." You stand still, half afraid to go forward. Or perhaps it
          is something proceeding more immediately from God. You find that just
          when he plants a vine in your heart, he blasts all the vines in your
          vineyard; and when he plants you in his own garden, then it is that he
          uproots all your comforts and your joys. Just when the Sun of
          Righteousness is rising upon you, your own little candle is blown out;
          just when you seem to need it most, your gourd is withered, your
          prosperity departs, and your flood becomes an ebb. I say again, it may
          not be so with all of you, but I think that most of God's people have
          not long escaped the bondage of Egypt, before they find some terrible,
          rolling sea, lashed perhaps by tempestuous winds directly in their
          path; they stand aghast, and say, "O God, how can I bear this? I
          thought I could give up all for thee; but now I feel as if I could do
          nothing! I thought I should be in heaven, and all would be easy; but
          here is a sea I cannot ford -- there is no squadron of ships to carry
          me across: it is not bridged even by thy mercy; I must swim it, or
          else I fear I must perish."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the children of Israel had a second difficulty. They would not
          have cared about the Red Sea a single atom, if they had not been
          terrified by the Egyptians who were behind them. These Egyptians, I
          think may be interpreted this morning, by way of parable, as the
          representatives of those sins of ours, which we thought were clean
          dead and gone. For a little while after conversion sin does not
          trouble a Christian; he is very happy and cheerful, in a sense of
          pardon; but before many days are past, he will understand what Paul
          said, "I find another law in my members, so that when I would do good,
          evil is present with me." The first moment when he wins his liberty he
          laughs and leaps in an ecstacy of joy. He thinks, "Oh! I shall soon be
          in heaven; as for sin, I can trample that beneath my feet!" But mark
          you, scarce has another Sabbath gladdened his spirit, ere he finds
          that sin is too much for him; the old corruptions which he fancied
          were laid in their graves get a resurrection and start up afresh, and
          he begins to cry, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from
          the body of this death?" He sees all his old sins galloping behind
          him: like Pharoah and his host pursuing him to the borders of the Red
          Sea. There is a great trial before him. Oh! he thinks he could bear
          that; he thinks he could walk through the Red Sea; oh! those Egyptian
          -- they are behind him! He thought he should never have seen them any
          more for ever; they were the plague and torment of his life when they
          made him work in the brick-kiln. He sees his old master, the very man
          who was wont to lay the lash on his shoulders, riding post haste after
          him; and there are the eyes of that black Pharoah, flashing like fire
          in the distance; he sees the horrid scowling face of the tyrant, and
          how he trembles! Satan is after him, and all the legions of hell seem
          to be let loose, if possible, utterly to destroy his soul. At such a
          time, moreover, our sins are more formidable to us than they were
          before they were forgiven; because, when we were in Egypt, we never
          saw the Egyptians mounted on horses, or in chariots; they only
          appeared as our task-masters, with their whips; but now these people
          see the Egyptians on horseback, clad in armour; they behold all the
          mighty men of valour come out with their warlike instruments to slay
          them. So did I find, speaking for myself, that when I first knew the
          weight of sin, it was as a burden, as a labour, as a trouble; but when
          the second time
        </p>
        <p>"I asked the Lord that I might grow,</p>
        <p>In faith, and love, and every grace;</p>
        <p>Might more of his salvation know,</p>
        <p>And seek more earnestly his face;"</p>
        <p>
          and when he answered me by letting all my sins loose upon me they
          appeared more frightful than before. I thought the Egyptians in Egypt
          were not half so bad as the Egyptians out of Egypt; I thought the sins
          I knew before, though they were cruel task-masters, were not half so
          much to be dreaded as those soldier-sins, armed with spears and axes,
          with chariots of iron with scythes upon their axles, hastening to
          assault me. It is true they did not come so near to me as heretofore;
          nevertheless they occasioned more fright than when I was their slave.
          It may be, poor child of God, thou art astonished and amazed to find,
          that thy sins are more black now than they were when thou wast under
          conviction; that thou hast less hope than thou hadst even then; and
          that thy condition is possibly far worse than when the law was beating
          thee from head to foot, and rubbing brine into the wounds of thy
          conscience. Thou mayest be saying, "Ah! well, I never thought of this;
          if I be a child of God, if I were really pardoned and forgiven, how
          could it be that I should be so vexed and tormented with a sense of my
          guilt? And if all my transgressions have been cast into the depths of
          the sea, how is it that I hear the armies of my sins, rattling their
          horse-hoofs and chariot-wheels behind me?" I tell thee, beloved, in
          the name of the Lord, that is just what you ought to have expected.
          The pangs after we come out of Egypt are at times even more painful
          than those we feel in the house of bondage; and there is usually a
          time of trial a little while after the new birth, which is even more
          terrible and awful than the previous agony of the soul, though not
          usually so protracted. This was the second difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there was a third difficulty, which perhaps wrought them more
          misery than either of the other two: these poor children of Israel had
          such faint hearts. They no sooner saw the Egyptians than they began to
          cry out; and when they beheld the Red Sea before them, they murmured
          against their deliverer. A faint heart is the worst foe a Christian
          can have; whilst he keeps his faith firm, whilst the anchor is fixed
          deep in the rock, he never need fear the storm; but when the hand of
          faith is palsied, or the eye of faith is dim, it will go hard with us.
          As for the Egyptian, he may throw his spear; while we can catch it on
          the shield of faith, we are not terrified by the weapon, but if we
          lose our faith, the spear becomes a deadly dart. While we have faith,
          the Red Sea may flow before us, as deep and dark as it pleases: for
          like Leviathan, we trust we can snuff up Jordan at a draught. But if
          we have no faith, then at the most insignificant streamlet, which
          Faith could take up in her hands in a single moment, and drink like
          Gideon's men, poor Unbelief stands quivering and crying, "Ah! I shall
          be drowned in the floods, or I shall be slain by the foe; there is no
          hope for me; I am driven to despair. It would have been better for me
          that I had died in Egypt, than that I should come hither to be slain
          by the hand of the enemy." The child of God, when he is first born,
          has but very little faith, because he has had but little experience;
          he has not tried the promise, and therefore he does not know its
          faithfulness. He has not used the arm of his faith, and therefore the
          sinews of it have not become strong. Let him live a little longer, and
          become confirmed in the faith, and he will not care for Red Seas, nor
          yet for the Egyptians; but just then his little heart beats against
          the walls of his body, and he laments, "Ah, me! ah, me! O wretched man
          that I am! How shall I ever find deliverance?" This description of
          spiritual geography may be uninteresting to some, because they may not
          have travelled through this part of the wilderness, but others will
          view it with attention. Who cared about maps of the Crimea till there
          was war there? But as soon as our soldiers were engaged in that
          particular spot, every man bought a map of the Crimea and studied the
          boundaries of Russia. So if you have been in these straits, you will
          be very glad of my map this morning, that you may see the way in which
          God leads his family. These are the three dangers -- a great trial,
          sins pursuing us behind, and an exceedingly faint heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But, thanks be to God! the children of Israel had THREE HELPS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! child of God? dost thou discern this mystery? Whenever thou hast
          three trials, thou wilt always have three promises; and if thou hadst
          forty afflictions, thou wouldst have forty measures of grace. Yes, and
          if thou hadst a million troubles, thou wouldst have a million measures
          of mercy. The Israelites had three difficulties, and they had three
          helps; and as the difficulty was put in the way by providence, so
          providence did also furnish a relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first help they had was Providence. Providence put the Red Sea
          there, and piled the rocks on either hand, while providence
          represented by the fiery cloudy pillar, had led them to its shore, and
          conducted them into the defile, and now the same pillar of providence
          came to their assistance. They had not come thither undirected, and
          therefore they should not be left unprotected, for the same cloudy
          pillar which led them there, came behind them to protect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cheer up, then, heir of grace! What is thy trial? Has providence
          brought it upon thee? If so, unerring wisdom will deliver thee from
          it. What is it thou art now exercised upon? As truly as thou art
          alive, God will remove it. Dost thou think God's cloudy pillar would
          ever lead thee to a place where God's right arm would fail thee? Dost
          thou imagine that he would ever guide thee into such a defile that he
          could not conduct thee out again? The providence which apparently
          misleads, will in verity befriend thee. That which leads thee into
          difficulties guards thee against thy foes; it casts darkness on thy
          sins, whilst it giveth light to thee. How sweet is providence to a
          child of God, when he can reflect upon it! He can look out into this
          world, and say, "However great my troubles, they are not so great as
          my Father's power; however difficult may be my circumstances, yet all
          things around me are working together for good. He who holds up yon
          unpillared arch of the starry heavens can also support my soul without
          a single apparent prop; he who guides the stars in the well-ordered
          courses, even when they seem to move in hazy dances, surely he can
          overrule my trials in such a way that out of confusion he will bring
          order; and from seeming evil produce lasting good. He who bridles the
          storm, and puts the bit in the mouth of the tempest, surely he can
          restrain my trial, and keep my sorrows in subjection. I need not fear
          while the lightnings are in his hands and the thunders sleep within
          his lips; while the oceans gurgle from his fist, and the clouds are in
          the hollow of his hands; while the rivers are turned by his foot, and
          while he diggeth the channels of the sea. Surely he whose might wings
          an angel, can furnish a worm with strength; he who guides a cherub
          will not be overcome by the trials of an emmet like myself. He who
          makes the most ponderous orb roll in dignity, and keeps its
          predestined orbit, can make a little atom like myself move in my
          proper course, and conduct me as he pleaseth. Christian! there is no
          sweeter pillow than providence; and when providence seemeth adverse,
          believe it still, lay it under thy head, for depend upon it there is
          comfort in its bosom. There is hope for thee thou child of God! The
          great trouble which is to come in thy way in the early part of thy
          pilgrimage, is planned by love, the same love which shall interpose as
          thy protector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: the children of Israel had another refuge, in the fact, that
          they knew that they were the covenant people of God, and that, though
          they were in difficulties, God had brought them there, and therefore
          God, (with reverence let me say it,) was bound in honor to bring them
          out of that trouble into which he had brought them. "Well," says the
          child of God, "I know I am in a strait, but this one thing I also
          know, that I did not come out of Egypt by myself -- I know that he
          brought me out; I know that I did not escape by my own power, or slay
          my first-born sins myself -- I know that he did it; and though I fled
          from the tyrant -- I know that he made my feet mighty for travel, for
          there was not one feeble in all our tribes; I know that though I am at
          the Red sea, I did not run there uncalled, but he bade me go there,
          and therefore I give to the winds my fears; for it he hath led me here
          into this difficulty, he will lead me out, and lead me through.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the point to which I want to direct your attention most of all is
          this. The third refuge which the children of Israel had, was in a man;
          and neither of the two others, without that, would have been of any
          avail. It was the man Moses. He did everything for them. Thy greatest
          refuge, O child of God! in all thy trials, is in a man: not in Moses,
          but in Jesus; not in the servant, but in the master. he is interceding
          for thee, unseen and unheard by thee, even as Moses did for the
          children of Israel. If thou couldst but, in the dim distance, catch
          the sweet syllables of his voice as they distil from his lips, and see
          his heart as it speaks for thee, thou wouldst take comfort; for God
          hears that man when he pleads. He can overcome every difficulty. He
          has not a rod, but a cross, which can divide the Red sea; he has not
          only a cloudy pillar of forgiving grace, which can dim the eyes of
          your foes and keep them at a distance; but he has a cross, which can
          open the Red sea and drown thy sins in the very midst. He will not
          leave thee. Look! on yonder rock of heaven he stands, cross in hand,
          even as Moses with his rod. Cry to him, for with that uplifted cross
          he will cleave a path for thee, and guide thee through the sea; he
          will make those hoary floods, which had been friends for ever, and
          stand asunder like foes. Call to him, and he will make thee a way in
          the midst of the ocean, and a path through the pathless sea. Cry to
          him, and there shall not a sin of thine be left alive; he will sweep
          them all away; and the king of sin, the devil, he too shall be
          overwhelmed beneath the Saviour's blood, whilst thou shalt sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Hell and my sins obstruct my path,</p>
        <p>But hell and sin are conquer'd foes;</p>
        <p>My Jesus nailed them to his cross,</p>
        <p>And sang the triumph as he rose."</p>
        <p>Still look thou to that man who once on Calvary died!</p>
        <p>
          III. GOD HAD A DESIGN IN IT. And here, also, we wish you to regard
          with attention what God's design is, in leading the Christian into
          exceeding great trials in the early part of his life. This is
          explained to us by the Apostle Paul. A reference Bible is the best
          commentator in the world; and the most heavenly exposition is the
          searching out of kindred, texts, and comparing their meaning. "They
          were all baptized," says the Apostle, "unto Moses, in the cloud and in
          the sea." God's design in bringing his people into trouble, and
          raising all their sins at their heels, is to give them a thorough
          baptism into his service, consecrating them for ever to himself. I
          mean by baptism this morning, not the rite, but what baptism
          represents. Baptism signifies dedication to God -- initiation into
          God's service. It is not when we are first converted that we so fully
          dedicate ourselves to God, as afterwards, when some great Red sea
          rolls before us. I should be delighted to see some of you get into
          trouble. Am I unkind to utter such a wish? Well I repeat it, I should;
          for I shall never get you into the church unless you do; you will
          never come forward and make a thorough dedication of yourselves to
          God, till you have had a sharp trial. Rest assured of this, that sharp
          trials were no slight cause of the heroic devotion of the martyrs,
          confessors, and missionaries, who so thoroughly consecrated themselves
          to their Master's service. The great purpose of all our affliction is
          the promotion of an entire dedication to Christ in all our hearts. It
          is only in the font of sorrow that we are baptized with Christ's
          baptism. No holy chrism hath efficacy to baptize; it is the Spirit,
          who alone can dedicate us in the waters of the sea of tribulation. You
          are brought into these straits, young believer, that you may at such a
          time receive the baptism for God. Do not, I beseech you, let the time
          pass by; for there are some who neglect it, who, afterwards, never
          perfectly know what it is to be "baptized unto Jesus, in the cloud and
          in the sea." They say, "they will wait a little while," but the
          consequence is, they wait a very long while. They say they will do
          to-morrow what they ought to do to-day. Beware how you let slip the
          opportunity which God presents you, that you may devote yourself
          publicly to him. The very first time after conversion, when we come
          into straits and difficulties, is intended that we should then be
          dedicated to Jesus, and come out openly as the children of the living
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, let these thoughts rest with you. You may think them
          unimportant, but I am sure they are not. Believe me, you ought,
          indeed, to own yourselves on the Lord's side. If God be God, serve
          him; if Baal be God, serve him. There is nothing which I would more
          earnestly and ardently press upon you, than the great duty of decision
          for Jesus Christ. How many of you have a faint and indistinct hope,
          that when you die you will be Christ's people; and yet you must
          confess that you are not decided for Christ. You think you are his,
          but you often neglect duty, and frequently allow what you think a
          little sin to stain your conscience. You are not godly in worldly
          affairs. But I beseech you, put truth and righteousness into one
          scale, and put your own worldly gain into the other, and see which is
          the most important, and if you think that prudence dictates attention
          to this world instead of God, then remember, that is hellish prudence,
          and cometh of the devil, and, therefore, reject it. If ye were
          Egyptians, I might tell you to serve another master; but since you are
          God's people, or profess to be, I charge home upon you; and I beg of
          you, if you make a profession, to be out-and-out with it. How we do
          loathe those hot and cold people, who are neither one thing nor the
          other! You, who hold with the hare and run with the hounds -- you, who
          are first one thing and then another -- you, who are half horse, half
          alligator, and neither of them -- you, who are something between the
          two, who are neither Christians nor worldlings in your own opinions.
          We know which you are. I have often thought what a consistent religion
          the Roman Catholic would be for some of you go-between people. You are
          not exactly children of God; but you would not like to be called the
          children of the devil. Where should we put you at last? It would be a
          very convenient thing to have a purgatory for you, to place you
          somewhere between the two. But as we have no such place, we do not
          wish to have any such characters, and we believe there are none such;
          you are either servants of God, or servants of the devil. Don't stand
          halting between two opinions, but just say, once for all, whom you
          will serve. If you choose the devil, choose him, love him, serve him,
          and rejoice in your choice. If you choose hell, go there, rush madly
          there; it's a fearful dwelling place for eternity -- an awful home for
          ever! But if you choose God, I beseech you be in downright earnest
          about it. The religion of the present day, what mockery it is to call
          it religion at all! I protest, I believe the common religion of this
          age will not carry half those who profess it to heaven. It is a
          religion which they might easily carry to heaven, for it is too light
          to burden them, but it is too fragile to carry them there. They have a
          godliness which has not eaten up their soul. I heart a minister say
          once to his people, that "it would be a long time before the zeal of
          God's house would eat them up." Take the churches all round: what a
          slumbering brotherhood they are! There might almost be a controversy
          between the prince of this world, and the prince of heaven to whom
          they belonged. But I beseech you, let there be a marked and decided
          difference between you and the world. Let your heart be steeped in
          godliness; let your life be saturated with religion. Take care that,
          "whether you eat, or drink, or whatsoever you do, you do it all in the
          name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by him."
          So shall God see his great design subserved of making you to be
          baptized unto Jesus, "in the cloud and in the sea."
        </p>
        <p>
          In concluding, there is one sad aspect of this picture, which I wish
          you to regard. It is this. Some of you are journeying in an
          unconverted state to that bourne from which there is no return. At
          death you will find a Red Sea in your way -- the sea of death staring
          you in the face. When you come before it, you will find no bridge, no
          ships; but you must wade that sea alone. And, mark you, if you are
          living now in an ungodly condition, and are doing so when you die, as
          certainly as you are here, just when that great sea of death is
          rolling before you, all the Egyptian hosts of your sins will harass
          you in the rear. All your sins will come bellowing after you; you will
          have your iniquities like wild winter wolves pursuing you, athrist for
          blood, and swift to slay. You will hear fiends howling in your ears.
          And when already the raging flood of Jordan hath made your bones
          shake, and your marrow quiver, just then you will see the red eyes of
          your sins peering through the darkness of your despair, and hear the
          howlings of your former transgressions, as they hound you to the pit,
          seeking after your soul's blood. Ah, then, my hearer, thou wilt have
          no cloudy pillar to give thee light; thou wilt have no pillar of
          darkness to confound thy foes; but thou wilt have behind thee all thy
          sins, and before thee that black sea of death, which thou art
          compelled to cross. But mark thee, those sins will swim that sea with
          thee; they will not be like the Egyptians which were drowned; but when
          thou art wading through the sea, thou wilt find thy sins like hounds
          fixing on a stag, drinking thy heart's blood. Ay, when thou hast
          landed in eternity, thou wilt find there was not a single one drowned
          in the sea, but that they are all alive; every sin grown into a giant,
          every lust brandishing a thousand arms, each arm bearing a thousand
          horrid fingers of flame, and each finger a claw of iron, which shall
          tear thy soul. Oh! I warn thee against these Egyptians of thy sins,
          for unless the blood be sprinkled on thy door-post and on thy lintel,
          and unless the destroying angel smite those sins for thee, they will
          assuredly follow thee across the sea. Methinks I see thee there! Thou
          art just in the midst of the Jordan. Poor soul! the river itself is
          work enough for a man to wade through it; for dying is not easy
          labour. The waters are rushing into his lips, and gurgling in his
          throat, like a whirlpool. See how he shakes. White as the floods
          around him, he quivers, like the very waves themselves. And, ah! just
          when in his fell despair, he shrieks -- see, the harpies feed him with
          black fruits of hell; and when he quivers most, see there the scalding
          brimstone of Almighty God rained upon his body. Just when he is
          shrieking in death's torments, then is it that Satan takes the
          opportunity to howl in his face, and show him his glaring eyes of
          fire, to terrify his poor soul, worse than death itself. Sinner! when
          thou diest, remember that thou wilt have to die two deaths, one death
          which we shall see, another death which we only know of by the
          shrieks, and groans, and anguish, which even we may hear on this side
          of the grave. But what thou wilt experience in the next world, I
          cannot picture to thee, I cannot tell thee; those dim shapes of horror
          I cannot paint to thee; those fierce flames of misery I cannot now
          describe; that doleful miserere of desolation, and that awful lament
          of eternity, I cannot endure to hear; I dare not lift the veil that
          conceals the dread scenes, which haunt the spirits of the ungodly
          departed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, what shalt thou do to escape this death? What canst thou
          do to be saved? Why, sinner, in the first place, of thyself thou canst
          do nothing at all. But, in the second place, there is one -- a Man,
          who can do all for thee. He is the Man Christ Jesus; if thou believest
          on him, filthy as thou art, and wretched, and outcast, and vile, thou
          shalt never see the second death, but shalt have eternal life abiding
          in thee; and when thou diest in this world, instead of black fiends to
          hound thee through the river, thou wilt have sweet angels playing o'er
          the stream, waiting to waft thee unto glory; thou wilt feel bright
          spirits fanning thy hot brow with their soft wings; thou wilt hear
          songs, sweet as the music of paradise, and when thy troubles are the
          strongest, thou wilt have a peace with God "which passeth all
          understanding;" a "joy unspeakable and full of glory," which shall
          enable thee to "swallow up death in victory." "He that believeth and
          is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
          damned." Poor, trembling, penitent sinner, put thine hand inside the
          hand of Christ; now fall on his mercy; "to-day, if you will hear his
          voice, harden not your heart." I beseech you for Christ's sake, "be ye
          reconciled to God." And if ye be penitents, may God give you faith
          that ye may be believers! As for the rest of you, remember, ere you
          go, I have told you no fable, but the truth. You may go away and say,
          "There is no hell." Well, suppose there is none, believers will be as
          well off as you are. But suppose there is -- and there is for a
          certainty -- suppose yourselves in it, you cannot then suppose
          yourselves out of it any more. May God grant his blessing, for Jesus'
          sake; turning many of you to righteousness.<br />
