          "And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall
          come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts."
          -- Haggai 2:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE second temple was never intended to be as magnificent as the
          first. The first was to be the embodiment of the full glory of the
          dispensation of symbols and types, and was soon to pass away. This
          comparative feebleness had been proved by the idolatry and apostasy of
          the people Israel, and when they returned to Jerusalem they were to
          have a structure that would be sufficient for the purposes of their
          worship, but they were not again to be indulged with the splendours of
          the former house which God had erected by the hand of Solomon. Had it
          been God's Providence that a temple equally magnificent as the first
          should be erected, it might have been very readily accomplished. Cyrus
          appears to have been obedient to the divine will, and to have been a
          great favourer of the Jews, but he expressly by edict diminished the
          length of the walls and gave express command that the walls should
          never be erected so high as before. We have also evidence that a like
          decree was made by Darius, an equally great friend of the Jews, who
          could with the lifting of his finger have outdone the glory of
          Solomon's temple, but in God's Providence it was not arranged that so
          it should be, and though Herod, not a Jew, and only a Jew by religious
          pretence to suit his own particular purpose, lavished a good deal of
          treasure upon the second temple, for the pleasure of the nation he
          ruled, and to gain some favour from them, yet he rather profaned than
          adorned the temple, since he did not follow the prescribed
          architecture by which it ought to have been built, and he had not the
          divine approval upon his labours. No prophet ever commanded, and no
          prophet ever sanctioned, the labours of such a horrible wretch as that
          Herod. The reason seems to me to be this. In the second temple, during
          the time it should stand, the dispensation of Christ was softly melted
          into the light of spiritual truth. The outward worship was to cease
          there. It seems right that it should cease in a temple that had not
          the external glory of the first. God intended there to light up the
          first beams of the spiritual splendour of the second temple, namely,
          his true temple, the Church, and he would put a sign of decay on the
          outward and visible in the temple of the first. Yet he declares by his
          servant, Haggai, that the glory of the second temple should be greater
          than the first. It certainly was not so as in respect of gold, or
          silver, or size, or excellency of architecture; and yet it truly was
          so, for the glory of the presence of Christ was greater than all the
          glory of the old temple's wealth; and the glory of having the gospel
          preached in it, the glory of having the gospel miracles wrought in its
          porches by the apostles and by the Master, was far greater than any
          hecatombs of bullocks and he-goats -- the glory of being, as it were,
          the cradle of the Christian Church, the nest out of which should fly
          the messengers of peace, who, like doves, should bear the olive branch
          throughout the world. I take it that the decadence of the old system
          of symbols was a most fitting preparation for the incoming of the
          system of grace and truth in the person of Jesus Christ; and the
          second temple hath this glory which excelleth, that while the first
          was the glory of the moon in all its splendour, the second is the moon
          going down: the sun is rising beyond her, gilding the horizon with the
          first beams of the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend to speak to you at this time about the true spiritual temple;
          the true second temple, the spiritual temple, which, I think, is here
          spoken of -- although the second temple literally is also intended --
          the true spiritual temple built up, according to the text, of the
          desire of all nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find this passage a very difficult one in the original; and it bears
          several meanings in itself. The first meaning that I give you, though
          it runs contrary to the great majority of Christian expositors, is the
          most accurate explanation of the original. We shall bring in the other
          explanations by-and-by. Reading it thus, "I will shake all nations,"
          and the desire -- the desirable persons, the best part, or as the
          Septuagint reads it, the elect of all nations -- shall come. They
          shall come -- the true temple of God, and they shall be the living
          stones that shall compose it; or, as others read it, "The desirable
          things of all nations shall come," which is, no doubt, the meaning,
          because the eighth verse gives the key: "The silver is mine, and the
          gold is mine, saith the Lord of Hosts." The desirable things of all
          nations are to be brought in as voluntary offerings to this true
          second temple, this spiritual living temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us begin, then, and take that sense first, and in this case we are
          told, in the text concerning this second temple, what these living
          stones are: --
        </p>
        <p>I. THE HISTORICAL DESIRE OF ALL NATIONS SHALL COME.</p>
        <p>
          The choice men, the pick, the best of all men shall come and
          constitute the true temple of God. Not the kings and princes, not the
          great and noble after the flesh -- these are but the choice of men
          after the manner of man's choice; but not many great men after the
          flesh, not many mighty are chosen and called; but still, those whom
          God chooses must be the choice ones of mankind. They will not claim to
          be so by nature; on the contrary, they will repudiate any idea of any
          natural betterness in themselves. But God sees them as what they are
          to be, as what he intends them to be, as what he makes them to be, and
          in this respect they are the desire, they are the choice of all
          nations. To God, his people are his royal treasure, his secret jewels,
          the treasury of kings -- they are very precious in his sight. Their
          very death is precious. He keeps record of their bones, and will raise
          their dust at the last day. If the nation did but know it, the saints
          in a nation are the aristocracy of that nation. Those who fear God are
          the very soul, and marrow, and backbone of a nation. For their sakes
          God has preserved many a nation. For their sakes he gives unnumbered
          blessings. "Ye are the salt of the earth": the earth were putrid
          without them. "Ye are the light of the world": the world would be dark
          without them. They are the desire, I say, though often the world
          treats them with contempt, and would cast them out. It has ever been
          thus with the blind world -- to treat its best friends worst, and its
          worst enemies often receive the most royal entertainment. Now what a
          joy it is to us to think that God has been pleased to make unto
          himself a people according to his own sovereign will and good
          pleasure, and that he has made these to be the desirable ones out of
          all nations -- that with these choice and elect ones he will build up
          his Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text not only tell us of the stones, but of the remarkable
          mode of architecture. "The desire of all nations shall come" -- they
          shall be brought together. Human means shall be used to bring each one
          to its place, to excavate each one from its quarry; but while it is
          God who speaketh, he speaks like God, for he uses shalls and wills
          most freely, and according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in
          Christ Jesus, or ever the earth was, so shall the fulfilment be. We
          who preach the gospel may preach with devout assurance of success. The
          desire of all nations shall come. Out of this congregation the truly
          desirable ones shall come to Christ. Out of the soil in which the
          sower sowed -- the honest and good ground -- is brought forth the
          harvest. Out of the nations are some choice spirits who come; some
          whom the Lord looks upon with great delight, and these shall come. We
          do not labour in vain, neither do we spend our strength for nought. We
          fall back upon the doctrine of divine working and divine choice for
          consolation -- certainly not for an excuse for indolence, but for
          consolation when we have done our best, that God is glorified in the
          end -- "the desire of all nations shall come."
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you will notice in the whole text, it appears that they do not
          come without much shaking. In one sense, no man comes to God with
          compulsion; and in another sense, no man comes without compulsion. You
          see two boxes opened. There are two ways of opening them. You see one
          box wrenched: there has been used evidently rough means. Who opened
          it? A thief. God never opens men's hearts in that way. You see another
          box open -- no sign of damage, no sign of any particular labour. Who
          opened it? The person who had the key -- probably the owner. Hearts
          belong to God, and he has the keys and opens them -- sweetly opens
          them. And yet, though no force is used, that puts aside the positive,
          free agency of man which God interferes not with; yet there is a
          spiritual force which may well be described as a shaking. It is only
          when the tree of the nation has a thorough shaking, that at last the
          prime, ripe fruit will drop down into the great Master's lap. He
          shakes by Providence, by the movement of the human conscience. He
          shakes by the impulses of his Holy Spirit; he shakes the spirit, and
          as the result the desirable persons out of all the nations are brought
          to himself. Stones that he would have, come at last out of the quarry,
          and he builds them up into a temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now observe that these persons, according to another rendering of
          the text, when they come to build up the Church, they always bring
          their desire with them -- they bring with them the most desirable
          thing. The desirable things of all nations shall give the silver, and
          the gold, and so on. He that comes to Christ brings with him all he
          has, and he has not come to Christ who has left his true substance
          behind him. What, now, is the desire of all the nations when hearts
          are renewed? Well, silver and gold will always be desirable, and men
          who give their hearts to Christ will bring that they have of that to
          Christ. But the most desirable things of manhood are not metals --
          dirt, mere dross, hard materialisms -- no, the desirable things of
          manhood are things of the soul, the heart, the spirit; and into the
          temple, the great second temple, there shall come, not masses of gold
          and silver merely, that can adorn with outward splendour, but also
          love, and faith, and holy virtue, more priceless than gems, far richer
          in value than rarest mines. Oh! what a sight the Church of God is when
          holy angels look upon it. We hear of some of the first Spanish
          invaders going into the temple of Peru, and seeing floors, roofs, and
          walls made of slabs of gold, and standing astonished. But oh! in the
          Church there are slabs of faith on the floor of that great temple, and
          walls of love, of Christian self-sacrifice, and roofs of holy joy and
          Christian consolation. It is a temple that makes spiritual eyes flash
          with gladness. What care they for the splendour of kings and princes?
          But they care much for the true, desirable things of nations -- holy
          emotions, holy desires, ascriptions of gratitude, and devout acts of
          service of the Lord God. Oh! how glorious is the second temple then,
          when the desirable men come to it, and bring with them all the
          desirable things to make it glorious in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then this temple, thus built and thus adorned, will continue. The
          text implies that "I will shake all nations." The apostle says that
          this signifies the things that can be shaken; that the things that
          cannot be shaken will remain, and that the desire of all nations must
          be put down as a thing that cannot be shaken. The Church, then, shall
          never be shaken, and the precious things that the Church gives to her
          God shall not be shaken. Time will change many things. Great princes
          will be considered mere beggars by-and-by in the esteem of men who
          know how to judge by character. Great men will shrivel into very small
          things -- when they come to be tried, even by posterity. And the
          judgement-day -- ah! how will that try the great ones of this earth?
          But the Christian Church -- the very gates of hell shall not prevail
          against her. Time shall not be able so much as to chip one of her
          polished stones. Her treasures of faith, and what not, the rich things
          that God hath given her -- these things shall never be stolen: they
          can never be shaken. And then the crown of all is, "I will fill this
          house with my glory," saith the Lord. This is the reason, the great
          charm of it all. God himself dwells, as he dwells nowhere else, in his
          glory. The Church, which we think two, and call militant and
          triumphant, is but one, after all, and God dwelleth in it. Oh! if we
          had but eyes to see it, the glory of God on earth is not much less
          than the glory of God in heaven, for the glory of a king in peace is
          one thing, but the glory of a conqueror in war is another thing,
          though I know which I prefer; yet if I transfer the figure, I have no
          preference between the glory of the God of peace in the midst of his
          obedient servants in his ivory palaces, and the glory of the Lord of
          Hosts in the thick of this heavenly war, as he conflicts with human
          evil, and brings forth glory to his saints out of all the mischief
          that Satan seeks to do to his throne and to his sceptre. God is known
          in the Jerusalem below, as well as in the Jerusalem above. "The Lord
          is in the midst of her." Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God
          hath shined. God is in the midst of her: she shall not be moved; and
          though the kings gather together for her destruction, yet his presence
          is the river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God. Yes,
          glorious things may well be spoken of Zion when we have such stones as
          precious men, such gifts as precious graces, such abiding character as
          God gives, and such a presence as the presence of God Himself. But now
          in the next place, if we take the other rendering of the text: --
        </p>
        <p>
          II. THE GLORY OF THE SPIRITUAL SECOND TEMPLE IS ACTUALLY THE
          INCARNATION OF CHRIST.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will shake all nations," and he who is the desire of all nations
          shall come -- a rendering which is not incorrect, and is established
          by a great mass of theologians, though, according to some of the
          ablest critics, a rendering scarcely to be sustained by the original.
          He who is the desire of all nations shall come, and that shall be the
          glory of the second spiritual temple. Jesus Christ, then, is the
          desire of all nations, if so we read the text, and this is doubtless
          true. All nations have a dark and dim desire for him. I say a dark
          desire, for without that adjective I could scarcely speak the truth.
          Most interesting chapters have been written by students of the history
          of mankind upon the preparedness of men's hearts for the coming of
          Christ at his incarnation. It is very certain that almost all nations
          have a tradition of the coming one. The Jews, of course, expected the
          Messiah. There were persons instructed according to the culture of
          various nations, which, though they do not expect the Messiah quite so
          clearly as the Jews, had almost as shrewd a guess as to what he might
          be and do as the mere ritualistic and Pharisaic Jews had. There was a
          notion all over the world at that time of Christ's coming, that some
          great one was to descend from heaven, and to come into this world for
          this world's good. He was in that respect darkly and dimly the desire
          of all nations. But in all nations there have been some persons more
          instructed to whom Christ has really been the object of desire with
          much more of intelligence. Job was a Gentile and a fearer of God. We
          have no reason to believe that Job was a solitary specimen of
          enlightened persons: we have reason rather to hope that in all
          countries all over the world God has had a chosen people, who have
          known and feared him, who have not had all the light which has been
          given to us, but who better used what light they had, and were guided
          by his secret Spirit to much more of light, perhaps, than we think it
          right, with our little knowledge, to credit them with. These, then, as
          representatives of all the nations, were desiring the coming of the
          great Deliverer, the incarnate God; and in this sense,
          representatively, the whole of the world was desiring Christ in that
          higher sense, and he was the desire of all nations. But, my brethren,
          does this mean, or does it not mean, that Christ is exactly what all
          the nations need? If they did but know, if they could but understand
          him, he is just what they would desire and should desire. Were their
          reason taught rightly, and were their minds instructed by the Spirit
          to desire the best in all the world, Christ is just what they want.
          All the world desire a way to God. Hence men set up priests and anoint
          them with oil, and smear them with I know not what, only that they may
          be mediators between them and God. They must have something to come
          between their guilt and God's glorious holiness. Oh; if they knew it,
          what they want is Christ. You want no priest, but the great "Apostle
          and High Priest of our profession." You want no mediator with God, but
          the one Mediator, the man Christ Jesus, who is also equal with God.
          Oh! world, why wilt thou gad about to seek this priest and that other
          deceiver, when he whom thou wantest is appointed by the Most High? He
          whom Jacob saw in his dream as the ladder which reached from earth to
          heaven is the only means -- the Son of Man and yet the Son of God. The
          world wants a peacemaker; oh! how badly it wants it now! I seem as I
          walk my garden, as I go to my pulpit, as I go to my bed, to hear the
          distant cries and moans of wounded and dying men. We are so
          familiarised each day with horrible details of slaughter, that if we
          give our minds to the thought, I am sure we must feel a nausea, a
          perpetual sickness creeping over us. The reek and steam of those
          murderous fields, the smell of the warm blood of men flowing out on
          the soil, must come to us and vex our spirits. Earth wants a
          peacemaker, and it is he, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews, and
          the friend of Gentiles, the Prince of Peace, who will make war to
          cease unto the ends of the earth. Man wants a purifier. Very many
          nations feel, somehow or other, that political affairs do not go as
          one could wish. There are great exellences in personal government, but
          great disadvantages. There are great excellences in republican
          government, but great disadvantages. There are supreme excellences, as
          we think, in our own form of government, but a great many things to be
          amended, for all that; and this world is altogether out of joint; it
          is a crazy old concern, and does not seem as if it could be amended
          with all the tinkering of our reformers in the lapse of years. The
          fact is, it wants the Maker, who made it, to come in and put it to
          rights. It needs the Hercules that is to turn the stream right through
          the Aegean stable; it wants the Christ of God to turn the stream of
          his atoning sacrifice right through the whole earth, to sweep away the
          whole filth of ages, and it never will be done unless he does it. He
          is the one, the true Reformer, the true rectifier of all wrong, and in
          this respect the desire of all nations. Oh! i If the world could
          gather up all her right desire; if she could condense in one cry all
          her wild wishes; if all true lovers of mankind could condense their
          theories and extract the true wine of wisdom from them; it would just
          come to this, we want an Incarnate God, and you have got the Incarnate
          God! Oh! nations, but ye know it not! Ye, in the dark, are groping
          after him, and know not that he is there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, I may add, Christ is certainly the desire of all nations in
          this respect, that we desire him for all nations. Oh! that the world
          were encompassed in his gospel! Would God the sacred fire would run
          along the ground, that the little handful of corn on the top of the
          mountains would soon make its fruit to shake like Lebanon. Oh! when
          will it come, when will it come that all the nations shall know him?
          Let us pray for it: let us labour for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one other meaning I may give to this: he is the desirable one of
          all nations, bringing back the former translation of this text. He is
          the choice one of all nations. He is the chief among ten thousand, and
          the altogether lovely. He, whom we love, is such an one that he can
          never be matched by another, his rival could not be found amongst the
          sons of men. There is none like him; there is none like him amongst
          the angels of light; there is none that can stand in comparison with
          him. The desire, the one that ought to be desired, the most desirable
          of all the nations, is Jesus Christ, and it is the glory of the
          Christian Church, which is the second temple that Christ is in her,
          her head, her Lord. It is never her glory that she condescends to make
          an iniquitous union with the State. It is her glory that Christ is her
          sole King; it is her glory that he is her sole Prophet, and that he is
          her sole Priest, and that he then gives to all his people to be kings
          and priests with him, himself the centre and source of all their glory
          and their power.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot stay longer, though the theme tempts me, but must just give
          you the last word, which is this, the visible glory of the true second
          temple will be Christ's second coming. He, himself, is her glory,
          whether at his first coming, or at his second coming. The Church will
          be no more glorious at the second coming than now. "What!" say you,
          "no more glorious!" No; but more apparently glorious. Christ is as
          glorious on the cross as he is on the throne; it is the appearance
          only that shall alter. "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the
          sun in the kingdom of their Father," but they evermore are brightness
          itself, in the person of Jesus Christ. Now, brethren, we are to
          expect, as long as this world lasts, that all things will shake that
          are to be moved. They will go on shaking. We call the world sometimes
          "terra firma"; it is not this world, surely, that deserves such a name
          as that; there is nothing stable beneath the stars; all things else
          will shake, and as the shaking goes on, Jesus Christ will, to those
          who know him, become more and more their desire. I suppose, if the
          world went on, in some things mending and improving, and were to go up
          to a point, we should not want Christ to come in a hurry; we would
          rather that things should be perpetuated; but the shaking will make
          Christ more and more the desire of the nations. "The whole creation
          groaneth," is groaning up to now, but it will groan more and more "in
          pain together travailing" -- the apostle saith -- "even until now."
          The travailing pains grow worse and worse, and worse, and it will be
          so with this world; it will travail till at last it must come to the
          consummation of her desire. The Church will say, "Come, Lord Jesus."
          She will say it with gathering earnestness; she will continue still to
          say it, though there are intervals in which she will forget her Lord,
          but still her heart's desire will be that he will come; and at last he
          will surely come and bring to this world not only himself, the desire
          of all nations, but all that can be desired, for those days of his,
          when he appeareth, shall be to his people as the days of heaven upon
          earth, the days of their honour, the days of their rest -- the day in
          which the kingdoms shall belong unto Christ. Oh! brethren, it is not
          for me to go into details on a subject which would require many
          discourses, and which could not be brought out in the few last words
          of a discourse. But here is the great hope of that splendid building,
          the Church, which is desired. Her glory essentially lies in the
          Incarnate God, who has come into her midst. Her glory manifestly will
          lie in the second coming of that Incarnate God, when he shall be
          revealed from heaven to those that look and are waiting for and
          hasting unto the coming of the Son of God -- looking for him with
          gladsome expectation. And this is the joy of the Church. He has gone,
          but he has left word, "I will come again, and will receive you unto
          myself, that where I am, ye may be also." Remember the words that were
          spoken of the angels to the Church, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
          here, gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus who is gone up from you
          into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go up
          into heaven." In propria persona -- in very deed and truth, he shall
          come: --
        </p>
        <p>"These eyes shall see him in that day,</p>
        <p>The God that died for me:</p>
        <p>And all my rising bones shall say,</p>
        <p>Lord, who is like to thee?"</p>
        <p>
          Then shall come the adoption, the raising of the body, the reception
          of a glory to that body re-united to the soul, such as we have not
          dreamed of, for eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it
          entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for
          them that love him. Though he hath revealed them unto us by His Holy
          Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
          God, yet have our ears heard but little thereof, and we have not
          received the full discovery of the things that shall be hereafter. The
          Lord bless you! May you all be parts of his Church, have a share in
          his glory, and a share in the manifestation of that glory at the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear hearer, I would send thee away with this one query in thine ear
          -- Is Christ thy desire? Couldest thou say, with David, "He is all my
          salvation and all my desire"? Could you gather up your feet in the
          bed, with dying Jacob, and say, "I have waited for thy will, O God"?
          By your desire shall you be known. The desire of the righteous shall
          be granted. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee
          the desire of thine heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the desire of many is a grovelling desire: it is a sinful desire:
          it is a disgraceful desire -- a desire which, if it be attained, the
          attainment of it will afford very brief pleasure. Oh! sinner let thy
          desires go after Christ. Remember, if thou wouldest have him, thou
          hast not to earn him -- fight for him -- win him -- but he is to be
          had for the asking. "Lay hold," says the apostle, "on eternal life."
          As if it were ours, if we did but grip it. God give us grace to lay
          hold on eternal life, for Jesus from the cross is saying, "Look unto
          me, and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth," and from his throne of
          glory he still is saying, "Come unto me," exalted on high, to give
          repentance and remission of sin, and he will give them both to those
          who seek him. Seek him, then, this night. God grant it for his Son's
          sake. Amen.
