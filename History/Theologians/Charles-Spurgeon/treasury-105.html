            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              This Psalm is a prayer far more in spirit than in words. The
              formal petitions are few—but a strong stream of supplication runs
              from beginning to end, and like an under-current, finds its way
              heavenward through the moanings of grief and confessions of faith
              which make up the major part of the Psalm.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              It is a prayer of the afflicted, or of "a sufferer, "and it bears
              the marks of its parent age; as it is recorded of Jabez that "his
              mother bore him with sorrow," so may we say of this Psalm. Yet as
              Rachel's <i>Benoni</i>, or child of sorrow, was also her Benjamin,
              or son of her right hand—so is this Psalm as eminently expressive
              of consolation as of desolation. It is scarcely correct to call it
              a penitential Psalm, for the sorrow of it is rather of one
              suffering, than sinning. It has its own bitterness, and it is not
              the same as that of the Fifty-first Psalm.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The sufferer is afflicted more for others than for himself, more
              for Zion and the house of the Lord, than for his own house.

              >The best of men are not always able to stem the torrent of
              sorrow</i

            >. When a cup is overwhelmed or turned bottom over, all that is in
            it is naturally poured out; great trouble removes the heart from all
            reserve and causes the soul to flow out without restraint; it is
            well when that which is in the soul is such as may be poured out in
            the presence of God, and this is only the case where the heart has
            been renewed by divine grace.
            <p align="justify">
              The word rendered "complaint" has in it none of the idea of
              fault-finding or repining—but should rather be rendered
              "moaning,"—the expression of pain, not of rebellion. To help the
              memory we will call this Psalm THE PATRIOT'S LAMENT.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">SUBJECT.</p>
            <p align="justify">
              This is a patriot's lament over his country's distress. He arrays
              himself in the griefs of his nation as in a garment of sackcloth,
              and casts her dust and ashes upon his head as the ensigns and
              causes of his sorrow. He has his own private woes and personal
              enemies, he is moreover sore afflicted in body by sickness—but the
              miseries of his people cause him a far more bitter anguish, and
              this he pours out in an earnest, pathetic lamentation. Not,
              however, without hope does the patriot mourn; he has faith in God,
              and looks for the resurrection of the nation through the
              omnipotent favor of the Lord; this causes him to walk among the
              ruins of Jerusalem, and to say with hopeful spirit, "No, Zion, you
              shall never perish. Your sun is not set forever; brighter days are
              in store for you." It is in vain to inquire into the precise point
              of Israel's history which thus stirred this patriot's soul, for
              many a time was the land oppressed, and at any of her sad seasons
              this song and prayer would have been a most natural and
              appropriate utterance.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">DIVISION.</p>
            <p align="justify">
              In the first part of the Psalm, 1-11, the moaning monopolizes
              every verse, the lamentation is unceasing, sorrow rules the hour.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The second portion, from 12-28, has a vision of better things, a
              view of the gracious Lord, and his eternal existence, and care for
              his people, and therefore it is interspersed with sunlight as well
              as shaded by the cloud, and it ends up right gloriously with calm
              confidence for the future, and sweet restfulness in the Lord. The
              whole composition may be compared to a day which, opening with
              wind and rain, clears up at noon and is warm with the sun,
              continues fine, with intervening showers, and finally closes with
              a brilliant sunset.

              Sincere supplicants are not content with praying for praying's
              sake, they desire really to reach the ear and heart of the great
              God. It is a great relief in time of distress to acquaint others
              with our trouble, we are eased by their hearing our
              lamentation—but
              <i

                sympathizing listener to our plaint</i

              would be the direst of all our woes if we could be indisputably
              convinced that with God there is neither hearing nor answering; he
              who could argue us into so dreary a belief would do us no better
              service than if he had read us our death-warrants.

              When sorrow rises to such a height that words become too weak a
              medium of expression, and prayer is intensified into a cry, then
              the heart is even more urgent to have audience with the Lord. If
              our cries do not enter within the veil, and reach to the living
              God, we may as well cease from prayer at once, for it is idle to
              cry to the winds. But, blessed be God, the philosophy which
              suggests such a hideous idea is disproved by the facts of every
              day experience, since thousands of the saints can declare, "Truly,

              that our heavenly Patron will grant us the best gifts in the best

              In these two verses the psalmist has gathered up a variety of
              expressions all to the same effect; in them all he entreats an
              audience and answer of the Lord, and the whole may be regarded as
              a sort of preface to the prayer which follows.

              My grief has made life unsubstantial to me, I seem to be but a
              puff of vapor which has nothing in it, and is soon dissipated. The
              metaphor is very admirably chosen, for, to the unhappy, life seems
              not merely to be frail—but to be surrounded by so much that is
              darkening, defiling, blinding, and depressing, that, sitting down
              in despair, they compare themselves to men wandering in a dense
              fog, and themselves so dried up thereby that they are little
              better than pillars of smoke. When our days have neither light of
              joy nor fire of energy in them—but become as a smoking flax which
              dies out ignobly in darkness, then have we cause enough to appeal
              to the Lord that he would not utterly quench us.

              have had to question its reality, and fear that it never was
              anything more than a smoke; we have had the most convincing
              evidence of its weakness, for we could not derive even the
              smallest comfort from it, any more than a chilled traveler can

              psalmist was moved to grief by a view of national calamities, and
              these so wrought upon his patriotic soul that he was wasted with
              anxiety, his spirits were dried up, and his very life was ready to
              expire. There is hope for any country which owns such a son; no

              him. What a joy is this! We may lose our dearest earthly
              friends—but not our heavenly Friend. Men's days are often suddenly
              cut short, and at the longest they are but few—but the years of
              the right hand of the Most High cannot be counted, for they have
              neither first nor last, beginning nor end. O my soul, rejoice in
              the Lord always, since he is always the same.

              The Psalmist had early in the psalm looked forward to a future
              generation, and here he speaks with confidence that such a race
              would arise and be preserved and blessed of God.

              Any way, it is full of good cheer to us; we may plead for the
              Lord's favor to our seed, and we may expect that the cause of God
              and truth will revive in future generations. Let us hope that
              those who are to succeed us will not be so stubborn, unbelieving
              and erring as we have been. If the church has been diminished and
              brought low by the lukewarmness of the present race, let us
              entreat the Lord to raise up a better order of men, whose zeal and
              obedience shall win and hold a long prosperity. May our own dear
              ones be among the better generation who shall continue in the
              Lord's ways, obedient to the end.

              God does not neglect the children of his servants. It is the rule
              that <i>Abraham's Isaac </i>should be the Lord's, that
              <i>Isaac's Jacob </i>should be beloved of the Most High, and that
              <i>Jacob's Joseph </i> should find favor in the sight of God.
              <i>Grace is not hereditary</i>—yet God loves to be served by the
              same family time out of mind, even as many great landowners feel a
              pleasure in having the same families as tenants upon their estates
              from generation to generation.

              Here is Zion's hope, her sons will build her up, her offspring
              will restore her former glories. We may, therefore, not only for
              our own sakes—but also out of love to the church of God, daily
              pray that our sons and daughters may be saved, and kept by divine
              grace even unto the end—established before the Lord.

              We have thus passed through the cloud, and in the next psalm we
              shall bask in the sunshine. Such is
              <i>the chequered experience of the believer</i>. Paul in the
              seventh of Romans cries and groans, and then in the eighth
              rejoices and leaps for joy. Just so, from the moaning of the
              hundred and second psalm, we now advance to the songs and dancing
              of the hundred and third, blessing the Lord that, "though weeping
              may endure for a night, joy comes in the morning."
