        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.238)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 13th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out
          to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down
          the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all
          Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had
          utterly destroyed them all." -- 2 Chronicles 31:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT is a pleasant sight to behold the thousands assembled together for
          the worship of God, but it is lamentable to reflect, how often the
          reverence which is exhibited in the sanctuary is lost when the
          thresh-hold is passed. How frequently the most earnest address of the
          preacher is forgotten, and becomes as "the morning cloud, and as the
          early dew." We very often go up to the house of God, and imagine that
          we have done our duty when we have gone through the round of the
          service: self-satisfied, we return each man to his home. Oh that we
          would remember that the preaching of the gospel is but the sowing!
          afterward the reaping must come. To-day we do, as it were, lay the
          first stone of an edifice; and henceforward that edifice must be
          built, stone by stone, through your daily practice, until at last the
          top-stone is brought forth with shoutings of joy and gladness. Well
          said the Scotch woman, when her husband asked her, on her return from
          the house of God sooner than usual, "Wife, is the sermon all done?"
          "Nay, Donald," said she; "it is all said; but it is nae begun to be
          done." There was wisdom in her pithy saying, a wisdom which we too
          frequently forget. Praying is the end of preaching. Reformation,
          conversion, regeneration -- these are the ends of the ministry, and a
          holy life should be the result of your devout worship. We have read in
          your hearing the story of the great Passover, which was held in the
          days of Hezekiah. One almost envies the men of that, time; we might
          almost wish that we could be carried back some thousands of years,
          that we might have been there to see the solemn sacrifices, to behold
          the priests, as with joyous countenances they sang the praises of God,
          and to have mingled in that countless throng, which stood at one hour
          to listen to the Levite, at another hour gathered round the priest;
          again, at another season clapped their hands for joy at the sound of
          the golden trumpets, and then outvied the trumpets by the magnificent
          sound of their vocal praise. But, beloved, when that scene had
          vanished, and the multitude had gone to their homes, Hezekiah might
          have sat down and wept if there had not been a fitting effect from so
          great a gathering. Isaiah the prophet, I doubt not, was one of the
          gladdest in all the crowd. Oh, how his noble heart beat for joy, and
          how eloquent was his seraphic tongue when he preached among the
          people, and cried, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
          waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come,
          buy wine and milk without money and without price." But sad indeed
          would his heart have been, notwithstanding all the delightful
          excitement of the day, if he had not seen some glorious consequences
          result from the ministrations and from the great gatherings of the
          people. In our text we are informed, that the Passover did not end
          with the seven days twice-told of its extraordinary celebration. The
          Passover, it is true, might end, but not its blessed effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there are three effects which ought always to follow our solemn
          assembly upon the Lord's day, especially when we gather in such a
          number as the present, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving. We should
          go home and first break our false gods; next, cut down the very groves
          in which we have been wont to delight, and after that break the altars
          which though dedicated to the God of Israel, are not according to
          Scripture, and therefore ought to be broken down, albeit, they be even
          dedicated to the true God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To begin then, the true result of all our gatherings should be, in
          the first place, to BREAK TO PIECES ALL OUR IMAGES. "Thou shalt have
          none other gods before me." Every place is before God. Every thing is
          before his face and open to him. Therefore by this command we
          understand that we are in no way, and in no sense to have another god,
          but the Lord our God. What! do you ask, are we a nation of idolaters?
          Can this text pertain to us? Would not this be a proper rebuke to
          address the Hindostanee, or to speak to the benighted inhabitants of
          the center of Africa? Might we not exhort them to serve Jehovah and to
          dash the gods of their fathers in pieces? Assuredly we might. But
          imagine not that idolatry is confined to nations of a swarthy hue. It
          is not in Africa alone that false gods are worshipped; idols are
          worshipped in this land also, and by many of you. Yea, all of us,
          until renewed by divine grace, worship gods which our own hands have
          made, and we do not fear, and love, and obey the living God with our
          entire and exclusive homage. Once however, let grace be received into
          the heart, let the soul be renewed by the Holy Spirit, once drink in
          the free life of Jesus, and these false gods must be broken in pieces
          at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first god who is worshipped among us is one called
          self-righteousness. The Pharisees were the high priests of this god;
          they burnt incense every morning and every evening before him, but he
          has ten thousand times ten thousand worshippers still left. Among your
          respectable classes of society he is the received divinity. If a man
          be respectable, he thinks it all-sufficient. Among your moralists,
          this is the great god before which they bow down and worship. Nay,
          among sinners themselves, men whose character is not moral, there is,
          nevertheless, found an altar to this god within their hearts. I have
          known a drunkard self-righteous, for he has declared that he did not
          swear; and I have known a swearer self-righteous, for he trusted he
          should be saved because he did not steal. Until we are brought to know
          our own lost and ruined condition, self-righteousness is the god
          before which every one of us will prostrate ourselves. Oh, my dear
          friends, if we have worshipped God in this house to-day, let us go
          home determined to aim a blow, by the help of God, at self
          righteousness; let us go home and prostrate ourselves before God, and
          cry --
        </p>
        <p>"Vile and full of sin I am."</p>
        <p>
          "Lord, I confess before thee, that I have no good works in which to
          trust, no self-righteousness on which I can rely. I cast my boastings
          away; I come to thee as a poor, guilty, helpless sinner; Lord, save,
          or I perish.'" That is the way to dash down this god. Paul once
          worshipped this mighty one, and worshipped him so well, that, after
          the "most straitest sect of his religion, he lived a Pharisee." Never,
          in his opinion, so good a man as himself. He served this god with all
          his mind, and soul, and strength. But, once upon a time, as he was
          going to Damascus to sacrifice to this god with the blood of believers
          in Christ, the Lord Jesus looked upon him out of heaven, and said,
          "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Prostrate tell Saul, and down
          went his self-righteousness too. Afterwards, you might hear him say,
          "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of Christ, by whom
          the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." May we all go
          home thus, and pull down our self-righteousness. Stop a moment, I am
          not quite sure that we can do this all at once. My self-righteousness
          I feel in my own heart, as something like those colossal statues of
          Egypt, and when I try to break it in pieces, I can but disfigure it; I
          manage to break a chip off here and a chip off there, but still there
          stands the statue, not in all its former symmetry, but still there. At
          any rate, if you and I cannot wholly get rid of our
          self-righteousness, let us never lay down the axe and the hammer until
          we have destroyed it. Let us go home to-day and have another blow at
          this old foe; let us go home to have another dash at the colossal god,
          and let us take up the chisel and the hammer, and once more try to
          disfigure him. This is the proper result of the ministrations of God's
          Word, to destroy and cut in pieces, and utterly break down our
          self-righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other gods still worshipped in this world, to be execrated
          with unrelenting indignation. There is one which is certain to be
          broken, so sure as ever a man becomes a Christian: I mean Bacchus,
          that jolly god whom so many adored in days of yore with mad revelry,
          and who is still worshipped by tens of thousands of Englishmen.
          Perhaps he is the great god of Britain. I am certain he has many
          temples, for there is scarcely a corner of any street in which we do
          not behold his image, or see his votaries pouring out libations before
          him. He is a god that is worshipped with reeling to and fro, and
          staggering. Men become drunken in his presence, and so do him homage.
          Now, ye that are drunkards, if ye become Christians, that will turn
          your cup bottom upwards once and for ever. There will be no more
          inebriety for you now. By the grace of God you will say, "They that be
          drunken are drunken in the night, but let us who are of the day be
          sober. I renounce this practice of drunkenness, I can have nothing
          more to do with it." Bless God there are many here present who have
          gone out of this hall to demolish this god. Oh! if it were right to
          relate the cases that have been told privately to us, we could tell
          you this very day, not of one, or two, or twenty but of hundreds, who,
          as we believe, once made their homes a hell, who treated their wives
          with brutality and their children with neglect; whose homes were
          empty, because every article they had was sold for accursed drink.
          They have heard the gospel not in word only, but also in power, and
          now their home is a paradise, their house is made glad with prayer,
          their children are brought up in the fear of the Lord. We have seen
          the wife's tear of gladness when she said, "The Lord be blessed for
          ever, and blessed be the name of the gospel, for a wretched woman has
          been made happy, and she who was but a drudge and a slave to one who
          was like a fiend, has now become the companion of one whom she reckons
          to be little short of an angel." Ay, may this be the effect with some
          of you, for there are some such here to-day, I doubt not, who still
          worship this all-degrading deity, the deity of drunkenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me tell you of another god, which is to be pulled down as
          certainly by any man who worships Jehovah aright, and that is the god
          of lust; Oh! this world is not so good as it seems to be. You scarcely
          hear the minister in these days talk of whoremongers, adulterers, and
          such like: but they are not all dead. There are such to be found, such
          in every congregation, I fear. Our streets have not yet become such as
          Chastity might pace at midnight, nor are the chief places of the earth
          become clean and purified. There is much hidden pollution to be
          dragged forth, and cast into Kishon. Even in high places, sin is
          tolerated, men are respectable who have sent their fellow-creatures to
          hell, and are going there themselves; but once let grace come into the
          heart, and away with these: the most darling lust is given up, and
          that which was thought to be the greatest pleasure, is now looked upon
          with abhorence and detestation. If thou, my hearer, livest in lust,
          and yet dost make profession of religion, away with thy profession,
          for it is an awful lie. Away with that profession, for it is an empty
          vanity! away with it! It will but add to thy destruction, and cannot
          save thee from the dreadful doom of the man that goeth on in his
          iniquity. A happy thing it is for a man when he goes from the house of
          God, with the resolve that lust shall be abandoned, and every sinful
          pleasure cast away.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, too, the gods of business, but I must not touch upon them,
          of course. The minister has nothing to do with business, he is told.
          Keep your counting-house door bolted always, let not the minister
          inside. But the minister knows why he is shut out. Is it not because
          there are secrets of your prisonhouse which you would not have
          revealed? There are things done which pass for honest among tradesmen,
          that if put in the balance of the sanctuary are found very wanting. I
          would that the result of our preaching upon our hearers should be such
          that their actions should be more upright and their conduct more
          Christ-like in their daily business. I have heard of a woman who once
          went to hear a minister, and when he called to see her on the Monday,
          he asked her what the text was. She replied, "It was a blessed sermon
          to me, sir, but I forget the text." "Well, what was the subject, my
          good woman." "Oh! I do not know; I forget now." "Well," said he, "it
          cannot have done you any good then." "Yes it did," said she, "for
          though I forgot the sermon, I did not forget to burn my bushel when I
          got home." The fact was, she had a bushel that gave false measure to
          her customers, and although she forgot what the sermon was about, she
          did not forget to burn her false measure. If any of you are in
          business and have false measures, though you may forget what I say, do
          not forget to break your yard measure, and to have your weights set
          right, and to remodel your business, and "to do unto others as ye
          would they should do unto you." Break the gods of your business in
          pieces, if so be ye have not followed with your whole heart the
          statutes of the God of Israel. If you cannot serve God in your daily
          business, then give such business up, or alter it so that you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Say now, who is there among us who has not some image to break? I have
          thought sometimes that I had broken all mine at one season, for I have
          had the will to do it; but lo! I have walked through the temple of my
          heart, and I have seen in some dark corner an idol still standing. Let
          it be cast down, I have said; and I have used the sledge-hammer upon
          it. But when I thought I had cleared all away, there was still one
          gigantic figure standing there; for you may be sure that there is one
          idol of which we can never thoroughly cleanse our hearts though we try
          and though by God's strength we give him a blow every day. It is the
          god of pride. He changes his shape continually; sometimes he calls
          himself humility, and we begin to bow before him, till we find we are
          getting proud of our humility. At another time he assumes the fashion
          of conscientiousness, and we begin to carp at this and cavil at the
          other, and all the while we are tampering with our own professed
          sanctity, and are bowing before the shrine of religious pride. We
          think sometimes we are praising God when we are praising ourselves,
          and we pray at times that God may prosper us in doing good, and our
          greatest desire is to be honored, not that his name should be
          glorified. This idol must be cast down; but it is of such a form and
          such a shape, that I suppose it will fare like Dagon. When the ark was
          brought into the house, it is said Dagon fell upon his face to the
          ground before the ark of the Lord, and his head and the palms of his
          hands were cut off, nevertheless the stump of Dagon remained. So will
          it be with us, I fear the stump of Dagon will still remain, do what we
          may. Then let us each to day go home to our closet and begin to open
          the door of the chambers of our hearts, and walk through them all, and
          say "What have I to break, what have I to knock down, what have I to
          destroy;" and let us be very careful that we do destroy all that we
          can get near. Oh my hearers! how I wish we were more watchful of the
          effects produced in ourselves by preaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us now go a step further, and consider what it is to CUT DOWN
          THE GROVES. Groves are the places where those images have been set up.
          There was nothing, mark you, positively sinful in the grove. There
          could not be anything wrong in a cluster of trees. They were very
          beautiful -- they were the work of God, but they had been used for an
          idolatrous purpose, and, therefore down they must come. Had some of
          the lax professors of this age been present, they would have said,
          "Break the god," -- that is right enough. Hammer away at him, dash him
          to pieces, but don't cut down the trees. You may use them for very
          proper purposes. Why, you may even go there to pray. There you may sit
          and refresh yourself, and beneath their grateful shade you may even
          worship the true God. "Nay," say these reformers. "We will cut down
          the trees and all, because the images have been harboured under their
          covert," Now, I am going to lift the axe to clear away some of the
          trees, where some of you at least have defiled yourselves with the
          false gods of this world's idolatry. The first grove of trees, at
          which I must strike, is the theater. I am told by some, that in the
          theater there is much that might do good. There are plays, they inform
          me, that might be profitably heard, and I believe there are. I am
          told, again, that there is something so pleasant, so agreeable, so
          interesting in them that one might be instructed there: and that
          especially do the plays of Shakespeare contain such noble sentiments,
          that a man must feel his soul elevated and his heart expanded while
          witnessing their performance. Nevertheless I will have this grove
          down, every bit of it. It is all very well for you to eulogize it; I
          will not argue with you; but false gods have been worshipped in these
          places, and are being worshipped still; so hew down every tree of
          them. Oh! you would have them spared, would you? Why, which tree in
          the whole grove is undefiled by a harlot? Which theater in the world
          is not the very den and nest of abominable iniquity, obscenity, and
          lust? Is it possible for any man to enter and come out of one of them
          without defilement? If it be possible, I suppose it is only so with
          men who are so bad that they cannot be made worse than they are, and
          therefore cannot be defiled. To the Christian mind, there is something
          hideous in the whole matter. He may believe that there were times when
          the theater might have been profitable. He looks back to the days of
          the Greeks and Romans, and feels that then it might have been the
          lever of civilization. But since those old times, he finds that the
          devil has become the god of the theater, and the god that is
          diligently worshipped there is none other than Beelzebub. And
          therefore he says, "No, if I be a Christian, by the grace of God, I
          will never tread that floor again. Let others go there if they please.
          If they can find an interest under the shadow of its trees, let them
          sit there; but I remember, in the days when I went there, I worshipped
          Bacchus, I worshipped iniquities of every shape. For me to go there,
          would be to put myself into temptations way. Therefore I will down
          with the tree, I abhor it; I pass by on the other side, rather than
          come in contact even with its shadow."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, men may make what apologies they please, but the thing is clear
          to me, that no man can be a true child of God and yet attend those
          haunts of vice. I care not though I may be thought too severe. We had
          better use severity than allow souls to perish unwarned God himself
          has annexed to the theater the warning of your own destruction; for,
          staring you in the face, there is a hand with these words written --
          "To the pit;" and, true enough, it is the short cut to hell, and to
          the pit that is bottomless. But there are other groves that must come
          down too; There is the tavern, -- like the grove, a very excellent
          thing in itself; the tavern is needed in some places for the
          refreshment of travelers, and the inn is a great advantage of
          civilization; but, nevertheless, the Christian man remembers, that in
          the tavern, false gods are worshipped; he recollects that the company
          of the taproom is not the fellowship of the saints, nor the general
          assembly and church of the firstborn, whose names are written in
          heaven. The Christian may have to go into the tavern, his business may
          sometimes take him there; but he will be like a man going through a
          shower of rain; he will carry an umbrella, while he is going through
          it, and he will get out of it as soon as he can. So will the Christian
          do, he will try and guard himself against evil while he is there, but
          not one moment longer will he stay than imperative necessity demands.
          The tavern, I have said, was originally an institute of civilization,
          and it is at this day a thing that cannot be given up, but,
          notwithstanding this, let no Christian, nor any pretender to
          Christianity, resort habitually to such places, nor let him sit down
          with the profane who generally assemble there. I believe there are
          Christian men who are often tempted into bad company by the benefit
          clubs and societies which are held in such places, if there are no
          benefit societies but those which are held in public-houses, trust to
          God, and have nothing to do with societies at all. But there are
          others; and you are under no necessity whatever, to injure and
          contaminate your character by connecting yourself with those who meet
          in such places and lead you into sin. "Well," says one, "but I can do
          it and yet I am not hurt." I dare say you can, I could not. If the
          coals did not burn me, yet they would blacken me; and, therefore, I
          would have nothing to do with them. There are some professors,
          however, who are like the old lady's coachman. She advertised for a
          coachman, and three waited on her. To one she said, "How near could
          you drive to danger?" "Madam," he replied, "I could drive, I dare say,
          within six inches, and yet be safe." "Then you will not suit me at
          all," said she. She asked the next, "How near can you drive me to
          danger?" "I would drive within a hair's breadth." "Then you will not
          suit me." The third was asked, "How near can you drive to danger?"
          "Madam," said he, "that is a thing I never tried; for I always drive
          as far off danger as ever I can." She said, "Then you will suit me."
          That is my advice to every professor of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must make the very same remark with regard to the pastimes, the
          puerile pastimes and enjoyments of the rich, and of those who meet for
          purposes, not of sin, but of what they call recreation. Dancing -- the
          ball-room -- is there anything sinful there? I say, No! no more than
          there was in the trees that surrounded the image. But nevertheless, I
          will cut the trees down, because of their association with the images.
          I must have done with every amusement of such a kind that I could not
          appear before my God whilst in the act. The Christian is to recollect,
          that "in such an hour as he thinks not the Son of Man cometh." Would
          he like his Master to come and find him in the society of the
          frivolous; engaged in the dizzy mazes of the dance? I trow not.
          Perhaps one of the last places he would like to be found in would be
          there. Dancing! while hell is filling and sinners are perishing! What!
          are Christian men to be the saviours of the world, and yet waste their
          time so? Are there no poor to be relieved, no sick to be visited? Are
          there no dens of this great metropolis that need to be pried into by
          the servants of Christ? Are there no children to be taught, are there
          no aged men who need leading to Jesus; is there nothing to be done in
          this great vineyard -- this great field of the Lord, so that a
          Christian could afford to waste his time so? Let the worldling do it
          if he likes, we have no right to talk to him about it. But amusements
          that are right for him are not right for us. Let him do as he pleases,
          but we are the servants of God. We protest that all we have and all we
          are is given up to Christ, and can that be consistent with the waste
          of time that is involved in the frivolous amusements in which so many
          are content to indulge? I do not condemn the thing itself, any more
          than I condemn the grove of trees. I condemn it for its associations
          with many things that are to be avoided by the Christian; jesting,
          lascivious and foolish talking, and many unholy thoughts, that must
          necessarily arise. Down with the trees altogether, because there have
          false gods been worshipped. You are too hard, a great deal, some will
          reply; well, I dare say I am, but I am not harder than God's Word. If
          I am, whatever is not according to God's Word, reject; but you will
          not find me beginning to temporize just yet I assure you. While I know
          a thing to be true, I am not the man to stammer in speaking it. What I
          would not do myself I would not have others do who are Christian men,
          and who are followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I must lift up the axe against another evil -- books. There are
          many books that are to be so esteemed by the Christian man, that they
          must be cut down like the groves of trees, not because they are bad in
          themselves, mark, but because there false gods are worshiped.
          Novel-reading is the rage of the present day. I go to a railway
          bookstall, and I cannot see a book that I can read. I get one, and it
          is all trash. I search to find something that would be really valuable
          but I am told, "It would not sell here." The fact is, nothing will
          sell but that which is light, and frothy, and frivolous; so every
          traveler is compelled to consume such food as that, unless he carry
          something better with him. Do I, therefore, say, that the Christian
          man must condemn all reading of fiction and novels? No, I do not, but
          I do say, that the mass of popular books published under the name of
          Light Literature is to be eschewed and cut down, for the simple reason
          that the moral of it is not that of piety and goodness; the tendency
          of the reading is not to bring the Christian towards heaven, but
          rather to retard and impede him in his good course. I lift up my axe
          against many a work that I cannot condemn, if I look at it
          abstractedly in itself, but which must come down, because I recollect
          how much of my own precious time I wasted in such vapid reading, and
          how many years in which I might have had fellowship with Christ have
          been cast away, whilst I have been foolishly indulging a vicious taste
          for the romantic and the frivolous. No, there are many things which
          are not wrong in themselves, but which nevertheless must be given up
          by the true Christian, because they have had, and do have association
          with things positively wrong. Just as these groves must be cut down --
          not because there can be a sin in trees, but because the trees have
          been associated with the worship of idols. You remember John Knox's
          memorable saying, when he turned the Romanists out, he went straight
          away to pull down their chapels. He gathered the mob together, and
          began to overhaul the whole of their places of worship. Why should
          John Knox meddle with them? " I'll pull the nests down," said he,
          "then I shall be sure that the birds will never come back." So I would
          today. I would not only drive away the birds -- the sin, the evil; but
          I would pull down the nest, so that there will be no temptation to you
          to come back again to the sin. "Come ye out from among them, and be ye
          separate, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will be a father unto
          you." Come out from the world, ye children of Christ. Have naught to
          do with their enjoyments, nor with their devices. Follow the Lamb
          whithersoever he goeth. Go not a whoring after these iniquities, but
          drink thou waters out of thine own cistern, and be thou always
          ravished with his love who is thy Lord, thy husband, thy hope, thy
          joy, thine all.

          III. Moreover, they not only broke the images, and cut down the
          groves, but they THREW DOWN THE HIGH PLACES, AND THE ALTERS OUT OF ALL
          JUDAH AND BENJAMIN. This was, perhaps, the least necessary work, but
          it showed the thoroughness of their desire to serve the Lord. These
          altars were built for the service of the true God, but they were built
          against his express command. God had said that he would have but one
          altar, namely, at Jerusalem. These people, to avoid inconvenience and
          trouble, thought they would build altars, wherever they lived, and
          there celebrate their worship. I can conceive that they worshipped
          Jehovah with all their hearts, and that He might graciously accept
          even such worship as that through Christ Jesus, overlooking their
          ignorance and casting their sin behind his backs. But now as their
          zeal was kindled, their consciences became scrupulous, so they
          resolved not only to avoid, the things that are positively sinful but
          they would have nothing to do with anything that is not positively
          right. So they began to cast down the altars of God, because they were
          not built according to God's law. This then is a third reformation,
          which ought to result from the ministry, and the assembling of the
          people together when we have times of refreshing from the presence of
          the Lord. There should be a casting down of everything in connection
          with the true worship, that is not according to the law of God and the
          word of God. As it was with the worship of Israel of old, so it is now
          with that of the Christian church. The pure becomes alloyed with the
          base, that which is genuine with that which is spurious, divine
          revelation with human tradition, and the inspired decrees of heaven
          with the inventions and devices of the children of men. Some fallacies
          are perpetuated from generation to generation, until the deep hue of
          antiquity tinges them over, makes them look venerable and speciously
          invites a reverence and regard to which they never had any legitimate
          claim. We have in this country, seven or eight different forms of the
          Christian religion. Some of these are at complete variance and
          contradiction with others. Some indeed, I verily think, are
          contradictory in themselves. We are all, I do trust, building on a
          sure foundation for eternity, if we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
          and abide by the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, notwithstanding
          our many grievous discrepancies, which must involve error. Evangelical
          Christians are to be found in every sect and denomination, bearing the
          name of our one common Lord; yea, there are some who as yet have never
          taken upon them his name by public profession, who devoutly follow him
          in secret. But, mark ye this, if the grace of God be once more
          restored to the church in all its fullness and the Spirit of God be
          poured out from on high, in all his sanctifying energy there will come
          such a shaking as has never been seen in our days. We want such an one
          as Martin Luther to rise from his tomb. If Martin Luther, were now to
          visit our so-called reformed churches, he would say with all his holy
          boldness "I was not half a reformer when I was alive before, now I
          will make thorough work of it." How he would adjure you to cast away
          your superstitions, to abolish all the rites and forms and ceremonies
          that are not of divine appointment, and once more in the integrity of
          simple faith, to worship the Lord God alone, in that way alone, which
          the Lord God himself has ordained. Let all these, like those altars of
          Judaism, be cast down to the ground and utterly put away. I desire not
          only to be a Christian, but to be fully a Christian, walking in all
          the ways of my blessed Master, with a perfect heart, and I desire for
          all my brethren and sisters in Christ here, not only that they may
          have grace enough to save their souls, but grace enough to purify them
          from all the devices of men, from every false doctrine, from every
          false practice, and every evil thing. Speak you now of doctrine? Are
          there not two kinds of doctrines professed among Christians, the one
          Arminian, and the other Calvinistic? We cannot be both right; it is
          impossible. The Arminian says, "God loves all men alike." "Not so,"
          says the Calvinist. "He has proved to many of us by his free and
          distinguishing grace that he has given us more than others, not for
          the merit of our deservings, but according to the riches of his mercy,
          and the counsel of his own will." The Arminian supposes, that Christ
          hath bought all men with his blood, and yet that multitudes of these
          redeemed ones perish. The Calvinist holds, that none can perish for
          whom Jesus died -- that his blood was never shed in vain and that of
          all those whom he hath redeemed, none shall ever perish. The Arminian
          teaches that though a man should be regenerated and become a child of
          God to-day, he may to-morrow be cast out of the covenant, and be as
          much a child of the devil as if no spiritual change had been wrought
          in him. "Not so," says the Calvinist, "Salvation is of God alone, and
          where once he begins he never leaves off, until he has finished the
          good work." How obvious it is that we cannot both be right in matters
          about which we so widely differ. I exhort you, therefore, my brothers
          and sisters, after you have broken your images and cut down your
          groves, go a step further, and break down the false altars. I can only
          say for myself, "If I be wrong, I desire to be set right," and for you
          I am solemnly concerned, "If you be wrong, may God help you to a right
          judgment, and bring you to see the truth, embrace it, and earnestly
          and valiantly maintain it. I like you to be charitable to others; but
          do not be too charitable to yourselves. Let others follow out their
          own conscientious convictions, but do you recollect, it is not your
          conscience that is to be your guide, but God's Word; and if your
          conscience is wrong, you are to bring it to God's Word that it may be
          reproved and "transformed by the renewing of your mind." It is for you
          to do what God tells you, as God tells you, when God tells you, and
          how God tells you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pardon me for a moment, if I should risk the displeasure of some I
          love by referring to an ordinance of the church about which we are
          likely to disagree. The sacred rite of baptism is administered in a
          great number of churches to little infants upon the sponsorship of
          their guardians or friends, while many of us consider that Holy
          Scripture teaches that believers only (without respect to their age at
          all) are the proper subjects of baptism, and that upon a personal
          profession of their faith in Christ. I see a man take up an
          unconscious infant in his arms, and he says he baptizes it. When I
          turn to my Bible, I can see nothing whatever of this sort there. It is
          true I find the Lord Jesus saying, "Suffer little children to come
          unto me," but that affords no precedent for carrying a little child to
          the minister, that could not come, that was too young to walk, much
          less to think and understand the meaning of these things. Yet more,
          when Jesus said "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
          them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven" -- they did come to
          him; but I do not find that he baptized or sprinkled them at all, he
          gave them his blessing and they went away. I am sure he did not
          baptize them, for it is expressly said, "Jesus Christ baptized not,
          but his disciples." So, then, that passage does not favor the
          Paedo-baptist, it is quite clear. I am informed however, that the
          reason why children are baptized is, that we are told in the Bible
          that Abraham's children were circumcised. This puzzles me. I cannot
          see any likeness at all between the two things. But who were the
          persons circumcised? They were Israelites. Why were they circumcised?
          Because they were Israelites. That is the reason; and I say I would
          not hesitate to baptize any Christian, though he be a babe in Christ,
          as soon as he knows the Lord Jesus Christ, were he only eight days old
          in the faith, if he proves that he is an Israelite in the spirit
          himself, I will baptize him. I have nothing to do with his father or
          his mother in religion. Religion is a personal act all the way
          through; another man cannot believe for me, cannot repent for me; and
          another person cannot give for me the answer of a good conscience
          toward God in baptism and have it done in my name. We must act on our
          own individual responsibility in religion by the grace of God, or else
          the thing is virtually not done at all. Now I believe many godly
          people do sincerely worship God at this altar of infant baptism; but I
          am equally clear that it is my duty to do my utmost to break it down,
          for it is not God's altar; God's altar is believers' baptism. What
          said Philip to the Eunuch? "If thou believest with all thine heart,
          thou mayest." "Lo! here is water," said the Eunuch. Yes, but that was
          not all; there must be faith, as well as water, before there could be
          legitimate baptism; and every baptism that is administered to any man,
          except he asketh it himself, on profession of his faith in Christ, is
          an altar at which I could not worship, for I do not believe it to be
          the altar of God, but an altar originally built at Rome, the pattern
          of which has been adopted here, to the marring of the union of the
          church, and to the great injury of souls. Now, all I ask from those
          who differ from me in opinion is, simply to look at the matter
          honestly and calmly. If they can find infant baptism in the Bible,
          then let them practice it and worship there; if they cannot, let them
          be honest, and come and worship at the altar of Jerusalem, and there
          alone. An old woman was once promised a Bible, if she could find a
          text that sanctioned infant baptism. She could only find one, and that
          was, "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's
          sake." The minister gave her the Bible for her ingenuity, admitting,
          that it was an ordinance of man, and no mistake. I quote this instance
          of infant baptism, as only one out of many corruptions that have crept
          into our churches. It is quite clear that all sects cannot be right.
          They may be right as to the main points essential to salvation, though
          in their discrepancies with one another they betray errors. I do not
          want you to believe that I am right. rather turn to Scripture, and see
          what is right. The day must come when Episcopacy, Independency,
          Wesleyanism, and every other system, must be read by the Word of God,
          and every form given up that is not approved before the Most High. I
          hope I shall always be able to lift up my voice against that charity
          growing up in our midst, which is not only a charity towards persons,
          but a charity towards doctrines. I here fervent charity towards every
          brother in Christ who differs from me. I love him for Christ's sake,
          and hold fellowship with him for the truth's sake: but I can have no
          charity for his errors, nor do I wish him to have any for mine. I tell
          him straight to his face, "If your sentiments contradict mine, either
          I am right and you are wrong, or you are right and I am wrong; and it
          is time we should meet together and search the Word of God, to see
          what is right." Talk of your Evangelical Alliances, and such like:
          they will never endure; they may effect many blessed purposes, but
          they are not the remedy that is wanted for our divisions. What is
          wanted is, for all of us to come to the model of the Word of God, and
          when we have come to that, we must come together. Let us all come "to
          the law and to the testimony." Let the Baptist, let the Independent,
          let the Churchman, lay aside his old thoughts, his old prejudices, and
          his old traditions, and let each man search for himself, as in the
          sight of Almighty God, and some of the altars must go down, for they
          cannot all be after the divine type, when their dissimilarity is so
          palpable. May the Spirit of God be poured out in this land, and there
          will come a three-fold reformation, such as I have described; broken
          images, groves cut down, and fallen altars scattered to the winds. And
          yet, my dear hearers, I do not ask you to attend to this last thing
          first. It is unimportant, compared with the first. The images are
          first to be burned, then sinful customs are to be given up, and after
          that let the church be reformed. Each of these in its proper place and
          due order is important, and all must be attended to. Yet once more, my
          hearer, before I send thee away let me put one pertinent and pressing
          question to thee. What hast thou got by all thy hearing of God's Word?
          Some of you have heard sermons beyond count; you can hardly reckon the
          number of gospel ministers to whom you have listened. What good have
          you obtained as the result of them all? Have you been led to
          repentance? Have you been brought to faith? Are you made "a child of
          God and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." If not, I solemnly
          remind thee that all thy church goings and chapel goings are
          increasing thy condemnation. Unless thou repentest, these priviliges
          shall rise up in judgment against thee to condemn thee. Woe unto thee,
          London, woe unto thee, for if the words which have been preached in
          thy streets had been proclaimed in Sodom and Gomorrah, they had
          repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Woe unto you, ye sons and
          daughters of pious parents, children trained in the Sunday-school,
          hearers of God's Word; for "except ye repent, it shall be more
          tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you." "I
          speak as unto wise men; judge ye what I say," and may God guide you
          aright.<br />
