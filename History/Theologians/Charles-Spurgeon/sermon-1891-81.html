          1. John, the disciple of the Lord, preaches this faith, and seeks, by
          the proclamation of the Gospel, to remove that error which by
          Cerinthus had been disseminated among men, and a long time previously
          by those termed Nicolaitans, who are an offset of that "knowledge"
          falsely so called, that he might confound them, and persuade them that
          there is but one God, who made all things by His Word; and not, as
          they allege, that the Creator was one, but the Father of the Lord
          another; and that the Son of the Creator was, forsooth, one, but the
          Christ from above another, who also continued impassible, descending
          upon Jesus, the Son of the Creator, and flew back again into His
          Pleroma; and that Monogenes was the beginning, but Logos was the true
          son of Monogenes; and that this creation to which we belong was not
          made by the primary God, but by some power lying far below Him, and
          shut off from communion with the things invisible and ineffable. The
          disciple of the Lord therefore desiring to put an end to all such
          doctrines, and to establish the rule of truth in the Church, that
          there is one Almighty God, who made all things by His Word, both
          visible and invisible; showing at the same time, that by the Word,
          through whom God made the creation, He also bestowed salvation on the
          men included in the creation; thus commenced His teaching in the
          Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
          the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
          were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made. What was made was
          life in Him, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth
          in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not." "All things," he
          says, "were made by Him;" therefore in "all things" this creation of
          ours is [included], for we cannot concede to these men that [the
          words] "all things" are spoken in reference to those within their
          Pleroma. For if their Pleroma do indeed contain these, this creation,
          as being such, is not outside, as I have demonstrated in the preceding
          book; but if they are outside the Pleroma, which indeed appeared
          impossible, it follows, in that case, that their Pleroma cannot be
          "all things:" therefore this vast creation is not outside [the
          Pleroma].
        </p>
        <p>
          2. John, however, does himself put this matter beyond all controversy
          on our part, when he says, "He was in this world, and the world was
          made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own
          [things], and His own [people] received Him not." But according to
          Marcion, and those like him, neither was the world made by Him; nor
          did He come to His own things, but to those of another. And, according
          to certain of the Gnostics, this world was made by angels, and not by
          the Word of God. But according to the followers of Valentinus, the
          world was not made by Him, but by the Demiurge. For he (Soter) caused
          such similitudes to be made, after the pattern of things above, as
          they allege; but the Demiurge accomplished the work of creation. For
          they say that he, the Lord and Creator of the plan of creation, by
          whom they hold that this world was made, was produced from the Mother;
          while the Gospel affirms plainly, that by the Word, which was in the
          beginning with God, all things were made, which Word, he says, "was
          made flesh, and dwelt among us."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But, according to these men, neither was the Word made flesh, nor
          Christ, nor the Saviour (Soter), who was produced from [the joint
          contributions of] all [the Æons]. For they will have it, that the Word
          and Christ never came into this world; that the Saviour, too, never
          became incarnate, nor suffered, but that He descended like a dove upon
          the dispensational Jesus; and that, as soon as He had declared the
          unknown Father, He did again ascend into the Pleroma. Some, however,
          make the assertion, that this dispensational Jesus did become
          incarnate, and suffered, whom they represent as having passed through
          Mary just as water through a tube; but others allege him to be the Son
          of the Demiurge, upon whom the dispensational Jesus descended; while
          others, again, say that Jesus was born from Joseph and Mary, and that
          the Christ from above descended upon him, being without flesh, and
          impassible. But according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was
          the Word of God made flesh. For if anyone carefully examines the
          systems of them all, he will find that the Word of God is brought in
          by all of them as not having become incarnate (sine carne) and
          impassible, as is also the Christ from above. Others consider Him to
          have been manifested as a transfigured man; but they maintain Him to
          have been neither born nor to have become incarnate; whilst others
          [hold] that He did not assume a human form at all, but that, as a
          dove, He did descend upon that Jesus who was born from Mary. Therefore
          the Lord's disciple, pointing them all out as false witnesses, says,
          "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And that we may not have to ask, Of what God was the Word made
          flesh? he does himself previously teach us, saying, "There was a man
          sent from God, whose name was John. The same came as a witness, that
          he might bear witness of that Light. He was not that Light, but [came]
          that he might testify of the Light." By what God, then, was John, the
          forerunner, who testifies of the Light, sent [into the world]? Truly
          it was by Him, of whom Gabriel is the angel, who also announced the
          glad tidings of his birth: [that God] who also had promised by the
          prophets that He would send His messenger before the face of His Son,
          who should prepare His way, that is, that he should bear witness of
          that Light in the spirit and power of Elias. But, again, of what God
          was Elias the servant and the prophet? Of Him who made heaven and
          earth, as he does himself confess. John, therefore, having been sent
          by the founder and maker of this world, how could he testify of that
          Light, which came down from things unspeakable and invisible? For all
          the heretics have decided that the Demiurge was ignorant of that Power
          above him, whose witness and herald John is found to be. Wherefore the
          Lord said that He deemed him "more than a prophet." For all the other
          prophets preached the advent of the paternal Light, and desired to be
          worthy of seeing Him whom they preached; but John did both announce
          [the advent] beforehand, in a like manner as did the others, and
          actually saw Him when He came, and pointed Him out, and persuaded many
          to believe on Him, so that he did himself hold the place of both
          prophet and apostle. For this is to be more than a prophet, because,
          "first apostles, secondarily prophets;" but all things from one and
          the same God Himself.

          5. That wine, which was produced by God in a vineyard, and which was
          first consumed, was good. None of those who drank of it found fault
          with it; and the Lord partook of it also. But that wine was better
          which the Word made from water, on the moment, and simply for the use
          of those who had been called to the marriage. For although the Lord
          had the power to supply wine to those feasting, independently of any
          created substance, and to fill with food those who were hungry, He did
          not adopt this course; but, taking the loaves which the earth had
          produced, and giving thanks, and on the other occasion making water
          wine, He satisfied those who were reclining [at table], and gave drink
          to those who had been invited to the marriage; showing that the God
          who made the earth, and commanded it to bring forth fruit, who
          established the waters, and brought forth the fountains, was He who in
          these last times bestowed upon mankind, by His Son, the blessing of
          food and the favour of drink: the Incomprehensible [acting thus] by
          means of the comprehensible, and the Invisible by the visible; since
          there is none beyond Him, but He exists in the bosom of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. For "no man," he says, "hath seen God at any time," unless "the
          only-begotten Son of God, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath
          declared [Him]." For He, the Son who is in His bosom, declares to all
          the Father who is invisible. Wherefore they know Him to whom the Son
          reveals Him; and again, the Father, by means of the Son, gives
          knowledge of His Son to those who love Him. By whom also Nathanael,
          being taught, recognised [Him], he to whom also the Lord bare witness,
          that he was "an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile." The Israelite
          recognised his King, therefore did he cry out to Him, "Rabbi, Thou art
          the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel." By whom also Peter,
          having been taught, recognised Christ as the Son of the living God,
          when [God] said, "Behold My dearly beloved Son, in whom I am well
          pleased: I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment to
          the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear
          His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and
          smoking flax shall He not quench, until He send forth judgment into
          contention; and in His name shall the Gentiles trust."
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Such, then, are the first principles of the Gospel: that there is
          one God, the Maker of this universe; He who was also announced by the
          prophets, and who by Moses set forth the dispensation of the law, --
          [principles] which proclaim the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
          ignore any other God or Father except Him. So firm is the ground upon
          which these Gospels rest, that the very heretics themselves bear
          witness to them, and, starting from these [documents], each one of
          them endeavours to establish his own peculiar doctrine. For the
          Ebionites, who use Matthew's Gospel only, are confuted out of this
          very same, making false suppositions with regard to the Lord. But
          Marcion, mutilating that according to Luke, is proved to be a
          blasphemer of the only existing God, from those [passages] which he
          still retains. Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging
          that Christ remained impassible, but that it was Jesus who suffered,
          preferring the Gospel by Mark, if they read it with a love of truth,
          may have their errors rectified. Those, moreover, who follow
          Valentinus, making copious use of that according to John, to
          illustrate their conjunctions, shall be proved to be totally in error
          by means of this very Gospel, as I have shown in the first book.
          Since, then, our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of
          these [documents], our proof derived from them is firm and true.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in
          number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in
          which we live, and four principal winds, while the Church is scattered
          throughout all the world, and the "pillar and ground" of the Church is
          the Gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have
          four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying
          men afresh. From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the
          Artificer of all, He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all
          things, He who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under
          four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit. As also David says,
          when entreating His manifestation, "Thou that sittest between the
          cherubim, shine forth." For the cherubim, too, were four-faced, and
          their faces were images of the dispensation of the Son of God. For,
          [as the Scripture] says, "The first living creature was like a lion,"
          symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power;
          the second [living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His]
          sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but "the third had, as it were, the
          face as of a man," -- an evident description of His advent as a human
          being; "the fourth was like a flying eagle," pointing out the gift of
          the Spirit hovering with His wings over the Church. And therefore the
          Gospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is
          seated. For that according to John relates His original, effectual,
          and glorious generation from the Father, thus declaring, "In the
          beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
          God." Also, "all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing
          made." For this reason, too, is that Gospel full of all confidence,
          for such is His person. But that according to Luke, taking up [His]
          priestly character, commenced with Zacharias the priest offering
          sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be
          immolated for the finding again of the younger son. Matthew, again,
          relates His generation as a man, saying, "The book of the generation
          of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;" and also, "The
          birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise." This, then, is the Gospel of
          His humanity; for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a
          humble and meek man is kept up through the whole Gospel. Mark, on the
          other hand, commences with [a reference to] the prophetical spirit
          coming down from on high to men, saying, "The beginning of the Gospel
          of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Esaias the prophet," -- pointing
          to the winged aspect of the Gospel; and on this account he made a
          compendious and cursory narrative, for such is the prophetical
          character. And the Word of God Himself used to converse with the
          ante-Mosaic patriarchs, in accordance with His divinity and glory; but
          for those under the law he instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical
          service. Afterwards, being made man for us, He sent the gift of the
          celestial Spirit over all the earth, protecting us with His wings.
          Such, then, as was the course followed by the Son of God, so was also
          the form of the living creatures; and such as was the form of the
          living creatures, so was also the character of the Gospel. For the
          living creatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform, as is
          also the course followed by the Lord. For this reason were four
          principal (katholikai) covenants given to the human race: one, prior
          to the deluge, under Adam; the second, that after the deluge, under
          Noah; the third, the giving of the law, under Moses; the fourth, that
          which renovates man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the
          Gospel, raising and bearing men upon its wings into the heavenly
          kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. These things being so, all who destroy the form of the Gospel are
          vain, unlearned, and also audacious; those, [I mean,] who represent
          the aspects of the Gospel as being either more in number than as
          aforesaid, or, on the other hand, fewer. The former class [do so],
          that they may seem to have discovered more than is of the truth; the
          latter, that they may set the dispensations of God aside. For Marcion,
          rejecting the entire Gospel, yea rather, cutting himself off from the
          Gospel, boasts that he has part in the [blessings of] the Gospel.
          Others, again (the Montanists), that they may set at nought the gift
          of the Spirit, which in the latter times has been, by the good
          pleasure of the Father, poured out upon the human race, do not admit
          that aspect [of the evangelical dispensation] presented by John's
          Gospel, in which the Lord promised that He would send the Paraclete;
          but set aside at once both the Gospel and the prophetic Spirit.
          Wretched men indeed! who wish to be pseudo-prophets, forsooth, but who
          set aside the gift of prophecy from the Church; acting like those (the
          Encratitæ) who, on account of such as come in hypocrisy, hold
          themselves aloof from the communion of the brethren. We must conclude,
          moreover, that these men (the Montanists) can not admit the Apostle
          Paul either. For, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, he speaks
          expressly of prophetical gifts, and recognises men and women
          prophesying in the Church. Sinning, therefore, in all these
          particulars, against the Spirit of God, they fall into the
          irremissible sin. But those who are from Valentinus, being, on the
          other hand, altogether reckless, while they put forth their own
          compositions, boast that they possess more Gospels than there really
          are. Indeed, they have arrived at such a pitch of audacity, as to
          entitle their comparatively recent writing "the Gospel of Truth,"
          though it agrees in nothing with the Gospels of the Apostles, so that
          they have really no Gospel which is not full of blasphemy. For if what
          they have published is the Gospel of truth, and yet is totally unlike
          those which have been handed down to us from the apostles, any who
          please may learn, as is shown from the Scriptures themselves, that
          that which has been handed down from the apostles can no longer be
          reckoned the Gospel of truth. But that these Gospels alone are true
          and reliable, and admit neither an increase nor diminution of the
          aforesaid number, I have proved by so many and such [arguments]. For,
          since God made all things in due proportion and adaptation, it was fit
          also that the outward aspect of the Gospel should be well arranged and
          harmonized. The opinion of those men, therefore, who handed the Gospel
          down to us, having been investigated, from their very fountainheads,
          let us proceed also to the remaining apostles, and inquire into their
          doctrine with regard to God; then, in due course we shall listen to
          the very words of the Lord.<br />
