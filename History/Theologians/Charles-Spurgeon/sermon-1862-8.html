        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.477)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, October 26th, 1862, by</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." -- Hebrews
          13:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHAT POWER RESIDES in "Thus saith the Lord!" The man who can grasp by
          faith, "He hath said," has an all-conquering weapon in his hand. What
          doubt will not be slain by this to two-edged sword? What fear is that
          which shall not fall smitten with a deadly wound before this arrow
          from the bow of God's covenant? Will not the distresses of life and
          the pangs of death, will not the corruptions within and the
          temptations without, will not the trials from above and the
          temptations from beneath all seem but light afflictions when we can
          hide ourselves behind the bulwark of "He hath said?" Whether for
          delight in our quietude, or for strength in our conflict, "He hath
          said" must be our daily resort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, let us learn, my brethren, the extreme value of searching the
          Scriptures. There may be a promise in the Word which would exactly fit
          your case, but you may not know of it, and therefore miss its comfort.
          You are like prisoners in a dungeon, and there may be one key in the
          bunch which would unlock the door, and you might be free; but if you
          will not look for it you may remain a prisoner still, though liberty
          is near at hand. There may be a potent medicine in the great
          pharmacopia of Scripture, and you may still remain sick, though there
          is the precise remedy that would meet your disease, unless you will
          examine and search the Scriptures to discover what "He hath said."
          Should we not, beside reading Scripture, store our memories richly
          with the promises of God? We can recollect the sayings of great men;
          we treasure up the verses of renowned poets; ought we not to be
          profound in our knowledge of the words of God? The Scriptures should
          be the classics of a Christian, and as our orators quote Homer, or
          Virgil, or Horace, when they would clinch a point, so we should be
          able to quote the promises of God when we would solve a difficulty or
          overthrow a doubt. "He hath said," is the foundation of all riches and
          the fountain of all comfort, let it dwell in you richly as "a well of
          water, springing up unto everlasting life." And, oh, my brethren, how
          diligently should we test the Scriptures! Besides searching them by
          reading, and treasuring them by memory, we should test them by
          experience, and so often as a promise is proven to be true we should
          make a mark against it, and note that we also can say, as did one of
          old, "This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened
          me." "Wait on the Lord," said Isaiah, and then he added "Wait, I say,
          on the Lord," as if his own experience led him to echo the voice of
          God to his hearers. Test the promise, take God's banknote to the
          counter, and mark if it be cashed. Grasp the lever, which he ordains
          to lift your trials, and try if it possesses real power. Cast this
          divine tree into the bitter waters of your Marah, and learn how it
          will sweeten them. Take this salt, and throw it into the turbid
          waters, and witness if they be not made sweet, as were the waters of
          old by the prophet Elisha. Taste and see that the Lord is good, for
          there is no want to them that fear him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostles, you will notice, like their Master, were always very
          ready at quotations. Though they were inspired men, and could have
          used fresh words, yet they preferred, as an example to us, to quote
          "He hath said;" let us do the same, for, though the words of ministers
          may be sweet, the words of God are sweeter; and though original
          thoughts may have the novelty of freshness, yet the ancient words of
          God have the ring, and the weight, and the value of old and precious
          coins, and they shall not be found wanting in the day when we shall
          use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems from our text that "He hath said" is not only useful to chase
          away doubts, fears, difficulties, and devils, but that it also
          yieldeth nourishment to all our graces. You perceive that when the
          apostle would make us contented, he says, "Be content with such things
          as ye have, for he hath said;" and when he would make us bold and
          courageous, he puts it, "He hath said, therefore, we may boldly say,
          God is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me." When the
          apostle would nourish faith, he does it by quoting from Scripture the
          examples of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of Moses, of Gideon, of
          Barak, and of Jephthah. When he would nourish our patience, he says,
          "Ye remember the patience of Job;" or if it be our prayerfulness, he
          says, "Elias was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed and
          prevailed." "He hath said" is food for every grace as well as death
          for every sin. Here you have nourishment for that which is good, and
          poison for that which is evil. Search ye, then, the Scriptures, for so
          shall ye grow healthy, strong, and vigorous in the divine life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We turn at once, with great pleasure, to the wonderful words of our
          text, "He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." I
          have no doubt you are aware that our translation does not convey the
          whole force of the original, and that it would hardly be possible in
          English to give the full weight of the Greek. We might render it, "He
          hath said, I will never, never leave thee; I will never, never, never
          forsake thee;" for, though that would be not a literal, but rather a
          free rendering, yet, as there are five negatives in the Greek, we do
          not know how to give their force in any other way. Two negatives
          nullify each other in our language; but here, in the Greek, they
          intensify the meaning following one after another, as I suppose
          David's five stones out of the brook would have done if the first had
          not been enough to make the giant reel. The verse we sung just now is
          a very good rendering of the original --
        </p>
        <p>"'The soul that on Jesus hath lean'd for repose,</p>
        <p>I will not, I will not desert to his foes;</p>
        <p>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</p>
        <p>I'll never, no never, no never forsake."</p>
        <p>
          Here you have the five negatives very well placed, and the force of
          the Greek, as nearly as possible, given.
        </p>
        <p>
          In trying to expound this five-fold assurance, this quintessence of
          consolation, we shall have to draw your attention, first of all, to an
          awful condition, or what is negatived; secondly, to a gracious
          promise, or what is positively guaranteed; next, we shall observe
          notable occasions or times when this promise was uttered; a few words
          upon certain sweet confirmations which prove the text to be true; and
          then, in the fifth place, necessary conclusions which flow from the
          words of the promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, then, AN AWFUL CONDITION -- lost and FORSAKEN of God!
          I am quite certain I shall fail in attempting to describe this state
          of mind. I have thought of it, dreamed of it, and felt it in such
          feeble measure as a child of God can feel it, but how to describe it I
          know not.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Forsaking implies an utter loneliness. Put a traveler in a vast
          howling wilderness, where for many a league there is no trace of man
          -- no foot-step of traveler. The solitary wretch cries for help -- the
          hollow echo of the rocks is his only reply. No bird in the air; not
          even a prowling jackal in the waste; not an insect in the sunbeam to
          keep him company; not even a solitary blade of grass to remind him of
          God! Yet, even there he is not alone: for yon bare rocks prove a God,
          and the hot sand beneath his feet, and the blazing sun above his head,
          all witness to a present Deity. But what would be the loneliness of a
          man forsaken of God! No migration could be so awful as this, for he
          says, "If I take the wings of the morning and fly to the uttermost
          parts of the sea thou art there." Such a state were worse than hell,
          for David says, "If I make my bed in hell thou art there." Loneliness
          is a feeling which none of us delight in. Solitude may have some
          charms, but they who are forced to be her captives have not discovered
          them. A transient solitude may give pleasure; to be alone, utterly
          alone, is terrible; to be alone, without God, is such an emphasis of
          loneliness, that I defy the lip even of a damned spirit to express the
          horror and anguish that must be concentrated in it. There is far more
          than you and I dream of in the language of our Lord Jesus, when he
          says, "I have trodden the wine-press alone." Alone! You remember he
          once said, "Ye shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because
          the Father is with me." There is no agony in that sentence, but what
          must be his grief when he says -- "I have trodden the wine-press
          alone!" "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is the cry of human
          nature in its uttermost dismay. Thank God, you and I by this promise
          are taught that we never shall know the desperate loneliness of being
          forsaken of God; yet, this is what it would be if he should forsake
          us!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Mingling with this mournful solitude is a sense of utter
          helplessness. Power belongeth unto God; withdraw the Lord, and the
          strong men must utterly fail. The archangel without God passes away
          and is not; the everlasting hills do bow, and the solid pillars of the
          earth are dissolved. Without God our dust returneth to the earth;
          without God our spirit mourneth like David, "I am forgotten as a dead
          man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel." Christ knew what this was
          when he said, "I am a worm, and no man." He was so utterly broken, so
          emptied of all power, that as he hung with dislocated limbs upon the
          cross, he cried, "My strength is dried up like a potsherd; thou hast
          brought me into the dust of death." No broken reed or smoking flax can
          be so feeble as a soul forsaken of God. Our state would be as
          deplorably destitute as that of Ezekiel's infant, deserted and cast
          into the open field with none to swaddle and none to care for it, left
          utterly to perish and to die, -- such should we be if we could be
          forsaken of God! Glorious are those negatives which shut us in from
          all fear of this calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To be forsaken of God implies utter friendlessness. A thousand
          times let Jehovah be blessed that very few of us have ever known what
          it is to be friendless! There have been times in the experience of
          some of us when we felt that we stood without a friend in the
          particular spot which we then occupied, for we had a grief which we
          could not entrust to any other heart. Every man who is eminently
          useful in the Church will know seasons when as the champion of Israel
          he must go forth alone. This, however, is compensated by stronger
          faith, and the moral grandeur of solitary heroism. But what must it be
          to be some poor wretch whose parents have long since been buried; who
          has lost his most distant relatives; who, passing along the street
          remembers the name of one who was once his father's friend, knocks at
          the door, and is repulsed; recollects another -- and this is his last
          hope -- one he played with in his infancy -- stands at that door
          asking for charity and is bidden to go his way, and paces the cold
          November streets while the rain is pouring down, feeling to his utter
          dismay that no friend breathes for him? Should he return to his own
          parish it would be like going to his own dungeon, and if he enters the
          workhouse no eye there will flash sympathy upon him! He is utterly
          friendless and alone! I believe that many a suicide has been produced
          by the want of a friend. As long as a man feels he has some one loving
          him, he has something worth living for; but when the last friend is
          gone and we feel that we are floating on a raft far out at sea, with
          not a sail in sight, and we cry, "Welcome death!" Our Lord and Master
          was brought to this state, and knew what it was to be forsaken, for he
          had no friends left. "He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
          heel against me." "All the disciples forsook him and fled." Brethren,
          many saints have lost all their friends, but have bravely borne the
          trial, for turning their eye to heaven, they have felt that though
          without friends they were still befriended. They have heard the voice
          of Jesus say, "I will not leave you orphans; I will come unto you;"
          and, made strong by Divine friendship, they have felt that they were
          not utterly bereaved. But to be forsaken of God! Oh, may you and I
          never know it! To be without a friend in heaven; to look to that
          throne of glory and to see the blackness of darkness there; to turn to
          mercy and receive a frown; to fly to love and receive a rebuke; to
          turn to God and find that his ear is heavy that he will not hear, and
          his hand restrained that he will not help -- oh! this is terror,
          terror heaped on terror, to be thus forsaken!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Loneliness, helplessness, friendlessness -- add these together, and
          then put the next -- hopelessness. A man forsaken of men may still
          entertain some hope. But let him be forsaken of God, and then hope
          hath failed; the last window is shut; not a ray of light now streams
          into the thick Egyptian darkness of his mind. Life is death; death is
          damnation -- damnation in its lowest deeps. Let him look to men, and
          they are broken reeds; let him turn to angels, and they are avengers;
          let him look to death, and even the tomb affords no refuge. Look where
          he will, blank, black despair seizes hold upon him. Our blessed Lord
          knew this when lover and friend had been put far from him, and his
          acquaintance into darkness. It was only his transcendent faith which
          enabled him after all to say "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell:
          neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." The black
          shadow of this utter hopelessness went over him when he said, "My soul
          is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death," and he "sweat as it were
          great drops of blood, falling down to the ground."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. To make up this five-fold forsaking, against which we have the five
          negatives, let us add to all this loneliness, helplessness,
          friendlessness, and hopelessness, a sense of unutterable agony. We
          speak of agony, but to feel it is a very different thing. Misery and
          despair -- the wrestling of these with the spirit till the spirit is
          trodden down, and crushed, and broken, and chooses strangling rather
          than life; a horrible sense of every evil having made one's heart its
          den; a consciousness that we are the target for all God's arrows; that
          all God's waves and billows have gone over us; that he hath forgotten
          to be gracious; that he will be merciful to us no more; that he hath
          in anger shut up the bowels of his compassion -- this is a part of
          being forsaken of God which only lost spirits in hell can know! Our
          unbelief sometimes lets us get a glimpse of what this would be, but it
          is only a glimpse, only a glimpse; let us thank God that we are
          delivered from all fear of this tremendous evil. By five wounds doth
          our Redeemer slay our unbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, if God should leave us, mark the result: I picture to myself
          the very best state of one forsaken of God -- it is uncertainty and
          chance. I would rather be an atom, which hath God with it,
          predestinating its track and forcing it onward according to his own
          will, than I would be an archangel left to my own choice, to do as I
          would and to act at I please, without the control of God; for an
          archangel, left without God, would soon miss his way, and fall to
          hell; or he would melt away, and drop and die; but the tiny atom,
          having God with it, would fulfill its predestinated course; it would
          be ever in a sure track, and throughout eternity would have as much
          potence in it as at its first creation. I cannot think why some people
          are so fond of free-will. I believe free-will is the delight of
          sinners, but that God's will is the glory of saints. There is nothing
          I desire more to get rid of than my own will, and to be absorbed into
          the will and purpose of my Lord. To do according to the will of Him
          who is most good, most true, most wise, most mighty, seems to me to be
          heaven. Let others choose the dignity of independence, I crave the
          glory of being wholly dead in Christ, and only alive in him. Oh! dear
          friends, if the Lord should forsake us, to say the best of it, our
          course would be uncertain, and, ere long it would end in nothingness.
          We know, further, that if God should forsake the best saint alive,
          that man would immediately fall into sin. He now stands securely on
          yonder lofty pinnacle, but his brain would reel and he would fall, if
          secret hands did not uphold him. He now picks his steps carefully;
          take away grace from him and he would roll in the mire, and wallow in
          it like other men. Let the godly be forsaken of his God, and he would
          go from bad to worse, till his conscience, now so tender, would be
          seared as with a hot iron. Next he would ripen into an atheist or a
          blasphemer, and he would come to his dying bed foaming at the mouth
          with rage; would come before the bar of his Maker with a curse upon
          his lip; and in eternity, left and forsaken of God, he would sink to
          hell with the condemned, ay, and among the damned he would have the
          worst place, lower than the lowest, finding in the lowest depths a
          lower depth, finding in the wrath of God something more dreadful than
          the ordinary wrath which falleth upon common sinners!
        </p>
        <p>
          When we thus describe being forsaken of God, is it not satisfactory to
          the highest degree to remember that we have God's word for it five
          times over, "I will never, never leave thee; I will never, never,
          never forsake thee?" I know those who caricature Calvinism say we
          teach that let a man live as he likes, yet if God be with him, he will
          be safe at the last. We teach no such thing, and our adversaries know
          better. They know that our doctrines are invulnerable if they will
          state them correctly, and that the only way in which they can attack
          us is to slander us and to misrepresent what we teach. Nay, verily, we
          say not so, but we say that where God begins the good work, the man
          will never live as he likes, or if he does, he will like to live as
          God would have him live; that where God begins a good work he carries
          it on; that man is never forsaken of God, nor does he forsake God, but
          is kept even to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have before us now, in the second place, A GRACIOUS PROMISE, or
          what is positively guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is guaranteed in this promise? Beloved, herein doth God give to
          his people everything. "I will never leave thee." Then no attribute of
          God can cease to be engaged for us. Is he mighty? He will show himself
          strong on the behalf of them that trust him. Is HE love? Then with
          everlasting lovingkindness will he have mercy upon us. Whatever
          attributes may compose the character of Deity every one of them to its
          fullest extent shall be engaged on our side. Moreover, whatsoever God
          hath, whether it be in the lowest hades or in the highest heaven,
          whatever can be contained in infinity or can be held within the
          circumference of eternity, whatever, in fine, can be in him who
          filleth all things, and yet is greater than all things, shall be with
          his people for ever, since "He hath said, I will never leave you, nor
          forsake you." How one might enlarge here, but I forbear; ye yourselves
          know that to sum up "all things" is a task beyond all human might.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. More fully, however, to expound this promise, I would remind you
          of the five OCCASIONS in which it occurs in Scripture. The number five
          rune all through our subject. The sense and spirit of the text are to
          be found in innumerable places, and possibly there may be some other
          passages which approximate so very nearly to our text, that you might
          say they also are repetitions, but I think there are five which may
          clearly take the priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. One of the first instances is to be found in Genesis 28:15.
          "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou
          goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave
          thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of." Here we
          have this promise in the case of a man of trials. More than either
          Abraham or Isaac, Jacob was the son of tribulation. He was now flying
          away from his father's house, leaving the over-fondness of a mother's
          attachment, abhorred by his elder brother, who sought his blood. He
          lies down to sleep, with a stone for his pillow, with the hedges for
          his curtains, with the earth for his bed, and the heavens for his
          canopy; and as he sleeps thus friendless, solitary, and alone, God
          saith to him "I will never, never leave thee." Mark his after career.
          He is guided to Padan-aram; God, his guide, leaves him not. At
          Padan-aram Laban cheats him, wickedly and wrongfully cheats him in
          many ways; but God doth not leave him, and he is more than a match for
          the thievish Laban. He flies at last with his wives and children;
          Laban, in hot haste pursues him, but the Lord does not leave him;
          Mizpah's Mount bears witness that God can stop the pursuer, and change
          the foe into a friend. Esau comes against him; let Jabbok testify to
          Jacob's wrestlings, and through the power of him who never did forsake
          his servant, Esau kisses his brother, whom once he thought to slay.
          Anon Jacob dwells in tents and booths at Succoth; he journeys up and
          down throughout the land, and his sons treacherously slay the
          Shechemites. Then the nations round about seek to avenge their death,
          but the Lord again interposes, and Jacob is delivered. Poor Jacob is
          bereaved of his sons. He cries -- "Joseph is not, and Simeon is not,
          and now ye will take Benjamin away; all these things are against me."
          But they are not against him; God has not left him, for he has not yet
          done everything that he had spoken to him of. The old man goes into
          Egypt; his lips are refreshed while he kisses the cheeks of his
          favourite Joseph, and until the last, when he gathers up his feet in
          the bed and sings of that coming Shiloh and the scepter that should
          not depart from Judah, good old Jacob proves that in six troubles God
          is with his people, and in seven he doth not forsake them; that even
          to hoar hairs he is the same, and until old age he doth carry them.
          You Jacobs, full of affliction, you tried and troubled heirs of
          heaven, he hath said to you, each one of you -- oh! believe him! -- I
          will never leave thee; I will never forsake thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The next instance in which we find this same promise is in
          Deuteronomy 31:6. Here we find it spoken, not so much to individuals
          as to the whole body collectively. Moses said unto the people of
          Judah, by the Word of God, "Be strong, and of a good courage, fear
          not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth
          go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." Beloved, we
          may take this promise as being spoken to God's Church, as a Church.
          These people were to fight the accursed nations of Canaan, to drive
          out the giants, and the men who had chariots of iron, but the Lord
          said he would never leave them, nor did he, till from Dan to Beersheba
          the favored race possessed the promised land, and the tribes went up
          to Jerusalem with the voice of joyful song. Now, as the Church of God,
          let us remember that the land lieth before us, and we are called of
          God to go up and possess it. I would it were my lot yet more and more,
          like Joshua, to lead you from one place to another, smiting the
          enemies of the Lord and extending the kingdom of Messias! Let us
          undertake what we may, we shall never fail. Let us, by faith, dare
          great things, and we shall do great things. Let us venture upon
          notable exploits which shall seem fanatical to reason and absurd to
          men of prudence, for he hath said, "I will never leave you nor forsake
          you." If the Church of God would but know that her Lord cannot leave
          her, she might attempt greater things than she has ever done, and the
          success of her attempts would be most certain and sure. God never can
          forsake a praying people, nor cast off a laboring Church; he must
          bless us even to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third occasion upon which this promise was made is in Joshua
          1:5, where the Lord says to Joshua, "There shall not any man be able
          to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so
          I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. "Now this
          is a minister's text. If we be called to lead the people, to bear the
          brunt of the fight, the burden and heat of the day, let us treasure up
          this as our precious consolation, he will not fail us nor forsake us.
          It needs not that I should tell you that it is not every man who can
          stand first in the ranks, and that, albeit there is no small share of
          honor given by God to such a man, yet there is a bitterness in his lot
          which no other men can know. There are times when, if it were not for
          faith, we would give up the ghost, and, were not the Master with us,
          we would turn our back and fly, like Jonah, unto Nineveh. But if any
          of you be called to occupy prominent positions in God's Church, bind
          this about your arm and it shall make you strong; He hath said to you,
          "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Go, in this thy might;
          the Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. On the next occasion, this same promise was given by David in his
          last moments to his son Solomon, 1 Chronicles 28:20. David was
          speaking of what he himself by experience had proved to be true, and
          he declares -- "Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not,
          nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he
          will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the
          work for the service of the house of the Lord." Some Christians are
          placed where they need much prudence, discretion, and wisdom. You may
          take this for your promise. The Queen of Sheba came to see Solomon;
          she put to him many difficult questions, but God did not leave him,
          nor forsake him, and he was able to answer them all. As judge over
          Israel, many knotty points were brought before him; you remember the
          child and the harlots, and how wisely he decided the case. The
          building of the temple was a very mighty work -- the like of which the
          earth had never seen, but, by wisdom given to him, the stones were
          fashioned, and laid one upon another, till at last the top stone was
          brought out with shoutings. You shall do the same, O man of business,
          though yours be a very responsible situation. You shall finish your
          course, O careful worker, though there are many eyes that watch for
          your halting. You shall do the same, sister, though you need to have
          seven eyes rather than two, you shall hear the voice of God saying,
          "This is the way, walk ye in it." Thou shalt never be ashamed nor
          confounded, world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Once more, and perhaps this fifth occasion may be the most
          comforting to the most of you, Isaiah 41:17, "When the poor and needy
          seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I
          the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them."
          You may be brought to this state to-day. Your soul may need Christ,
          but you may not be able to find him. You may feel that without the
          mercy which comes from the atoning blood you are lost. You may have
          gone to works and ceremonies, to prayings and doings, to alms-givings
          and to experiences, and have found them all dried wells, and now you
          can hardly pray, for your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth for
          thirst. Now in your worst condition, brought to the lowest state into
          which a creature ever can be cast, Christ will not forsake you, he
          will appear for your help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, one of these five occasions must suit you, and let me here
          remind you that whatever God has said to any one saint he has said to
          all. When he opens a well for one man it is that all may drink. When
          the manna falls, it is not only for those in the wilderness, but we by
          faith do eat the manna still. No promise is of private interpretation.
          When God openeth a granary-door to give out food, there may be some
          one starving man who is the occasion of its being opened, but all the
          hungry besides may come and feed too. Whether he gave the word to
          Abraham or to Moses matters not; he has given it to thee as one of the
          covenanted seed. There is not a high blessing too lofty for thee; nor
          a wide mercy too extensive for thee. Lift up now thine eyes to the
          north and to the south, to the east and to the west, for all this is
          thine. Climb to Pisgah's top, and view the utmost limit of the divine
          promise, for the land is all thine own. There is not a brook of living
          water of which thou mayest not drink. If the land floweth with milk
          and honey, eat the honey and drink the milk. The fattest of the kine,
          yea, and the sweetest of the wines, let all be thine, for there is no
          denial of any one of them to any saint. Be thou bold to believe, for
          he hath said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." To put
          everything in one, there is nothing you can want, there is nothing you
          can ask for, there is nothing you can need in time or in eternity,
          there is nothing living, nothing dying, there is nothing in this
          world, nothing in the next world, there is nothing now, nothing at the
          resurrection-morning, nothing in heaven that is not contained in this
          text -- "I will never leave thee; I will never forsake thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I shall give five blows to drive home the nail while I speak upon
          THE SWEET CONFIRMATIONS of this most precious promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Let me remind you that the Lord will not and cannot leave his
          people, because of his relationship to them. He is your Father; will
          your Father leave you? Has he not said -- "Can a woman forget her
          sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her
          womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." Would you,
          being evil, leave your child to perish? Never, never! Remember, Christ
          is your husband. Would you, a husband, neglect your wife? Is it not a
          shame to a man, unless he nourisheth and cherisheth her even as his
          own body, and will Christ become one of these ill husbands? Hath he
          not said -- "I hate putting away," and will he ever put thee away?
          Remember, thou art part of his body. No man yet ever hated his own
          flesh. Thou mayest be but as a little finger, but will he leave his
          finger to rot, to perish, to starve? Thou mayest be the least
          honorable of all the members, but is it not written that upon these he
          bestoweth abundant honor, and so our uncomely parts have abundant
          comeliness? If he be father, if he be husband, if he be head, if he be
          all-in-all, how can he leave thee? Think not so hardly of thy God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then, next, his honor binds him never to forsake thee. When we see
          a house half-built and left in ruins, we say, "This man began to build
          and was not able to finish." Shall this be said of thy God, that he
          began to save thee and could not bring thee to perfection? Is it
          possible that he will break his word, and so stain his truth? Shall
          men be able to cast a slur upon his power, his wisdom, his love, his
          faithfulness? No! thank God, no! "I give," saith he "unto my sheep
          eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
          them out of my hand." If thou shouldest perish, believer, hell would
          ring with diabolical laughter against the character of God; and if
          ever one whom Jesus undertook to save shouldest perish, then the
          demons of the pit would point the finger of scorn for ever against a
          defeated Christ, against a God that undertook but went not through.
        </p>
        <p>"His honor is engaged to save</p>
        <p>The meanest of his sheep;</p>
        <p>All that his heavenly Father gave</p>
        <p>His hands securely keep."</p>
        <p>
          3. And if that be not enough, wilt thou remember besides this that the
          past all goes to prove that he will not forsake thee. Thou hast been
          in deep waters; hast thou been drowned? Thou hast walked through the
          fires; hast thou been burned? Thou hast had six troubles; hath he
          forsaken thee? Thou hast gone down to the roots of the mountains, and
          the weeds have been wrapped about thy head; hath he not brought thee
          up again? Thou hast borne great and sore troubles; but hath he not
          delivered thee? Say, when did he leave thee? Testify against him; if
          thou hast found him forgetful, then doubt him. If thou hast found him
          unworthy of thy confidence, then disown him, but not till then. The
          past is vocal with a thousand songs of gratitude, and every note
          therein proveth by an indisputable logic that he will not forsake his
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And if that be not enough ask thy father and the saints that have
          gone before. Did ever any perish trusting in Christ? I have heard that
          some whom Jehovah loved have fallen from grace, and have been lost. I
          have heard lips of ministers thus prostitute themselves to falsehood,
          but I know that such never was the case. He keepeth all his saints;
          not one of them hath perished; they are in his hand, and have hitherto
          been preserved. David mourneth, "All thy waves and thy billows have
          gone over me;" yet, he crieth, "Hope thou in God, for I shall yet
          praise him." Jonah laments, "The earth with her bars was about me for
          ever;" and yet, erelong he says, "Salvation is of the Lord." Ye
          glorified ones above, through much tribulation ye have inherited the
          kingdom, and wearing your white robes, ye smile from your thrones of
          glory and say to us, "Doubt not the Lord, neither distrust him, he
          hath not forsaken his people nor cast off his chosen."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Beloved friends, there is no reason why he should cast us off. Can
          you adduce any reason why he should cast you away? Is it your poverty,
          your nakedness, your peril, the danger of your life? In all these
          things we are more than conquerors through him that hath loved us. Do
          you say it is your sins? Then I answer sin can never be a cause why
          God should cast away his people, for they were full of sin when he at
          first embraced their persons, and espoused their cause. That would
          have been a cause why he never should have loved them, but having
          loved them when they were dead in trespasses and sins, their sin can
          never be a reason for leaving them. Besides, the Apostle says, "I am
          persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
          principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
          -- and sin is one of the things present, and I fear it is one of the
          things to come -- "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
          shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
          Jesus our Lord." O child of God, there is no fear of your misusing
          this precious truth. The base-born professor of godliness may say, "I
          will sin, for God will not cast me away," but you will not, ye heirs
          of heaven; rather you will bind this about your heart, and say "Now
          will I love him who having loved his own, loves them even unto the
          end." Glory be to God,
        </p>
        <p>"'Midst all my sin, and care, and woe,</p>
        <p>His Spirit will not let me go."</p>
        <p>
          Go, ye slaves that fear the curse of God, and sweat and toil; we are
          his sons, and we know he cannot expel us from his heart. May God
          deliver us from the infamous bondage of the doctrine which makes men
          fear that God may be unfaithful, that Christ may divorce his own
          spouse, may let the members of his own body perish; that he may die
          for them and yet not save them. If there be any truth taught us in
          Scripture, it is that the children of God cannot perish. If this Book
          teaches anything whatever, if it be not all a fiction from beginning
          to end, it teaches in a hundred places that "The righteous shall hold
          on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and
          stronger." "The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but
          the covenant of his love cannot depart from us saith the Lord that
          hath mercy upon us."
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now, fifthly, the SUITABLE CONCLUSIONS to be drawn from this
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. One of the first is contentment. The apostle says, "Having food and
          raiment, let us be therewith content, for he hath said, I will never
          leave thee, nor forsake thee." Ishmael, the son of Hagar, had his
          water in a bottle; and he might have laughed at Isaac because Isaac
          had no bottle, but then here was the difference between them -- Isaac
          lived by the well. Now some of us have little enough in this world; we
          have no bottle of water, no stock in hand; but then we live by the
          well, and that is better still. To depend upon the daily providence of
          a faithful God, is better than to be worth twenty thousand pounds a
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Courage is the next lesson. Let us boldly say, "God is my helper,
          why should I fear what man can do unto me." A child of God afraid!
          Why, there is nothing more contrary to his nature. If any would
          persecute you, look them in the face and bear it cheerfully. If they
          laugh at you, let them laugh; you can laugh when they shall howl. If
          any despise you, be content to be despised by fools, and to be
          misunderstood by madmen. It were hard if the world loved us; it is an
          easy thing if the world hateth us. We are so used to be spoken of as
          altogether vile in our motives and selfish in our objects; so used to
          hear our adversaries misconstrue our best words and pull our sentences
          to pieces, that if they were to do anything else but howl, we should
          think ourselves unworthy. "Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid
          of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as
          grass; and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth
          the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Then next, we ought to cast off our despondency. Some of you came
          here this morning as black as the weather. Just now we saw some gleams
          of sunshine peering through those side windows, until our friends
          hastened to draw the blinds, to shut out the dazzling brightness from
          their eyes; I hope, however, you will not shut out the rays of holy
          joy which break in upon you now. No, since he has said, "I will never
          leave nor forsake thee" leave your troubles in your pews, and bear
          away a song.
        </p>

          4. And then, my brethren, here is argument for the greatest possible
          delight. How we ought to rejoice with joy unspeakable if He will never
          leave us! Mere songs are not enough; shout for joy all ye that are
          upright in heart.

          5. And, lastly, what ground there is here for faith! Let us lean upon
          our God with all our weight. Let us throw ourselves upon his
          faithfulness as we do upon our beds, bringing all our weariness to his
          dear rest. Now, right on our God let us cast the burdens of our
          bodies, and our souls, for he hath said, "I will never leave thee; I
          will never forsake thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, I wish this promise belonged to you all! I would give my right
          hand if it could! But some of you must not touch it; it does not
          belong to some of you, for it is the exclusive property of the man who
          trusts in Christ. "Oh!" saith one, "then I will trust in Christ." Do
          it, soul, do it; and if thou trustest in him he will never leave thee.
          Black as thou art, he will wash thee; he will never leave thee. Wicked
          as thou art, he will make thee holy, he will never leave thee. Though
          thou hast nought that should win his love, he will press thee to his
          bosom; he will never leave thee. Living or dying, in time or in
          eternity, he will never forsake thee, but will surely bring thee to
          his right hand, and say, "Here am I, and the children whom thou hast
          given me."
        </p>

          May God seal these five negatives upon our memories and hearts for
          Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
