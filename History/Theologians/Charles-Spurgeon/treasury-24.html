          TITLE.<b> A Psalm of David. </b>From the title we learn nothing but
          the authorship. This is interesting and leads us to observe the
          wondrous operations of the Spirit upon the mind of Israel's sweet
          singer, enabling him to touch the mournful string in Psalm twenty-two,
          to pour forth gentle notes of peace in Psalm twenty-three, and here to
          utter majestic and triumphant strains. We can do or sing all things
          when the Lord strengthens us.

          This sacred hymn was probably written to be sung when the ark of the
          covenant was taken up from the house of Obed-edom, to remain within
          curtains upon the hill of Zion. The words are not unsuitable for the
          sacred dance of joy in which David led the way upon that joyful
          occasion. The eye of the psalmist looked, however, beyond the typical
          upgoing of the ark to the sublime ascension of the King of glory. We
          will call it <i>The Song of the Ascension.</i>

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1.</p></b> How very different is this from
        the ignorant Jewish notion of God which prevailed in our Savior's day?
        The Jews said, "The holy land is God's, and the seed of Abraham are his
        only people;" but their great Monarch had long before instructed them—
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof."

        >
        The whole round world is claimed for Jehovah,<b>
          "and they that dwell therein" </b
        >are declared to be his subjects. When we consider the bigotry of the
        Jewish people at the time of Christ, and how angry they were with our
        Lord for saying that many widows were in Israel, but unto none of them
        was the prophet sent, save only to the widow of Sarepta, and that there
        were many lepers in Israel, but none of them was healed except Naaman
        the Syrian—when we recollect, too, how angry they were at the mention of
        Paul's being sent to the Gentiles, we are amazed that they should have
        remained in such blindness, and yet have sung this psalm, which shows so
        clearly that God is not the God of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles
        also.
        <p align="justify">
          What a rebuke is this to those wiseacres who speak of the negro and
          other despised races as though they were not cared for by the God of
          Heaven! If a man be but a man the Lord claims him, and who dares to
          brand him as a mere piece of merchandise! The meanest of men is a
          dweller in the world, and therefore belongs to Jehovah.

          The "fullness" of the earth may mean its harvests, its wealth, its
          life, or its worship; in all these senses the Most High God is
          Possessor of all. The earth is full of God; he made it full and he
          keeps it full, notwithstanding all the demands which living creatures
          make upon its stores.

          Under man's tutored hand the world is coming to a greater fullness
          than ever, but it is all the Lord's; the field and the fruit, the
          earth and all earth's wonders are Jehovah's. We look also for a
          sublimer fullness when the true ideal of a world for God shall have
          been reached in millennial glories, and then most clearly the earth
          will be the Lord's and the fullness thereof. These words are now upon
          London's Royal Exchange, they shall one day be written in letters of
          light across the sky.

          Paul uses this verse twice, to show that no food is unclean, and that
          nothing is really the property of false gods. All things are God's; no
          ban is on the face of nature, nothing is common or unclean. The world
          is all God's world, and the food which is sold in the shambles is
          sanctified by being my Father's, and I need not scruple to eat
          thereof.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b> In the second verse we have the
        reason why the world belongs to God, namely, because he has created it,
        which is a title beyond all dispute.

        is God who lifts up the earth from out of the sea, so that the dry land,
        which otherwise might in a moment be submerged, as in the days of Noah,
        is kept from the floods.
        <i

          Let it be noted, however, upon what insecure foundations all
          terrestrial things are founded. Founded on the seas! Established on
          the floods! Blessed be God the Christian has another world to look

        Jews only, nor Gentiles only, nor any one branch of mankind peculiarly,

          The soul must be delivered from delighting in the groveling toys of
          earth. The man who is born for Heaven "has not lifted up his soul unto
          vanity." All men have their joys, by which their souls are lifted up;
          the worldling lifts up his soul in carnal delights, which are mere

        reigns and grace alone. Such men wear the holy livery of the Great King
        because he has of his own free love clothed them therewith. The true

            everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in."

        >These last verses reveal to us the great representative man, who
        answered to the full character laid down, and therefore by his own right
        ascended the holy hill of Zion. Our Lord Jesus Christ could ascend into
        the hill of the Lord because his hands were clean and his heart was
        pure.<i>
          If we by faith in him are conformed to his image we shall enter too. </i
        >We have here a picture of our Lord's glorious ascent. We see him rising
        from amidst the little group upon Olivet, and as the cloud receives him,
        angels reverently escort him to the gates of Heaven.

          The ancient gates of the eternal temple are personified and addressed
          in song by the attending cohorts of rejoicing spirits.

          "Lo his triumphal chariot waits,<br />
          And angels chant the solemn lay.<br />
          Lift up your heads, you heavenly gates;<br />
          You everlasting doors, give way."

          They are called upon <b>"to lift up their heads,"</b> as though with
          all their glory they were not great enough for the All-glorious King.
          Let all things do their utmost to honor so great a Prince. Let the
          highest Heaven put on unusual loftiness in honor of "the King of
          Glory." He who, fresh from the cross and the tomb, now rides through
          the gates of the New Jerusalem is higher than the heavens; great and
          everlasting as they are, those gates of pearl are all unworthy of him
          before whom the heavens are not pure, and who charges his angels with
          folly.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 8.</p></b>The watchers at the gate hearing
        the song look over the battlements and ask,
        <b>"Who is this King of glory?" </b>A question full of meaning and
        worthy of the meditations of eternity. Who is he in his person, his
        nature, his character, his office and his work? What is his pedigree?
        What his rank and what his race?
        <p align="justify">
          The answer given in a mighty wave of music is,<b>
            "The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." </b
          >We know the might of Jesus by the battles which he has fought, and
          the victories which he has won over sin, and death, and Hell, and we
          clap our hands as we see him leading captivity captive in the majesty
          of his strength. Oh for a heart to sing his praises! Mighty hero, be
          crowned for ever King of kings and Lord of lords.

            Verse 9. "Lift up your heads, O gates; even lift them up, O

        >The words are repeated with a pleasing variation. There are times of
        deep earnest feeling when repetitions are not vain but full of force.
        Doors were often taken from their hinges when Easterns would show
        welcome to a guest, and some doors were drawn up and down, and may
        possibly have protruded from the top; thus literally lifting up their
        heads.

          The picture is highly poetic, and shows how wide Heaven's gate is set
          by the ascension of our Lord. Blessed be God, the gates have never
          been shut since. The opened gates of Heaven invite the weakest
          believer to enter.

          Dear reader, it is possible that you are saying, "I shall never enter
          into the Heaven of God, for I have neither clean hands nor a pure
          heart." Look then to Christ, who has already climbed the holy hill. He
          has entered as the forerunner of those who trust him.<i>
            Follow in his footsteps, and repose upon his merit</i
          >. He rides triumphantly into Heaven, and you shall ride there too if
          you trust him.

          "But how can I get the character described?" say you. The Spirit of
          God will give you that. He will create in you a new heart and a right
          spirit.

        The closing note is inexpressibly grand. Jehovah Almighty, Lord of men
        and angels, Lord of the universe, Lord of the worlds, is the King of
        glory. All true glory is concentrated upon the true God, for all other
        glory is but a passing pageant, the painted pomp of an hour. The
        ascended Savior is here declared to be the Head and Crown of the
        universe, the King of Glory! Our Immanuel is hymned in sublimest
        strains. Jesus of Nazareth is Jehovah Almighty.
