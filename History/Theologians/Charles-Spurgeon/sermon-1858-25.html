        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.189)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 25th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of
          Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help
          us." -- Acts 16:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS WAS NO DOUBT a special vision sent of God for the direction of
          the apostle. For we are told in the next verse, that they assuredly
          gathered from this vision, that the Lord had called them to preach the
          gospel in Macedonia. And yet the vision may be very readily accounted
          for by natural causes. Men usually dream of that which is most upon
          their minds. Who would marvel that the miser should, in his restless
          sleep, be pictured to his own sight as counting over his gold? Who
          wonders that the mother's dream is often concerning her fair infant?
          Who marvels that the wife frequently dreams of shipwrecks, when, in
          the stormy night, she lies upon her bed, her last thoughts having been
          exercised concerning her husband at sea? You wonder not that the
          soldier in the trenches dreams of battle. And hence we cannot marvel
          that the apostle Paul, whose whole soul was full of his Master's
          cause, should have a vision in the night concerning a new field of
          labor, which God had intended to open up to him. You will remember
          that the apostle was, on this occasion, in a peculiar condition. He at
          first endeavored to preach the gospel in Phrygia and Galatia, but he
          was forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia. And "after
          they had come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia, but the
          Spirit suffered them not." The apostle was like Abraham of old; he
          went forth, not knowing whither he went. There was a certain path
          which he must take, and when he strove to turn either to the right
          hand or to the left, the Spirit directly forbade him, and he was
          compelled to go on till he came to the sea-port of Troas. There,
          wearied with his journey, he cast himself upon his couch, and in the
          midst of the night a vision appeared unto him. A man who by his brogue
          and his dress was discovered to be a Macedonian, said to him, "Come
          over and help us." God sometimes tells men in their sleep the secret
          they could not discover when they were awake. We have heard of the
          preacher who, tired late on Saturday evening, has been unable to think
          of a discourse, in the middle of the night has dreamed it through, and
          on the morrow he ascended his pulpit and preached it. What wonder
          then, that the apostle Paul, specially directed by the Spirit of God,
          after an day long wearily exercising his mind an to the journey God
          intended him to take, should, after all, when in his sleep, have a
          vision from on high, teaching him where he should go.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, having thus prefaced our discourse, we have another
          observation to make before we proceed to a full discussion of the
          text. What an instance of Divine sovereignty we have in our text! He
          who is wise can see sovereignty everywhere in the work of salvation,
          but how clearly is it present here. Bithynia must not hear the gospel;
          the apostle desires to go and preach it there; but as yet, it seems,
          God does not intend that Bithynia should be evangelised. He desires to
          tarry in Asia, and there throughout its length and breadth preach the
          gospel; but he is strictly forbidden, and the command comes to him
          that he is to go across to Europe, and there proclaim the gospel. Was
          not this sovereignty? Why was it that God shut the door in Bithynia,
          and opened it in Philippi! Was it that Philippi was more worthy, or
          that Bithynia needed it less? Assuredly not. It was of God's mercy
          that he sent the gospel at any time, and when he sent to Philippi the
          most eminent of apostles to preach it, who shall blame him? Has he not
          a right to do what he wills with his own? But we may rest quite
          assured, that his sovereignty was not an arbitrary exercise of
          despotic will. It was a sovereignty dictated by the highest wisdom;
          for while God rules all things according to his own will, yet we are
          expressly told, that he doeth it according to the counsels of his
          will, his will being no blind headstrong thing, willing for no reason
          whatever, but being always subject to his own sense of that which is
          the wisest, and which will promote his glory and his creature's
          profit. However, we must still observe, Divine sovereignty is that
          which casts a rich lustre upon grace, when we recollect that it is
          sovereign and free. Oh ye, of the race of Britain! bless the Lord,
          that he hath sent the gospel unto you; for while doubtless there is
          wisdom in it, remember there is also sovereignty in it. "He hath not
          dealt so with any nation. Praise ye the Lord." Had he willed it, had
          he seen fit, the gospel had this day been flourishing in the center of
          Africa, and you might at this moment have been destitute of the word
          of the gospel, living barbarians like your fathers, embruing your
          hands in blood. Unto the great, dread Sovereign, who ruleth as he
          wills on earth as in heaven, be glory for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we turn to our text. "And a vision appeared to Paul in the
          night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come
          over into Macedonia, and help us." First, we shall observe, that the
          best help that can be rendered to any people is the preaching of the
          gospel. "Come over and help us," that is, preach to us. Secondly, we
          shall notice that although we have no visions or dreary in the night,
          yet, the nations on the earth are calling to the church of the living
          God, and are saying to us, "Come over to us, and help us." And then,
          thirdly, I shall conclude, by solemnly asking the question, what do
          you who love the Lord intend to say to those, who are now asking at
          your hands the help of a preached gospel?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE GREATEST HELP THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO ANY PEOPLE, IS
          THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL, and when I say this, I am uttering a
          truth which I need not guard. The gospel is a help, not in one way,
          but in every way. Those who have not the gospel stand in the greatest
          need of help; but when the gospel is carried, you carry everything
          within it. In the folds of the gospel sleepeth the manifold wisdom of
          God, and his manifold goodness also toward the sons of men. Behold,
          the nations of the earth this day are still the bond-slaves of tyrants
          -- many lands are still subject to despotic dynasties, who trample men
          beneath their feet, as if men were but earthen pitchers to be broken
          in pieces by the iron wills of kings. How is liberty to be established
          in these lands? Shall the point of the bayonet bring liberty to these
          nations that still are slaves? Never, never. Iron makes our fetters,
          iron rivets them, but iron never can unloose them. We need something
          more potent than steel to carve out the liberty of mankind. Love, love
          of the Gospel, must be the ground work of liberty, and if liberty,
          equality, and fraternity, the three great words that are the world's
          heir loom, are ever to be fully known and realised, it must be by the
          preaching of the Word of Jesus. The preaching of the gospel is the
          terror of despots. If you ask what makes this land free, every candid
          man must say it is the open gospel and the unfettered preaching of the
          Word. Glasgow's motto is, "Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of
          the Word." It is the coat of arms of liberty herself. Liberty
          flourishes by the preaching of the Word of God. Certain it is that
          wherever you find Protestantism, you find liberty, and wherever you
          leave Protestantism behind you, you begin to feel the yoke, and to
          hear the groans of the oppressed. It is true that Protestantism doth
          not in every place produce perfect liberty, because it is not
          sufficiently true to itself. There are still places where the slave
          feels the lash, while his master calls himself a Christian; but this
          is not the legitimate effect of our religion, but rather the effect of
          a delusion which hell itself did first invent, and which nought but
          the deep depravity of men could ever permit to stand before the face
          of God's sun. Yes, ye tyrants on your thrones, the little stone cut
          out of the mountain without hands shall yet break you in pieces! O
          great statue of tyranny with thy head of gold, and thy feet of clay,
          thou shalt yet totter, for this shall break thee in pieces, for the
          breaker is come out before us, and the king at the head of us, and who
          can withstand his might? What shall hold out against the mighty
          principle wherewith Christ makes men free?
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, brethren, too, and see how the nations of the earth are lying
          under gloomy superstition. Perhaps there is one thing in the world
          worse than kingcraft, and that is priestcraft. May God save us from
          two things -- from tyrannical kings, and from priests of all sorts.
          Priests of any sort are bad, but superstitious priests are the worst
          of all. Oh, how many nations of the earth have their intellect
          blighted, their hopes blasted, their progress shipped, their whole
          history eclipsed of its glory, their state robbed of its riches, by
          the cursed dominancy of priests. Men are compelled to believe just
          what the priest chooses. Because he wears a cassock; because he has
          been educated in the deep mysteries of craftiness, he is to be lord
          over men's consciences, and consciences and hearts are to bow before
          him; wherever he comes his word is to be law, his will is to open and
          shut the gates of heaven, for he pretends that the keys of heaven and
          of hades are hanging at his girdle. How shall we deliver men from
          these enthralling superstitions! No how, but by the preaching of the
          gospel. You cannot make men free, even by governments; you cannot give
          them a thorough freedom by giving them a republic itself; for that
          republic must fall so long as priestcraft is there, for liberty and
          priestcraft agree as well together as God and devil, and no better;
          and until the one falls the other can never stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the preaching of the gospel which teaches that believers are all
          priests and kings; which lifts every one of us into the high places of
          princes and monarchs and puts every one of us on a level with pontiffs
          and priests -- this is the gospel which shall yet set men free, and
          the preaching of this, and this only, is the world's great and
          grandest hope of its deliverance from the slavery of the body and the
          yet more accursed bondage of the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, there are some nations of the earth that have never as
          yet tasted of the sweets of salvation. Large tracts of country have
          been discovered, where the people are still debased and degraded; the
          kraal of the Hottentot has not yet blossomed into a mansion, the spear
          of the New Zealander has not yet been entirely changed for a pruning
          hook. There are many places where all the joys of life and the social
          comforts and enjoyments of our being, are as yet totally unknown. Now,
          the gospel has blessings in both its hands. Wherever it goes it has
          the blessings heaven, rich and golden -- it has the blessing of the
          earth, fair and silvery. They are both precious things, and while we
          believe the gospel is ordained most of all to bless man for the
          hereafter, yet the secularist himself, if he were wise, must take some
          interest in the progress of the gospel, for it is a blessing to men
          even ill this life. The great civilizer is the cross. Nothing else can
          make the barbarian into a civilized man, but the cross and the vision
          of Christ hanging on it. Blessed are the feet of them that bring glad
          tidings of peace, for where they bring the glad tidings of peace with
          God, they bring also good news of goodwill towards men, -- even
          goodwill towards men as creatures here, as well as good news to them
          as creatures that are to exist for ever. My dear brethren and sisters,
          if you would bless the world, in the largest possible sense,
          temporarily, spiritually, and eternally; if you would bless the bodies
          and the souls of men, if you would bless men in their children, in
          their houses, if you would bless them in their meats and drinks and in
          all the necessities of life, the one simple means of doing all this,
          is just the proclamation of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
          that fully preached and received, has been proved in instances which I
          need not now stop to recall to your memories -- instances abundant and
          recent, to be after all, the power of God, not only to salvation but
          to civilization too.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet one more point which I must mention here in which the
          gospel is the best help to man. We must remember to-day, that there
          are districts of the earth where the ground is yet red with blood.
          There are sad portions of our globe that as yet must have the name of
          Aceldama, the field of gore, there are spots where the horse-hoof is
          splashed with blood; where the very carcasses of men are the food of
          ravens and of jackalls, the mounds of Balaclava are as yet scarcely
          green, and the spots where rest the relics of our own murdered sisters
          and brothers are not covered with the memorial stone. War has ravaged
          whole districts; even in these late times the dogs of war are not yet
          muzzled. Oh! what shall we do to put an end to war? Mars, where is the
          chain that shall bind thee like Prometheus, to the rock? How shall we
          imprison thee for ever, thou cruel Moloch; how shall we for ever chain
          thee? Behold here is the great chain, that which one day is to bind
          the great serpent; it has the blood-red links of love. The gospel of
          Jesus Christ the crucified one, shall yet hush the clarion of war, and
          break the battle-bow in sunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy are we, thrice happy, that we have a gospel which shall make men
        </p>
        <p>"Hang the useless helmet high,</p>
        <p>And study war no more."</p>
        <p>
          Let us spread it, then, to earth's utmost bounds; for, to repeat the
          text I quoted just now, it hath blessings in both its hands, wherever
          it goes temporarily as well as eternally, it blesses the human race.
          And when it shall have spread to its utmost limits, when all the
          habitable earth shall be covered with it then the mist that swathes
          our planet shall be rolled away, and bright, like a new-born morning
          star, this earth shall shine out with her sister stars in all her
          glory, and the angels shall once more sing, and God himself shall
          repeat his verdict -- "all things are very good."
        </p>
        <p>
          But still, beloved, the greatest help that the gospel brings is help
          to the soul. Ah, Christian men, ye know what this means: your brothers
          and sisters are this day wandering blindfold, they know not whither.
          Ye know, for the Bible tells you that they are wending their weary way
          down to the gulf of black despair! Oh does not your heart desire that
          the blind eye should be opened, that the misguided should be directed
          on the path to heaven: would not your pity desire to snatch the fire
          brand from the flame? Do you not anxiously seek to know how you can
          lead the vicious to virtue, and the virtuous to the righteousness that
          is in Jesus Christ? Have you no desire to see God's elect ingathered,
          to see them washed, and sanctified, and perfected? Remember this is to
          be, and since it is to be it is certain that ye must send the gospel
          far and wide, for by no other means can God's elect be gathered home.
          How can they believe without a preacher? How can they preach except
          they be sent? The gospel must go throughout all lands, that the elect
          may be gathered home, and the Messiah's kingdom come. Oh! ye who love
          the souls of men, it is to you an awful thought that hell's caverns
          are filling; it is a dreary thing to you to see the broad road so
          crowded with its many travelers? You are longing and wishing that the
          narrow way might have more pilgrims, I beseech you, then, look to it,
          that by every mean. and by all means ye aid the preaching of the
          gospel of Jesus; for it is the help for which the earth calls, and the
          help which you must render to it. Come over and help us by preaching
          Christ's holy gospel. Thus have I done with the first head, may the
          Lord help us in the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second point is, that although not in visions of the night,
          yet EVERY DAY AND EVERY HOUR, THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH ARE SAYING,
          "COME OVER AND HELP US." Do you not know, that the loudest eloquence
          is silence? To move the heart of the right-minded, ye need not the
          declamation of the orator. The sight of silent, dumb misery is the
          highest eloquence to a tender heart. It is true, I must confess it the
          nations of the earth do not vocally ask for your help; nay, worse than
          that, if you send them the help of the gospel they will many of them
          reject it. Your missionaries have been slain, -- the altars of false
          gods have been stained with their blood; but still I solemnly repeat
          it the nations of the earth are silently crying, "Come over and help
          us." If I say; a person in the street sick, faint, and dying, although
          he spoke not to me, though he asked me not to befriend him, I should
          think the weakness of his silence more potent than all the power of
          words. Ay, and if I saw him like a maniac, rejecting my help and
          pushing me from him, if I was convinced that he was really a maniac,
          for that very reason that he needed my help, I would thrust my alms
          upon him, I would willingly give him my help and assistance, and so
          must you do. The nations of the earth are dead in sin; how can they
          cry to you? But it is yours to see their misery; and let the poor,
          poor dumb wounds of this bleeding earth speak to you. It is true,
          earth is a maniac, and it puts away the only cure. But what care we
          for that? It is ours to thrust our kindness upon unwilling men,
          because we believe that their unwillingness arises from the madness of
          their disease. Let us take the poor man that has fallen among thieves.
          Let us pour in the oil and the wine, and if he doth not receive it
          gratefully, because he is faint, if he putteth his hand upon the
          wound, and rends away the liniment, and unbinds the plaster,
          nevertheless. let us bind him up again, and set him upon our own
          beast, and carry him to the inn. Let us pay for the lodging even
          though as yet he cannot speak to thank us; and the day shall come,
          when the wound is healed, and the burning fever is removed, when his
          brain is cool, and his reason restored, that he shall fall at our feet
          and kiss the hand that once he spurned. Unborn generations shall bless
          the men that sent the gospel, which at first their fathers did reject.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, brethren and sisters, let me plead the cause of the dumb. No
          man of Macedonia is here to-day to say "Come over and help us," but
          let me be the heathen's spokesman, and very earnestly ask you to come
          and help him. Methinks, I will stand here as a heathen this morning,
          and I say to you as if I had not heard the gospel. "Ye Christians of
          Britain! ye highly favored ones, who know the name of Jesus and prove
          the power of the Spirit, preach the gospel to us, for we are men like
          yourselves. What though our skin be of a color less fair than your
          own? Yet he fashioneth our hearts alike. Oh tell us not, because we
          feed on the locust, and eat the serpent, that therefore we are not of
          your kith and kind! Not that which goeth into a man defileth a man.'
          It is true, our kings and princes are only fit to rank with your
          beggars; but oh! God hath made of one blood all nations that dwell
          upon the face of the earth; and from our huts and cabins we come forth
          to-day, and we say to you, We are men -- we are your brothers --
          younger brothers, it is true -- we have not had a double portion of
          the inheritance, brothers, too, whose fathers spent their part in
          riotous living, but why should the children's teeth be set on edge
          because the fathers have eaten sour grapes? Why must the son of man
          for ever bear the curse of Canaan? O preach the gospel to us! We are
          men, mother Eve is our mother, as well as yours; Adam, too, is the
          father from whose loins we sprang; and because we are men, the common
          sympathy of humanity bids you listen to us, when we say, Come over and
          help us.' Besides, we have another argument. We are told that unto you
          is the Word of this salvation sent,' not for yourselves, but for us,
          brothers, who have not heard the gospel and who know it not. And you
          have the treasure in your own land; and we believe you have the
          treasure given to you, that you may lavish handfuls of it out to us.
          We know that old Judea had the covenant and the oracles, and the
          gospel to keep for coming generations; and we believe that you men of
          Britain have the gospel, not for yourselves, but for us. We have heard
          what your Master said, Ye are the lights of the world;' not lights of
          Britain, not lights for yourselves, the lights of the world. Oh! bear
          your burning torches into the glades of our dark forests. come and
          shed your light through the dark mists of our idolatrous temples; let
          the bats of our superstition, and the owls of our ignorance, fly away
          before the sunlight of your gospel. It is not for yourselves you have
          received it, but for us. Oh! give it to us. Preach the gospel to us,
          for it is designed for us. But we have another argument, brethren;
          look at our miseries!"
        </p>
        <p>
          As the spokesman for my poor brethren to-day, I stand before you, and
          I remind you of the tortures to which the poor Hindoo devotee puts
          himself; I remind you of the cruelties enacted in the Chinese empire
          -- the horrors of a government that is based upon idolatry. I tell you
          of the distress, the destitution, the poverty, the nakedness, the
          misery, of the Bechuanas and the Bushmen, and I speak for these, and I
          say, "Christians, you have the means of alleviating their woes by
          sending them the gospel; will you not do it?" Look at the dwellers in
          the land of the jungle and the lion. There they are; the serpent has
          grasped them in his folds, and like the boa-constrictor of their own
          forests, he is crushing their nations, until the ribs of the strong
          man snap, and the hearts of the women melt like wax. And you have the
          sword in your hands that can cut the serpent's head! Your Master
          bruised that head beneath his heel, and you must do the same. Oh!
          come, come, ye missionaries of the cross, ye ministers of Jesus, come
          and deliver us from this deadly hydra! Save us from our fearful doom!
          Our miseries invoke your aid. It is true, we cannot speak to you in
          gentle language, but there was a time when poets walked amongst us,
          and some of the light that shone in Paradise, yet gilded our darkness.
          and we treasured up a few of those faint rays, and we are hoping that
          the sun of righteousness will yet dawn upon us. Oh! come, roll away
          those mists; come, chase our night. and let us see that sacred, high,
          eternal noon, which is the daughter of the gospel following the Sun of
          Righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, Christian men, let me speak to you as one of yourselves.
          Brethren, you and I are soldiers, soldiers of the cross, and at this
          hour worlds are rushing to the shock. The fight is thickening, and we
          are warriors! Shame upon the craven who stays from the battle. The
          trump is sounding to-day. Mohammed has waked from his sleep; the
          Moslem, with bloody hands, has sought to slay our race; the Hindoo,
          too, the meek-eyed Hindoo, his eyes have glared like the eyes of his
          tiger, and his lips have smacked with gore. The battle is raging. Not
          there alone. Popery hath aroused itself, with mighty effort it is
          endeavoring to win back this gem of the sea, this first isle of the
          ocean. Infidelity, too, is on the stir; her myrmidons are flying here
          and there. Everything is awake, except the church of God. Oh! rouse
          ye, men and brethren; rouse, now that the fight is at its fullest
          fury. Now is the time for our most desperate velour, our most earnest
          zeal. Recollect, every time you bow your knees, and say, "Our Father,"
          you tell a lie at the end of that prayer, if you are not seeking to
          make his kingdom come, and his will be done in earth, as it is heaven.
          You are praying for what you do not try to get; you are insulting God
          by saying, "Thy kingdom come," with as foul a mockery, as if I should
          say, "Be warmed and be filled," to some poor dying beggar, and then
          refused to give to his needs, that he might remove his distresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recollect, too, that you cannot be Christians at all, not in the right
          sense of the word, unless you everyone of you would compass sea and
          land to make one proselyte. You must have in you the spirit of
          propagathm, desirous to will others to Christ, or else the genuine
          blood of Christianity is not in your veins. Of all things in the world
          Christianity is the most prolific, if it be true. Mohammedism of old
          had mighty power to spread itself, but not such power as Christianity
          had. The religion of Jesus began like a mustard seed, with those few
          men in an upper-room; but ere a half century had rolled away, the
          gospel was preached to every nation under heaven, and if we had
          Christianity in our hearts of the right sort -- hot, burning stuff,
          not the lukewarm shams of this degenerate age, our religion ere
          another half a century will have won the day. If the Spirit of God
          should give us true diligence, in the course of another half century
          there would not be one district that would not have been trodden by
          the foot of the minister, nor one town or city which would not have
          been evangelized. I know I am not speaking without book now I am
          absolutely certain that what I am saying is a sober matter of fact. If
          you will just calculate the proportion between the four hundred, and
          the progress made in one half a century, and then begin with the three
          or four millions -- I should hope there are as many as that -- of true
          Christians in the world, I say, it is a little thing to believe that
          if they were true to their profession, they might, under Divine
          blessing, carry the gospel into every known part of the habitable
          world before half a century has rolled away. However, we need not be
          afraid we shall do it. There is no fear that we shall run into any
          fanaticism. That is the last sin this age will commit. We shall go on,
          and be as orthodox and cold as we always were. No enthusiasm will ever
          fall upon us. We shall not see any very great and strange developments
          of an enormous fanaticism at the present day. Do not be alarmed,
          brothers and sisters. All I preach that looks like fanaticism will not
          hurt this age. Ye may do what ye will; preach ye never so wisely, ye
          will never make this deaf adder hear. The church of this day is a
          great deal too deaf to do anything extravagant. We do a little, and
          think it a wonderful deal. We each give fourpence to send Testaments
          to China; we will talk of it for the next fifty years! We sent out one
          or two missionaries to India (and are they not one or two, compared
          with their needs?) it is a great thing. It is a fine thing for the
          whole Baptist denomination to raise twenty thousand pounds a year,
          when there are some men in the denomination who make as much money as
          that in the time. It is a marvellous thing that out of the whole lot
          of us we should not be able to get more than that. But you know I am
          an imprudent young man, of course, -- I always shall be I dare say --
          to dare to hint that some people have a great deal too much money to
          go to heaven with. Of course it will be very wicked if I dare to say
          this morning, that to die rich is a very frightful thing; that there
          are some people who have got too much riches to allow us to have any
          sure and certain hope that they have the love of God at all; for if
          they had more of the love of God, they would not grip their money so
          tightly. They would say, "While men are damning, what is my money?
          While men are dying, what is my gold? There it goes! As much as I
          need, I have, God allows it me; as much as I shall require in my old
          age, as much as my family can demand of me, that will I have, but as
          for more, a blast and a curse would be on it if I had it. My gold and
          my silver would be cankered, for I should be guilty of the blood of
          men's souls, and then condemnation would be at my door, because I had
          the money wherewithal to send the minister to preach to them, and I
          would not give it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I say again, there is no fear of any one becoming improvidently
          liberal. You need not be frightened that anyone here will give a
          thousand pounds this morning. We provide ample accommodation for those
          who feel inclined to do so. If anyone should be overtaken with such an
          enormous fit of generosity, we will register and remember it. But I
          fear there are no people like Barnabas now. Barnabas brought all he
          had, and put it into the treasury. "My dear friend, do not do that, do
          not be so rash." Ah! he will not do that; there is no necessity for
          you to advise him. But I do say again, if Christianity were truly in
          our hearts; if we were what we professed to be; the men of generosity
          whom we meet with now and hold up as very paragons and patterns would
          cease to be wonders, for they would be as plentiful as leaves upon the
          trees. We demand of no man that he should beggar himself; but we do
          demand of every man who makes a profession that he is a Christian,
          that he should give his fair proportion, and not be content with
          giving as much to the cause of God as his own servant. We must have it
          that the man who is rich must give richly. We know the widow's mite is
          precious, but the widow's mite has been an enormously great loss to
          us. O, that widow's mite has lost Jesus Christ many a thousand pounds.
          It is a very good thing in itself; but people with thousands a-year
          talk of giving a widow's mite. What a wicked application of what never
          can apply to them. No; in our proportion we must serve our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, I come in conclusion to ask you very pointedly and plainly,
          WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO IN ANSWER TO THE HEATHEN'S CRY, "COME OVER AND
          HELP US?" Have I in all this congregation one man who loves sound
          doctrine, who has ability to preach, and who has a mind to go and
          preach the gospel in other lands? Because if I have, and if I have ten
          others who have a mind to give him ten pounds a year, I have an
          opening for sending him out at once. In Port Natal there are twenty
          Baptists, and those twenty Baptists are desirous of having a minister
          who should not only preach to them, but to the wild tribes around.
          They will raise him one hundred pounds, if we can manage to get the
          rest and send them out a missionary. Who can tell; he might be another
          Livingstone, perhaps a Moffat? Oh, that I had the honor of sending
          such an one from such a congregation as this! Have we no young men
          here this morning, who are ready to volunteer to go and preach the
          gospel in heathen lands? I confess, when I think of myself, I know I
          cannot go away. My calling is here. And yet I sometimes think what a
          lazy, feather-bed life it is for one to lead, to be preaching here
          when there are all these continents without the gospel. Some people
          think it wonderfully hard to preach two or three sermons a week. but I
          think preaching thirteen or fourteen is a fearfully little thing. And
          I think sometimes, "Oh, if I were somewhere rise, where there are some
          toils, some hardships to undergo! There is nothing to be done here. We
          cannot suffer, we cannot work, we cannot will crowns of martyrdom, we
          cannot will great battles here, as we could wish." Yes, young man, I
          say again, if you are ambitious -- if you are ambitious to serve
          Christ, the height of your ambition should lead you to say, "I desire
          to preach the gospel among the heathen." I hope there may be come here
          -- some one at least -- whose heart God hath touched. What! can it be
          possible that I should this morning address some eight thousand
          people, and yet out of the whole eight thousand there is not one who
          can say, "Here am I, send me?" Is it not strange? Very probably there
          is not. But yet I would fain hope that somewhere there is one, who
          will write on the tablet of his heart, "I will go home to pray, I will
          go home to study, and if God has given me power to preach, if there be
          any door open in his providence, here am I; I will be a preacher of
          the gospel in foreign lands."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, what are you resolved to do who cannot preach? Why, there are
          some of you, if you were to get up and preach, you had a great deal
          better sit down. It would not do for you to go and preach in foreign
          lands, because nobody would listen to you. I have often marvelled that
          some people should think themselves called to preach when they have no
          ability. As I tell them, "f God calls anybody to fly, he will give
          them wings, and if he calls them to preach, he will give them ability
          to preach." but if a man has not the ability to preach, I am sure he
          has not the call. Well, what will you do Says one, "I will pray
          earnestly in support of missions; I will cry to God, that great
          results may follow." Do so; and you shall have our best thanks for
          your prayers. But in doing that, you have not done very much. for
          recollect, that is what the Roman priest did for the beggar. The
          priest said he would not give him a sovereign, he would not give him a
          half-crown, nor would he give him a penny. "Holy father," said the
          beggar, "will you give me your prayers?" "Yes," said the priest,
          "kneel down." "No, not so," said the beggar; "for if your prayers had
          been worth a penny, you would not have given them to me." And when you
          say you will pray, but will not help the cause with something more
          substantial; though we love your prayers, we night say, "You would not
          give them if they were worth a penny." If you have nought else to give
          to Christ, ye need not be ashamed of saying, "Jesus, I give thee my
          prayers;" but if you are blessed in your substance, you will be lying
          before him, if you ask him to bless his cause, and do not give of your
          means in its support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let each, as he is able, help this great cause; and above all let
          us all in our spheres be preachers of the gospel,
        </p>
        <p>"Seeking to tell to others round,</p>
        <p>What a dear Saviour we have found."</p>
        <p>
          Let me say, before the collection is made, just this word. Alas! there
          are some of you here, that are as much heathen as if you were in
          Africa. To you I proclaim the gospel, and I have done -- "He that
          believeth and is baptized shall be saved, he that believeth not shall
          be damned. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, find thou shalt be
          saved."
