          1. Hallelujah. Praise ye Jehovah; because he is good; because his
          mercy endureth for ever.2. Who shall express the power of Jehovah? who
          shall declare all his praise? 3. Blessed are they that keep judgment,
          and blessed is he who worketh in righteousness at all times. 4.
          Remember me, O Jehovah! with the good will which thou bearest towards
          thy people: visit me with thy salvation; 5. That I may see the good of
          thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, and glory
          with thy heritage.

          1. Praise ye Jehovah This exhortation supplies the want of a title;
          not that the psalm contains nothing else than thanksgiving and praise
          to God, but that the people, from the experience of past favors, may
          obtain the assurance of reconciliation; and thus entertain the hope
          that God, although at present offended, would soon be pacified towards
          them. In celebrating the praises of God, therefore, he orders them to
          call to mind such things as would have a tendency to assuage their
          grief on account of present ills, and to animate their spirits, and
          prevent them from sinking into despair.

          2 Who shall express. This verse is susceptible of two interpretations;
          for if you read it in connection with the one immediately following,
          the sense will be, that all men are not alike equal to the task of
          praising God, because the ungodly and the wicked do nothing else than
          profane his holy name with their unclean lips; as it is said in the
          fiftieth psalm: "But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do
          to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
          mouth?" And hence to this sentence the following clause should have
          been annexed, in the form of a reply, Blessed are they that keep
          judgment I am of opinion, however, that the prophet had another
          design, namely, that there is no man who has ever endeavored to
          concentrate all his energies, both physical and mental, in the
          praising of God, but will find himself inadequate for so lofty a
          subject, the transcendent grandeur of which overpowers all our senses.
          Not that he exalts the power of God designedly to deter us from
          celebrating its praises, but rather as the means of stirring us up to
          do so to the utmost of our power. Is it any reason for ceasing our
          exertions, that with whatever alacrity we pursue our course, we yet
          come far short of perfection? But the thing which ought to inspire us
          with the greatest encouragement is, the knowledge that, though ability
          may fail us, the praises which from the heart we offer to God are
          pleasing to him; only let us beware of callousness; for it would
          certainly be very absurd for those who cannot attain to a tithe of
          perfection, to make that the occasion of their not reaching to the
          hundredth part of it.
        </p>

          3 Blessed are they that keep judgment I make a distinction between
          this and the preceding verse, and yet so as to preserve the connection
          between them. For the prophet, having declared the magnitude of God's
          power to be such that no tongue could utter all its praises, now says,
          that the praises of the lip merely are not acceptable to God, but that
          the concurrence of the heart is indispensable, nay, that even the
          whole of our deportment must be in unison with this exercise. Now,
          when he first commands to keep judgment, and then to work
          righteousness, he gives us a short description of genuine godliness. I
          have no doubt, that in the former clause he describes the sincere
          affection of the heart, and that, in the latter, he refers to external
          works. For we know, there is nothing but the mere shadow of
          righteousness, unless a man cordially devote himself to the practice
          of honesty. He requires perseverance, too, that no one may imagine
          that he has discharged this duty properly, excepting he whose constant
          and continued aim it is to live righteously and justly. We behold not
          a few who have only an empty profession; others show some signs of
          virtue, but do not maintain a consistent course of conduct.

          4 Remember me By these words the prophet declares it to be his chief
          desire, that God would extend to him that love which he bore towards
          the Church, that he might thus become a participator of all the
          blessings which, from the very first, he bestows upon his chosen, and
          which day by day he continues with them. Nor does he desire this for
          himself alone, but in name of the Church Catholic, offers up a prayer
          alike for all, that, by his example, he might stimulate the faithful
          to present similar petitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember me, says he, with the good will which thou bearest towards
          thy people; that is to say, grant to me the same unmerited kindness
          which thou art pleased to confer upon thy people, that so I may never
          be cut off from thy Church, but always be included among the number of
          thy children; for the phrase, good will towards thy people, is to be
          understood passively of that love which God graciously bears to his
          elect. It is, however, by a metonymy employed by the prophet to point
          out the marks of God's love. For from this gracious source flows that
          proof which he actually and experimentally gives of his grace. But the
          prophet, if accounted to belong to the number of the people of God,
          would consider this to be the summit of true happiness; because, by
          this means, he would feel that God was reconciled to him, (than which
          nothing is more desirables) and thus, too, he would experience that he
          was bountiful. The term, remember, relates to the circumstance of
          time, as we shall see towards the end of the psalm that it was penned
          when the people were in a state so sad and calamitous, that the
          faithful might entertain some secret apprehension that their God had
          forgotten them. To obviate this is the tendency of the next clause,
          visit me with thy salvation For God is said to visit those from whom
          he had apparently withdrawn himself; and their salvation is a
          demonstration of his good-will towards them. In the next verse he
          repeats the same sentiment, that I may see the good of thy chosen For
          he desires to be an associate and participator of the blessings which
          are constantly realised by the elect of God. The verb to see, is very
          plainly taken to denote the enjoyment of the blessings, as "to see the
          kingdom of God," (John 3:3;) and "to see good and life" (1 Peter
          3:10,) denote the corresponding blessings. Those who expound it, that
          I may see thee do good to the chosen, are mistaken; because the
          preceding verse upon which this depends will not bear this
          interpretation, and the exposition which I have given is supported by
          the words which follow, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation,
          and glory with thy heritage For it is quite obvious that the prophet
          is solicitous to become a sharer in all the benefits which are the
          portion of the chosen, that, satisfied with God alone, he may, under
          his providential care, live joyfully and happily. Whatever might be
          the then mournful state of the Church, the prophet, amid all such
          tumult, still clings fast by this principle, that there is nothing
          better than to be regarded as belonging to the flock and people of
          God, who will always prove the best of fathers to his own, and the
          faithful guardian of their welfare. All that he asks is, that God
          would deal with him, as he is wont to deal with his Church; and
          declares that he could not bear the thought of being severed or
          separated from the common lot of the Church. These words, however,
          imply a tacit complaint that at that time God was withholding his
          loving-kindness from his afflicted Church, as if he had cast her off
          altogether.<br />
