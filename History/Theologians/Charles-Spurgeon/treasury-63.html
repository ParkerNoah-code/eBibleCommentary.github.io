        >TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician upon Neginah, a Psalm of David. </b>The
        original indicates that both the hymn and the musical instrument were
        David's. He wrote the verses and himself sang them to the stringed
        instrument whose sound he loved so well. We have left the Psalms
        entitled Michtam, but we shall still find much precious meaning though
        the golden name be wanting. We have met with the title of this Psalm
        before, in Psalms 4, 6, 54, and 55, but with this difference, that in
        the present case the word is in the singular number: the Psalm itself is
        very personal, and well adapted for the private devotion of a single
        individual.
        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT AND DIVISION. This Psalm is a pearl. It is little, but
          precious. To many a mourner it has furnished utterance when the mind
          could not have devised a speech for itself. It was evidently composed
          by David after he had come to the throne—see verse 6. The second verse
          leads us to believe that it was written during the psalmist's enforced
          exile from the tabernacle, which was the visible abode of God: if so,
          the period of Absalom's rebellion has been most suitably suggested as
          the date of its authorship, and Delitzsch is correct in entitling it,
          "Prayer and thanksgiving of an expelled King on his way back to his
          throne."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We might divide the verses according to the sense, but it is
          preferable to follow the author's own arrangement, and make a break at
          each SELAH.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Hear my cry, O God.</p></b> He was in
        terrible earnest; he shouted, he lifted up his voice on high. He is not
        however content with the expression of his need: to give his sorrows
        vent is not enough for him, he wants actual audience of Heaven, and
        manifold support as the result.
        <p align="justify">
          Pharisees may rest in their prayers; true believers are eager for an
          answer to them. Ritualists may be satisfied when they have, "said or
          sung" their litanies, but living children of God will never rest until
          their supplications have entered the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Attend unto my prayer.</p></b>Give it your
        consideration, and such an answer as your wisdom sees fit. When it comes
        to <i>crying </i> with us, we need not doubt but that it will come to
        attending with God. Our heavenly Father is not hardened against the
        cries of his own children. What a consoling thought it is that the Lord
        at all times hears his people's cries, and is never forgetful of their
        prayers; whatever else fails to move him,<i>
          praying breath is never spent in vain! </i
        ><b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. From the end of the earth will I cry unto you.
          </p></b
        >
        He was banished from the spot which was the center of his delight, and
        at the same time his mind was in a depressed and melancholy condition;
        both actually and figuratively he was an outcast—yet he does not
        therefore restrain prayer, but rather finds therein a reason for the
        louder and more importunate cries.
        <p align="justify">
          To be absent from the place of divine worship was a sore sorrow to
          saints in the olden times; they looked upon the tabernacle as the
          center of the world, and they counted themselves to be at the fag end
          of the universe when they could no longer resort to the sacred shrine;
          their heart was heavy as in a strange land when they were banished
          from its solemnities.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet even they knew right well that
          <i>no place is unsuitable for prayer. </i>There may be an end of the
          earth, but there must not be an end to devotion. On creation's verge
          we may call upon God, for even there he is within call. No spot is too
          dreary, no condition is too deplorable; whether it be the world's end
          or life's end, prayer is equally available. To pray in some
          circumstances needs resolve, and the psalmist here expresses it,<b>
            I will cry. </b
          >It was a wise resolution, for had he ceased to pray he would have
          become the victim of despair; there is an end to a man when he makes
          an end to prayer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observe that David never dreamed of seeking any other God; he did not
          imagine the dominion of Jehovah to be local: he was at the end of the
          promised land, but he knew himself to be still in the territory of the
          Great King; to him only does he address his petitions.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">When my heart is overwhelmed.</p></b> When the
        huge waves of trouble wash over me, and I am completely submerged, not
        only as to my head, but also my heart. It is hard to pray when the very
        heart is drowning—yet gracious men plead best at such times.
        <i>Tribulation brings us to God, and brings God to us. </i>Faith's
        greatest triumphs are achieved in her heaviest trials.
        <p align="justify">
          It is all over with me, affliction is all over me; it encompasses me
          as a cloud, it swallows me up like a sea, it shuts me in with thick
          darkness—yet God is near, near enough to hear my voice, and I will
          call him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is not this brave talk? Mark how our psalmist tells the Lord, as if he
          knew he were hearing him, that he intended to call upon him. Our
          prayer by reason of our distress may be like to a call upon a far off
          friend, but our inmost faith has its quiet heart whispers to the Lord
          as to one who is assuredly our very present help.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</p></b
        >
        I see you to be my refuge, sure and strong; but alas! I am confused, and
        cannot find you; I am weak, and cannot climb you. You are so steadfast,
        guide me. You are so high, uplift me.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            There is a mint of meaning in this brief prayer.
          </p></i
        >
        Along the iron bound coast of our northern shores, lives are lost
        because the rocks are inaccessible to the shipwrecked mariner. A
        clergyman of one of the coast villages has with immense labor cut steps
        up from the beach to a large chamber, which he has excavated in the
        chalk cliffs; here many mariners have been saved; they have climbed the
        rock, which had else been too high for them, and they have escaped.
        <p align="justify">
          We have heard of late, however, that the steps have been worn away by
          the storms, and that poor sailors have perished miserably within sight
          of the refuge which they could not reach, for it was too high for
          them: it is therefore proposed to drive in iron stanchions, and to
          hang up chain ladders that shipwrecked mariners may reach the chambers
          in the rock.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The illustration is self-interpreting. Our experience leads us to
          understand this verse right well, for the time was with us when we
          were in such amazement of soul be reason of sin, that although we knew
          the Lord Jesus to be a sure salvation for sinners—yet we could not
          come at him, by reason of our many doubts and forebodings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A Savior would have been of no use to us if the Holy Spirit had not
          gently led us to him, and enabled us to rest upon him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To this day we often feel that we not only need a rock, but to be led
          to it. With this in view we treat very leniently the half unbelieving
          prayers of awakened souls; for in their bewildered state we cannot
          expect from them all at once a fully believing cry.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A seeking soul should at once believe in Jesus, but it is legitimate
          for a man to ask to be led to Jesus; the Holy Spirit is able to effect
          such a leading, and he can do it even though the heart be on the
          borders of despair.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How infinitely higher that we are, is the salvation of God. We are low
          and groveling, but it towers like some tall cliff far above us. This
          is its glory, and is our delight when we have once climbed into the
          rock, and claimed an interest in it; but while we are as yet trembling
          seekers, the glory and sublimity of salvation appal us, and we feel
          that we are too unworthy ever to be partakers of it; hence we are led
          to cry for grace upon grace, and to see how dependent we are for
          everything, not only for the Savior, but for the power to believe on
          him.

          <p align="justify">Verse 3. For you have been a shelter for me.</p></b

        <i>I</i> will, verses 3-6.
        <i> <p align="justify">Experience is the nurse of faith.</p></i> From
        the past we gather arguments for present confidence. Many and many a
        time had the persecutions of Saul and the perils of battle imperiled
        David's life, and only by miracle had he escaped—yet was he still alive
        and unhurt; this he remembers, and he is full of hope.
        <b> <p align="justify">And a strong tower from the enemy.</p></b> As in
        a fort impregnable, David had dwelt, because surrounded by omnipotence.
        Sweet is it beyond expression to remember the lovingkindnesses of the
        Lord in our former days, for he is unchangeable, and therefore will
        continue to guard us from all evil.

        by the word <i> tabernacle </i>is here meant the

          The best of all is that our residence with God is not for a limited
          period of time, but for ages; yes, for ages of ages, for time and for

        Often does our sweet singer use this figure; and far better is it to

        ransack creation for poor, strained metaphors.

        immutable God. <i> <p align="justify">Vows</p></i>may rightly be joined
        with prayers when they are lawful, well considered, and truly for God's
        glory. It is great mercy on God's part to take any notice of the vows
        and promises of such faithless and deceitful creatures as we are. What
        we promise him is his due already, and yet he deigns to accept our vows
        as if we were not so much his servants as his free suitors who could
        give or withhold at pleasure.

        David reigns on evermore.

          Thus he who began at the foot of the rock, half-drowned, and almost

        Though this is true of David in a modified sense, we prefer to view the
        Lord Jesus as here intended as the lineal descendant of David, and the
        representative of his royal race. Jesus is enthroned before God to
        eternity; here is our safety, dignity, and delight. We reign in him; in
        him we are made to sit together in the heavens.
        <p align="justify">
          David's personal claim to sit enthroned forever is but a foreshadowing
          of the revealed privilege of all true believers. O prepare mercy and
          truth, which may preserve him. As men cry, "Long live the king," so we
          hail with acclamation our enthroned Immanuel, and cry, "Let mercy and
          truth preserve him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Eternal love and immutable faithfulness are the bodyguards of Jesus'
          throne, and they are both the providers and the preservers of all
          those who in him are made kings and priests unto God. We cannot keep
          ourselves, and nothing short of divine mercy and truth can do it; but
          these both can and will, nor shall the least of the people of God be

        <p align="justify">
          David had given vocal utterance to his prayer by a cry; he will now

          The vow to celebrate the divine name forever is no hyperbolical piece

        from this heavenly vocation; we would make no pause in this sacred
        service. God daily performs his promises, let us daily perform our vows.
