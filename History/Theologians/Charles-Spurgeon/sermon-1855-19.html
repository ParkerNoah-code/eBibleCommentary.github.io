        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.20)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 22, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>"The carnal mind is enmity against God" -- Romans 8:7.</p>
        <p>
          This is a very solemn indictment which the Apostle Paul here prefers
          against the carnal mind. He declares it to be enmity against God. When
          we consider what man once was, only second to the angels, the
          companion of God, who walked with him in the garden of Eden in the
          cool of the day; when we think of him as being made in the very image
          of his Creator, pure, spotless, and unblemished, we cannot but feel
          bitterly grieved to find such an accusation as this preferred against
          us as a race. We may well hang our harps upon the willows, while we
          listen to the voice of Jehovah solemnly speaking to his rebellious
          creature. "How art thou fallen from heaven, thou son of the morning!"
          "Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou
          hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy
          covering -- the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was
          prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the
          anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon
          the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of
          the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that
          thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee, and thou hast
          sinned; therefore, I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of
          God; and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the
          stones of fire."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much to sadden us in a view of the ruins of our race. As the
          Carthaginian, who might tread the desolate site of his much-loved
          city, would shed many tears when he saw it laid in heaps by the
          Romans; or as the Jew, wandering through the deserted streets of
          Jerusalelm, would lament that the ploughshare had marred the beauty
          and the glory of that city which was the joy of the whole earth; so
          ought we to mourn for ourselves and our race, when we behold the ruins
          of that goodly structure which God had piled, that creature, matchless
          in symmetry, second only to angelic intellect, that mighty being, man
          -- when we behold how he is "fallen, fallen, fallen, from his high
          estate," and lies in a mass of destruction. A few years ago a star was
          seen blazing out with considerable brilliance, but soon disappeared;
          it has since been affirmed that it was a world on fire, thousands of
          millions of miles from us, and yet the rays of the conflagration
          reached us; the noiseless messenger of light gave to the distant
          dwellers on this globe the alarm of "A world on fire!" But what is the
          conflagration of a distant planet, what is the destruction of the mere
          material of the most ponderous orb, compared with this fall of
          humanity, this wreck of all that is holy and sacred in ourselves? To
          us, indeed, the things are scarcely comparable, since we are deeply
          interested in one, though not in the other. The fall of Adam was OUR
          fall; we fell in and with him; we were equal sufferers; it is the ruin
          of our own house that we lament, it is the destruction of our own city
          that we bemoan, when we stand and see written, in lines too plain for
          us to mistake their meaning, "The carnal mind" -- that very self-same
          mind which was once holiness, and has now become carnal -- "is enmity
          against God." May God help me, this morning, solemnly to prefer this
          indictment against all! Oh! that the Holy Spirit may so convince us of
          sin, that we may unanimously plead "guilty" before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no difficulty in understanding my text; it needs scarcely any
          explanation. We all know that the word "carnal" here signifies
          fleshly. The old translators rendered the passage thus; "The mind of
          the flesh is enmity against God" -- that is to say, the natural mind,
          that soul which we inherit from our fathers, that which was born
          within us when our bodies were fashioned by God. The fleshly mind, the
          phronema sarkos, the lusts, the passions of the soul; it is this which
          has gone astray from God, and become enmity against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, before we enter upon a discussion of the doctrine of the text,
          observe how strongly the Apostle expresses it. "The carnal mind," he
          says, "is ENMITY against God." He uses a noun, and not an adjective.
          He does not say it is opposed to God merely, but it is positive
          enmity. It is not black, but blackness; it is not at enmity, but
          enmity itself; it is not corrupt, but corruption; it is not
          rebellious, it is rebellion; it is not wicked, it is wickedness
          itself. The heart, though it be deceitful, is positively deceit; it is
          evil in the concrete, sin in the essence; it is the distillation, the
          quintessence of all things that are vile; it is not envious against
          God, it is envy; it is not at enmity, it is actual enmity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor need we say a word to explain that it is "enmity against God." It
          does not charge manhood with an aversion merely to the dominion, laws,
          or doctrines of Jehovah; but it strikes a deeper and surer blow. It
          does not strike man upon the head; it penetrates into his heart; it
          lays the axe at the root of the tree, and pronounces him "enmity
          against God," against the person of the Godhead, against the Deity,
          against the mighty Maker of this world; not at enmity against his
          Bible or against his gospel, though that were true, but against God
          himself, against his essence, his existence, and his person. Let us,
          then, weigh the words of the text, for they are solemn words. They are
          well put together by that master of eloquence, Paul, and they were
          moreover, dictated by the Holy Spirit, who telleth man how to speak
          aright. May he help us to expound, as he has already given us the
          passage to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall be called upon to notice, this morning, first, the
          truthfulness of this assertion; secondly, the universality of the evil
          here complained of; thirdly, we will still further enter into the
          depths of the subject, and press it to your hearts, by showing the
          enormity of the evil; and after that, should we have time, we will
          deduce one or two doctrines from the general fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we are called upon to speak of the truthfulness of this
          great statement. "The carnal mind is enmity against God." It needs no
          proof, for since it is written in God's word, we, as Christian men,
          are bound to bow before it. The words of the Scriptures are words of
          infinite wisdom, and if reason cannot see the ground of a statement of
          revelation, it is bound, most reverently, to believe it, since we are
          well assured, even should it be above our reason, that it cannot be
          contrary thereunto. Here I find it written in the Scriptures, "The
          carnal mind is enmity against God;" and that of itself is enough for
          me. But did I need witnesses, I would conjure up the nations of
          antiquity; I would unroll the volume of ancient history; I would tell
          you of the awful deeds of mankind. It may be I might move your souls
          to detestation, if I spake of the cruelty of this race to itself, if I
          showed you how it made the world an Aceldama, by its wars, and deluged
          it with blood by its fightings and murders; if I should recite the
          black list of vices in which whole nations have indulged, or even
          bring before you the characters of some of the most eminent
          philosophsers, I should blush to speak of them, and you would refuse
          to hear; yea, it would be impossible for you, as refined inhabitants
          of a civilized country, to endure the mention of the crimes that were
          committed by those very men who, now-a-days, are held up as being
          paragons of perfection. I fear, if all the truth were written, we
          should rise up from reading the lives of earth's mightiest heroes and
          proudest sages, and would say at once of all of them, "They are clean
          gone out of the way; they are altogether become unprofitable; there is
          none that doeth good, no, not one.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, did not that suffice, I would point you to the delusions of the
          heathen; I would tell you of their priestcraft, by which their souls
          have been enthralled in superstition; I would drag their gods before
          you; I would let you witness the horrid obscenities, the diabolical
          rites which are to these besotted men most sacred things. Then after
          you had heard what the natural religion of man is, I would ask what
          must his irreligion be? If this is his devotion, what must be his
          impiety? If this be his ardent love of the Godhead, what must his
          hatred thereof be? Ye would, I am sure, at once confess, did ye know
          what the race is, that the indictment is proven, and that the world
          must unreservedly and truthfully exclaim, "guilty."
        </p>
        <p>
          A further argument I might find in the fact, that the best of men have
          been always the readiest to confess their depravity. The holiest men,
          the most free from impurity, have always felt it most. He whose
          garments are the whitest, will best perceive the spots upon them. He
          whose crown shineth the brightest, will know when he hath lost a
          jewel. He who giveth the most light to the world, will always be able
          to discover his own darkness. The angels of heaven veil their faces;
          and the angels of God on earth, his chosen people, must always veil
          their faces with humility, when they think of what they were. Hear
          David: he was none of those who boast of a holy nature and a pure
          disposition. He says, "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin
          did my mother conceive me." Hear all those holy men who have written
          in the inspired volume, and ye shall find them all confessing that
          they were not clean, no not one; yea, one of them exclaimed, "O
          wretched man that I am; who shall deliver me from the body of this
          death?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And more, I will summon one other witness to the truthfulness of this
          fact, who shall decide the question; it shall be your conscience.
          Conscience, I will put thee in the witness-box, and cross-examine thee
          this morning! Conscience, truly answer! Be not drugged with the
          laudanum of self-security! Speak the truth! Didst thou never hear the
          heart say, "I wish there were no God?" Have not all men, at times,
          wished that our religion were not true? Though they could not entirely
          rid their souls of the idea of the Godhead, did they not wish that
          there might not be a God? Have they not had the desire that it might
          turn out that all these divine realities were a delusion, a farce, and
          an imposture? "Yea," saith every man; "that has crossed my mind
          sometimes. I have wished I might indulge in folly; I have wished there
          were no laws to restrain me; I have wished, as the fool, that there
          were no God." That passage in the Psalms, "The fool hath said in his
          heart, there is no God," is wrongly translated. It should be, "The
          fool hath said in his heart, no God." The fool does not say in his
          heart there is no God, for he knows there is a God; but he says, "No
          God -- I don't want any; I wish there were none." And who amongst us
          has not been so foolish as to desire that there were no God? Now,
          conscience, answer another question! Thou hast confessed that thou
          hast at times wished there were no God; now, suppose a man wished
          another dead, would not that show that he hated him? Yes, it would.
          And so, my friends, the wish that there were no God, proves that we
          dislike God. When I wish such a man dead and rotting in his grave;
          when I desire that he were non est, I must hate that man; otherwise I
          should not wish him to be extinct. So that wish -- and I do not think
          there has been a man in this world who has not had it -- proves that
          "the carnal mind is enmity against God."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, conscience, I have another question! Has not thine heart ever
          desired, since there is a God, that he were a little less holy, a
          little less pure, so that those things which are now great crimes
          might be regarded as venial offences, as peccadillos? Has thy heart
          never said, "Would to God these sins were not forbidden! Would that he
          would be merciful and pass them by without an atonement! Would that he
          were not so severe, so rigorously just, so sternly strict to his
          integrity." Hast thou never said that, my heart? Conscience must
          reply, "Thou hast." Well, that wish to change God, proves that thou
          art not in love with the God that now is, the God of heaven and earth;
          and though thou mayest talk of natural religion, and boast that thou
          dost reverence the God of the green fields, the grassy meads, the
          swelling flood, the rolling thunder, the azure sky, the starry night,
          and the great universe -- though thou lovest the poetic beau ideal of
          Deity, it is not the God of Scripture, for thou hast wished to change
          his nature, and in that hast thou proved that thou art at enmity with
          him. But wherefore, conscience, should I go thus round about? Thou
          canst bear faithful witness, if thou wouldst speak the truth, that
          each person here has so transgressed against God, so continually
          broken his laws, violated his Sabbath, trampled on his statutes,
          despised his gospel, that it is true, aye, most true, that "the carnal
          mind is enmity against God."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now Secondly, we are called upon to notice the universality of
          this evil. What a broad assertion it is. It is not a single carnal
          mind, or a certain class of characters, but "the carnal mind." It is
          an unqualified statement, including every individual. Whatever mind
          may properly be called carnal, not having been spiritualized by the
          power of God's Holy Ghost, is "enmity against God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe then, first of all, the universality of this as to all
          persons. Every carnal mind in the world is at enmity against God. This
          does not exclude even infants at the mothers' breast. We call them
          innocent, and so they are of actual transgression, but as the poet
          says, "Within the youngest breast there lies a stone." There is in the
          carnal mind of an infant, enmity against God; it is not developed, but
          it lieth there. Some say that children learn sin by imitation. But no;
          take a child away, place it under the most pious influences, let the
          very air it breathes be purified by piety; let it constantly drink in
          draughts of holiness; let it hear nothing but the voice of prayer and
          praise; let its ear be always kept in tune by notes of sacred song;
          and that child, notwithstanding, may still become one of the grossest
          of transgressors; and though placed apparently on the very road to
          heaven, it shall, if not directed by divine grace, march downwards to
          the pit. Oh! how true it is that some who have had the best of
          parents, have been the worst of sons; that many who have been trained
          up under the most holy auspices, in the midst of the most favorable
          scenes for piety, have nevertheless, become loose and wanton! So it is
          not by imitation, but it is by nature, that the child is evil. Grant
          me that the child is carnal, and my text says, "the carnal mind is
          enmity against God." The young crocodile, I have heard, when broken
          from the shell, will in a moment begin to put itself in a posture of
          attack, opening its mouth as if it had been taught and trained. We
          know that young lions, when tamed and domesticated, still will have
          the wild nature of their fellows of the forest, and were liberty given
          them, would prey as fiercely as others. So with the child; you may
          bind him with the green withes of education, you may do what you will
          with him, since you cannot change his heart, that carnal mind shall
          still be at enmity against God; and notwithstanding intellect, talent,
          and all you may give to boot, it shall be of the same sinful
          complexion as every other child, if not as apparently evil; for "the
          carnal mind is enmity against God."
        </p>
        <p>
          And if this applies to children, equally does it include every class
          of men. There be some men that are born into this world
          master-spirits, who walk about it as giants, wrapped in mantles of
          light and glory. I refer to the poets, men who stand aloft like
          Colossi, mightier than we, seeming to be descended from celestial
          spheres. There be others of acute intellect, who, searching into
          mysteries of science, discover things that have been hidden from the
          creation of the world; men of keen research, and mighty erudition; and
          yet of each of these -- poet, philosopher, metaphysician, and great
          discoverer -- it shall be said, "The carnal mind is enmity against
          God." Ye may train him up, ye may make his intellect almost angelic,
          ye may strengthen his soul until he shall take what are riddles to us,
          and unravel them with his fingers in a moment; ye may make him so
          mighty, that he can grasp the iron secrets of the eternal hills and
          grind them to atoms in his fist; ye may give him an eye so keen, that
          he can penetrate the arcana of rocks and mountains; ye may add a soul
          so potent, that he may slay the giant Sphinx, that had for ages
          troubled the mightiest men of learning; yet, when ye have done all,
          his mind shall be a depraved one, and his carnal heart shall still be
          in opposition to God. Yea, more, ye shall bring him to the house of
          prayer; ye shall make him sit constantly under the clearest preaching
          of the word, where he shall hear the doctrines of grace in all their
          purity, attended by a holy unction; but if that holy unction does not
          rest upon him, all shall be vain; he shall still come most regularly,
          but, like the pious door of the chapel, that turneth in and out, he
          shall still be the same; having an outside superficial religion, and
          his carnal mind shall still be at enmity against God. Now, this is not
          my assertion, it is the declaration of God's word, and you must leave
          it if you do not believe it; but quarrel not with me, it is my
          Master's message; and it is true of every one of you -- men, women,
          and children, and myself too -- that if we have not been regenerated
          and converted, if we have not experienced a change of heart, our
          carnal mind is still at enmity against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, notice the universality of this at all times. The carnal mind
          is at all times enmity against God. "Oh," say some, "it may be true
          that we are at times opposed to God, but surely we are not always so."
          "There be moments," says one, "when I feel rebellious; at times my
          passions lead me astray; but surely there are other favorable seasons
          when I really am friendly to God, and offer true devotion. I have
          (continues the objector), stood upon the mountain-top, until my whole
          soul has kindled with the scene below, and my lips have uttered the
          song of praise, --
        </p>
        <p>"These are thy glorious works, parent of good,</p>
        <p>Almighty, thine this universal frame,</p>
        <p>Thus wondrous fair; thyself how wondrous then!"</p>
        <p>
          Yes, but mark, what is true one day is not false another; "the carnal
          mind is enmity against God" at all times. The wolf may sleep, but it
          is a wolf still. The snake with its azure hues, may slumber amid the
          flowers, and the child may stroke its slimy back, but it is a serpent
          still; it does not change its nature, though it is dormant. The sea is
          the house of storms, even when it is glassy as a lake; the thunder is
          still the mighty rolling thunder, when it is so much aloft that we
          hear it not. And the heart, when we perceive not its ebullitions, when
          it belches not forth its lava, and sendeth not forth the hot stones of
          its corruption, is still the same dread volcano. At all times, at all
          hours, at every moment, (I speak this as God speaketh it), if ye are
          carnal, ye are each one of you enmity against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thought concerning the universality of this statement. The
          whole of the mind is enmity against God. The text says, "The carnal
          mind is enmity against God." That is, the entire man, every part of
          him -- every power, every passion. It is a question often asked, "What
          part of man was injured by the fall?" Some think that the fall was
          only felt by the affections, and that the intellect was unimpaired;
          this they argue from the wisdom of man, and the mighty discoveries he
          has made, such as the law of gravitation, the steam-engine, and the
          sciences. Now, I consider these things as being a very mean display of
          wisdom, compared with what is to come in a hundred years, and very
          small compared with what might have been, if man's intellect had
          continued in its pristine condition. I believe that the fall crushed
          man entirely, albeit, when it rolled like an avalanche upon the mighty
          temple of human nature, some shafts were still left undestroyed, and
          amidst the ruins you find here and there, a flute, a pedestal, a
          cornice, a column, not quite broken, yet the entire structure fell,
          and its most glorious relics are fallen ones, levelled in the dust.
          The whole of man is defaced. Look at our memory; is it not true that
          the memory is fallen? I can recollect evil things far better than
          those which savor of piety. I hear a ribald song; that music of hell
          shall jar in my ear when gray hairs shall be upon my head. I hear a
          note of holy praise; alas! it is forgotten! For memory graspeth with
          an iron hand ill things, but the good she holdeth with feeble fingers.
          She suffereth the glorious timbers from the forest of Lebanon to swim
          down the stream of oblivion, but she stoppeth all the draff that
          floateth from the foul city of Sodom. She will retain evil, she will
          lose good. Memory is fallen. So are the affections. We love everything
          earthly better than we ought; we soon fix our heart upon a creature,
          but very seldom on the Creator; and when the heart is given to Jesus,
          it is prone to wander. Look at the imagination, too. Oh! how can the
          imagination revel, when the body is in an ill condition? Only give man
          something that shall well nigh intoxicate him; drug him with opium;
          and how will his imagination dance with joy! Like a bird uncaged, how
          will it mount with more than eagles' wings! He sees things he had not
          dreamed of even in the shades of night. Why did not his imagination
          work when his body was in a normal state -- when it was healthy?
          Simply because it is depraved; and until he had entered a foul element
          -- until the body had begun to quiver with a kind of intoxication --
          the fancy would not hold its carnival. We have some splendid specimens
          of what men could write, when they have been under the accursed
          influence of ardent spirits. It is because the mind is so depraved
          that it loves something which puts the body into an abnormal
          condition; and here we have a proof that the imagination itself has
          gone astray. So with the judgement -- I might prove how ill it
          decides. So might I accuse the conscience, and tell you how blind it
          is, and how it winks at the greatest follies. I might review all our
          powers, and write upon the brow of each one, "Traitor against heaven!
          traitor against God!" The whole "carnal mind is enmity against God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my hearers, "the Bible alone is the religion of Protestants;" but
          whenever I find a certain book much held in reverence by our
          Episcopalian brethren, entirely on my side, I always feel the greatest
          delight in quoting from it. Do you know I am one of the best churchmen
          in the world; the very best, if you will judge me by the articles, and
          the very worst, if you measure me in any other way. Measure me by the
          articles of the Church of England, and I will not stand second to any
          man under heaven's blue sky in preaching the gospel contained in them;
          for if there be an excellent epitome of the gospel, it is to be found
          in the articles of the Church of England. Let me show you that you
          have not been hearing strange doctrine. Here is the 9th article, upon
          Original or Birth Sin: "Original Sin standeth not in the following of
          Adam; (as the Pelagians do vainly talk); but it is the fault and
          corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of
          the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original
          righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the
          flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and, therefore, in every
          person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation.
          And this infection of nature doth remain, yea, in them that are
          regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek,
          phronema sarkos, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality,
          some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to
          the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that
          believe and are baptized, yet the apostle doth confess, that
          concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin." I want
          nothing more. Will any one who believes in the Prayer Book dissent
          from the doctrine that "the carnal mind is enmity against God?"
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I have said that I would endeavor, in the third place, to show
          the great enormity of this guilt. I do fear, my brethren, that very
          often when we consider our state, we think not so much of the guilt as
          of the misery. I have sometimes read sermons upon the inclination of
          the sinner to evil, in which it has been very powerfully proved, and
          certainly the pride of human nature has been well humbled and brought
          low; but one thing always strikes me, if it is left out, as being a
          very great omission; viz. -- the doctrine that man is guilty in all
          these things. If his heart is against God, we ought to tell him it is
          his sin; and if he cannot repent, we ought to show him that sin is the
          sole cause of his disability -- that all his alienation from God is
          sin -- that as long as he keeps from God it is sin. I fear many of us
          here must acknowledge that we do not charge the sin of it to our own
          consciences. Yes, say we, we have many corruptions. Oh! yes. But we
          sit down very contented. My brethren, we ought not to do so. The
          having those corruptions is our crime which should be confessed as an
          enormous evil; and if I, as a minister of the gospel, do not press
          home the sin of the thing, I have missed what is the very virus of it.
          I have left out the very essence, if I have not shown that it is a
          crime. Now, "The carnal mind is enmity against God." What a sin it is!
          This will appear in two ways. Consider the relation in which we stand
          to God, and then remember what God is; and after I have spoken of
          these two things, I hope you will see, indeed, that it is a sin to be
          at enmity with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is God to us? He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth; he
          bears up the pillars of the universe; his breath perfumes the flowers;
          his pencil paints them; he is the author of this fair creation; "we
          are the sheep of his pasture; he hath made us, and not we ourselves."
          He stands to us in the relationship of a Maker and Creator; and from
          that fact he claims to be our King. He is our legislator, our
          law-maker; and then, to make our crime still worse and worse, he is
          the ruler of providence; for it is he who keeps up from day to day. He
          supplys our wants; he keeps the breath within our nostrils; he bids
          the blood still pursue its course through the veins; he holdeth us in
          life, and preventeth us from death; he standeth before us, our
          creator, our king, our sustainer, our benefactor, and I ask, is it not
          a sin of enormous magnitude -- is it not high treason against the
          emperor of heaven -- is it not an awful sin, the depth of which we
          cannot fathom with the line of all our judgment -- that we, his
          creatures, dependent upon him, should be at enmity with God?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the crime may seem to be worse when we think of what God is. Let
          me appeal personally to you in an interrogatory style, for this has
          weight with it. Sinner! why art thou at enmity with God? God is the
          God of love; he is kind to his creatures; he regards you with his love
          of benevolence; for this very day his sun hath shone upon you, this
          day you have had food and raiment, and you have come up here in health
          and strength. Do you hate God because he loves you? Is that the
          reason? Consider how many mercies you have received at his hands all
          your life long! You are born with a body not deformed; you have had a
          tolerable share of health; you have been recovered many times from
          sickness; when lying at the gates of death, his arm has held back your
          soul from the last step to destruction. Do you hate God for all this?
          Do you hate him because he spared your life by his tender mercy?
          Behold his goodness that he hath spread before you! He might have sent
          you to hell; but you are here. Now, do you hate God for sparing you?
          Oh, wherefore art thou at enmity with him? My fellow creature, dost
          thou not know that God sent his Son from his bosom, hung him on the
          tree, and there suffered him to die for sinners, the just for the
          unjust? And dost thou hate God for that? Oh, sinner! is this the cause
          of thine enmity? Art thou so estranged that thou givest enmity for
          love? And when he surroundeth thee with favors, girdeth thee with
          mercies, encircleth thee with loving kindness, dost thou hate him for
          this? He might say, as Jesus did to the Jews, "For which of these
          works do ye stone me?" For which of these works do ye hate God? Did an
          earthly benefactor feed you, would you hate him? Did he clothe you,
          would you abuse him to his face? Did he give you talents, would you
          turn those powers against him? Oh, speak! Would you forge the iron and
          strike the dagger into the heart of your best friend? Do you hate your
          mother, who nursed you on her knee? Do you curse your father, who so
          wisely watched over you? Nay, ye say, we have some little gratitude
          towards earthly relatives. Where are your hearts, then? Where are your
          hearts, that ye can still despise God, and be at enmity with him? Oh!
          diabolical crime! Oh! satanic enormity! Oh! iniquity for which words
          fail in description! To hate the all-lovely -- to despise the
          essentially good -- to abhor the constantly merciful -- to spurn the
          ever beneficent -- to scorn the kind, the gracious one; above all, to
          hate the God who sent his son to die for man! Ah! in that thought --
          "The carnal mind is enmity with God;" there is something which may
          make us shake; for it is a terrible sin to be at enmity with God. I
          would I could speak more powerfully, but my Master alone can impress
          upon you the enormous evil of this horrid state of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But there are one or two doctrines which we will try to deduce
          from this. Is the carnal mind at enmity against God? Then salvation
          cannot be by merit; it must be by grace. If we are at enmity with God,
          what merit can we have? How can we deserve anything from the being we
          hate? Even if we were pure as Adam, we could not have any merit; for I
          do not think Adam had any desert before his Creator. When he had kept
          all his Master's law he was but an unprofitable servant; he had done
          no more than he ought to have done; he had no surplus, no balance. But
          since we have become enemies, how much less can we hope to be saved by
          works! Oh! no; but the whole Bible tells us, from beginning to end,
          that salvation is not by the works of the law, but by the deeds of
          grace. Martin Luther declared that he constantly preached
          justification by faith alone, "because," said he, "the people would
          forget it; so that I was obliged almost to knock my Bible against
          their heads, to send it into their hearts." So it is true; we
          constantly forget that salvation is by grace alone. We always want to
          be putting in some little scrap of our own virtue; we want to be doing
          something. I remember a saying of old Matthew Wilkes: "Saved by your
          works! you might as well try to go to America in a paper boat!" Saved
          by your works! It is impossible! Oh! no, the poor legalist is like a
          blind horse going round and round the mill, or like the prisoner going
          up the treadwheel, and finding himself no higher after all he has
          done; he has no solid confidence, no firm ground to rest upon. He has
          not done enough -- "never enough;" conscience always says, "this is
          not perfection; it ought to have been better," Salvation for enemies
          must be by an ambassador, -- by an atonement, -- yea, by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another doctrine we gather from this is, the necessity of an entire
          change of our nature. It is true, that by birth we are at enmity with
          God. How necessary then it is that our nature should be changed! There
          are few people who sincerely believe this. They think that if they
          cry, "Lord, have mercy upon me," when they lay a-dying, they shall go
          to heaven directly. Let me suppose an impossible case for a moment.
          Let me imagine a man entering heaven without a change of heart. He
          comes within the gates. He hears a sonnet. He starts! It is to the
          praise of his enemy. He sees a throne, and on it sits one who is
          glorious; but it is his enemy. He walks streets of gold, but those
          streets belong to his enemy. He sees hosts of angels; but those hosts
          are the servants of his enemy. He is in an enemy's house; for he is at
          enmity with God. He could not join the song, for he would not know the
          tune. There he would stand, silent, motionless; till Christ would say,
          with a voice louder than ten thousand thunders, "What dost thou here?
          Enemies at a marriage banquet? Enemies in the children's house?
          Enemies in heaven? Get thee gone? Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting
          fire in hell!'" Oh! sirs, if the unregenerate man could enter heaven,
          I mention once more the oft-repeated saying of Whitefield, he would be
          so unhappy in heaven, that he would ask God to let him run down to
          hell for shelter. There must be a change, if ye consider the future
          state; for how can enemies to God ever sit down at the banquet of the
          Lamb?
        </p>
        <p>
          And to conclude, let me remind you -- and it is in the text after all
          -- that this change must be worked by a power beyond your own. An
          enemy may possibly make himself a friend; but enmity cannot. If it be
          but an adjunct of his nature to be an enemy, he may change himself
          into a friend; but if it is the very essence of his existence to be
          enmity, positive enmity, enmity cannot change itself. No, there must
          be something done more than we can accomplish. This is just what is
          forgotten in these days. We must have more preaching of the Holy
          Spirit, if we are to have more conversion work. I tell you, sirs, if
          you change yourselves, and make yourselves better, and better, and
          better, a thousand times, you will never be good enough for heaven,
          till God's Spirit has laid his hand upon you; till he has renewed the
          heart, till he has purified the soul, till he has changed the entire
          spirit and new-made the man, there can be no entering heaven. How
          seriously, then, should each stand and think. Here am I, a creature of
          a day, a mortal born to die, but yet an immortal! At present I am at
          enmity with God. What shall I do? Is it not my duty, as well as my
          happiness, to ask whether there be a way to be reconciled to God?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! weary slaves of sin, are not your ways the paths of folly? Is it
          wisdom, O my fellow-creatures, is it wisdom to hate your Creator? Is
          it wisdom to stand in opposition against him? Is it prudent to despise
          the riches of his grace? If it be wisdom, it is hell's wisdom; if it
          be wisdom, it is a wisdom which is folly with God. Oh! may God grant
          that you may turn unto Jesus with full purpose of heart! He is the
          ambassador; he it is who can make peace through his blood; and though
          you came in here an enemy, it is possible you may go out through that
          door a friend yet, if you can but look to Jesus Christ, the brazen
          serpent which was lifted up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, it may be, some of you are convinced of sin, by the Holy
          Spirit. I will now proclaim to you the way of salvation. "As Moses
          lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man
          be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
          have eternal life." Behold, O trembling penitent, the means of thy
          deliverance. Turn thy tearful eye to yonder Mount of Calvary! See the
          victim of justice -- the sacrifice of atonement for your
          transgression. View the Saviour in his agonies, with streams of blood
          purchasing thy soul, and with intensest agonies enduring thy
          punishment. He died for thee, if now thou dost confess thy guilt. O
          come, thou condemned one, self-condemned, and turn thine eye this way,
          for one look will save. Sinner! thou art bitten. Look! It is naught
          but "Look!" It is simply "Look!" If thou canst but look to Jesus, thou
          art safe. Hear the voice of the Redeemer: "look unto me, and be ye
          saved." Look! Look! Look! O guilty souls.
        </p>
        <p>"Venture on him, venture wholly,</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude;</p>
        <p>None but Jesus, kind and loving,</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good."</p>
        <p>
          May my blessed Master help you to come to him, and draw you to his
          Son, for Jesu's sake. Amen and Amen.<br />
