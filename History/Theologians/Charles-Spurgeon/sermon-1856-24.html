        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.78)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Thursday Evening, November 22, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." -- John
          17:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          CHRIST'S prayer was for a special people. He declared that he did not
          offer an universal intercession. "I pray for them," said he. "I pray
          not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are
          thine." In reading this beautiful prayer through, only one question
          arises to our minds; Who are the people that are described as "them,"
          or as "they?" Who are these favoured individuals, who share a
          Saviour's prayers, are recognized by a Saviour's love, have their
          names written on the stones of his precious breastplate, and have
          their characters and their circumstances mentioned by the lips of the
          High Priest before the throne on high? The answer to that question is
          supplied by the words of our text. The people for whom Christ prays
          are an unearthly people. They are a people somewhat, above the world,
          distinguished altogether from it. "They are not of the world, even as
          I am not of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall treat my text, first of all, doctrinally; secondly,
          experimentally; and thirdly, practically.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, we shall take our text and look at it DOCTRINALLY.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of it is, that God's people are people who are not of the
          world, even as Christ was not of the world. It is not so much that
          they are not of the world, as that they are "not of the world, even as
          Christ was not of the world." This is an important distinction, for
          there are to be found certain people who are not of the world, and yet
          they are not Christians. Amongst these I would mention sentimentalists
          -- people who are always crying and groaning in affected sentimental
          ways. Their spirits are so refined, their characters are so delicate,
          that they could not attend to ordinary business. They would think it
          rather degrading to their spiritual nature to attend to anything
          connected with the world. They live much in the air of romances and
          novels; love to read things that fetch tears from their eyes; they
          would like continually to live in a cottage near a wood, or to inhabit
          some quiet cave, where they could read "Zimmerman on Solitude" for
          ever; for they feel that they are "not of the world." The fact is,
          there is something too flimsy about them to stand the wear and tear of
          this wicked world. They are so pre-eminently good, that they cannot
          bear to do as we poor human creatures do. I have heard of one young
          lady, who thought herself so spiritually-minded that she could not
          work. A very wise minister said to her, "That is quite correct! you
          are so spiritually-minded that you cannot work; very well, you are so
          spiritually-minded that you shall not eat unless you do." That brought
          her back from her great spiritual-mindedness. There is a stupid
          sentimentalism that certain persons nurse themselves into. They read a
          parcel of books that intoxicate their brains, and then fancy that they
          have a lofty destiny. These people are "not of the world," truly; but
          the world does not want them, and the world would not miss them much,
          if they were clean gone for ever. There is such a thing as being "not
          of the world," from a high order of sentimentalism, and yet not being
          a Christian after all. For it is not so much being "not of the world,"
          as being "not of the world, even as Christ was not of the world."
          There are others, too, like your monks, and those other made
          individuals of the Catholic church, who are not of the world. They are
          so awfully good, that they could not live with us sinful creatures at
          all. They must be distinguished from us altogether. They must not
          wear, of course, a boot that would at all approach to a worldly shoe,
          but they must have a sole of leather strapped on with two or three
          thongs, like the far-famed Father Ignatius. They could not be expected
          to wear worldly coats and waistcoats; but they must have peculiar
          garbs, cut in certain fashions, like the Passionists. They must wear
          particular dresses, particular garments, particular habits. And we
          know that some men are "not of the world," by the peculiar mouthing
          they give to all their words -- the sort of sweet, savoury, buttery
          flavor they give to the English language, because they think
          themselves so eminently sanctified that they fancy it would be wrong
          to indulge in anything in which ordinary mortals indulge. Such persons
          are, however, reminded, that their being "not of the world," has
          nothing to do with it. It is not being "not of the world," so much as
          being "not of the world, even as Christ was not of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the distinguishing mark -- being different from the world in
          those respects in which Christ was different. Not making ourselves
          singular in unimportant points, as those poor creatures do, but being
          different from the world in those respects in which the Son of God and
          the Son of man, Jesus Christ, was not of the world in nature; that he
          was not of the world again, in office; and above all, that he was not
          of the world in his character.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, Christ was not of the world in nature. What was there about
          Christ that was worldly? In one point of view his nature was divine;
          and as divine, it was perfect, pure unsullied, spotless, he could not
          descend to things of earthliness and sin; in another sense he was
          human; and his human nature, which was born of the Virgin Mary, was
          begotten of the Holy Ghost, and therefore was so pure that in it
          rested nothing that was worldly. He was not like ordinary men. We are
          all born with worldliness in our hearts. Solomon well says,
          "Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child." It is not only
          there, but it is bound up in it; it is tied up in his heart, and is
          difficult to remove. And so with each of us; when we were children,
          earthliness and carnality were bound up in our nature. But Christ was
          not so. His nature was not a worldly one; it was essentially different
          from that of every one else, although he sat down and talked with
          them. Mark the difference! He stood side by side with a Pharisee; but
          every one could see he was not of the Pharisee's world. He sat by a
          Samaritan woman, and though he conversed with her very freely, who is
          it that fails to see that he was not of that Samaritan woman's world
          -- not a sinner like her? He mingled with the Publicans, nay, he sat
          down at the Publican's feast, and eat with Publicans and sinners; but
          you could see by the holy actions and the peculiar gestures he there
          carried with him, that he was not of the Publicans' world, though he
          mixed with them. There was something so different in his nature, that
          you could not have found an individual in all the world whom could
          have set beside him and said, "There! he is of that man's world," Nay,
          not even John, though he leaned on his bosom and partook very much of
          his Lord's spirit, was exactly of that world to which Jesus belonged;
          for even he once in his Boanergean spirit, said words to this effect,
          "Let us call down fire from heaven on the heads of those who oppose
          thee," -- a thing that Christ could not endure for a moment, and
          thereby proved that he was something even beyond John's world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, beloved, in some sense, the Christian man is not of the world
          even in his nature. I do not mean in his corrupt and fallen nature,
          but in his new nature. There is something in a Christian that is
          utterly and entirely distinct from that of anybody else. Many persons
          think that the difference between a Christian and worldling consists
          in this: one goes to chapel twice on a Sabbath-day, another does not
          go but once, or perhaps not at all; one of them takes the sacrament,
          the other does not; one pays attention to holy things, the other pays
          very little attention to them. But, ah, beloved, that does not make a
          Christian. The distinction between a Christian and a worldling is not
          merely external, but internal. The difference is one of nature, and
          not of act.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christian is as essentially difference from a worldling as a dove is
          from a raven, or a lamb from a lion. He is not of the world even in
          his nature. You could not make him a worldling. You might do what you
          liked; you might cause him to fall into some temporary sin; but you
          could not make him a worldling. You might cause him to backslide; but
          you could not make him a sinner, as he used to be. He is not of the
          world by his nature. He is a twice-born man; in his veins run the
          blood of the royal family of the universe. He is a nobleman; he is a
          heaven-born child. His freedom is not merely a bought one, but he hath
          his liberty his new-born nature; he is essentially and entirely
          different from the world. There are persons in this chapel now who are
          more totally distinct from one another than you can even conceive. I
          have some here who are intelligent, and some who are ignorant; some
          who are rich, and some who are poor; but I do not allude to those
          distinctions: they all melt away into nothing in that great
          distinction -- dead or alive, spiritual or carnal, Christian or
          worldling. And oh! if ye are God's people, then ye are not of the
          world in your nature; for ye are "not of the world, even as Christ was
          not of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again: you are not of the world in your office. Christ's office had
          nothing to do with worldly things. "Art thou a king them?" Yes; I am a
          king; but my kingdom is not of this world. "Art thou a priest?" Yes; I
          am a priest; but my priesthood is not the priesthood which I shall
          soon lay aside, or which shall be discontinued as that of others has
          been. "Art thou a teacher?" Yes; but my doctrines are not the
          doctrines of morality, doctrines that concern earthly dealings between
          man and man simply; my doctrine cometh down from heaven. So Jesus
          Christ, we say, is "not of the world." He had no office that could be
          termed a worldly one, and he had no aim which was in the least
          worldly. He did not seek his own applause, his own fame, his own
          honour; his very office was not of the world. And, O believer! what is
          thy office? Hast thou none at all? Why, yes, man! Thou art a priest
          unto the Lord thy God; thy office is to offer a sacrifice of prayer
          and praise each day. Ask a Christian what he is. Say to him: "What is
          your official standing? What are you by office?" Well, if he answers
          you properly, he will not say, "I am a draper, or druggist," or
          anything of that sort. No; he will say, "I am a priest unto my God.
          The office unto which I am called, is to be the salt of the earth. I
          am a city set on a hill, a light that cannot be hid. That is my
          office. My office is not a worldly one." Whether yours be the office
          of the minister, or the deacon, or the church member, ye are not of
          this world is your office, even as Christ was not of the world; your
          occupation is not a worldly one.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, ye are not of the world in your character; for that is the
          chief point in which Christ was not of the world. And now, brethren, I
          shall have to turn somewhat from doctrine to practice before I get
          rightly to this part of the subject; for I must reprove many of the
          Lord's people, that they do not sufficiently manifest that they are
          not of the world in character, even as Christ was not of the world.
          Oh! how many of you there are, who will assemble around the table at
          the supper of your Lord, who do not live like your Saviour. How many
          of you there are, who join our church and walk with us, and yet are
          not worthy of your high calling and profession. Mark you the churches
          all around, and let your eyes run with tears, when you remember that
          of many of their members it cannot be said, "ye are not of this
          world," for they are of the world. O, my hearers, I fear many of you
          are worldly, carnal, and covetous; and yet ye join the churches, and
          stand well with God's people by a hypocritical profession. O ye
          whitewashed sepulchres! ye would deceive even the very elect! ye make
          clean the outside of the cup and platter, but your inward part is very
          wickedness. O that a thundering voice might speak this to your ears!
          -- "Those whom Christ loves are not of the world," but ye are of the
          world; therefore ye cannot be his, even though ye profess so to be;
          for those that love him are not such as you. Look at Jesus character;
          how different from every other man's -- pure, perfect, spotless, even
          such should be the life of the believer. I plead not for the
          possibility of sinless conduct in Christians, but I must hold that
          grace makes men to differ, and that God's people will be very
          different from other kinds of people. A servant of God will be a
          God's-man everywhere. As a chemist, he could not indulge in any tricks
          that such men might play with their drugs; as a grocer -- if indeed it
          be not a phantom that such things are done -- he could not mix sloe
          leaves with tea or red lead in the pepper; if he practised any other
          kind of business, he could not for a moment condescend to the little
          petty shifts, called "methods of business." To him it is nothing what
          is called "business;" it is what is called God's law, he feels that he
          is not of the world, consequently, he goes against its fashions and
          its maxims. A singular story is told of a certain Quaker. One day he
          was bathing in the Thames, and a waterman called out to him, "Ha!
          there goes the Quaker." "How do you know I'm a Quaker?" "Because you
          swim against the stream; it is the way the Quakers always do." That is
          the way Christians always ought to do -- to swim against the stream.
          The Lord's people should not go along with the rest in their
          worldliness. Their characters should be visibly different. You should
          be such men that your fellows can recognise you without any
          difficulty, and say, "Such a man is a Christian." Ah! beloved, it
          would puzzle the angel Gabriel himself, to tell whether some of you
          are Christians or not, if he were sent down to the world to pick out
          the righteous from the wicked. None but God could do it, for in these
          days of worldly religion they are so much alike. It was an ill day for
          the world, when the sons of God and the daughters of men were mingled
          together: and it is an ill day now, when Christians and worldlings are
          so mixed, that you cannot tell the difference between them. God save
          us from a day of fire that may devour us in consequence! But O
          beloved! the Christian will be always different from the world. This
          is a great doctrine, and it will be found as true in ages to come as
          in the centuries which are past. Looking back into history, we read
          this lesson: "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the
          world." We see them driven to the catacombs of Rome; we see them
          hunted about like partridges; and wherever in history you find God's
          servants, you can recognise them by their distinct, unvarying
          character -- they are not of the world, but were a people scarred and
          peeled; a people entirely distinct from the nations. And if in this
          age, there are no different people, if there are none to be found who
          differ from other people, there are no Christians; for Christians will
          be always different from the world. They are not of the world; even as
          Christ is not of the world. This is the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>II. But now for treating this text EXPERIMENTALLY.</p>
        <p>
          Do we, dearly beloved, feel this truth? Has it ever been laid to our
          souls, so that we can feel it is ours? "They are not of the world,
          even as I am not of the world." Have we ever felt that we are not of
          the world? Perhaps there is a believer sitting in a pew to-night, who
          says, "Well, sire, I can't say that I feel as if I was not of the
          world, for I have just come from my shop, and worldliness is still
          hanging about me." Another says, "I have been in trouble and my mind
          is very much harassed -- I can't feel that I am different from the
          world; I am afraid that I am of the world." But, beloved, we must not
          judge ourselves rashly, because just at this moment we discern not the
          spot of God's children. Let me tell you, there are always certain
          testing moments when you can tell of what kind of stuff a man is made.
          Two men are walking. Part of the way their road lies side by side. How
          do you tell which man is going to the right, and which to the left?
          Why, when they come to the turning point. Now, to-night is not a
          turning point, for you are sitting with worldly people here, but at
          other times we may distinguish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me tell you one or two turning points, when every Christian will
          feel that he is not of the world. One is, when he gets into very deep
          trouble. I do believe and protest, that we never feel so unearthly as
          when we get plunged down into trouble. Ah! when some creature comfort
          hath been swept away, when some precious blessing hath withered in our
          sight, like the fair lily, snapped at the stalk; when some mercy has
          been withered, like Jonah's gourd in the night -- then it is that the
          Christian feels, "I am not of the world." His cloak is torn from him,
          and the cold wind whistles almost through him; and then he says, "I am
          a stranger in the world, as all my fathers were. Lord, thou hast been
          my dwelling-place in all generations." You have had at times deep
          sorrows. Thank God for them! They are testing moments. When the
          furnace is hot, it is then that the gold is tried best. Have you felt
          at such a time that you were not of the world? Or, have you rather sat
          down, and said, "Oh! I do not deserve this trouble?" Did you break
          under it? Did you bow down before it and let it crush you while you
          cursed your Maker? Or did your spirit, even under its load, still lift
          itself unto him, like a man all dislocated on the battle-field, whose
          limbs are cut away, but who still lifts himself up as best he can, and
          looks over the field to see if there be a friend approaching. Did you
          do so? Or did you lie down in desperation and despair? If you did
          that, methinks you are no Christian; but if there was a rising up, it
          was a testing moment, and it proved that you were "not of the world,"
          because you could master affliction; because you could tread it under
          foot, and say --
        </p>
        <p>"When all created streams are dry,</p>
        <p>His goodness is the same;</p>
        <p>With this I well am satisfied,</p>
        <p>And glory in his name."</p>
        <p>
          But another testing moment is prosperity. Oh! there have been some of
          God's people, who have been more tried by prosperity than by
          adversity. Of the two trials, the trial of adversity is less severe to
          the spiritual man than that of prosperity. "As the fining pot for
          silver, so is a man to his praise." It is a terrible thing to be
          prosperous. You had need to pray to God, not only to help you in your
          troubles, but to help you in your blessings. Mr. Whitfield once had a
          petition to put up for a young man who had -- stop, you will think it
          was for a young man who had lost his father or his property. No! "The
          prayers of the congregation are he has need of much grace to keep him
          humble in the midst of riches." That is the kind of prayer that ought
          to be put up; for prosperity is a hard thing to bear. Now, perhaps you
          have become almost intoxicated with worldly delights, even as a
          Christian. Everything goes well with you; you have loved, and you are
          loved. Your affairs are prosperous; your heart rejoices, your eyes
          sparkle; you tread the earth with a happy soul and a joyous
          countenance; you are a happy man, for you have found that even in
          worldly things, "godliness with contentment is great gain." Did you
          ever feel, --
        </p>
        <p>"These can never satisfy;</p>
        <p>Give me Christ, or else I die."</p>
        <p>
          Did you feel that these comforts were nothing but the leaves of the
          tree, and not the fruit, and that you could not live upon mere leaves?
          Did you feel they were after all nothing but husks? Or did you not sit
          down and say, "Now, soul, take thine ease; thou hast goods laid up for
          many years; eat, drink, and be merry?" If you did imitate the rich
          fool, then you were of the world; but if your spirit went up above
          your prosperity so that you still lived near to God, then you proved
          that you were a child of God, for you were not of the world. These are
          testing points; both prosperity and adversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: you may test yourselves in this way in solitude and in company.
          In solitude you may tell whether you are not of the world. I sit me
          down, throw the window up, look out on the stars, and think of them as
          the eyes of God looking down upon me! And oh! does it not seem
          glorious at times to consider the heavens when we can say, "Ah! beyond
          those stars in my house not made with hands; those stars are
          mile-stones on the road to glory, and I shall soon tread the
          glittering way, or be carried by seraphs far beyond them, and be
          there!" Have you felt in solitude that you are not of the world? And
          so again in company. Ah! beloved, believe me, company is one of the
          best tests for a Christian. You are invited to an evening party.
          Sundry amusements are provided which are not considered exactly
          sinful, but which certainly cannot come under the name of pious
          amusements. You sit there with the rest; there is a deal of idle chat
          going on, you would be thought puritanical to protest against it. Have
          you not come away -- and notwithstanding all has been very pleasant,
          and friends have been very agreeable -- have you not been inclined to
          say, "Ah! that does not do for me; I would rather be in a prayer
          meeting; I could be with the people of God, than in fine rooms with
          all the dainties and delicacies that could be provided without the
          company of Jesus. By God's grace I will seek to shun all these places
          as much as possible." That is a good test. You will prove in this way
          that you are not of the world. And you may do so in great many other
          ways, which I have no time to mention. Have you felt this
          experimentally, so that you can say, "I know that I am not of the
          world, I feel it; I experience it." Don't talk of doctrine. Give me
          doctrine ground into experience. Doctrine is good; but experience is
          better. Experimental doctrine is the true doctrine which comforts and
          which edifies.

        <p>
          IV. And now, lastly we must briefly apply this in PRACTICE. "They are
          not of the world, even as I am not of the world." And, first, allow
          me, man or woman, to apply this to thee. Thou who art of the world,
          whose maxims, whose habits, whose behaviour, whose feelings, whose
          everything is worldly and carnal, list thee to this. Perhaps thou
          makest some profession of religion. Hear me, then. Thy boasting of
          religion is empty as a phantom, and shall pass away when the sun
          rises, as the ghosts sleep in their grave at the crowing of the cock.
          Thou hast some pleasure in that professioned religion of thine
          wherewith thou art arrayed, and which thou carriest about thee as a
          cloak, and usest as a stalking-horse to thy business, and a net to
          catch the honour of the world, and yet thou art worldly, like other
          men. Then I tell thee if there be no distinction between thyself and
          the worldly, the doom of the worldly shall be thy doom. If thou wert
          marked and watched, thy next door tradesman would act as thou dost,
          and thou actest as he does; there is no distinction between thee and
          the world. Hear me, then; it is God's solemn truth. Thou art none of
          his. If thou art like the rest of the world, thou art of the world.
          Thou art a goat, and with goats thou shalt be cursed; for the sheep
          can always be distinguished from the goats by their appearance. O ye
          worldly men of the world! ye carnal professors, ye who crowd our
          churches, and fill our places of worship, this is God's truth! let me
          say it solemnly. If I should say it as I ought, it would be weeping
          tears of blood. Ye are, with all your profession, "in the gall of
          bitterness;" with all your boastings, ye are "in bonds of iniquity;"
          for ye act as others and ye shall come where others come; and it shall
          be done with you as with more notorious heirs of hell. There is an old
          story which was once told of a Dissenting minister. The old custom
          was, that a minister might stop at an inn, and not pay anything for
          his bed or his board; and when he went to preach, from place to place,
          he was charged nothing for the conveyance in which he rode. But on one
          occasion, a certain minister stopped at an inn and went to bed. The
          landlord listened and heard no prayer; so when he came down in the
          morning, he presented his bill. "Oh! I am not going to pay that, for I
          am a minister." "Ah!" said the landlord, "you went to bed last night
          like a sinner, and you shall pay this morning like a sinner; I will
          not let you go." Now, it strikes me, that this will be the case with
          some of you when you come to God's bar. Though you pretended to be a
          Christian, you acted like a sinner, and you shall fare like a sinner
          too. Your actions were unrighteous; they were far from God; and you
          shall have a portion with those whose character was the same as yours.
          "Be not deceived;" it is easy to be so. "God is not mocked," though we
          often are, both minister and people. "God is not mocked; whatsoever a
          man soweth, that shall he also reap."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we want to apply this to many true children of God who are
          here, by way of caution. I say, my brother Christian, you are not of
          the world. I am not going to speak hardly to you, because you are my
          brother, and in speaking to you I speak to myself also, for I am as
          guilty as thou art. Brother, have we not often been too much like the
          world? Do we not sometimes in our conversation, talk too much like the
          world? Come, let me ask myself, are there not too many idle words that
          I say? Ay, that there are. And do I not sometimes give occasion to the
          enemy to blaspheme, because I am not so different from the world as I
          ought to be? Come, brother; let us confess our sins together. Have we
          not been too worldly? Ah! we have. Oh! let this solemn thought cross
          our minds: suppose that after all we should not be his! for it is
          written, "Ye are not of the world." O God! if we are not right, make
          us so; where we are a little right, make us still more right; and
          where we are wrong, amend us! Allow me to tell a story to you; I told
          it when I was preaching last Tuesday morning, but it is worth telling
          again. There is a great evil in many of us being too light and frothy
          in our conversation. A very solemn thing once happened. A minister had
          been preaching in a country village, very earnestly and fervently. in
          the midst of his congregation there was a young man who was deeply
          impressed with a sense of sin under the sermon; he therefore sought
          the minister as he went out, in hopes of walking home with him. They
          walked till they came to a friend's house. On the road the minister
          had talked about anything except the subject on which he had preached,
          though he had preached very earnestly, and even with tears in his
          eyes. The young man thought within himself, "Oh! I wish I could
          unburden my heart and speak to him; but I cannot. He does not say
          anything now about what he spoke of in the pulpit." When they were at
          supper that evening, the conversation was very far from what it should
          be, and the minister indulged in all kinds of jokes and light sayings.
          The young man had gone into the house with eyes filled with tears,
          feeling like a sinner should feel; but as soon as he got outside,
          after the conversation, he stamped his foot, and said, "It is a lie
          from beginning to end. That man has preached like an angel; and now he
          has talked like a devil." Some years after the young man was taken
          ill, and sent for this same minister. The minister did not know him.
          "Do you remember preaching at such-and-such a village?" asked the
          young man. "I do." "your text was very deeply laid to my heart."
          "Thank God for that," said the minister. "Do not be so quick about
          thanking God," said the young man. "Do you know what you talked of
          that evening afterwards, when I went to supper with you. Sir, I shall
          be damned! And I will charge you before God's throne with being the
          author of my damnation. On that night I did feel my sin; but you were
          the means of scattering all my impressions." That is a solemn thought,
          brother, and teaches us how we should curb our tongues, especially
          those who are so light hearted, after solemn services and earnest
          preachings, that we should not betray levity. Oh! let us take heed
          that we are not of the world, even as Christ was not of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Christian, lastly, by way of practice, let me comfort thee with
          this. Thou art not of the world for thy home is in heaven. Be content
          to be here a little, for thou art not of the world, and thou shalt go
          up to thine own bright inheritance by-and-bye. A man in travelling
          goes into an inn; it is rather uncomfortable, "Well," says he, "I
          shall not have to stay here many nights; I have only to sleep here
          to-night, I shall be at home in the morning, so that I don't care much
          about one night's lodging being a little uncomfortable." So,
          Christian, this world is never a very comfortable one; but recollect,
          you are not of the world. This world is like an inn; you are only
          lodging here a little while. Put up with a little inconvenience,
          because you are not of the world, even as Christ is not of the world;
          and by-and-bye, up yonder, you shall be gathered into your father's
          house, and there you will find that there is a new heaven and a new
          earth provided for those who are "not of the world."<br />
