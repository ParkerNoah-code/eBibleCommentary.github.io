        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.283)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 13th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me." -- Job 10:2.</p>
        <p>
          AND WILL GOD CONTEND with man? If God be angry, can he not take away
          the breath of his nostrils, and lay him low in the dust of earth? If
          the heart of the Almighty be moved unto hot displeasure, can he not
          speak in his anger, and will not the soul of man sink into the lowest
          hell? Will God contend -- will he set himself in battle array against
          his creature? and such a creature? -- the creature of an hour -- a
          thing that is not, that is here to-day and gone to-morrow? Will the
          Almighty contend with the nothingness of man? Will the everlasting God
          take up the weapons of war, and go out to fight against the insect of
          a day? Well might we cry out to him, "after whom is my Lord the King
          gone forth? After a dead dog: after a flea?" Wilt thou hunt the
          partridge on the mountains with an army, and wilt thou go forth
          against a gnat with shield and spear? Shall the everlasting God who
          fainteth not, neither is weary, at whose reproof the pillars of
          heaven's starry roof tremble and start -- will he become combatant
          with a creature? Yet our text saith so. It speaks of God's contending
          with man. Ah, surely, my brethren, it needs but little logic to
          understand that this not a contention of anger, but a contention of
          love. It needs, methinks, but a short sight for us to discover that,
          if God contendeth with man, it must be a contention of mercy. There
          must be a design of love in this. If he were angry he would not
          condescend to reason with his creature, and to have a strife of words
          with him; much less would he put on his buckler, and lay hold on his
          sword, to stand up in battle and contend with such a creature as man.
          You will all perceive at once that there must be love even in this
          apparently angry word; that this contention must, after all, have
          something to do with contentment, and that this battle must be, after
          all, but a disguised mercy, but another shape of an embrace from the
          God of love. Carry this consoling reflection in your thoughts while I
          am preaching to you; and if any of you are saying to-day, "Shew me
          wherefore thou contendest with me," the very fact of God contending
          with you at all, the fact that he has not consumed you, that he has
          not smitten you to the lowest hell, may thus, at the very outset,
          afford consolation and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I propose to address myself to the two classes of persons who are
          making use of this question. First, I shall speak to the tried saint;
          and then I shall speak to the seeking sinner, who has been seeking
          peace and pardon through Christ, but who has not as yet found it, but,
          on the contrary, has been buffeted by the law, and driven away from
          the mercy-seat in despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, to THE CHILD OF GOD. I have -- I know I have -- in
          this great assembly, some who have come to Job's position. They are
          saying, "My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
          myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. I will say unto
          God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me."
          Sometimes to question God is wicked. As the men of Bethshemesh were
          smitten with death when they dared to lift up the lid of the ark and
          look into its sacred mysteries, so is it often death to our faith to
          question God. It often happens that the sorest plagues come upon us on
          account of an impudent curiosity which longs to pry between the folded
          leaves of God's great council-book, and find out the reason for his
          mysterious providences. But, methinks this is a question that may be
          asked. Inquiring here will not be merely curious: for there will be a
          practical affect following therefrom. Tried saint t follow me while I
          seek to look into this mystery and answer your question, and I pray
          you, select that one of several answers which I shall propound, which
          shall, to your judgment, enlightened by the Holy Spirit, seem to be
          the right one. You have been tried by trouble after trouble: business
          runs cross against you; sickness is never out of your house; while in
          your own person you are the continual subject of a sad depression of
          spirit. It seems as if God were contending with you, and you are
          asking, "Why is this" Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.?'
        </p>
        <p>
          1. My first answer on God's part, my brother, is this -- it may be
          that God is contending with thee that he may show his own power in
          upholding thee. God delighteth in his saints; and when a man delights
          in his child, if it be a child noted for its brightness of intellect,
          he delights to see it put through hard questions, because he knows
          that it will be able to answer them all. So God glories in his
          children. He loves to hear them tried, that the whole world may see
          that there is none like them on the face of the earth, and even Satan
          may be compelled before he can find an accusation against them, to
          resort to his inexhaustible fund of lies. Sometimes God on purpose
          puts his children in the midst of this world's trials. On the right,
          left, before, behind, they are surrounded. Within and without the
          battle rages. But there stands the child of God, calm amidst the
          bewildering cry, confident of victory. And then the Lord pointeth
          joyously to his saint, and he saith, "See, Satan, he is more than a
          match for thee. Weak though he is, yet through my power, he all things
          can perform." And sometimes God permits Satan himself to come against
          one of his children; and the black fiend of hell in dragon's wings,
          meets a poor Christian just when he is faint and weary from stumblings
          in the valley of humiliation. The fight is long and terrible, and,
          well it may be, for it is a worm combating with the dragon. But see
          what that worm can do. It is trodden under foot, and yet it destroys
          the heel that treads upon it. When the Christian is cast down he
          utters a cry, "Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy, for though I fall
          yet shall I rise again." And so God pointeth to his child and with,
          "See there! see what I can do: I can make flesh and blood more mighty
          than the most cunning spirit; I can make poor feeble foolish man, more
          than a match for all the craft and might of Satan." And what will you
          say to this third proof that God puts us through? Sometimes God doth
          as it were, himself enter into the lists; oh, let us wonder to tell
          it. God to prove the strength of faith, sometimes himself makes war on
          faith. Think not that this is a stretch of the imagination. It is
          plain simple fact. Have ye never heard of the brook Jabbok, and of
          that angel-clothed God who fought with Jacob there, and permitted
          Jacob to prevail? What was this for? It was this: thus had God
          determined, "I will strengthen the creature so much, that I will
          permit it to overcome its Creator." Oh, what noble work is this, that
          while God is casting down his child with one hand, he should be
          holding him up with the other: letting a measure of omnipotence fall
          on him to crush him, while the like omnipotence supports him under the
          tremendous load. The Lord shows the world -- "See what faith can do!
          "Well does Hart sing of faith --
        </p>
        <p>"It treads on the world and on hell;</p>
        <p>It vanquishes death and despair;</p>
        <p>And, O! let us wonder to tell,</p>
        <p>It overcomes heaven by prayer."</p>
        <p>
          This is why God contends with thee: to glorify himself, by showing to
          angels, to men, to devils, how he can put such strength into poor puny
          man, that he can contend with his Maker, and become a prevailing
          prince like Israel, who as a prince had power of God, and prevailed.
          This, then, may be the first reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Let me give you a second answer. Perhaps, O tried soul! the Lord is
          doing this to develope thy graces. There are some of thy graces that
          would never be discovered if it were not for thy trials. Dost thou not
          know that thy faith never looks so grand in summer weather, as it does
          in winter? Hast thou not heard that love is too often like a
          glow-worm, that showeth but little light except it be in the midst of
          surrounding darkness? And dost thou not know that hope itself is like
          a star -- not to be seen in the sunshine of prosperity, and only to be
          discovered in the night of adversity? Dost thou not understand that
          afflictions are often the black foils in which God doth set the jewels
          of his children's graces, to make them shine the better. It was but a
          little while ago that on thy knees thou west saying, "Lord, I fear I
          have no faith: let me know that I have faith." But dost thou know thou
          wast praying for trials, for thou canst not know that thou hast faith,
          until thy faith be exercised. Our trials, so to speak, are like
          wayfarers in a wood. When there is no intruder in the silent glades of
          the forest, the hare and the partridge lie; and there they rest, and
          no eye sees them. But when the intruding footstep is heard, then you
          see them start and run along the green lane, and you hear the whirr of
          the pheasant as it seeks to hide itself. Now, our trials are intruders
          upon our heart's rest; our graces start up and we discover them. They
          had lain in their lair, they had slept in their forms, they lead
          rested in their nests, unless these intruding trials had startled them
          from their places. I remember a simple rural metaphor used by a
          departed divine. He says he was never very skillful at birds' nesting
          in the summer time, but he could always find birds' nests in the
          winter. Now, it often happens that when a man has but little grace,
          you can scarcely see it when the leaves of his prosperity are on him;
          but let the winter's blast come and sweep away his withered leaves,
          and then you discover his graces. Depend upon it, God often sends us
          trials that our graces may be discovered, and that we may be certified
          of their existence. Besides, it is not merely discovery, it is real
          growth that is the result of these trials. There is a little plant,
          small and stunted, growing under the shade of a brood spreading oak;
          and this little plant values the shade which covers it, and greatly
          does it esteem the quiet rest which its noble friend affords. But a
          blessing is designed for this little plant. Once upon a time there
          comes along the woodman, and with his sharp axe he fells the oak. The
          plant weeps, and cries, "My shelter is departed: every rough wind will
          blow upon me, and every storm will seek to uproot me." "No, no," saith
          the angel of that flower, "now will the sun get at thee; now will the
          shower fall on thee in more copious abundance than before; now thy
          stunted form shall spring up into loveliness, and thy flower, which
          could never have expanded itself to perfection, shall now laugh in the
          sunshine, and men shall say, How greatly hath that plant increased!
          how glorious hath become its beauty through the removal of that which
          was its shade and its delight!'" See you not, then, that God may take
          away your comforts and your privileges to make you the better
          Christians? Why, the Lord always trains his soldiers, not by letting
          them lie on feather beds, but by turning them out and using them to
          forced marches and hard service He makes them ford through streams,
          and swim through rivers, and climb mountains, and walk many a long
          march with heavy knapsacks of sorrow on their backs. This is the way
          in which he makes soldiers -- not by dressing them up in fine
          uniforms, to swagger at the barrack gates, and to be fine gentlemen in
          the eyes of the loungers in the park. God knows that soldiers are only
          to be made in battle; they are not to be grown in peaceful times. We
          may grow the stuff of which soldiers are made, but warriors are really
          educated by the smell of powder, in the midst of whizzing bullets, and
          roaring cannonades -- not in soft and peaceful times. Well, Christian,
          may not this account for it all? Is not thy Lord bringing out thy
          graces and making them grow? This is the reason why he is contending
          with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Another reason may be found in this. It may be the Lord contends
          with thee because thou hast some secret sin which is doing thee sore
          damage. Dost thou remember the story of Moses? Never a man better
          beloved than he of the Lord his God, for he was faithful in all his
          house as a servant. But dost thou remember how the Lord met him on the
          way as he was going to Egypt, and strove with him? find why? Because
          he had in his house an uncircumcised child. This child was, so long as
          it had not God's seal upon it, a sin in Moses; therefore God strove
          with him till the thing was done. Now, too often we have some
          uncircumcised thing in our house, some joy that is evil, some
          amusement that is sinful, some pursuit that is not agreeable to his
          will. And the Lord meets us often as he did Moses, of whom it is
          written -- "The Lord met him by the way in the inn, and sought to kill
          him." -- Exodus 4:24. Now search and look, for if the consolations of
          God be small with thee, there is some secret sin within. Put it away,
          lest God smite thee still more sorely, and vex thee in his hot
          displeasure. Trials often discover sins -- sins we should never have
          found out if it had not been for them. We know that the houses in
          Russia are very greatly infested with rats and mice. Perhaps a
          stranger would scarcely notice them at first, but the time when you
          discover them is when the house is on fire; then they pour out in
          multitudes. And so doth God sometimes burn up our comforts to make our
          hidden sins run out; and then he enables us to knock them on the head
          and get rid of them. That may be the reason of your trial, to put an
          end to some long-fostered sin. It may be, too, that in this way God
          would prevent some future sin, some sin hidden from thine own eyes
          into which thou wouldst soon fall if it were not for his troubling
          thee by his providence. There was a fair ship which belonged to the
          great Master of the seas; it was about to sail from the port of grace
          to the haven of glory. Ere it left the shore the great Master said,
          "Mariners, be brave! Captain, be thou bold! for not a hair of your
          head shall perish; I will bring you safely to your desired haven. The
          angel of the winds is commissioned to take care of you on your way."
          The ship sailed right merrily with its streamers flying in the air. It
          floated along at a swift rate with a fair wind for many and many a
          day. But once upon a time there came a hurricane which drove them from
          the course, strained their mast until it bent as if it must snap in
          twain. The sail was gone to ribbons; the sailors were alarmed and the
          captain himself trembled. They had lost their course. "They were out
          of the right track," they said; and they mourned exceedingly. When the
          day dawned the waves were quiet, and the angel of the winds appeared;
          and they spoke unto him, and said, "Oh angel, wast thou not bidden to
          take charge of us, and preserve us on our journeys?" He answered, "It
          was even so, and I have done it. You were steering on right
          confidently, and you knew not that a little ahead of your vessel lay a
          quicksand upon which she would be wrecked and swallowed up quick. I
          saw that there was no way for your escape but to drive you from your
          course. See, I have done as it was commanded me: go on your way." Ah,
          this is a parable of our Lord's dealings with us. He often drives us
          from our smooth course which we thought was the right track to heaven.
          But there is a secret reason for it; there is a quicksand ahead that
          is not marked in the chart. We know nothing about it; but God seeth
          it, and he will not permit this fair vessel, which he has himself
          insured, to be stranded anywhere; he will bring it safely to its
          desired haven.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. I have now another reason to give, but it is one which some of you
          will not understand; some however will. Beloved, ye remember that it
          is written, that we "must bear the image of the heavenly," namely, the
          image of Christ. As he was in this world even so must we be. We must
          have fellowship with him in his sufferings, that we may be conformable
          unto his death. Hast thou never thought that none can be like the Man
          of Sorrow unless they have sorrows too? How can you be like unto him,
          who sweat as it were great drops of blood, if you do not sometimes
          say, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death." Think not, O
          well-beloved, that thou canst be like the thorn-crowned head, and yet
          never feel the thorn. Canst thou be like thy dying Lord, and yet be
          uncrucified? Must thy hand be without a nail, and thy foot without a
          wound? Canst thou be like him, unless like him thou art compelled to
          say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" God is chiselling
          you -- you are but a rough block -- he is making you into the image of
          Christ; and that sharp chisel is taking away much which prevents your
          being like him. Must he who is our head be marred in his visage by
          reason of grief, and must we for ever rejoice and sing? It cannot be.
        </p>
        <p>"The heirs of salvation, I know from his word,</p>
        <p>Through much tribulation must follow their Lord."</p>
        <p>
          Sweet is the affliction which gives us fellowship with Christ. Blessed
          is the plough that ploughs deep furrows, if the furrows be like his.
          Blessed is the mouth that spits upon us, if the spittle be from the
          same cause as that which defiled his face. Blessed are the nails and
          thorns, and vinegar and spear, if they but make us somewhat like to
          him, in whose glory we shall be partakers when we shall see him as he
          is. This is a matter which all cannot understand, for it is a path
          which no unhallowed foot hath trodden, and no careless eye hath so
          much as seen it. But the true believer can rejoice therein, for he has
          had fellowship with Christ in his sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. To the child Of God I shall give only one more reason. The Lord, it
          may be, contendeth with thee, my brother, to humble thee. We are all
          too proud; the humblest of us do but approach to the door of true
          humility. We are too proud, for pride, I suppose, runs in our very
          veins, and is not to be gotten out of us any more than the marrow from
          our bones. We shall have many blows before we are brought down to the
          right mark; and it is because we are so continually getting up that
          God is so continually putting us down again. Besides, don't you feel,
          in looking back on your past troubles, that you have after all been
          best when you have had troubles? I can truly say, there is a
          mournfulness in joy, and there is a sweet joy in sorrow. I do not know
          how it is, but that bitter wine of sorrow, when you once get it down
          gives such a warmth to the inner man as even the wine of Lebanon can
          scarce afford. It acts with such a tonic influence upon the whole
          system, that the very veins begin to thrill as the blood leaps
          therein. Strange influence! I am no physician, but yet I know that my
          sweet cup often leaves bitterness on the palate, and my bitter cup
          always leaves a sweet flavour in the mouth. There is a sweet joy in
          sorrow I cannot understand. There is music in this harp with its
          strings all unstrung and broken. There are a few notes I hear from
          this mournful lute that I never get from the loud-sounding trumpet.
          Softness and melody we get from the wail of sorrow, which we never get
          from the song of joy. Must we not account for this by the fact that in
          our troubles we live nearer to God? Our joy is like the wave as it
          dashes upon the shore -- it throws us on the earth. But our sorrows
          are like that receding wave which sucks us back again into the great
          depth of Godhead. We should have been stranded and left high and dry
          upon the shore if it had not been for that receding wave, that ebbing
          of our prosperity, which carried us back to our Father and to our God
          again. Blessed affliction! it has brought us to the mercy seat; given
          life to prayer; enkindled love; strengthened faith; brought Christ
          into the furnace with us, and then brought us out of the furnace to
          live with Christ more joyously than before.

          Surely, I cannot answer this question better. If I have not hit upon
          the right reason, search and look my dearly beloved; for the reason is
          not far off if ye but look for it -- the reason why he contendeth with
          you.

          II. I have thus done with the saints; I shall now turn myself to
          address THE SEEKING SINNER, who is wondering that he has found no
          peace and comfort. By the way -- running a little apart from the
          subject -- I heard a brother saying the other evening in describing
          his experience, that before he was converted he Was never sick, never
          had an affliction at all, but from the very hour when he became
          converted, he found that trials and troubles came upon him very thick.
          I have been thinking of that ever since, and I think I have found a
          reason for it. When we are converted, it is the time of the singing of
          birds; but do you know the time of the singing of birds is the time of
          the pruning of vines, and as sure as the time of the singing of birds
          is come the time of the pruning of vines is come also. God begins to
          try us as soon as he begins to make our soul sing. This is not running
          away from the subject. I thought it was. It has just brought me to
          address the sinner. You have come here this morning saying to
          yourself, "Sir, not long ago I was awakened to a sense of my lost
          estate. As I was directed I went home and sought mercy in prayer. From
          that day till now I have never ceased to pray. But, alas! I get no
          comfort, sir; I grow worse than ever I was before -- I mean I grow
          more desponding, more sad. If you had asked me before conviction, sir,
          whether the path to heaven was easy, I should have said yes.' But now
          it seems to me to be strewn with flints. That I would not mind but,
          alas! methinks the gate is shut which lies at the end of the road; for
          I have knocked, and it has never opened; I have asked, and I have not
          received; I have sought, and I have not found. In fact, instead of
          getting peace I receive terror. God is contending with me. Can you
          tell me, sir, why it is? "I will try to answer the question, God
          helping me.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. My first answer shall be this. Perhaps, my dear hearer, God is
          contending with you for awhile, because as yet you are not thoroughly
          awakened. Remember, Christ will not heal your wound till he has probed
          it to its very core. Christ is no unqualified physician, no foolish
          surgeon, who would close up a wound with proud flesh in it; but he
          will take the lances, and cut, and cut, and cut again crossways, and
          he will lay the sore open, expose it, look into it, make it smart; and
          then after that, he will close up its mouth and make it whole. Perhaps
          thou hast not as yet known thine own vileness, thine own lost state.
          Now, Christ will have thee know thy poverty before he will make thee
          rich. His Holy Spirit will convince thee of sin, of righteousness, and
          of judgment to come. He will strip thee, and though the pulling off of
          thy own righteousness be like flaying thee and tearing off the skin
          from thy breast, yet he will do it; for he will not clothe thee with
          the robe of his own righteousness till every rag of thy own
          self-sufficiency is pulled away. This is why God is contending with
          thee. Thou hast been on thy knees. Go lower, man -- go lower; fall
          flat on thy face. Thou hast said, "Lord, I am nothing." Go lower, man;
          say, "Lord, I am less than nothing and the very chief of sinners."
          Thou hast felt somewhat; go ask that thou mayest feel more; may be yet
          more fully convinced of sin -- may learn to hate it with a more
          perfect hatred, and to bewail thy lost estate with a wailing like that
          of Ramah, when Rachel wept for her children and would not be comforted
          because they were not. Seek to know the bottom of your case. Make it a
          matter of conscience to look thy sins in the face, and let hell also
          blaze before thee: realize the fact that thou deservest to be lost for
          ever. Sit down often and take counsel with the Lord thy God, whom thou
          hast grievously offended. Think of thy privileges, and how thou hast
          despised them; recollect the invitations thou hast heard, and how
          often thou hast rejected them; get a proper sense of sin, and it may
          be that God will cease to contend with thee, because the good is all
          obtained which he sought to give thee by this long and painful
          contention.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another answer I will give you is this: perhaps God contends with
          thee in order to try thy earnestness. There are many Mr. Pliables, who
          set out on the road to heaven for a little time, and the first boggy
          piece of road they come to, they creep out on that side which is
          nearest to their own house, and go back again. Now, God meets every
          pilgrim on the road to heaven and contends with him. If you can hold
          your own, and say, "Though he slay me yet will I trust in him;" if you
          can dare to do it, and be importunate with God, and say, "Though he
          never hear me, if I perish I will pray, and perish only there;" then
          you have got the mastery and you shall succeed. God's Spirit is
          teaching you how to wrestle and agonize in prayer. I have seen a man,
          when he has become solemnly in earnest about his soul, pray as though
          he was a very Samson, with the two gates of mercy in his hand, rocking
          them to and fro as though he would sooner pull them up -- gates, and
          bar, and all -- than he would go away without obtaining a blessing.
          God loves to see a man mighty in prayer, intent upon getting the
          blessing, resolved that he will have Christ, or he will perish seeking
          him. Now, be in earnest. Cry aloud! spare not! Rise in the
          night-watches! pour out your heart like water before the Lord, for he
          will answer thee when he hath heard the voice of thy crying; he will
          hearken to thy supplication and give thee the desire of thy heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Yet, again, another matter. "May it not be, my dear hearers, that
          the reason why God contends with you and does not give you peace is,
          because you are harbouring some one sin" Now, I will not say what it
          is; I have known a man solemnly under conviction of sin, but the
          company which he kept on market-day was of such a caste, that until he
          was separated entirely from his companions, it was not possible he
          should have peace. I do not know what your peculiar besetting sin may
          be. It may be a love for frivolity; it may be the desire to associate
          with those who amuse you; it may be worse. But remember, Christ and
          thy soul will never be one till thou and thy sins are two. Thy desires
          and longings must make a clean sweep of the devil and all his crew, or
          else Christ will not come and dwell with thee. "Well," says one, "but
          I cannot be perfect." No, but you cannot find peace till you desire to
          be. Wherever you harbour a sin, there you harbour misery. One sin
          wilfully indulged in, and not forsaken by true repentance, will
          destroy the soul. Sins given up are like goods cast out at sea by the
          mariners in days of storm; they lighten the ship, and the ship will
          never float till you have thrown all your sins overboard. There is no
          hope whatever for you till you can truly say,
        </p>
        <p>"Whate'er consists not with thy love,</p>
        <p>O help me to resign."</p>
        <p>"The dearest idol I have known,</p>
        <p>Whate'er that idol be,</p>
        <p>Help me to tear it from its throne,</p>
        <p>And worship only thee."</p>
        <p>
          4. Then drawing near to a conclusion let me have your most solemn
          attention while I give one more hint as to the reason why you have not
          yet found peace. My dear hearers, perhaps it is because you do not
          thoroughly understand the plan of salvation. I do feel that all
          ministers, -- and here perhaps, I am as great a sinner as any other,
          and I condemn myself while I chastise others -- we all of us do in
          some way or other, I fear, help to dim the lustre of God's grace, as
          manifested in the cross of Christ. Often am I afraid lest I should
          prefer Calvinism to Calvary, lest I should put the sinner's sense of
          need like a quickset hedge round the cross, and keep the poor sinner
          from getting as near as he would to the bleeding Lamb of God. Ah, my
          dear hearers, remember if you would be saved, your salvation comes
          wholly and entirely from Jesus Christ, the dying Son of God. View him
          yonder, sinner, sweating in the garden! See the red drops of blood as
          they fall from that dear face! Oh, see him sinner, see him in Pilate's
          hall. View the streams of gore as they gush from those lacerated
          shoulders. See him, sinner, see him on his cross! View that head still
          marked with the wounds with which the thorns pierced his temples! Oh,
          view that face emaciated and marred! See the spittle still hanging
          there -- the spittle of cruel mockers! See the eyes floating in tears
          with languid pity! Look, too, at those hands, and view them as they
          stream like founts of blood! Oh, stand and listen while he cries,
          "Lama Sabacthani!" Sinner, thy life is in him that died; thy healing
          is in yonder wounds; thy salvation is in his destruction. "Oh," says
          one, "but I cannot believe." Ah, brother, that was once my mournful
          cry. But I will tell you how I came to believe. Once upon a time, I
          was trying to make myself believe, and a voice whispered, "Vain man,
          vain man, if thou wouldst believe, come and see!" Then the Holy Spirit
          led me by the hand to a solitary place. And while I stood there,
          suddenly there appeared before me One upon his cross. I looked up, I
          had then no faith. I saw his eyes suffused with tears, and the blood
          still flowing: I saw his enemies about him hunting him to his grave; I
          marked his miseries unutterable; I heard the groaning which cannot be
          described; and as I looked up, he opened his eyes and said to me, "The
          Son of Man is come into the world to seek and to save that which was
          lost." I clapped my hands, and I said, "Jesus, I do believe, I must
          believe what thou hast said, I could not believe before, but the sight
          of thee has breathed faith into my soul. I dare not doubt -- it were
          treason, it were high treason to doubt thy power to save." Dissolved
          by his agonies, I fell on the ground, and embraced his feet, and when
          I fell, my sin fell also! And I rejoiced in love divine that blots out
          sin and saves from death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh my friend, you will never get faith by trying to make yourself have
          it. Faith is the gift of Christ! go and find it in his veins. There is
          a secret spot where faith is treasured up; it is in the heart of
          Christ; go and catch it sinner as it flows therefrom. Go to your
          chamber, and sit down and picture Christ in holy vision, dying on the
          tree, and as your eye sees, your heart shall melt, your soul shall
          believe, and you shall rise from your knees and cry, "I know whom I
          may believe, and I am persuaded he is able to save that which I have
          committed to him until that day."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, may the love of Christ Jesus, and the grace of his Father,
          and the fellowship of his Spirit, be with you for ever and ever. Amen
          and Amen.<br />
