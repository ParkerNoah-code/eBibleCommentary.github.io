          This psalm consists of three parts. It begins with a complaint; next
          follows an enumeration of various imprecations; and then comes a
          prayer with an expression of true gratitude. And although David here
          complains of the injuries which he sustained, yet, as he was a typical
          character, everything that is expressed in the psalm must properly be
          applied to Christ, the Head of the Church, and to all the faithful,
          inasmuch as they are his members; so that when unjustly treated and
          tormented by their enemies, they may apply to God for help, to whom
          vengeance belongs. <br />
