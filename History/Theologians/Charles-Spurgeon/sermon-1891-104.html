          1. Therefore Abraham also, knowing the Father through the Word, who
          made heaven and earth, confessed Him to be God; and having learned, by
          an announcement [made to him], that the Son of God would be a man
          among men, by whose advent his seed should be as the stars of heaven,
          he desired to see that day, so that he might himself also embrace
          Christ; and, seeing it through the spirit of prophecy, he rejoiced.
          Wherefore Simeon also, one of his descendants, carried fully out the
          rejoicing of the patriarch, and said: "Lord, now lettest Thou Thy
          servant depart in peace. For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which
          Thou hast prepared before the face of all people: a light for the
          revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of the people Israel." And
          the angels, in like manner, announced tidings of great joy to the
          shepherds who were keeping watch by night. Moreover, Mary said, "My
          soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
          salvation;" -- the rejoicing of Abraham descending upon those who
          sprang from him, -- those, namely, who were watching, and who beheld
          Christ, and believed in Him; while, on the other hand, there was a
          reciprocal rejoicing which passed backwards from the children to
          Abraham, who did also desire to see the day of Christ's coming.
          Rightly, then, did our Lord bear witness to him, saying, "Your father
          Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For not alone upon Abraham's account did He say these things, but
          also that He might point out how all who have known God from the
          beginning, and have foretold the advent of Christ, have received the
          revelation from the Son Himself; who also in the last times was made
          visible and passible, and spake with the human race, that He might
          from the stones raise up children unto Abraham, and fulfil the promise
          which God had given him, and that He might make his seed as the stars
          of heaven, as John the Baptist says: "For God is able from these
          stones to raise up children unto Abraham." Now, this Jesus did by
          drawing us off from the religion of stones, and bringing us over from
          hard and fruitless cogitations, and establishing in us a faith like to
          Abraham. As Paul does also testify, saying that we are children of
          Abraham because of the similarity of our faith, and the promise of
          inheritance.
        </p>

          3. He is therefore one and the same God, who called Abraham and gave
          him the promise. But He is the Creator, who does also through Christ
          prepare lights in the world, [namely] those who believe from among the
          Gentiles. And He says, "Ye are the light of the world;" that is, as
          the stars of heaven. Him, therefore, I have rightly shown to be known
          by no man, unless by the Son, and to whomsoever the Son shall reveal
          Him. But the Son reveals the Father to all to whom He wills that He
          should be known; and neither without the goodwill of the Father nor
          without the agency of the Son, can any man know God. Wherefore did the
          Lord say to His disciples, "I am the way, the truth, and the life and
          no man cometh unto the Father but by Me. If ye had known Me, ye would
          have known My Father also: and from henceforth ye have both known Him,
          and have seen Him." From these words it is evident, that He is known
          by the Son, that is, by the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Therefore have the Jews departed from God, in not receiving His
          Word, but imagining that they could know the Father [apart] by
          Himself, without the Word, that is, without the Son; they being
          ignorant of that God who spake in human shape to Abraham, and again to
          Moses, saying, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people in
          Egypt, and I have come down to deliver them." For the Son, who is the
          Word of God, arranged these things beforehand from the beginning, the
          Father being in no want of angels, in order that He might call the
          creation into being, and form man, for whom also the creation was
          made; nor, again, standing in need of any instrumentality for the
          framing of created things, or for the ordering of those things which
          had reference to man; while, [at the same time,] He has a vast and
          unspeakable number of servants. For His offspring and His similitude
          do minister to Him in every respect; that is, the Son and the Holy
          Spirit, the Word and Wisdom; whom all the angels serve, and to whom
          they are subject. Vain, therefore, are those who, because of that
          declaration, "No man knoweth the Father, but the Son," do introduce
          another unknown Father.<br />
