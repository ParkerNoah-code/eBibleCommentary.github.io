          TITLE. <b>A Psalm of David.</b> David is pictured in this Psalm as in
          a faithful picture. His holy trust, his many conflicts, his great
          transgression, his bitter repentance, and his deep distresses are all
          here; so that we see the very heart of "the man after God's own
          heart."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is evidently a composition of David's later days, for he mentions
          the sins of his youth, and from its painful references to the craft
          and cruelty of his many foes, it will not be too speculative a theory
          to refer it to the period when Absalom was heading the great rebellion
          against him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This has been styled the second of the seven Penitential Psalms.<i>
            It is the mark of a true saint that his sorrows remind him of his
            sins, and his sorrow for sin drives him to his God.</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT AND DIVISION. The twenty-two verses of this Psalm begin in the
          original with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet in their proper
          order. It is the first instance we have of an
          <i>inspired acrostic or alphabetical song. </i>This method may have
          been adopted by the writer to assist the memory; and the Holy Spirit
          may have employed it to show us that the graces of style and the arts
          of poetry may lawfully be used in his service. Why should not all the
          wit and ingenuity of man be sanctified to noblest ends by being laid
          upon the altar of God?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From the singularity of the structure of the Psalm, it is not easy to
          discover any marked divisions; there are great changes of thought, but
          there is no variation of subject; the moods of the writer's mind are
          twofold—prayer and meditation; and as these appear in turns, we should
          thus divide the verses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer, 1-7; <br />
          meditation, 8-10; <br />
          prayer, 11; <br />
          meditation, 12-15; <br />
          prayer, 16-22.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Unto you, O Lord.</p></b> See how the
        holy soul flies to its God like a dove to its cote. When the storm winds
        are out, the Lord's vessels turn about and make for their well
        remembered harbor of refuge.<i>
          What a mercy that the Lord will condescend to hear our cries in time
          of trouble, although we may have almost forgotten him in our hours of
          imagined prosperity</i
        >.
        <p align="justify">
          Unto you, O Jehovah,<b> do I lift up my soul.</b> It is but a mockery
          to uplift the hands and the eyes, unless we also bring our souls into
          our devotions. True prayer may be described as the soul rising from
          earth to have fellowship with Heaven; it is taking a journey upon
          Jacob's ladder, leaving our cares and fears at the foot, and meeting
          with a covenant God at the top.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Very often the soul cannot rise, she has lost her wings, and is heavy
          and earth bound; more like a burrowing mole than a soaring eagle. At
          such dull seasons we must not give over prayer, but must, by God's
          assistance, exert all our powers to lift up our hearts. Let faith be
          the lever and grace be the arm, and the dead lump will yet be stirred.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a lift it has sometimes proved! With all our tugging and
          straining we have been utterly defeated, until the heavenly magnet of
          our Savior's love has displayed its omnipotent attractions, and then
          our hearts have gone up to our Beloved like mounting flames of fire.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. O my God.</p></b> This title is more
        dear than the name Jehovah, which is used in the first sentence. Already
        the sweet singer has drawn nearer to his heavenly helper, for he makes
        bold to grasp him with the hand of assured possession, calling him,
        <i>my God</i>. Oh the more than celestial music of that word, "My God!"
        <p align="justify">
          It is to be observed that the psalmist does not deny expression to
          those gracious feelings with which God had favored him; he does not
          fall into loathsome mock modesty, but finding in his soul a desire to
          seek the Lord he avows it; believing that he had a rightful interest
          in Jehovah he declares it, and knowing that he had confidence in his
          God he professes it.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">O my God, I trust in you.</p></b> Faith is the
        cable which binds our boat to the shore, and by pulling at it we draw
        ourselves to the land; faith unites us to God, and then draws us near to
        him. As long as the anchor of faith holds there is no fear in the worst
        tempest; if that should fail us there would be no hope left. We must see
        to it that our faith is sound and strong, for otherwise prayer cannot
        prevail with God. Woe to the warrior who throws away his shield; what
        defense can be found for him who finds no defense in his God?
        <b> <p align="justify">Let me not be ashamed.</p></b>Let no my
        disappointed hopes make me feel ashamed of my former testimonies of your
        faithfulness. Many were on the watch for this. The best of men have
        their enemies, and should pray against them that they may not see their
        wicked desires accomplished.
        <b> <p align="justify">Let not my enemies triumph over me.</p></b>Allow
        no wicked mouth to make blasphemous mirth out of my distresses by
        asking, "Where is your God?" There is a great jealousy in believers for
        the honor of God, and they cannot endure that unbelievers should taunt
        them with the failure of their expectations from the God of their
        salvation. All other trusts will end in disappointment and eternal
        shame, but our confidence shall never be confounded.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. Yes, let none that wait on you be ashamed.
          </p></b
        >
        Suffering enlarges the heart by creating the power to sympathize. If we
        pray eagerly for ourselves, we shall not long be able to forget our
        fellow sufferers. None pity the <i>poor </i>like those who have been or
        are still poor. None have such tenderness for the <i>sick </i>as those
        who have been long in ill health themselves. We ought to be grateful for
        occasional griefs if they preserve us from chronic hard-heartedness;
        for<i>
          of all afflictions, an unkind heart is the worst, it is a plague to
          its possessor, and a torment to those around him.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer when it is of the Holy Spirit's teaching is never selfish; the
          believer does not sue for monopolies for himself, but would have all
          in like case to partake of divine mercy with him. The prayer may be
          viewed as a promise;
          <i
            >our Heavenly Father will never let his trustful children find him
            untrue or unkind</i
          >. He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Let them be ashamed who transgress without cause.
          </p></b
        >
        David had given his enemies no provocation. Their hatred was wanton.
        Sinners have no justifiable reason or valid excuse for transgressing.
        They benefit no one, not even themselves by their sins. The law against
        which they transgress is not harsh or unjust. God is not a tyrannical
        ruler, providence is not a bondage. Men sin because they will sin, not
        because it is either profitable or reasonable to do so. Hence shame is
        their fitting reward.
        <i>
          May they blush with penitential shame now, or else they will not be
          able to escape the everlasting contempt and the bitter shame which is
          the portion of fools in the world to come</i
        >.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. Show me your ways, O Lord.</p></b>
        Unsanctified natures clamor for their own way, but gracious spirits cry,
        "Not my will, but yours be done." We cannot at all times discern the
        path of duty, and at such times it is our wisdom to apply to the Lord
        himself. Frequently the dealings of God with us are mysterious, and then
        also we may appeal to him as his own interpreter, and in due time he
        will make all things plain.<i>
          Moral, providential and mental forms of guidance are all precious
          gifts of a gracious God to a teachable people.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          The second petition,<b> teach me your paths</b>, appears to mean more
          than the first, and may be illustrated by the case of a little child
          who should say to his father, "Father, first tell me the way, and then
          teach my little trembling feet to walk in it." What weak dependent
          creatures we are! How constantly should we cry to the Strong for
          strength!
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. Lead me in your truth, and teach me.
          </p></b
        >
        The same request as in the last verse. The little child having begun to
        walk, asks to be still led onward by its parent's helping hand, and to
        be further instructed in the alphabet of truth.
        <i>Experimental teaching is the burden of this prayer</i>. Lead me
        according to your truth, and prove yourself faithful. Lead me into truth
        that I may know its preciousness. Lead me by the way of truth that I may
        manifest its spirit.
        <p align="justify">
          David knew much, but he felt his ignorance and desired to be still in
          the Lord's school; four times over in these two verses
          <i>he applies for a scholarship in the college of grace</i>. It were
          well for many professors if instead of following their own devices,
          and cutting out new paths of thought for themselves, they would
          inquire for the good old ways of God's own truth, and beseech the Holy
          Spirit to give them sanctified understandings and teachable spirits.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For you are the God of my salvation.</p></b> The
        Three One Jehovah is the Author and Perfecter of salvation to his
        people.
        <p align="justify">
          Reader, is he the God of your salvation? Do you find in the Father's
          <i>election</i>, in the Son's <i>atonement</i>, and in the Spirit's
          <i>quickening</i>—all the grounds of your eternal hopes? If so, you
          may use this as an argument for obtaining further blessings. If the
          Lord has ordained to save you, surely he will not refuse to instruct
          you in his ways. It is a happy thing when we can address the Lord with
          the confidence which David here manifests. It gives us great power in
          prayer, and comfort in trial.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">On you do I wait all the day.</p></b> Patience is
        the fair handmaid and daughter of faith; we cheerfully wait when we are
        certain that we shall not wait in vain. It is our duty and our privilege
        to wait upon the Lord in service, in worship, in expectancy, in trust
        all the days of our life. Our faith will be tried faith, and if it be of
        the true kind, it will bear continued trial without yielding. We shall
        not grow weary of waiting upon God, if we remember how long and how
        graciously he once waited for us.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. Remember, O Lord, your tender mercies and your
            loving-kindnesses.
          </p></b
        >We are usually tempted in seasons of affliction to fear that our God
        has forgotten us, or forgotten his usual kindness towards us. Hence the
        soul does as it were put the Lord in remembrance, and beseech him to
        recollect those deeds of love which once he wrought towards it. There is
        a holy boldness which ventures thus to deal with the Most High God—let
        us cultivate it. But there is also an unholy unbelief which suggests our
        fears, let us strive against it with all our might.
        <p align="justify">
          What gems are those two expressions, "tender mercies and
          loving-kindnesses!" They are the virgin honey of language; for
          sweetness no words can excel them; but as for the gracious favors
          which are intended by them, language fails to describe them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "When all your mercies, O my God,<br />
          My rising soul surveys,<br />

          In wonder, love and praise!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the Lord will only do unto us in the future as in the past, we
          shall be well content. We seek no change in the divine action, we only
          desire that <i>the river of grace may never cease to flow</i>.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For they have been ever of old.</p></b> A more
        correct translation would be "from eternity." David was a sound believer
        in the doctrine of God's eternal love. The Lord's loving-kindnesses are
        no novelties. When we plead with him to bestow them upon us, we can urge
        use and custom of the most ancient kind. In courts of law men make much
        of precedents, and we may plead them at the throne of grace.
        <p align="justify">
          "Faith, "says Dickson, "must make use of experiences and read them
          over unto God, out of the register of a sanctified memory, as a
          recorder to him who cannot forget." With a unchangeable God it is a
          most effectual argument to remind him of his ancient mercies and his
          eternal love. By tracing all that we enjoy to the fountainhead of
          everlasting love we shall greatly cheer our hearts, and those do us
          but sorry service who try to dissuade us from meditating upon election
          and its kindred topics.

          Those offences which we remember with repentance God forgets; but if

        wonderful that

          Moreover, as a godly man naturally endeavors to make others like
          himself, so will the Lord our God in his compassion bring sinners into

          assured that he will renew transgressors' hearts and guide them into
          the way of holiness. Let those who desire to be delivered from sin

          Observe how this verse illustrates the <i>logic of faith</i>, which is
          clean contrary to that of a legal spirit. Faith looks not for merit in
          the creature, but has regard to the goodness of the Creator; and
          instead of being staggered by the demerits of sin it looks to the
          precious blood, and pleads all the more vigorously because of the
          urgency of the case.

          A <i>net </i>is the common metaphor for <i>temptation</i>. The Lord
          often keeps his people from falling into it, and if they have fallen
          he rescues them. The word "pluck" is a rough word, and saints who have
          fallen into sin find that the means of their restoration are not
          always easy to the flesh. The Lord plucks at us sharply to let us feel
          that sin is an exceeding bitter thing. But what a mercy is here:
          Believer, be very grateful for it. The Lord will deliver us from the
          cunning devices of our cruel enemy, and even if through infirmity we
          have fallen into sin, he will not leave us to be utterly destroyed but
          will pluck us out of our dangerous state.

        Often unbelief suggests that God has turned his back upon us. If we know
        that we turn to God we need not fear that he will turn from us, but may
        boldly cry,<b> Turn unto me. </b>The ground of quarrel is always in
        ourselves, and when that is removed there is nothing to prevent our full
        enjoyment of communion with God.
        <b> <p align="justify">Have mercy upon me.</p></b> Saints still must
        stand upon the footing of mercy; notwithstanding all their experience

        <b> <p align="justify">For I am desolate and afflicted.</p></b> He was
        lonely and bowed down. Jesus was in the days of his flesh in just such a
        condition; none could enter into the secret depths of his sorrows, he

        sense, those who tread the solitary path.

        arrives we may expect the dawn. When the sea is at its lowest ebb the

        believing spirit of a true saint; all he asks for is, "Lord,
        <i>look </i>upon my evil plight." He does not dictate, or even express a

          To pretend to wait on God without holiness of life, is religious
