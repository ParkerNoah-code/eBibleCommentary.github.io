          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician.</b> He who had the leadership of the
          Temple service was charged with the use of this song in public
          worship. <i>What is everybody's business is never done</i>. It was
          well to have one person specially to attend to the service of song in
          the house of the Lord.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Of David the servant of the Lord.</p></b>This
        would seem to indicate that the Psalm peculiarly befits one who esteems
        it an honor to be called <i>Jehovah's servant</i>. It is THE SONG OF
        HAPPY SERVICE; such a one as all may join in who bear the easy yoke of
        Jesus. The wicked are contrasted with the righteous, and the great Lord
        of devout men is heartily extolled; thus obedience to so good a Master
        is indirectly insisted on, and rebellion against him is plainly
        condemned.

            Says within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
          </p></b
        >Men's sins have a voice to godly ears. They are the outer index of an
        inner evil. It is clear that men who dare to sin constantly and
        presumptuously cannot respect the great Judge of all. Despite the
        professions of unrighteous men, when we see their unhallowed actions,
        our heart is driven to the conclusion that they have no religion
        whatever. <i> Unholiness is clear evidence of ungodliness</i>.
        <i>Wickedness is the fruit of an atheistic root. </i>
        <p align="justify">
          This may be made clear to the candid mind by cogent reasoning, but it
          is clear already and intuitively to the pious heart.
          <i
            >If God is everywhere, and I fear him, how can I dare to break his
            laws in his very presence? </i
          >He must be a desperate traitor who will rebel in the monarch's own
          halls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Whatever theoretical opinions bad men may avow, they can only be
          classed with atheists, since they are such <i>practically</i>.
          <i>
            Those eyes which have no fear of God before them now, shall have the
            terrors of Hell before them forever.</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. For.</p></b> Here is the argument to
        prove the proposition laid down in the former verse. David here runs
        over the process of reasoning by which he had become convinced that
        <i>wicked men have no proper idea of God or respect for him</i>.
        God-fearing men see their sins and bewail them; where the reverse is the
        case, we may be sure there is no fear of God.
        <b> <p align="justify">He flatters himself in his own eyes.</p></b> He
        counts himself a fine fellow, worthy of great respect. He quiets his
        conscience, and so deceives his own judgment as to reckon himself a
        pattern of excellence; if not for morality—yet for having sense enough
        not to be enslaved by rules which are bonds to others. He is the free
        thinker, the man of strong mind, the hater of holiness, the philosopher.
        The servants of God are, in his esteem, mean spirited and narrow-minded.
        <p align="justify">
          Of all flatteries, this is the most absurd and dangerous. Even the
          silliest bird will not set traps for itself; the most reproachful
          attorney will not cheat himself.
          <i>To smooth over one's own conduct to one's conscience </i>(which is
          the meaning of the Hebrew)<i> is to smooth one's own path to Hell. </i
          >The descent to eternal ruin is easy enough, without making an icy
          slope of it, as self-flatters do.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</p></b
        >
        At length he is found out and detested, despite his self-conceit.
        <i>Rottenness smells sooner or later</i>—it is too strong to be
        concealed. There is a time when the leprosy cannot be hidden. At last
        the old house can no longer be propped up, and falls about the tenant's
        ears.
        <p align="justify">
          Just so, there is a limit to a man's self-deception; he is found out
          amid general scorn, and can no longer keep up the <i>farce </i> which
          he played so well. If this happens not in this life, the hand of death
          will let light in upon the hidden character, and expose the sinner to
          shame and contempt!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The self-flattering process plainly proves the atheism of sinners,
          since the bare reflection that God sees them would render such
          self-flatteries extremely difficult, if not impossible. Belief in God,
          like light reveals—and then our sin and evil are perceived. But wicked
          men are in the dark, for they cannot see what is so clearly within
          them and around them, that it stares them in the face!
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.
          </p></b
        >This pair of Hell-dogs generally hunt together, and what one does not
        catch the other will; if iniquity cannot win by oppression, deceit will
        gain by <i>chicanery</i>. When the <i>heart </i>is so corrupt as to
        flatter itself, the tongue follows suit. The open sepulcher of the
        throat, reveals the foulness of the inner nature.
        <p align="justify">
          God-fearing men make a conscience of their words, and if they sin
          through infirmity they do not invent excuses, or go about to boast of
          their wickedness. But because wicked men think little of evil and
          deceptive speeches, we may be clear that God rules not in their souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The original by declaring that the words of the wicked are falsehood
          and deceit, is peculiarly strong; as if they were not only false in
          quality, but actual falseness itself. He has left off to be wise, and
          to do good.

        season they relinquish even that hypocritical reverence of him which in
        former days they maintained in order to flatter their souls?
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. He devises evil upon his bed.</p></b>
        His place of rest becomes the place for plotting evil. His bed is a
        hot-bed for poisonous weeds. God-fearing men meditate upon God and his
        service; but when men turn all their thoughts and inventive faculties
        towards evil, their godlessness is proved to a demonstration.
        <i
          >He has the devil for his bed-fellow who lies abed and schemes how to
          sin</i
        >. God is far from him.
        <b> <p align="justify">He commits himself to a sinful course.</p></b>
        When he gets up, he resolutely and persistently pursues the mischief
        which he planned in his bed. The worst of ways he prefers for his
        walking, for he has taught his heart to love filthiness, having
        accustomed himself to revel in it in imagination.
        <b> <p align="justify">He abhors not evil.</p></b> So far from having a
        contempt and abhorrence for evil, he even rejoices in it, and patronizes
        it. He never hates a wrong thing because it is wrong, but he meditates
        on it, defends it, and practices it!

        Like the ethereal blue, God's mercy encompasses the whole earth, smiling
        upon universal nature, acting as a canopy for all the creatures of
        earth, surmounting the loftiest peaks of human provocations, and rising
        high above the mists of mortal transgression. Clear sky is evermore
        above, and mercy calmly smiles above the din and smoke of this poor
        world. Darkness and clouds are but of earth's lower atmospheres—the
        heavens are evermore serene, and bright with innumerable stars.
        <p align="justify">

        Afflictions are like clouds, but the divine truthfulness is all around
        them. While we are under the cloud, we are in the region of God's
        faithfulness; when we mount above it we shall not need such an
        assurance. To every word of threat or promise, prophecy or covenant, the
        Lord has exactly adhered, for he is not a man that he should lie, nor

        spiritual life; he alone can make life bright and lustrous.
        <p align="justify">
          In spiritual things the knowledge of God sheds a light on all other
          subjects. We need no candle to see the sun, we see it by its own
          radiance, and then see everything else by the same luster.<i>
            We never see Jesus by the light of self, but self in the light of
            Jesus. </i
          >No inward intelligence of ours leads us to receive the Spirit's
          light, but rather, it often quenches the sacred beam. Purely and only
          by his own illumination, the Holy Spirit lights up the dark recesses
          of our heart's ungodliness.

          Vain are those who look to learning and human wit. One ray from the
          throne of God is better than the noonday splendor of created wisdom.
          Lord, give me the sun; and let those who will, delight in the wax
          candles of superstition and of corrupt philosophy. Faith derives both
          light and life from God, and hence she neither dies nor darkens.

            Verse 10. O continue your loving-kindness unto those who know you.
          </p></b
        >
        We ask no more than a continuance of the past mercy. Lord, extend this
        grace of your to all the days of all who have been taught to know your
        faithful love, your tenderness, your immutability and omnipotence. As
        they have been taught of the Lord to know the Lord, so go on to instruct
        them and perfect them. This prayer is the heart of the believer asking
        precisely that which the heart of his God is prepared to grant.
        <p align="justify">
          It is well when the petition is but the reflection of the promise.

            And your righteousness to the upright in heart.

        >
        As you have never failed the righteous, so abide you in the same manner,
        their defender and avenger. The worst thing to be feared by the man of
        God is to be forsaken by God—hence this prayer; but the fear is
        groundless, hence the peace which faith brings to us.
        <p align="justify">
          Learn from this verse, that although a continuance of mercy is
          guaranteed in the covenant, we are yet to make it a matter of prayer.
          For this good thing will the Lord be inquired of.

            Verse 11. Let not the <i>foot </i>of pride come against me.

        >The general prayer is here turned into a particular and personal one
        for himself.<i> Pride is the devil's sin. </i>Godly men may well be
        afraid of proud men, for the serpent's seed will never cease to bite the
        heel of the godly. Gladly would proud scoffers spurn the saints or
        trample them under foot; against their malice prayer lifts up her voice.
        No foot shall come upon us, no hand shall prevail against us, while
        Jehovah is on our side.

        Do not allow me to be driven about as a fugitive, nor torn from my place
        like an uprooted tree. Violence with both hand and foot, with means fair
        and means foul, strove to overthrow the psalmist, but he resorts to his
        great Patron, and sings a song of triumph in anticipation of the defeat
        of his foes.

        Faith sees them scattered on the plain. There! before our very eyes sin,
        death, and Hell, lie prostrate. Behold the vanquished foes!
        <b> <p align="justify">They are cast down.</p></b> Providence and grace
        have dashed them from their vantage ground. Jesus has already thrown all
        the foes of his people upon their faces, and in due time all sinners
        shall find it so.
        <b> <p align="justify">And shall not be able to rise.</p></b> The defeat
        of the ungodly and of the powers of evil is final, total, irretrievable.
        Glory be to God, however high the powers of darkness may carry it at
        this present, the time hastens on when God shall defend the right, and
        give to evil such a fall as shall forever crush the hopes of Hell; while
        those who trust in the Lord shall eternally praise him and rejoice in
        his holy name.
