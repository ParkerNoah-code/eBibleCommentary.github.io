          This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as there the Psalmist
          showed that God had been more than a bountiful father to his chosen
          people, in order to procure for himself, in coming ages, a race of
          pure worshippers, while here he acknowledges that these remarkable
          benefits had been turned to a bad account; because the Jews from time
          to time threw off the yoke of God, basely abused his kindness, defiled
          themselves with many pollutions, and also perfidiously departed from
          his word. Nevertheless, it is not so much in the shape of a reproof or
          complaint, as a confession of their sins, in order to the obtaining
          the pardon of them. For the prophet commences with the praises of God,
          with the design of encouraging both himself and others to cherish good
          hope in him. Then he prays that God would continue his blessing to the
          seed of Abraham. But because the people, after so frequently revolting
          from God, were unworthy of the continuation of his kindness, he asks
          pardon to be extended to them, and this after he had confessed that
          from first to last, they had provoked God's wrath by their malice,
          ingratitude, pride, perfidy, and other vices. <br />
