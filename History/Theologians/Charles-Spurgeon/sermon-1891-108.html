          1. But that it was not only the prophets and many righteous men, who,
          foreseeing through the Holy Spirit His advent, prayed that they might
          attain to that period in which they should see their Lord face to
          face, and hear His words, the Lord has made manifest, when He says to
          His disciples, "Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see
          those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those
          things which ye hear, and have not heard them." In what way, then, did
          they desire both to hear and to see, unless they had foreknowledge of
          His future advent? But how could they have foreknown it, unless they
          had previously received foreknowledge from Himself? And how do the
          Scriptures testify of Him, unless all things had ever been revealed
          and shown to believers by one and the same God through the Word; He at
          one time conferring with His creature, and at another propounding His
          law; at one time, again, reproving, at another exhorting, and then
          setting free His servant, and adopting him as a son (in filium); and,
          at the proper time, bestowing an incorruptible inheritance, for the
          purpose of bringing man to perfection? For He formed him for growth
          and increase, as the Scripture says: "Increase and multiply."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And in this respect God differs from man, that God indeed makes,
          but man is made; and truly, He who makes is always the same; but that
          which is made must receive both beginning, and middle, and addition,
          and increase. And God does indeed create after a skilful manner,
          while, [as regards] man, he is created skilfully. God also is truly
          perfect in all things, Himself equal and similar to Himself, as He is
          all light, and all mind, and all substance, and the fount of all good;
          but man receives advancement and increase towards God. For as God is
          always the same, so also man, when found in God, shall always go on
          towards God. For neither does God at any time cease to confer benefits
          upon, or to enrich man; nor does man ever cease from receiving the
          benefits, and being enriched by God. For the receptacle of His
          goodness, and the instrument of His glorification, is the man who is
          grateful to Him that made him; and again, the receptacle of His just
          judgment is the ungrateful man, who both despises his Maker and is not
          subject to His Word; who has promised that He will give very much to
          those always bringing forth fruit, and more [and more] to those who
          have the Lord's money. "Well done," He says, "good and faithful
          servant: because thou hast been faithful in little, I will appoint
          thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." The Lord
          Himself thus promises very much.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As, therefore, He has promised to give very much to those who do
          now bring forth fruit, according to the gift of His grace, but not
          according to the changeableness of "knowledge;" for the Lord remains
          the same, and the same Father is revealed; thus, therefore, has the
          one and the same Lord granted, by means of His advent, a greater gift
          of grace to those of a later period, than what He had granted to those
          under the Old Testament dispensation. For they indeed used to hear, by
          means of [His] servants, that the King would come, and they rejoiced
          to a certain extent, inasmuch as they hoped for His coming; but those
          who have beheld Him actually present, and have obtained liberty, and
          been made partakers of His gifts, do possess a greater amount of
          grace, and a higher degree of exultation, rejoicing because of the
          King's arrival: as also David says, "My soul shall rejoice in the
          Lord; it shall be glad in His salvation." And for this cause, upon His
          entrance into Jerusalem, all those who were in the way recognised
          David their king in His sorrow of soul, and spread their garments for
          Him, and ornamented the way with green boughs, crying out with great
          joy and gladness, "Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed is He that
          cometh in the name of the Lord: hosanna in the highest." But to the
          envious wicked stewards, who circumvented those under them, and ruled
          over those that had no great intelligence, and for this reason were
          unwilling that the king should come, and who said to Him, "Hearest
          thou what these say?" did the Lord reply, "Have ye never read, Out of
          the mouths of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise?" -- thus
          pointing out that what had been declared by David concerning the Son
          of God, was accomplished in His own person; and indicating that they
          were indeed ignorant of the meaning of the Scripture and the
          dispensation of God; but declaring that it was Himself who was
          announced by the prophets as Christ, whose name is praised in all the
          earth, and who perfects praise to His Father from the mouth of babes
          and sucklings; wherefore also His glory has been raised above the
          heavens.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, therefore, the self-same person is present who was announced by
          the prophets, our Lord Jesus Christ, and if His advent has brought in
          a fuller [measure of] grace and greater gifts to those who have
          received Him, it is plain that the Father also is Himself the same who
          was proclaimed by the prophets, and that the Son, on His coming, did
          not spread the knowledge of another Father, but of the same who was
          preached from the beginning; from whom also He has brought down
          liberty to those who, in a lawful manner, and with a willing mind, and
          with all the heart, do Him service; whereas to scoffers, and to those
          not subject to God, but who follow outward purifications for the
          praise of men (which observances had been given as a type of future
          things, -- the law typifying, as it were, certain things in a shadow,
          and delineating eternal things by temporal, celestial by terrestrial),
          and to those who pretend that they do themselves observe more than
          what has been prescribed, as if preferring their own zeal to God
          Himself, while within they are full of hypocrisy, and covetousness,
          and all wickedness, -- [to such] has He assigned everlasting perdition
          by cutting them off from life.<br />
