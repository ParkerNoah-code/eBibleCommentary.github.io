          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician</b>. Therefore not written for private
          meditation only, but for the public service of song. Suitable for the
          loneliness of individual penitence, this matchless Psalm is equally
          well adapted for an assembly of the poor in spirit.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">A Psalm of David.</p></b> It is a marvel, but
        nevertheless a fact, that writers have been found to deny David's
        authorship of this Psalm, but their objections are frivolous, the Psalm
        is David like all over. It would be far easier to imitate Milton,
        Shakespeare, or Tennyson, than David. His style is altogether of his own
        kind, and it is as easily distinguished as the touch of Rafaelle or the
        coloring of Rubens.
        <p align="justify">
          "When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to
          Bathsheba." When the divine message had aroused his dormant conscience
          and made him see the greatness of his guilt, he wrote this Psalm.
          <i>He had forgotten his psalmody while he was indulging his flesh, </i
          >but he returned to his harp when his spiritual nature was awakened,
          and he poured out his song to the accompaniment of sighs and tears.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The great sin of David is not to be excused, but it is well to
          remember that his case has an exceptional collection of specialities
          in it. He was a man of very strong passions, a soldier, and an
          Oriental monarch having despotic power; no other king of his time
          would have felt any compunction for having acted as he did, and hence
          there were not around him those restraints of custom and association
          which, when broken through, render the offence the more monstrous. He
          never hints at any form of extenuation, nor do we mention these facts
          in order to apologize for his sin, which was detestable to the last
          degree; but for the warning of others, that they reflect that the
          licentiousness in themselves at this day might have even a graver
          guilt in it than in the erring King of Israel.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            When we remember his sin, let us dwell most upon his penitence, and
            upon the long series of chastisements which rendered the after part
            of his life such a mournful history.

          DIVISION. It will be simplest to note in the first twelve verses the
          penitent's confessions and plea for pardon, and then in the last seven
          his anticipatory gratitude, and the way in which he resolves to
          display it.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Have mercy upon me, O God.</p></b> He
        appeals at once to the mercy of God, even before he mentions his sin.<i>
          The sight of mercy is good for eyes that are sore with penitential
          weeping. Pardon of sin must ever be an act of pure mercy</i
        >, and therefore to that attribute the awakened sinner flies.
        <b> <p align="justify">According to your loving-kindness.</p></b> Act, O
        Lord, like yourself; give mercy like your mercy. Show mercy such as is
        congruous with your grace.

          "Great God, your nature has no bound,<br />
           So let your pardoning love be found."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a choice word is that of our English version, a rare compound of
          precious things: love and kindness sweetly blended in one,
          "loving-kindness."
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            According unto the multitude of your tender mercies.
          </p></b
        >
        Let your most loving compassions come to me, and make you your pardons
        such as these would suggest. Reveal all your gentlest attributes in my
        case, not only in their essence but in their abundance. Numberless have
        been your acts of goodness, and vast is your grace; let me be the object
        of your infinite mercy, and repeat it all in me. Make my one case an
        epitome of all your tender mercies. By every deed of grace to others I
        feel encouraged, and I pray you let me add another and a yet greater
        one, in my own person, to the long list of your compassions.
        <b> <p align="justify">Blot out my transgressions.</p></b> My revolts,
        my excesses, are all recorded against me; but, Lord, erase the lines.
        Draw your pen through the account. Obliterate the record, though now it
        seems engraved in the rock forever; many strokes of your mercy may be
        needed, to cut out the deep inscription, but then you have a multitude
        of mercies, and therefore, I beseech you, erase my sins.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. Wash me thoroughly.</p></b> It is not
        enough to blot out the sin; his person is defiled, and he gladly would
        be purified. He would have God himself cleanse him, for none but he
        could do it effectually. The washing must be thorough, it must be
        repeated, therefore he cries, "Multiply to wash me." The dye is in
        itself indelible, and I, the sinner, have lain long in it, until the
        crimson is ingrained; but, Lord, wash, and wash, and wash again, until
        the last stain is gone, and not a trace of my defilement is left.
        <p align="justify">
          The hypocrite is content if his <i>garments</i> are washed, but the
          true suppliant cries, "wash <i>me." The </i>careless soul is content
          with a nominal cleansing, but the truly awakened conscience desires a
          real and practical washing, and that of a most complete and efficient
          kind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. It is viewed as one great
          pollution, polluting the entire nature, and as all his own; as if
          nothing were so much his own as his sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The one sin against Bathsheba, served to show the psalmist the whole
          mountain of his iniquity, of which that foul deed was but one falling
          stone. He desires to be rid of the whole mass of his filthiness, which
          though once so little observed, had then become a hideous and haunting
          terror to his mind.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And cleanse me from my sin.</p></b> This is a
        more general expression; as if the psalmist said, "Lord, if washing will
        not do, try some other process; if water avails not, let fire, let
        anything be tried, so that I may but be purified.
        <i
          >Rid me of my sin by some means, by any means, by every means, only do
          purify me completely, and leave no guilt upon my soul</i
        >."

        <p align="justify">
          It is not the punishment he cries out against, but the sin. Many a
          murderer is more alarmed at the <i>gallows </i>than at the
          <i> murder </i>which brought him to it. The thief loves the plunder,
          though he fears the prison.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Not so David: he is sick of sin as sin;
          <i
            >his loudest outcries are against the evil of his transgression, and
            not against the painful consequences of it. </i
          >When we deal seriously with our sin, God will deal gently with us.
          When we hate what the Lord hates, he will soon make an end of it, to
          our joy and peace.

            Verse 3. For I acknowledge my transgressions.
          </p></b
        >
        Here he sees the plurality and immense number of his sins, and makes
        open declaration of them. He seems to say, I make a full confession of
        them. Not that this is my plea in seeking forgiveness, but it is a clear
        evidence that I need mercy, and am utterly unable to look to any other
        quarter for help. My pleading <i>guilty </i>has barred me from any
        appeal against the sentence of justice.
        <p align="justify">
          O Lord, I must cast myself on your mercy, refuse me not, I pray you.
          You have made me willing to confess. O follow up this work of grace
          with a full and free remission!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And my sin is ever before me.</p></b> My sin as a
        whole is never out of my mind; it continually oppresses my spirit. I lay
        it before you because it is ever before me. Lord, put it away both from
        you and me.
        <p align="justify">
          To an awakened conscience, pain on account of sin is not transient and
          occasional, but intense and permanent, and this is no sign of divine
          wrath, but rather a sure preface of abounding favor.
        </p>

            Verse 4. Against you, you only have I sinned.
          </p></b
        ><i> The virus of sin lies in its opposition to God</i>. The psalmist's
        sense of sin towards others, rather tended to increase the force of this
        feeling of sin against God. All his wrong-doing centered, culminated,
        and came to a climax, at the foot of the divine throne. To injure our
        fellow men is sin, mainly because in so doing we violate the law of God.
        The penitent's heart was so filled with a sense of the wrong done to the
        Lord himself, that all other confession was swallowed up in a
        broken-hearted acknowledgment of offence against him.
        <b> <p align="justify">And done this evil in your sight.</p></b> To
        commit treason in the very court of the king and before his eye, is
        impudence indeed.

        proceeded at once to condemn him and punish him for his crime. His own
        confession, and the judge's own witness of the whole transaction, places
        the transgression beyond all question or debate. The iniquity was
        indisputably committed, and was unquestionably a foul wrong, and
        therefore the course of justice was clear and beyond all controversy.

          <p align="justify">Verse 5. Behold, I was shaped in iniquity.</p></b

        He is thunderstruck at the discovery of his inbred sin, and proceeds to
        set it forth. This was not intended to justify himself, but it rather
        meant to complete the confession. It is as if he said: Not only have I
        sinned this once, but I am in my very nature a sinner. The fountain of
        my life is polluted as well as its streams. My birth tendencies are
        towards iniquity; I naturally lean to forbidden things. My is a
        constitutional disease, rendering my very person obnoxious to your
        wrath.
        <b> <p align="justify">And in sin did my mother conceive me.</p></b> He
        goes back to the earliest moment of his being, not to traduce his
        mother, but to acknowledge the deep tap roots of his sin.

          It is a wicked wresting of Scripture to deny that
          <i> original sin and natural depravity </i>are here taught. Surely men
          who cavil at this doctrine have need to be taught of the Holy Spirit
          what be the first principles of the faith.

        <p align="justify">
          David's mother was the Lord's handmaid, he was born in chaste wedlock,
          of a good father, and he was himself, "the man after God's own heart;"
          and yet his nature was as fallen as that of any other son of Adam, and
          there only needed the <i>occasion </i>for the manifesting of that sad
          fact.

        he discovers this truth, and how far he is from satisfying the divine
        demand.

        <p align="justify">

          The love of the heart, the mystery of its fall, and the way of its

          blessing to be able to believe that the Lord will "make us to know
          it." No one can teach our innermost nature but the Lord—only he can
          instruct us to profit. The Holy Spirit can write the law on our heart,
          and that is the sum of practical wisdom. He can put the fear of the
          Lord within, and that is the beginning of wisdom. He can reveal Christ
          in us, and he is essential wisdom. Such poor, foolish, disarranged

          blood sufficient, nay, all sufficient merit entirely to purge it away.

          Considering also the deep natural inbred corruption which David saw

          Yet, be it added, the faith is no more than the word warrants, than

          No stinted bliss awaits the forgiven one; he shall not only have a

          <i>preceptive </i>part of the word of God, which, having broken, and

          Doubtless this Psalm and the whole story of David, have produced for
