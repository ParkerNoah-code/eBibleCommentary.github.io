        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.207)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 1, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought
          me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. But to
          Israel he saith, all day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a
          disobedient and gainsaying people." -- Romans 10:20-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          DOUBTLESS THESE WORDS primarily refer to the casting away of the Jews,
          and to the choosing of the Gentiles. The Gentiles were a people who
          sought not after God, but lived in idolatry; nevertheless, Jehovah was
          pleased in these latter times to send the gospel of his grace to them:
          while the Jews who had long enjoyed the privileges of the Word of God,
          on account of their disobedience and rebellion were cast away. I
          believe, however, that while this is the primary object of the words
          of our text, yet, as Calvin says, the truth taught in the text is a
          type of a universal fact. As God did choose the people who knew him
          not, so hath he chosen, in the abundance of his grace, to manifest his
          salvation to men who are out of the way; while, on the other hand, the
          men who are lost, after having heard the Word, are lost because of
          their wilful sin; for God doth all the day long "stretch forth his
          hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
        </p>
        <p>
          The system of truth is not one straight line, but two. No man will
          ever get a right view of the gospel until he knows how to look at the
          two lines at once. I am taught in one book to believe that what I sow
          I shall reap: I am taught in another place, that "it is not of him
          that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy."
          I see in one place, God presiding over all in providence; and yet I
          see, and I cannot help seeing, that man acts as he pleases, and that
          God has left his actions to his own will, in a great measure. Now, if
          I were to declare that man was so free to act, that there was no
          presidence of God over his actions, I should be driven very near to
          Atheism; and if, on the other hand, I declare that God so overrules
          all things, as that man is not free enough to be responsible, I am
          driven at once into Antinomianism or fatalism. That God predestines,
          and that man is responsible, are two things that few can see. They are
          believed to be inconsistent and contradictory; but they are not. It is
          just the fault of our weak judgment. Two truths cannot be
          contradictory to each other. If, then, I find taught in one place that
          everything is fore-ordained, that is true; and if I find in another
          place that man is responsible for all his actions, that is true; and
          it is my folly that leads me to imagine that two truths can ever
          contradict each other. These two truths, I do not believe, can ever be
          welded into one upon any human anvil, but one they shall be in
          eternity: they are two lines that are so nearly parallel, that the
          mind that shall pursue them farthest, will never discover that they
          converge; but they do converge, and they will meet somewhere in
          eternity, close to the throne of God, whence all truth doth spring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this morning I am about to consider the two doctrines. In the
          20th verse, we have taught us the doctrines of sovereign grace -- "But
          Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me
          not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me." In the
          next verse, we have the doctrine of man's guilt in rejecting God. "To
          Israel he saith, all day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a
          disobedient and gainsaying people."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, DIVINE SOVEREIGNTY AS EXEMPLIFIED IN SALVATION. If any
          man be saved, he is saved by Divine grace, and by Divine grace alone;
          and the reason of his salvation is not to be found in him, but in God.
          We are not saved as the result of anything that we do or that we will;
          but we will and do as the result of God's good pleasure, and the work
          of his grace in our hearts. No sinner can prevent God; that is, he
          cannot go before him, cannot anticipate him; God is always first in
          the matter of salvation. He is before our convictions, before our
          desires, before our fears, before our hopes. All that is good or ever
          will be good in us, is preceded by the grace of God, and is the effect
          of a Divine cause within.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in speaking of God's gracious acts of salvation, this morning, I
          notice first, that they are entirely unmerited. You will see that the
          people here mentioned certainly did not merit God's grace. They found
          him, but they never sought for him; he was made manifest to them, but
          they never asked for him. There never was a man saved yet who merited
          it. Ask all the saints of God, and they will tell you that their
          former life was spent in the lusts of the flesh; that in the days of
          their ignorance, they revolted against God and turned back from his
          ways, that when they were invited to come to him they despised the
          invitation, and, when warned, cast the warning behind their back. They
          will tell you that their being drawn by God, was not the result of any
          merit before conversion; for some of them, so far from having any
          merit, were the very vilest of the vile: they plunged into the very
          kennel of sin; they were not ashamed of all the things of which it
          would be a shame for us to speak; they were ringleaders in crime, very
          princes in the ranks of the enemy; and yet sovereign grace came to
          them, and they were brought to know the Lord. They will tell you that
          it was not the result of anything good in their disposition, for
          although they trust that there is now something excellent implanted in
          them, yet in the days of their flesh they could see no one quality
          which was not perverted to the service of Satan. Ask them whether they
          think they were chosen of God because of their courage; they will tell
          you, no; if they had courage it was defaced, for they were courageous
          to do evil. Question them whether they were chosen of God because of
          their talent; they will tell you, no; they had that talent, but they
          prostituted it to the service of Satan. Question them whether they
          were chosen because of the openness and generosity of their
          disposition; they will tell you that that very openness of temper, and
          that very generosity of disposition, led them to plunge deeper into
          the depths of sin, than they otherwise would have done, for they were
          "hail fellow, well met," with every evil man, and ready to drink and
          join every jovial party which should come in their way. There was in
          them no reason whatever why God should have mercy upon them, and the
          wonder to them is that he did not cut them down in the midst of their
          sins, blot out their names from the book of life, and sweep them into
          the gulf where the fire burneth. that shall devour the wicked. But
          some have said that God chooses his people because he foresees that
          after he chooses them, they will do this, that, and the other, which
          shall be meritorious and excellent. Refer again to the people of God,
          and they will tell you that since their conversion they have had much
          to weep over. Although they can rejoice that God has begun the good
          work in them, they often tremble lest it should not be God's work at
          all. They will tell you that if they are abundant in faith yet there
          are times when they are superabundant in unbelief; that if sometimes
          they are full of works of holiness, yet there are times when they weep
          many tears to think that those very acts of holiness were stained with
          sin. The Christian will tell you that he weeps over his very tears; he
          feels that there is filth even in the best of desires; that he has to
          pray to God to forgive his prayers, for there is sin in the midst of
          his supplications, and that he has to sprinkle even his best offerings
          with the atoning blood, for he never else can bring an offering
          without spot or blemish. You shall appeal to the brightest saint, to
          the man whose presence in the midst of society is like the presence of
          an angel, and he will tell you that he is still ashamed of himself.
          "Ah!" he will say, "you may praise me, but I cannot praise myself, you
          speak well of me, you applaud me, but if you knew my heart you would
          see abundant reason to think of me as a poor sinner saved by grace,
          who hath nothing whereof to glory, and must bow his head and confess
          his iniquities in the sight of God." Grace, then is entirely
          unmerited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the grace of God is sovereign. By that word we mean that God
          has an absolute right to give that grace where he chooses, and to
          withhold it when he pleases. He is not bound to give it to any man,
          much less to all men; and if he chooses to give it to one man and not
          to another, his answer is, "Is thine eye evil because mine eye is
          good? Can I not do as I will with mine own? I will have mercy on whom
          I will have mercy." Now, I want you to notice the sovereignty of
          Divine grace as illustrated in the text: "I was found of them that
          sought me not, I was made manifest to them that asked not after thee."
          You would imagine that if God gave his grace to any he would wait
          until he found them earnestly seeking him. You would imagine that God
          in the highest heavens would say, "I have mercies, but I will leave
          men alone, and when they feel their need of these mercies and seek me
          diligently with their whole heart, day and night, with tears, and
          vows, and supplications, then will I bless them, but not before." But,
          beloved, God saith no such thing. It is true he doth bless them that
          cry unto him, but he blesses them before they cry, for their cries are
          not their own cries, but cries which he has put into their lips; their
          desires are not of their own growth, but desires which he has cast
          like good seed into the soil of their hearts. God saves the men that
          do not seek him. Oh, wonder of wonders! It is mercy indeed when God
          saves a seeker; but how much greater mercy when he seeks the lost
          himself! Mark the parable of Jesus Christ concerning the lost sheep;
          it does not run thus: "A certain man had a hundred sheep, and one of
          them did go astray. And he tarried at home, and lo, the sheep came
          back, and he received it joyfully and said to his friends, rejoice,
          for the sheep that I have lost is come back." No; he went after the
          sheep: it never would have come after him; it would have wandered
          farther and farther away. He went after it; over hills of difficulty,
          down valleys of despondency he pursued its wandering feet, and at last
          he laid hold of it; he did not drive it before him, he did not lead
          it, but he carried it himself all the way, and when he brought it home
          he did not say, the sheep is come back," but, "I have found the sheep
          which was lost." Men do not seek God first; God seeks them first; and
          if any of you are seeking him to-day it is because he has first sought
          you. If you are desiring him he desired you first, and your good
          desires and earnest seeking will not be the cause of your salvation,
          but the effects of previous grace given to you. "Well," says another,
          "I should have thought that although the Saviour might not require an
          earnest seeking and sighing and groaning, and a continuous searching,
          after him, yet certainly he would have desired and demanded that every
          man, before he had grace, should ask for it." That, indeed, beloved,
          seems natural, and God will give grace to them that ask for it; but
          mark, the text says that he was manifested "to them that asked not for
          him." That is to say, before we ask, God gives us grace. The only
          reason why any man ever begins to pray is because God has put previous
          grace in his heart which leads him to pray. I remember, when I was
          converted to God, I was an Arminian thoroughly. I thought I had begun
          the good work myself, and I used sometimes to sit down and think,
          "Well, I sought the Lord four years before I found him," and I think I
          began to compliment myself upon the fact that I had perseveringly
          entreated of him in the midst of much discouragement. But one day the
          thought struck me, "How was it you came to seek God?" and in an
          instant the answer came from my soul, "Why, because he led me to do
          it; he must first have shown me my need of him, or else I should never
          have sought him; he must have shown me his preciousness, or I never
          should have thought him worth seeking;" and at once I saw the
          doctrines of grace as clear as possible. God must begin. Nature can
          never rise above itself. You put water into a reservoir, and it will
          rise as high as that, but no higher if let alone. Now, it is not in
          human nature to seek the Lord. Human nature is depraved, and
          therefore, there must be the extraordinary pressure of the Holy Spirit
          put upon the heart to lead us first to ask for mercy. But mark, we do
          not know an thing about that, while the Spirit is operating; we find
          that out afterwards. We ask as much as if we were asking all of
          ourselves. Our business is to seek the Lord as if there were no Holy
          Spirit at all. But although we do not know it, there must always be a
          previous motion of the Spirit in our heart, before there will be a
          motion of our heart towards him.
        </p>
        <p>"No sinner can be beforehand with thee,</p>
        <p>Thy grace is most sovereign, most rich, and most free."</p>
        <p>
          Let me give you an illustration. You see that man on his horse
          surrounded by a body of troopers. How proud he is, and how he reins up
          his horse with conscious dignity. Sir, what have you got there? What
          are those despatches you treasure up with so much care? "Oh, sir, I
          have that in my hand that will vex the church of God in Damascus. I
          have dragged the fellows into the synagogue, both men and women; I
          have scourged them, and compelled them to blaspheme; and I have this
          commission from the high priest to drag them to Jerusalem, that I may
          put them to death." Saul! Saul! have you no love for Christ? "Love to
          him! No. When they stoned Stephen, I took care of the witnesses'
          clothes, and I rejoiced to do it. I wish I had had the crucifying of
          their Master, for I hate them with perfect hatred, and I breathe out
          threatenings and slaughter against them." What do you say of this man?
          If he be saved, will you not grant that it must be some Divine
          sovereignty that converts him? Look at poor Pilate, how much there was
          that was hopeful in him. He was willing to save the Master, but he
          feared and trembled. If we had had our choice, we should have said,
          "Lord, save Pilate, he does not want to kill Christ, he labours to let
          him escape; but slay the bloodthirsty Saul, he is, the very chief of
          sinners." "No," says God, "I will do as I will with mine own." The
          heavens open, and the brightness of glory descends -- brighter than
          the noon-day sun. Stunned with the light he falls to the ground, and a
          voice is heard addressing him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
          it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." He rises up; God
          appears to him: "Lo, I have made thee a chosen vessel to bear my name
          among the Gentiles." Is not that sovereignty -- sovereign grace,
          without any previous seeking? God was found of him that sought not for
          him; he manifested himself to one that asked him not. Some will say,
          that was it miracle; but it is one that is repeated every day in the
          week. I knew a man once, who had not been to the house of God for a
          long time; and one Sunday morning, having been to market to buy a pair
          of ducks for his Sunday dinner, he happened to see a house of God
          opened as he was passing by. "Well," he thought, "I will hear what
          these fellows are up to." He went inside; the hymn that was being sung
          struck his attention; he listened to the sermon, forgot his ducks,
          discovered his own character, went home, and threw himself upon his
          knees before God, and after a short time it pleased God to give him
          joy and peace in believing. That man had nothing in him to begin with,
          nothing that could have led you to imagine he ever would be saved, but
          simply because God would have it so, he struck the effectual blow of
          grace, and the man was brought to himself. But we are, each of us who
          are saved, the very people who are the best illustrations of the
          matter. To this day, my wonder is, that ever the Lord should have
          chosen thee. I cannot make it out; and my only answer to the question
          is, "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have now, I think, stated the doctrine pretty plainly. Let me only
          say a few words about it. Some people are very much afraid of this
          truth. They say, "It is true, I dare say, but still you ought not to
          preach it before a mixed assembly; it is very well for the comfort of
          God's people, but it is to be very carefully handled, and not to be
          publicly preached upon." Very well, sir, I leave you to settle that
          matter with my Master. He gave me this great book to preach from, and
          I cannot preach from anything else. If he has put anything in it you
          think is not fit, go and complain to him, and not to me. I am simply
          his servant, and if his errand that I am to tell is objectionable, I
          cannot help it. If I send my servant to the door with a message, and
          he delivers it faithfully, he does not deserve to be scolded. Let me
          have the blame, not the servant. So I say; blame my Master, and not
          me, for I do but proclaim his message. "No," says one, "it is not to
          be preached." But it is to be preached. Every word of God is given by
          inspiration, and it is profitable for some good end. Does not the
          Bible say so? Let me tell you, the reason why many of our churches are
          declining is just because this doctrine has not been preached.
          Wherever this doctrine has been upheld. it has always been "Down with
          Popery." The first reformers held this doctrine and preached it. Well
          said it Church of England divine to some who railed at him, "Look at
          your own Luther. Do you not consider him to be the teacher of the
          Church of England? What Calvin and the other reformers taught is to be
          found in his book upon the freedom of the will." Besides, we can point
          you to a string of ministers from the beginning even until now. Talk
          of apostolic succession! The man who preaches the doctrines of grace
          has an apostolic succession indeed. Can we not trace our pedigree
          through a whole line of men like Newton, and Whitfield, and Owen, and
          Bunyan, straight away on till we come to Calvin, Luther, and Zwingle;
          and then we can go back from them to Savonarola, to Jerome of Prague,
          to Huss, and then back to Augustine, the mighty preacher of
          Christianity; and from St. Augustine to Paul is but one step. We need
          not be ashamed of our pedigree; although Calvinists are now considered
          to be heterodox, we are and ever must be orthodox. It is the old
          doctrine. Go and buy any puritanical book, and see if you can find
          Arminianism in it. Search all the book stalls over, and see if you can
          find one large folio book of olden times that anything in it but the
          doctrine of the free grace of God. Let this once be brought to bear
          upon the minds of men, and away go the doctrines of penance and
          confession, away goes paying for the pardon of your sin. If grace be
          free and sovereign in the hand of God, down goes the doctrine of
          priestcraft, away go buying and selling indulgences and such like
          things; they are swept to the four winds of heaven, and the efficacy
          of good works is dashed in pieces like Dagon before the ark of the
          Lord. "Well," says one, "I like the doctrine; still there are very few
          that preach it, and those that do are very high." Very likely; but I
          care little what anybody calls me. It signifies very little what men
          call you. Suppose they call you a "hyper," that does not make you
          anything wicked, does it? Suppose they call you an Antinomian, that
          will not make you one. I must confess, however, that there are some
          men who preach this doctrine who are doing ten thousand times more
          harm than good, because they don't preach the next doctrine I am going
          to proclaim, which is just as true. They have this to be the sail. but
          they have not the other to be the ballast. They can preach one side
          but not the other. They can go along with the high doctrine, but they
          will not preach the whole of the Word. Such men caricature the Word of
          God. And just let me say here, that it is the custom of a certain body
          of Ultra-Calvinists, to call those of us who teach that it is the duty
          of man to repent and believe, "Mongrel Calvinists." If you hear any of
          them say so, give them my most respectful compliments, and ask them
          whether they ever read Calvin's works in their lives. Not that I care
          what Calvin said or did not say; but ask them whether they, ever read
          his works; and if they say "No," as they must say, for there are
          forty-eight large voluines, you can tell them, that the man whom they
          call "a Mongrel Calvinist," though he has not read them all, has read
          a very good share of them, and knows their spirit; and he knows that
          he preaches substantially what Calvin preached -- that every doctrine
          he preaches may be found in Calvin's Commentaries on some part of
          Scripture or other. We are TRUE Calvinists, however. Calvin is nobody
          to us. Jesus Christ and him crucified, and the old fashioned Bible,
          are our standards. Beloved, let us take God's Word as it stands. If we
          find high doctrine there, let it be high; if we find low doctrine, let
          it be low; let us set up no other standard than the Bible affords.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now then for the second point. "There now," says my ultra friend,
          "he is going to contradict himself." No, my friend, I am not, I am
          only going to contradict you. The second point is MAN'S
          RESPONSIBILITY. "But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched
          forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people." Now, these
          people whom God had cast away had been wooed, had been sought, had
          been entreated to be saved; but they would not, and inasmuch as they
          were not saved, it was the effect of their disobedience and their
          gainsaying. That lies clearly enough in the text. When God sent the
          prophets to Israel, and stretched forth his hands, what was it for?
          What did he wish, thein to come to him for? Why, to be saved. "No,"
          says one, "it was for temporal mercies." Not so, my friend; the verse
          before is concerning spiritual mercies, and so is this one, for they
          refer to the same thing. Now, was God sincere in his offer? God
          forgive the man that dares to say he was not. God is undoubtedly
          sincere in every act he did. He sent his prophets, he entreated the
          people of Israel to lay hold on spiritual things, but they would not,
          and though he stretched out his hands all the day long, yet they were
          "a disobedient and gainsaying people," and would not have his love;
          and on their head rests their blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me notice the wooing of God and of what sort it is. First, it
          was the most affectionate wooing in the world. Lost sinners who sit
          under the sound of the gospel are not lost for the want of the most
          affectionate invitation. God says he stretched out his hands. You know
          what that means. You have seen the child who is disobedient and will
          not come to his father. The father puts out his hands, and says,
          "Come, my child, come; I am ready to forgive you." The tear is in his
          eye, and his bowels move with compassion, and he says, "Come, come."
          God says this is what he did -- "he stretched out his hands." That is
          what he has done to some of you. You that are not saved to-day are
          without excuse, for God stretched out his hands to you, and he said,
          "Come, come." Long have you sat beneath the sound of the ministry, and
          it has been a faithful one, I trust, and a weeping one. Your minister
          has not forgotten to pray for your souls in secret or to weep over you
          when no eye saw him, and he has endeavoured to persuade you as an
          ambassador from God. God is my witness, I have sometimes stood in this
          pulpit, and I could not have pleaded harder for my own life than I
          have pleaded with you. In Christ's name, I have cried, "Come unto me
          all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." I
          have wept over you as the Saviour did, and used his words on his
          behalf, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy
          children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and
          ye would not." And you know that your conscience has often been
          touched; you have often been moved; you could not resist it. God was
          so kind to you; he invited you so affectionately by the Word; he dealt
          so gently with you by his providence; his hands were stretched out,
          and you could hear his voice speaking in your ears, "Come unto me,
          come: come now, let us reason together; though your sins be as scarlet
          they shall be as wool; though they be red like crimson they shall be
          whiter than snow." You have heard him cry, "Ho every one that
          thirsteth, come ye to the waters." You have heard him say with all the
          affection of a father's heart, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and
          the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord, and
          he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly
          pardon." Oh! God does plead with men that they would be saved, and
          this day he says to every one of you, "Repent, and be converted for
          the remission of your sins. Turn ye unto me. Thus saith the Lord of
          hosts; consider your ways." And with love divine he woos you as a
          father woos his child, putting out his hands and crying, "Come unto
          me, come unto me." "No," says one strong-doctrine man, "God never
          invites all men to himself; he invites none but certain characters."
          Stop, sir, that is all you know about it. Did you ever read that
          parable where it is said, My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all
          things are ready; come unto the marriage." And they that were bidden
          would not come. And did you never read that they all began to make
          excuse, and that they were punished because they did not accept the
          invitations. Now, if the invitation is not to be made to anybody, but
          to the man who will accept it, how can that parable be true? The fact
          is, the oxen and fatlings are killed; the wedding feast is ready, and
          the trumpet sounds, "Ho every one that thirsteth, come and eat, come
          and drink." Here are the provisions spread, here is an
          all-sufficiency; the invitation is free; it is a great invitation.
          "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely."
          And that invitation is couched in tender words, "Come to me, my child,
          come to me." "All day long I have stretched forth my hands."
        </p>
        <p>
          And note again, this invitation was very frequent. The words, "all the
          day long," may be translated "daily" -- "Daily have I stretched forth
          my hands." Sinner, God has not called you once to come, and then let
          you alone, but every day has he been at you; every day has conscience
          spoken to you; every day has providence warned you, and every Sabbath
          has the Word of God wooed you. Oh! how much some of you will have to
          account for at God's great bar! I cannot now read your characters, but
          I know there are some of you who will have a terrible account at last.
          All the day long has God been wooing you. From the first dawn of your
          life, he wooed you through your mother, and she used to put your
          little hands together, and teach you to say,
        </p>
        <p>"Gentle Jesus meek and mild,</p>
        <p>Look upon a little child,</p>
        <p>Pity my simplicity;</p>
        <p>Suffer me to come to thee."</p>
        <p>
          And in your boyhood God was still stretching out his hands after you.
          How your Sunday-school teacher endeavoured to bring you to the
          Saviour! How often your youthful heart was affected; but you put all
          that away, and you are still untouched by it. How often did your
          mother speak to you, and your father warn you; and you have forgotten
          the prayer in that bed-room when you were sick, when your mother
          kissed your burning forehead, knelt down and prayed to God to spare
          your life, and then added that prayer, "Lord, save my boy's soul!" And
          you recollect the Bible she gave you, when you first went out
          apprentice, and the prayer she wrote on that yellow front leaf. When
          she gave it, you did not perhaps know, but you may now; how earnestly
          she longed after you, that you might be formed anew in Christ Jesus;
          how she followed you with her prayers, and how she entreated with her
          God for you. And you have not yet surely forgotten how many Sabbaths
          you have spent, and how many times you have been warned. Why you have
          had waggon-loads of sermons wasted on you. A hundred and four sermons
          you have heard every year, and some of you more, and yet you are still
          just what you were.
        </p>
        <p>
          But sinners, sermon hearing is an awful thing unless it is blessed to
          our souls. If God has kept on stretching out his hands every day and
          all the day, it will be a hard thing for you when you shall be justly
          condemned not only for your breaches of the law, but for your wilful
          rejection of the gospel. It is probable that God will keep on
          stretching out his hands to you until your hairs grow grey, still
          continually inviting you: and perhaps when you are nearing death he
          will still say, "Come unto me, come unto me." But if you still persist
          in hardening your heart, if still you reject Christ, I beseech you let
          nothing make you imagine that you shall go unpunished. Oh! I do
          tremble sometimes when I think of that class of ministers who tell
          sinners that they are not guilty if they do not seek the Saviour. How
          they shall be found innocent at God's great day I do not know. It
          seems to be a fearful thing that they should be lulling poor souls
          into sleep by telling them it is not their duty to seek Christ and
          repent, but that they may do as they like about that, and that when
          they perish they will be none the more guilty for having heard the
          Word. My Master did not say that. Remember how he said, "And thou,
          Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to
          hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been
          done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto
          you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day
          of judgment, than for thee." Jesus did not talk thus when he spoke to
          Chorazin and Bethsaida; for he said, "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe
          unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you,
          had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in
          sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
          for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you." It was not
          the way Paul preached. He did not tell sinners that there was no guilt
          in despising the cross. Hear the apostle's words once more: "For if
          the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and
          disobedience received a just recompence of reward, how shall we
          escape, if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to
          be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard
          him." Sinner, at the great day of God thou must give an account for
          every warning thou hast ever had, for every time thou hast read thy
          Bible, ay, and for every time thou hast neglected to read it; for
          every Sunday when the house of God was open and thou didst neglect to
          avail thyself of the opportunity of hearing the Word, and for every
          time thou didst hear it and didst not improve it. Ye who are careless
          hearers, are tying faggots for your own burning for ever. Ye that hear
          and straightway forget, or hear with levity, are digging for
          yourselves a pit into which ye must be cast. Remember, no one will be
          responsible for your damnation but yourself, at the last great day.
          God will not be responsible for it. "As I live saith the Lord" -- and
          that is a great oath -- "I have no pleasure in the death of him that
          dieth. but had rather that he should turn unto me and live." God has
          done much for you. He sent you his Gospel. You are not born in a
          heathen land; he has given you the Book of Books; he has given you an
          enlightened conscience; and if you perish under the sound of the
          ministry, you perish more fearfully and terribly, than if you had
          perished anywhere else.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine is as much God's Word as the other. You ask me to
          reconcile the two. I answer, they do not want any reconcilement; I
          never tried to reconcile them to myself, because I could never see a
          discrepancy. If you begin to put fifty or sixty quibbles to me, I
          cannot give any answer. Both are true; no two truths can be
          inconsistent with each other; and what you have to do is to believe
          them both. With the first one, the saint has most to do. Let him
          praise the free and sovereign grace of God, and bless his name. With
          the second, the sinner has the most to do. O sinner, humble thyself
          under the mighty hand of God, when thou thinkest of how often he hath
          shown his love to thee, by bidding thee come to himself, and yet how
          often thou hast spurned his Word and refused his mercy, and turned a
          deaf ear to every invitation, and hast gone thy way to rebel against a
          God of love, and violate the commands of him that loved thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, how shall I conclude? My first exhortation shall be to
          Christian people. My dear friends, I beseech you do not in any way
          give yourselves lip to any system of faith apart from the Word of God.
          The Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants; I am
          the successor of the great and venerated Dr. Gill, whose theology is
          almost universally received among the stronger Calvinistic churches;
          but although I venerate his memory, and believe his teachings, yet he
          is not my Rabbi. What you find in God's Word is for you to believe and
          to receive. Never be frightened at a doctrine; and above all, never be
          frightened at a name. Some one said to me the other day, that he
          thought the truth lay somewhere between the two extremes. He meant
          right, but I think he was wrong, I do not think the truth lies between
          the two extremes, but in them both. I believe the higher a man goes
          the better, when he is preaching the matter of salvation. The reason
          why a man is saved is grace, grace, grace; and you may go as high as
          you like there. But when you come to the question as to why men are
          damned, then the Arminian is far more right than the Antinomian. I
          care not for any denomination or party, I am as high as Huntingdon
          upon the matter of salvation, but question me about damnation, and you
          will get a very different answer. By the grace of God I ask no man's
          applause, I preach the Bible as I find it. Where we get wrong is where
          the Calvinist begins to meddle with the question of damnation, and
          interferes with the justice of God; or when the Arminian denies the
          doctrine of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second exhortation is, -- Sinners, I beseech every one of you who
          are unconverted and ungodly, this morning to put away every form and
          fashion of excuse that the devil would have you make concerning your
          being unconverted. Remember, that all the teaching in the world can
          never excuse you for being enemies to God by wicked works. When we
          beseech you to be reconciled to him, it is because we know you will
          never be in your proper place until you are reconciled. God has made
          you; can it be right that you should disobey him? God feeds you every
          day: can it be right that you should still live in disobedience to
          him? Remember, when the heavens shall be on a blaze, when Christ shall
          come to judge the earth in righteousness and his people with equity,
          there will not be one excuse that you can make which will be valid at
          the last great day. If you should attempt to say, "Lord, I have never
          heard the word;" his answer would be, "Thou didst hear it; thou
          heardest it plainly." "But Lord, I had an evil will." "Out of thine
          own mouth will I condemn thee; thou hadst that evil will, and I
          condemn thee for it. This is the condemnation, that light is come into
          the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their
          deeds are evil." "But Lord," some will say, "I was not predestinated."
          "What hadst thou to do with that? Thou didst; do according to thine
          own will when thou didst rebel. Thou wouldest not come unto me, and
          now I destroy thee for ever. Thou hast broken my law -- on thine own
          head be the guilt." If a sinner could say at the great day, "Lord, I
          could not be saved anyhow his torment in hell would be mitigated by
          that thought: but this shall be the very edge of the sword, and the
          very burning of the fire" -- Ye knew your duty and ye did it not: ye
          trampled on everything that was holy; ye neglected the Saviour, and
          how shall ye escape if ye neglect so great salvation?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with regard to myself; you may some of you go away and say, that
          I was Antinomian in the first part of the sermon and Arminian at the
          end. I care not. I beg of you to search the Bible for yourselves. To
          the law and to the testimony; if I speak not according to this Word,
          it is because there is no light in me. I am willing to come to that
          test. Have nothing to do with me where I have nothing to do with
          Christ. Where I separate from the truth, cast my words away. But if
          what I say be God's teaching, I charge you, by him that sent me, give
          these things your thoughts, and turn unto the Lord with all your
          hearts.
