          This plaintive ode is one of the most charming compositions in the
          whole Book of Psalms for its poetic power. If it were not inspired, it
          would nevertheless occupy a high place in poesy, especially the former
          portion of it, which is tender and patriotic to the highest degree.

          In the later verses (7-9), we have utterances of burning indignation

          It is one thing to talk of the bitter feeling which moved captive
          Israelites in Babylon, and quite another thing to be captives

          The song is such as might fitly be sung in the Jews' wailing place. It
          is a fruit of the Captivity in Babylon, and often has it furnished

            Verse 1. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.
          </p></b
        >
        Water courses were abundant in Babylon, wherein were not only natural
        streams but artificial canals: it was a place of broad rivers and
        streams. Glad to be away from the noisy streets, the captives sought the
        river side, where
        <i>the flow of the waters seemed to be in sympathy with their tears</i>.

        <p align="justify">
          It was some slight comfort to be out of the crowd, and to have a
          little breathing room, and therefore they sat down, as if to rest a
          while and solace themselves in their sorrow. In little groups they sat
          down and made common lamentation, mingling their memories and their
          tears. The rivers were well enough, but, alas, they were the rivers of
          <i>Babylon</i>, and the ground whereon the sons of Israel sat was
          foreign soil, and therefore they wept.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who came to interrupt their quiet were citizens of the
          destroying city, and their company was not desired. Everything
          reminded Israel of her banishment from the holy city, her servitude
          beneath the shadow of the temple of Bel, her helplessness under a
          cruel enemy; and therefore her sons and daughters sat down in sorrow.
          Yes, we wept, <b>when we remembered Zion. </b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Nothing else could have subdued their brave spirits—but the
          remembrance of the temple of their God, the palace of their king, and
          the center of their national life, quite broke them down. Destruction
          had swept down all their delights, and therefore they wept—the strong
          men wept, the sweet singers wept! They did not weep when they
          remembered the cruelties of Babylon; the memory of fierce oppression
          dried their tears and made their hearts burn with wrath: but when the
          beloved city of their solemnities came into their minds they could not
          refrain from floods of tears.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Even thus do true believers mourn when they see the church despoiled,
          and find themselves unable to support her: we could bear anything
          better than this. In these our times the
          <i>Babylon of error </i> ravages the city of God, and the hearts of
          the faithful are grievously wounded as they see truth fallen in the
          streets, and unbelief rampant among the professed servants of the
          Lord. We bear our protests, but they appear to be in vain; the
          multitude are mad upon their idols. Be it ours to weep in secret for
          the hurt of our Zion. It is the least thing we can do; perhaps in its
          result it may prove to be the best thing we can do. Be it ours also to
          sit down and deeply consider what is to be done. Be it ours, in any
          case, to keep upon our mind and heart the memory of the church of God
          which is so dear to us. The frivolous may forget, but Zion is graven
          on our hearts, and her prosperity is our chief desire.

        >The drooping branches appeared to weep as we did, and so we gave to
        them our instruments of music; the willows could as well make melody as
        we, for we had no mind for minstrelsy. In the midst of the willows, or
        in the midst of the rivers, or in the midst of Babylon, it matters
        little which, they hung their harps aloft—those harps which once in
        Zion's halls the soul of music shed. Better to hang them up than to dash
        them down. Better to hang them on willows than profane them to the
        service of idols.

          Sad indeed is the child of sorrow when he grows weary of his harp,
          from which in better days he had been able to draw sweet solaces.

        It was ill to be a singer at all when it was demanded that this talent
        should go into bondage to an oppressor's will. Better be dumb than be
        forced to please an enemy with forced song.

        studied torture: the iron enters into the soul. It is indeed "woe to the
        conquered" when they are forced to sing to increase the triumph of their
        conquerors. Cruelty herein reached a refinement seldom thought of. We do
        not wonder that the captives sat down to weep when thus insulted.
        <b> <p align="justify">And our tormentors required of us mirth.</p></b>
        The captives must not only sing but smile, and add merriment to their
        music. Blind Samson in former days must be brought forth to make sport
        for Philistines, and now the Babylonians prove themselves to be loaves
        of the same leaven. Plundered, wounded, fettered, carried into captivity
        and poverty—yet must the people laugh as if it were all a play, and they
        must sport as if they felt no sorrow. This was wormwood and gall to the
        true lovers of God and his chosen land.
        <b> <p align="justify">Saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</p></b>
        Nothing would serve their turn but a holy hymn, and a tune sacred to the
        worship of Jehovah. Nothing will content the Babylonian mockers but one
        of Israel's Psalms when in her happiest days she sang unto the Lord
        whose mercy endures forever. This would make rare fun for their
        persecutors, who would deride their worship and ridicule their faith in
        Jehovah.
        <p align="justify">
          In this demand there was an insult to their God as well as a mockery
          of themselves, and this made it the more intensely cruel. Nothing
          could have been more malicious, nothing more productive of grief.
          These wanton persecutors had followed the captives into their
          retirement, and had remarked upon their sorrowful appearance, and
          there and then they bade the mourners make mirth for them. Could they
          not let the sufferers alone? Were the exiles to have no rest?

        <p align="justify">
          The daughter of Babylon seemed determined to fill up her cup of
          iniquity, by torturing the Lord's people. Those who had been the most
          active agents of Israel's undoing, must needs follow up their
          <i>ferocities </i>by <i>mockeries</i>. "The tender mercies of the
          wicked are cruel." Worse than the Egyptians, they asked not labor
          which their victims could have rendered, but they demanded mirth which
          they could not give, and holy songs which they dared not profane to
          such a purpose, sufferings of the weary and oppressed exiles by their
          mirth and their indecency.

          We are sorry to say that the resemblance still holds between the Jews
          in a state of captivity and the Christians in the state of their
          pilgrimage. We have also to sustain the mockery of the profane and the
          unthinking. Ridicule and disdain are often the fate of sincere piety
          in this world. Fashion and frivolity and false philosophy have made a
          formidable combination against us; and the same truth, the same
          honesty, the same integrity of principle, which in any other cause
          would be esteemed as manly and respectable, is despised and laughed at
          when attached to the cause of the gospel and its sublime
          interests.—Thomas Chalmers.

          If the men of Babylon were wicked enough to suggest the defiling of

        To sing Zion's songs for the pleasure of Zion's foes, would be to forget

        for the pronoun alters from "we" to "I." Individually the captives

        had sooner forget the are which drew music from his harp strings than
        use it for Babel's delectation. Better far that the right hand should
        forget its usual handicraft, and lose all its dexterity, than that it
        should fetch music for rebels out of the Lord's instruments, or
        accompany with sweet skill a holy Psalm desecrated into a common song
        for fools to laugh at.
