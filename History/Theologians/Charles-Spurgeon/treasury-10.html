          The prevailing theme seems to be the oppression and persecution of the
          wicked, we will, therefore, for our own guidance, entitle it, THE CRY
          OF THE OPPRESSED.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">DIVISION</p></b>. The first verse, in an
        exclamation of surprise, explains the intent of the Psalm, namely, to
        invoke the interposition of God for the deliverance of his poor and
        persecuted people.

        <p align="justify">
          From verse 2 to 11, the character of the oppressor is described in
          powerful language.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In verse 12, the cry of the first verse bursts forth again, but with a
          clearer utterance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the next place (verses 13-15), God's eye is clearly beheld as
          regarding all the cruel deeds of the wicked; and as a consequence of
          divine omniscience, the ultimate judgment of the oppressed is joyously
          anticipated (verses 16-18).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To the Church of God during times of persecution, and to individual
          saints who are smarting under the hand of the proud sinner — this
          Psalm furnishes suitable language both for prayer and praise.

        <i
          >"Why do You stand afar off, O LORD? Why do You hide in times of
          trouble?"
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          To the tearful eye of the sufferer, the Lord seemed to stand still, as
          if he calmly looked on, and did not sympathize with his afflicted one.
          Nay, more, the Lord appeared to be afar off, no longer "a very present
          help in trouble," but an inaccessible mountain, into which no man
          would be able to climb.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The presence of God is the joy of his people, but any suspicion of his
          absence is distracting beyond measure. Let us, then, ever remember
          that the Lord is near us. The <i>refiner </i>is never far from the
          mouth of the furnace when his gold is in the fire — and the Son of God
          is always walking in the midst of the flames when his holy children
          are cast into them. Yet he who knows the frailty of man will little
          wonder that when we are sharply exercised, we find it hard to bear the
          apparent neglect of the Lord when he forbears to work our deliverance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Why do You hide in times of trouble?" It is not the trouble, but the
          hiding of our Father's face, which cuts us to the quick. When trial
          and desertion come together, we are in as perilous a plight as Paul,
          when his ship fell into a place where two seas met (Acts 27:41). It is
          but little wonder if we are like the vessel which ran aground, and the
          fore-part stuck fast, and remained unmovable, while the hinder part
          was broken by the violence of the waves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When our sun is eclipsed, it is dark indeed. If we need an answer to
          the question, "Why do You hide yourself?" it is to be found in the
          fact that there is a "needs-be," not only for trial, but for heaviness
          of heart under trial (1 Peter 1:6) But how could this be the case, if
          the Lord should shine upon us while he is afflicting us? Should the
          parent <i> comfort </i>his child while he is <i>correcting </i>him —
          where would be the use of the chastening? A smiling face and a rod are
          not fit companions. God bares the back, that the blow may be
          <i>felt</i>; for it is only <i>felt affliction </i>which can become
          blessed affliction. If we were carried in the arms of God over every
          stream — then where would be the <i>trial</i>, and where would be the
          <i>experience</i> — which trouble is meant to teach us?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?" The answer to this is
          not far to seek, for if the Lord did not hide himself it would not be
          a time of trouble at all. As well ask why the sun does not shine at
          night, when for certain there could be no night if he did. It is
          essential to our thorough chastisement, that the Father should
          withdraw his smile. There is a needs be not only for manifold
          temptations, but that we be in heaviness through them. The design of
          the <i>rod </i>is only answered by making us smart. If there is no
          pain — there will be no profit. If there is no hiding of God — there
          will be no bitterness, and consequently no purging efficacy in his
          chastisements.

        >The second verse contains the formal indictment against the wicked:
        <i>"The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor." </i>The accusation
        divides itself into two distinct charges — <i> pride</i> and
        <i>tyranny</i>; the one is the root and cause of the other.

        <p align="justify">
          The second sentence is the humble petition of the oppressed:<i>
            "Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined." </i
          >The prayer is reasonable, just, and natural. Even our enemies
          themselves being judges, it is but right that men should be done by —
          as they wished to do to others. We only weigh you in your own scales,
          and measure your grain with your own bushel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Terrible shall be your day, O persecuting Babylon! when you shall be
          made to drink of the wine cup which you yourself have filled to the
          brim with the blood of saints! There are none who will dispute the
          justice of God, when he shall hang every Haman on his own gallows —
          and cast all the enemies of his Daniels into their own den of lions!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That famous persecutor, Domitian, like others of the Roman emperors,
          assumed divine honors, and heated the furnace seven times hotter
          against Christians because they refused to worship his image. In like
          manner, when the popes of Rome became decorated with the blasphemous
          titles of Masters of the World, and, Universal Fathers — they let
          loose their blood-hounds upon the faithful. Pride is the egg of
          persecution.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Pride," is a vice which cleaves so fast unto the hearts of men, that
          if we were to strip ourselves of all faults one by one, we would
          undoubtedly find pride the very last and hardest to put off.

        The <i>indictment </i>being read, and the <i>petition </i>presented, the
        <i>evidence </i>is now heard upon the first count. The evidence is very
        full and conclusive upon the matter of <i> pride</i> — and no jury could
        hesitate to give a verdict against the prisoner at the bar. Let us,
        however, hear the witnesses one by one.
        <p align="justify">
          The first testifies that he is a <i>boaster</i>.<i>
            "For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire." </i
          >He is a very <i>silly </i> boaster, for he glories in a mere
          desire.<i> </i>He is a very <i> brazen-faced </i>boaster, for that
          desire is villainy. He is a most <i> abandoned </i>sinner, to boast of
          that which is his shame. Bragging sinners are the worst and most
          contemptible of men, especially when their filthy desires — too filthy
          to be carried into act — become the theme of their boastings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When <i>Mr. Hate-Good </i>and <i>Mr. Heady </i>are joined in
          partnership — they drive a brisk trade in the devil's wares. This one
          proof is enough to condemn the prisoner at the bar. Take him away,
          jailor!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But stay, another witness desires to be sworn and heard. This time,
          the impudence of the proud rebel is even more apparent; for
          <i> "he blesses the covetous, whom the Lord abhors." </i>This is
          <i>insolence</i>, which is pride unmasked. He is haughty enough to
          differ from the Judge of all the earth, and bless the men whom God has
          cursed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          So did the sinful generation in the days of Malachi, who called the
          proud happy, and set up those who worked wickedness (Malachi 3:15).
          These base pretenders would dispute with their Maker; they would —
        </p>
        <p align="justify">"Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,</p>
        <p align="justify">Re-judge his justice, be the God of God."</p>
        <p align="justify">
          How often have we heard the wicked man speaking in terms of the
          <i>honor </i>of the covetous, the grinder of the poor, and the sharp
          dealer! Our old proverb has it —
        </p>
        <p align="justify">"I know well how the world wags;</p>
        <p align="justify">He is most loved, who has most bags."</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Pride meets covetousness — and compliments it as wise, thrifty, and
          prudent. We say it with sorrow, there are many professors of religion
          who esteem a rich man, and flatter him, even though they know that he
          has fattened himself upon the flesh and blood of the poor!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The only sinners who are received as <i>respectable</i>, are
          <i>covetous </i>men. If a man is a fornicator, or a drunkard — we put
          him out of the church; but who ever read of church discipline against
          that idolatrous wretch — the <i>covetous </i>man? Let us tremble, lest
          we be found to be partakers of this atrocious sin of pride, "blessing
          the covetous, whom Jehovah abhors."

        The proud boastings and lewd blessings of the wicked have been received
        in evidence against him, and now his own face confirms the accusation,
        and his empty closet cries aloud against him.
        <i
          >"The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek
          after God."
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Proud <i>hearts </i>breed proud <i>looks </i>and stiff <i> knees</i>.
          It is an admirable arrangement that the <i>heart </i>is often written
          on the <i>countenance</i>, just as the motion of the wheels of a clock
          find their record on its face. A <i>brazen face </i>and a
          <i>broken heart </i>never go together. We are not quite sure that the
          Athenians were wise when they ordained that men should be tried in the
          dark, lest their countenances should weigh with the judges; for there
          is much more to be learned from the motions of the muscles of the
          face, than from the words of the lips. Honesty shines in the face —
          but villainy peeps out at the eyes!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          See the effect of pride — it kept the man from seeking God. It is hard
          to pray with a <i>stiff neck </i>and an
          <i>unbending knee. "God is not in all his thoughts!" </i>He thought
          much, but he had no thoughts for God. Amid heaps of chaff — there was
          not a grain of wheat. The only place where God is not — is in the
          thoughts of the wicked. This is a damning accusation — for where the
          God of Heaven is not, the<i> Lord of Hell </i>is reigning and raging;
          and if God is not in our thoughts — then our thoughts will bring us to
          eternal perdition.

          Verse 4. "In his pride, the wicked does not seek him. In all his
          thoughts, there is no room for God." Psalm 10:4
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after
          God."

        <p align="justify">
          "The pride of the wicked is the principal reason why they will not
          seek after the knowledge of God. This knowledge it prevents them from
          seeking in various ways. In the first place, it renders God a
          disagreeable object of contemplation to the wicked, and a knowledge of
          him as undesirable. Pride consists in an unduly exalted opinion of
          one's <i>self</i>. It is, therefore, impatient of a rival, hates a
          superior, and cannot endure a master. In proportion as it prevails in
          the heart — it makes us wish to see nothing above us, to acknowledge
          no law but our own wills, to follow no rule but our own inclinations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Thus it led Satan to rebel against his Creator, and our first parents
          to desire to be as gods. Since such are the effects of pride, it is
          evident that nothing can be more painful to a proud heart than the
          thoughts of such a being as God — one who is infinitely powerful,
          just, and holy — who can neither be resisted, deceived, nor deluded —
          who disposes, according to his own sovereign pleasure, of all
          creatures and events — and who, in an especial manner, hates pride,
          and is determined to abase and punish it. Such a being pride can
          contemplate only with feelings of dread, aversion, and abhorrence. It
          must look upon him as its natural enemy, the great enemy, whom it has
          to fear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "But the knowledge of God directly tends to bring this infinite,
          irresistible, irreconcilable enemy full to the view of the proud man.
          It teaches him that he has a superior, a master, from whose
          <i> authority </i>he cannot escape, whose <i>power </i>he cannot
          resist, and whose <i>will </i>he must obey — or be crushed before him,
          and be rendered miserable forever. It shows him what he hates to see,
          that, in despite of his opposition, God's counsel shall stand, that he
          will do all his pleasure, and that in all things wherein men deal
          proudly, God is above them.

          hence they hate that knowledge of God which teaches these truths, and
          will not seek it. On the contrary, they wish to remain ignorant of
          such a being, and to banish all thoughts of him from their minds. With
          this view, they neglect, pervert, or explain away those passages of
          revelation which describe God's true character, and endeavor to
          believe that he is altogether such a one as themselves.

          own object — does pride appear! By attempting to soar — it only
          plunges itself in the mire; and while endeavoring to erect for itself
          a throne — it undermines the ground on which it stands and digs its

          favor, prevents us from resembling him, deprives us in this world of
          all the honor and happiness which communion with him would confer; and
          in the next world, unless previously hated, repented of, and
          renounced, will bar forever against us the door of Heaven, and close

        Because God does not immediately visit every sin with punishment —
        ungodly men do not see that in due time he judges all the earth. Human
        tribunals must of necessity, by promptness and publicity, commend
        themselves to the common judgment — but the Lord's modes of dealing with
        sin are sublimer and apparently more tardy, hence the
        <i>bat's eyes of godless men </i>cannot see them, and the
        <i>groveling wits </i>of ungodly men cannot comprehend them. If God sat
        in the gate of every village and held his court there, even fools might
        discern his righteousness — but they are not capable of perceiving that
        for a matter to be settled in the highest court, even in Heaven itself,
        is a far more solemn matter. Let believers take heed lest they fall in a
        degree into the same error, and begin to criticize the actions of The

        saying, "He cries, <i> 'Pooh! Pooh!'</i> at his enemies."

        The testimony of the sixth verse concludes the evidence against the
        prisoner upon the first charge of pride — and certainly it is conclusive
        in the highest degree. The present witness has been prying into the
        secret chambers of the heart, and has come to tell us what he has heard.

          How impudence runs to seed! The man thinks himself immutable, and
          omnipotent too — for <i>he </i>is never to be in adversity. He counts
          himself a privileged man. He sits alone — and shall see no sorrow. His

          self-confidence is a sorry bulwark. This is the ruin of fools, that
          when they succeed — they become too big, and swell with self-conceit,
          as if their summer would last forever, and their flowers bloom on

          The second crime is now to be proved. The fact that the man is proud

          cruel. <i>Haman's </i>pride was the father of a cruel design to murder
          all the Jews. <i>Nebuchadnezzar </i>builds an idol, and in pride he
          commands all men to bow before it — and then he cruelly stands ready
          to heat the furnace seven times hotter for those who will not yield to
          his imperious will. Every <i>proud </i>thought is twin brother to a
          cruel <i>thought</i>. He who exalts himself will despise others — and

        Pompey, when he had in vain assaulted a city, and could not take it by

          fruit of his pains is served into Nimrod's table. Indeed, a money-man
          may not be damnified, but he may be damned. For this is a crying sin,
          and the wakened ears of the Lord will hear it, neither shall his
          provoked hands forbear it. If the poor should hold their peace, the

          to devour it. Now, if these should prosecute wolves, foxes, etc., they
          should then hunt their own kind. But though they are <i>men </i>they
          hunt, and by nature of the same kind, they are not so by quality, for
          they are <i>lambs </i>they persecute. In them there is blood, and
          flesh, and fleece to be had; and therefore on these do they gorge
          themselves. In them there is weak armor of defense against their
          cruelties; therefore over these they may domineer. I will speak it
          boldly: there is not a mighty Nimrod in this land that dares hunt his
          equal; but over his inferior lamb he insults like a young Nero. In the

          surely he will not punish." "He has said in his heart, God has

          rendered <i> justice </i>to the full, but not a grain of <i>mercy</i>.

          The Psalm ends with a song of thanksgiving to the great and
          everlasting King, because he has granted the desire of his humble and
          oppressed people, has defended the fatherless, and punished the
          heathen who trampled upon his poor and afflicted children. Let us
          learn that we are sure to speed well, if we carry our complaint to the
          King of kings. Rights will be vindicated, and wrongs redressed — at
          his throne. His government neglects not the interests of the needy —
          nor does it tolerate oppression in the mighty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Great God, we leave ourselves in your hand; to you we commit your
          church afresh. Arise, O God, and let the man of the earth — the
          creature of a day — be broken before the majesty of your power. Come,
          Lord Jesus, and glorify your people. Amen and Amen.
