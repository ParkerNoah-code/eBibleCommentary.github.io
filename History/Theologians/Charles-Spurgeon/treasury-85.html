              TITLE AND SUBJECT. A Psalm of Asaph. This poet of the temple here
              acts as a preacher to the court and to the magistracy. Men who do
              one thing well are generally equal to another; he who writes good
              verse is not unlikely to be able to preach. What preaching it
              would have been had Milton entered the pulpit, or had Virgil been
              an apostle.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Asaph's sermon before the judges is now before us. He speaks very
              plainly, and his song is rather characterized by strength than by
              sweetness. We have here a clear proof that all psalms and hymns
              need not be direct expressions of praise to God; we may, according
              to the example of this psalm, admonish one another in our songs.
              Asaph no doubt saw around him much bribery and corruption, and
              while David punished it with the sword, he resolved to scourge it
              with a prophetic psalm. In so doing, the sweet singer was not
              forsaking his profession as a musician for the Lord, but rather
              was practically carrying it out in another department. He was
              praising God when he rebuked the sin which dishonored him, and if
              he was not making music, he was hushing discord when he bade
              rulers dispense justice with impartiality.

              He is the overlooker, who, from his own point of view, sees all
              that is done by the great ones of the earth. When they sit in
              state he stands over them, ready to deal with them if they pervert
              judgment. Judges shall be judged, and to justices justice shall be
              meted out. Our village squires and country magistrates would do
              well to remember this. Some of them had need go to school to Asaph
              until they have mastered this psalm. Their harsh decisions and
              strange judgments are made in the presence of him who will surely
              visit them for every unfitting act, for he has no respect unto the
              person of any, and is the champion of the poor and needy. A higher
              authority will criticize the decision of petty sessions, and even
              the judgments of our most impartial judges will be revised by the
              High Court of Heaven.
            </p>
            <b> <p align="justify">He judges among the gods.</p></b>
            <p align="justify">
              They are gods to other men—but he is GOD to them. He lends them
              his name, and this is their authority for acting as judges—but
              they must take care that they do not misuse the power entrusted to
              them, for the Judge of judges is in session among them. Our puisne
              judges are but puny judges, and their brethren who administer
              common law will one day be tried by the common law.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              This great truth is, upon the whole, well regarded among us in
              these times—but it was not so in the earlier days of English
              history, when Jeffries, and such as he, were an insult to the name
              of justice. Oriental judges, even now, are frequently, if not
              generally, amenable to bribes, and in past ages it was very hard
              to find a ruler who had any notion of justice apart from his own
              arbitrary will. Such plain teaching as this psalm contains was
              needful indeed, and he was a bold good man who, in such courtly
              phrases, delivered his own soul.

              It is indirectly stated that the magistrates had been unjust and
              corrupt. They not only excused the wicked—but even decided in
              their favor against the righteous. A little of this is too much, a
              short time too long. Some suitors could get their claims settled
              at once, and in their own favor, while others were wearing out
              their lives by waiting for an audience, or were robbed by legal
              process because their opponents had the judge's ear: how long were
              such things to be perpetuated? Would they never remember the Great
              Judge, and renounce their wickedness? This verse is so grandly
              stern that one is tempted to say, "Surely an Elijah is here."

              you give them no more than justice, at least be sure that you give
              them that to the full. Do not allow the afflicted to be further
              afflicted by enduring injustice, and let not the needy long stand
              in need of an equitable hearing.

            certain of the great unpaid" should be paid off, when day after day
            their judgments show that they have no judgment. When peasants may
            be horsewhipped by farmers with impunity, and a pretty bird is
            thought more precious than poor men, the foundations of the earth
            are indeed sinking like rotten piles unable to bear up the
            structures built upon them. Thank God we have, as an almost
            invariable rule, incorruptible judges; may it always be so. Even our
            lesser magistrates are, in general, most worthy men; for which we

              This was their ex-officio character, not their moral or spiritual
              relationship. There must be some government among men, and as
              angels are not sent to dispense it, God allows men to rule over
              men, and endorses their office, so far at least that the
              prostitution of it becomes an insult to his own prerogatives.
              Magistrates would have no right to condemn the guilty if God had
              not sanctioned the establishment of government, the administration
              of law, and the execution of sentences. Here the Spirit speaks
              most honorably of these offices, even when it censures the
              officers; and thereby teaches us to render honor to whom honor is
              due,
