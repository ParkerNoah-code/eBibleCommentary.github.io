          TITLE. <b>A maschil of Asaph.</b> An instructive Psalm by Asaph. The
          history of the suffering church is always edifying; when we see how
          the faithful trusted and wrestled with their God in times of dire
          distress, we are thereby taught how to behave ourselves under similar
          circumstances. We learn moreover, that when fiery trial befalls us, no
          strange thing happened unto us, we are following the trail of the host
          of God.

          DIVISION. From verses 1-11 the poet pleads the sorrows of the nation,
          and the despite done to the assemblies of the Lord;
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          then he urges former displays of divine power as a reason for present
          deliverance (verses 12-23).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Whether it is a prophetic Psalm, intended for use in troubles
          foreseen, or whether it was written by a later Asaph, after the
          invasion by Sennacherib or during the Maccabean wars, it would be very
          hard to determine, but we see no difficulty in the first supposition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 1. O God, why have you cast us off forever?
          </p></b
        >To cast us off at all were hard, but when you do for so long a time
        desert they people it is an evil beyond all endurance—the very chief of
        woes and abyss of misery. It is our wisdom when under chastisement to
        inquire,<i> "Show me wherefore you contend with me?" </i>and if the
        affliction be a protracted one, we should more eagerly inquire the
        purpose of
        <i
          >it. Sin is usually at the bottom of all the hiding of the Lord's
          face; let us ask the Lord to reveal the special form of it to us, that
          we may repent of it, overcome it, and henceforth forsake it.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          When a church is in a forsaken condition it must not sit still in
          apathy, but turn to the hand which smites it, and humbly inquire the
          reason why.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At the same time, the inquiry of the text is a faulty one, for it
          implies two mistakes. There are two questions, which only admit of
          negative replies. "Has God cast away his people?" (Romans 11:1); and
          the other, "Will the Lord cast off for ever?" (Psalm 77:7).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is never weary of his people so as to abhor them, and even when
          his anger is turned against them, it is but for a small moment, and
          with a view to their eternal good. Grief in its distraction asks
          strange questions and surmises impossible terrors. It is a wonder of
          grace that the Lord has not long ago put us away as men lay aside cast
          off garments, but he hates putting away, and will still be patient
          with his chosen.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
          </p></b
        >They are yours, they are the objects of your care, they are poor,
        silly, and defenseless things: pity them, forgive them, and come to
        their rescue. They are but sheep, do not continue to be wroth with them.
        It is a terrible thing when the anger of God smokes, but it is an
        infinite mercy that it does not break into a devouring flame. It is fit
        to ask the Lord to remove every sign of his wrath, for it is to those
        who are truly the Lord's sheep a most painful thing to be the objects of
        his displeasure.
        <p align="justify">
          To vex the Holy Spirit is no slight sin, and yet how frequently are we
          guilty of it; hence it is no marvel that we are often under a cloud.

            Verse 2. Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of
            old.
          </p></b
        >What a mighty plea is redemption! O God, can you see the blood mark on
        your own sheep, and yet allow grievous wolves to devour them? The church
        is no new purchase of the Lord; from before the world's foundation the
        chosen were regarded as redeemed by the Lamb slain; shall ancient love
        die out, and the eternal purpose become frustrated? The Lord would have
        his people remember the paschal Lamb, the blood-stained lintel, and the
        overthrow of Egypt; and will he forget all this himself? Let us put him
        in remembrance, let us plead together. Can he desert his blood-bought
        and forsake his redeemed? Can election fail and eternal love cease to
        glow? Impossible! The woes of Calvary, and the covenant of which they
        are the seal, are the security of the saints.

            The rod of your inheritance, which you have redeemed.
          </p></b
        >
        So sweet a plea deserved to be repeated and enlarged upon. The Lord's
        portion is his people—will he lose his inheritance? His church is his
        kingdom, over which he stretches the rod of sovereignty; will he allow
        his possessions to be torn from him? God's property in us is a fact full
        of comfort. His value of us, his dominion over us, his connection with
        us are all so many lights to cheer our darkness. No man will willingly
        lose his inheritance, and no prince will relinquish his dominions;
        therefore we believe that the King of kings will hold his own, and
        maintain his rights against all comers.
        <b> <p align="justify">This mount Zion, wherein you have dwelt.</p></b>
        The Lord's having made Zion the especial center of his worship, and
        place of his manifestation, is yet another plea for the preservation of
        Jerusalem. Shall the sacred temple of Jehovah be desecrated by heathen,
        and the throne of the Great King be defiled by his enemies?
        <i
          >Has the Spirit of God dwelt in our hearts, and will he leave them to
          become a haunt for the devil? </i
        >Has he sanctified us by his indwelling, and will he, after all, vacate
        the throne? God forbid.
        <p align="justify">
          It may be well to note that this Psalm was evidently written with a
          view to the temple upon Zion, and not to the tabernacle which was
          there in David's time, and was a mere tent; but the destructions here
          bewailed were exercised upon the carved work of a substantial
          structure. Those who had seen the glory of God in Solomon's peerless
          temple might well mourn in bitterness, when the Lord allowed his
          enemies to make an utter ruin of that matchless edifice.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. Lift up your feet unto the perpetual desolations.
          </p></b
        >
        The ruin made had already long been an eyesore to the suppliant, and
        there seemed no hope of restoration. Havoc lorded it not only for a day
        or a year, but with perpetual power.
        <p align="justify">
          This is another argument with God. Would Jehovah sit still and see his
          own land made a wilderness, his own palace a desolation? Until he
          should arise, and draw near, the desolation would remain. Only his
          presence could cure the evil, therefore is he entreated to hasten with
          uplifted feet for the deliverance of his people.
        </p>
        <b>

        >Every stone in the ruined temple appealed to the Lord; on all sides
        were the marks of impious spoilers, the holiest places bore evidence of
        their malicious wickedness. Would the Lord forever permit this? Would he
        not hasten to overthrow the foe who defied him to his face, and profaned
        the throne of his glory?
        <i>Faith finds pleas in the worst circumstances</i>, she uses even the
        fallen stones of her desolate palaces, and assails with them the gates
        of Heaven, casting them forth with the great engine of prayer.

            Verse 4. Your enemies roar in the midst of your congregations.

        Where your people sang like angels, these barbarians roar like beasts.
        When your saints come together for worship, these cruel men attack them
        with all the fury of lions. They have no respect for the most solemn
        gatherings, but intrude themselves and their blasphemies into our most
        hallowed meetings. How often in times of persecution or prevalent heresy
        has the church learned the meaning of such language. May the Lord spare
        us such misery.
        <p align="justify">
          When hypocrites abound in the church, and pollute her worship, the
          case is parallel to that before us; Lord save us from so severe a
          trial.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">They set up their ensigns for signs.</p></b>
        Idolatrous emblems used in war were set up over God's altar, as an
        insulting token of victory, and of contempt for the vanquished and their
        God. Papists, Arians, and the modern school of Neologians, have, in
        their day, set up their ensigns for signs. Superstition, unbelief, and
        carnal wisdom have endeavored to usurp the place of Christ crucified, to
        the grief of the church of God.

        <p align="justify">
          The enemies <i>without </i>do us small damage, but those
          <i>within </i>the church cause her serious harm; by supplanting the
          truth and placing error in its stead, they deceive the people, and
          lead multitudes to destruction. As a Jew felt a holy horror when he
          saw an idolatrous emblem set up in the holy place, even so do we when
          in a Protestant church we see the fooleries of Rome; and when from
          pulpits, once occupied by men of God, we hear philosophy and vain
          deceit.

        Once men were renowned for felling the cedars and preparing them for
        building the temple, but now the axe finds other work, and men are as
        proud of destroying as their fathers were of erecting. Thus in the olden
        times our sires dealt sturdy blows against the forests of error, and
        labored hard to lay the axe at the root of the trees; but, alas! their
        sons appear to be quite as diligent to destroy the truth and to
        overthrow all that their fathers built up. O for the good old times
        again! O for an hour of Luther's hatchet, or Calvin's mighty axe!

          In these days men are using axes and sledge-hammers against the gospel
          and the church. Glorious truths, far more exquisite than the goodliest

          criticism. Truths which have upheld the afflicted and cheered the
          dying are smitten by pretentious Goths, who would be accounted
          learned, but know not the first principals of the truth. With sharp
          ridicule, and heavy blows of sophistry, they break the faith of some;
          and would, if it were possible, destroy the confidence of the elect

        When the Lord left Mount Zion, and the Roman gained entrance, the
        military fury led the soldiers to burn out and root up the memorial of
        the famous House of the Lord. Could the powers of darkness have their
        way, a like fate would befall the church of Christ. "Raze it, "say they,
        "raze it even to the foundation thereof." Defilement to the church is
        destruction; her foes would defile her until nothing of her purity, and
        consequently of her real self, remained. Yet, even if they could wreak
        their will upon the cause of Christ, they are not able to destroy it, it
        would survive their blows and fires;
        <i>the Lord would hold them still like dogs on a leash</i>, and in the
