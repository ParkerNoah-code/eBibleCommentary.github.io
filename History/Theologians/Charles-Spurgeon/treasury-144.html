          TITLE. A Psalm of David. This Psalm is wisely placed. Whoever edited
          and arranged these sacred poems, he had an eye to apposition and
          contrast; for if in Psalm 137:1-9 we see the need of silence before
          revilers, here we see the excellence of a brave confession.
          <i
            >There is a time to be silent, lest we cast pearls before swine; and
            there is a time to speak openly, lest we be found guilty of cowardly
            not confessing.

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalm is evidently of a Davidic character, exhibiting all the
          fidelity, courage, and decision of that King of Israel and Prince of
          Psalmists. Of course the critics have tried to rend the authorship
          from David on account of the mention of the temple, though it so
          happens that in one of the Psalms which is allowed to be David's the
          same word occurs.

            Many modern critics are to the word of God what blowflies are to the
            food of men: they cannot do any good, and unless relentlessly driven

          DIVISION. In full confidence David is prepared to own his God before
          the gods of the heathen, or before angels or rulers (verses 1-3); he
          declares that he will instruct and convert kings and nations, until on
          very highway men shall sing the praises of the Lord (verses 4-5).
          Having thus spoken, he utters his personal confidence in Jehovah, who
          will help his lowly servant, and preserve him from all the malice of
          wrathful foes (verses 6-8).<br />

        His mind is so taken up with God that he does not mention his name: to
        him there is no other God, and Jehovah is so perfectly realized and so
        intimately known, that the Psalmist, in addressing him, no more thinks
        of mentioning his name than we should do if we were speaking to a father
        or a friend. He sees God with his mind's eye, and simply addresses him
        with the pronoun "you."
        <p align="justify">
          He is resolved to praise the Lord, and to do it with the whole force
          of his life, even with his whole heart. He would not submit to act as
          one under restraint, because of the opinions of others; but in the
          presence of the opponents of the living God he would be as hearty in
          worship as if all were friends and would cheerfully unite with him. If
          others do not praise the Lord, there is all the more reason why we
          should do so, and should do so with enthusiastic eagerness.

        If ever our heart is whole and wholly occupied with one thing, it should

        Why should these idols rob Jehovah of his praises? The Psalmist will not
        for a moment suspend his songs because there are images before him, and
        their foolish worshipers might not approve of his music. I believe David
        referred to the false gods of the neighboring nations, and the deities
        of the surviving Canaanites. He was not pleased that such gods were set
        up; but he intended to express at once his contempt of them, and his own
        absorption in the worship of the living Jehovah by continuing most
        earnestly to sing wherever he might be. It would be paying these dead
        idols too much respect to cease singing because they were perched aloft.
        <p align="justify">
          In these days when new religions are daily excogitated, and new gods
          are set up, it is well to know how to act. Bitterness is forbidden,
          and controversy is apt to advertise the heresy. The very best method
          is to go on personally worshiping the Lord with unvarying zeal,
          singing with heart and voice his royal praises.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do they deny the Divinity of our Lord? Let us the more fervently adore
          him. Do they despise the substitutionary atonement? Let us the more
          constantly proclaim it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Had half the time spent in councils and controversies been given to
          praising the Lord, the church would have been far sounder and stronger
          than she is at this day. The Hallelujah Legion will win the day.
          Praising and singing are our armor against the idolatries of heresy,
          our comfort under the depression caused by insolent attacks upon the
          truth, and our weapons for defending the gospel. Faith when displayed
          in cheerful courage, has about it a sacred contagion: others learn to
          believe in the Most High when they see his servant

        God in God's own way. The Lord had ordained a center of unity, a place
        of sacrifice, a house of his indwelling; and David accepted the way of
        worship enjoined by revelation.

          Even so, the true hearted believer of these days must not fall into
          the will worship of superstition, or the wild worship of skepticism,

          The idol gods had their temples; but David averts his glance from
          them, and looks earnestly to the spot chosen of the Lord for his own
          sanctuary. We are not only to adore the true God, but to do so in his
          own appointed way. The Jew looked to the temple, we are to look to
          Jesus, the living temple of the Godhead.

        Praise would be the main part of David's worship; the name or character
        of God the great object of his song; and the special point of his praise
        the grace and truth which shone so conspicuously in that name.

        <p align="justify">
          The person of Jesus is the temple of the Godhead, and therein we

          It is upon these two points that the name of Jehovah is at this time
          assailed—his grace and his truth. He is said to be too stern, too
          terrible, and therefore "modern thought" displaces the God of Abraham,
          Isaac, and Jacob—and
          <i>sets up an effeminate deity of its own making. </i>
          As for us, we firmly believe that God is love, and that in the summing
          up of all things it will be seen that Hell itself is not inconsistent
          with the beneficence of Jehovah, but is, indeed, a necessary part of
          his moral government now that sin has intruded into the universe. True
          believers hear the thunders of his justice, and yet they do not doubt
          his loving-kindness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Especially do we delight in God's great love to his own elect, such as
          he showed to Israel as a race, and more especially to David and his
          seed when he entered into covenant with him. Concerning this there is
          abundant room for praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But not only do men attack the loving-kindness of God, but the truth
          of God is at this time assailed on all sides; some doubt the truth of
          the inspired record as to its <i>histories</i>, others challenge the
          <i>doctrines</i>, many sneer at the <i>prophecies</i>; in fact, the
          infallible word of the Lord is at this time treated as if it were the
          writing of impostors, and only worthy to be carped at.
          <i>The swine are trampling on the pearls at this time</i>, and nothing
          restrains them. Nevertheless, the pearls are pearls still, and shall
          yet shine about our Monarch's brow.

          We sing the loving-kindness and truth of the God of the Old Testament,

        No proof is so convincing as that of experience. No man doubts the power
        of prayer after he has received an answer of peace to his supplication.
        It is the distinguishing mark of the true and living God that he hears
        the pleadings of his people, and answers them. The idol-gods hear not
        and answer not, but Jehovah's memorial is, "the God who hears prayer."
        <p align="justify">
          There was some special day in which David cried more vehemently than
          usual; he was weak, wounded, worried, and his heart was wearied; then
          like a child he "cried"—cried unto his Father. It was a bitter,
          earnest, eager prayer, as natural and as plaintive as the cry of a
          babe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord answered it, but what answer can there be to a cry—to a mere
          inarticulate wail of grief?
          <i>Our heavenly Father is able to interpret tears and cries</i>, and
          he replies to their inner sense in such a way as fully meets the case.
          The answer came in the same day as the cry ascended:
          <i
            >so speedily does prayer rise to Heaven, so quickly does mercy
            return to earth. </i
          >The statement of this sentence is one which all believers can make,
          and as they can substantiate it with many facts, they ought boldly to
          publish it, for it is greatly to God's glory.

          Well might the Psalmist say, "I will worship" when he felt bound to
          say "you answered me." Well might he glory before the idols and their

        Kings have usually small concern to hear the word of the Lord; but King
        David feels assured that if they do hear it they will feel its power. A
        little piety goes a long way in courts; but brighter days are coming, in

        Here is a double wonder—kings in God's ways, and kings singing there.
        Let a man once know the ways of Jehovah, and he will find therein
        abundant reason for song; but the difficulty is to bring the great ones
        of the earth into ways so little attractive to the carnal mind. Perhaps

        David, under a sense of Jehovah's glory, exclaimed, "I will sing" (verse

        <b> <p align="justify">Yet has he respect unto the lowly.</p></b> He
        views them with pleasure, thinks of them with care, listens to their
        prayers, and protects them from evil. Because they think little of
        themselves he thinks much of them. They reverence him, and he respects
        them. They are low in their own esteem, and he makes them high in his
        esteem.
        <b> <p align="justify">But the proud he knows afar off.</p></b>He does
        not need to come near them in order to discover their utter vanity: a
        glance from afar reveals to him their emptiness and offensiveness. He
        has no fellowship with them, but views them from a distance. He is not
        deceived, but knows the truth about them, despite their blustering. He
        has no respect unto them, but utterly abhors them. To a Cain's
        sacrifice, a Pharaoh's promise, a Rabshakeh's threat, and a Pharisee's
        prayer—the Lord has no respect. Nebuchadnezzar, when far off from God,

        we are somewhat in trouble it is bad enough, but it is worse to
        penetrate into the center of that dark continent and traverse its midst:
        yet in such a case the believer makes progress, for he <i>walks</i>; he
        keeps to a quiet pace, for he does no more than walk; and he is not
        without the best of company, for his God is near to pour fresh life into
        him.
        <p align="justify">
          It is a happy circumstance that, if God be away at any other time—yet
          he is pledged to be with us in trying hours: "When you pass through
          the rivers I will be with you." He is in a blessed condition who can
          confidently use the language of David, "you will revive me."

        This is the fact which would revive fainting David. Our foes fall when
        the Lord comes to deal with them; he makes short work of the enemies of
        his people—with one hand he routs them. His wrath soon quenches their
        wrath; his hand stays their hand. Adversaries may be many, and
        malicious, and mighty—but our glorious Defender has only to stretch out
        his arm and their armies vanish.

          The sweet singer rehearses his assurance of salvation, and sings of it
          in the ears of the Lord, addressing him with this confident language.
          He will be saved—saved dexterously, decidedly, divinely; he has no
          doubt about it. God's right hand cannot forget its cunning; Jerusalem
          is his chief joy, and <i>he will defend his own elect</i>.

            Verse 8. The Lord will perfect that which concerns me.

        >
        All my interests are safe in Jehovah's hands.
        <p align="justify">
          "The work which his goodness began,<br />
          The arm of his strength will complete;<br />
          His promise is yes and Amen,<br />
          And never was forfeited yet."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is concerned in all that concerns his servants. He will see to it
          that none of their precious things shall fail of completion; their
          life, their strength, their hopes, their graces, their
          pilgrimage—shall each and all be perfected. Jehovah himself will see
          to this and therefore it is most sure.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Your mercy, O Lord, endures forever.</p></b> The
        refrain of the former Psalm is in his ears, and he repeats it as his own
        personal conviction and consolation. The first clause of the verse is
        the assurance of faith, and this second one reaches to the full
        assurance of understanding. God's work in us will abide unto perfection
        because God's mercy towards us thus abides.
        <b> <p align="justify">Forsake not the works of your own hands.</p></b>
        Our confidence does not cause us to live without prayer, but encourages
        us to pray all the more. Since we have it written upon our hearts that
        God will perfect his work in us, and we see it also written in Scripture
        that his mercy changes not, with holy earnestness we entreat that we may
        not be forsaken. If there be anything good in us, it is the work of
        God's own hands—will he leave it? Why has he wrought so much in us if he
        means to give us up? He who has gone so far, will surely persevere with
        us to the end. Our hope for the final perseverance of the believer lies
        in the final perseverance of the believer's God. If the Lord begins to
        build, and does not finish, it will not be his honor. He will have a
        desire to the work of his hands, for he knows it has cost him already,
        and
        <i
          >he will not throw away a vessel upon which he has expended so much of
          labor and skill.
        </i>
        Therefore do we praise him with our, whole heart, even in the presence
        of those who depart from his Holy Word, and, set up another god and
        another gospel; which are not another, but there be some that trouble
        us.
