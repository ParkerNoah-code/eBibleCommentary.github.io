          1. And since Adam was moulded from this earth to which we belong, the
          Scripture tells us that God said to him, "In the sweat of thy face
          shall thou eat thy bread, until thou turnest again to the dust from
          whence thou wert taken." If then, after death, our bodies return to
          any other substance, it follows that from it also they have their
          substance. But if it be into this very [earth], it is manifest that it
          was also from it that man's frame was created; as also the Lord
          clearly showed, when from this very substance He formed eyes for the
          man [to whom He gave sight]. And thus was the hand of God plainly
          shown forth, by which Adam was fashioned, and we too have been formed;
          and since there is one and the same Father, whose voice from the
          beginning even to the end is present with His handiwork, and the
          substance from which we were formed is plainly declared through the
          Gospel, we should therefore not seek after another Father besides Him,
          nor [look for] another substance from which we have been formed,
          besides what was mentioned beforehand, and shown forth by the Lord;
          nor another hand of God besides that which, from the beginning even to
          the end, forms us and prepares us for life, and is present with His
          handiwork, and perfects it after the image and likeness of God.

          2. And then, again, this Word was manifested when the Word of God was
          made man, assimilating Himself to man, and man to Himself, so that by
          means of his resemblance to the Son, man might become precious to the
          Father. For in times long past, it was said that man was created after
          the image of God, but it was not [actually] shown; for the Word was as
          yet invisible, after whose image man was created, Wherefore also he
          did easily lose the similitude. When, however, the Word of God became
          flesh, He confirmed both these: for He both showed forth the image
          truly, since He became Himself what was His image; and He
          re-established the similitude after a sure manner, by assimilating man
          to the invisible Father through means of the visible Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And not by the aforesaid things alone has the Lord manifested
          Himself, but [He has done this] also by means of His passion. For
          doing away with [the effects of] that disobedience of man which had
          taken place at the beginning by the occasion of a tree, "He became
          obedient unto death, even the death of the cross;" rectifying that
          disobedience which had occurred by reason of a tree, through that
          obedience which was [wrought out] upon the tree [of the cross]. Now He
          would not have come to do away, by means of that same [image], the
          disobedience which had been incurred towards our Maker if He
          proclaimed another Father. But inasmuch as it was by these things that
          we disobeyed God, and did not give credit to His word, so was it also
          by these same that He brought in obedience and consent as respects His
          Word; by which things He clearly shows forth God Himself, whom indeed
          we had offended in the first Adam, when he did not perform His
          commandment. In the second Adam, however, we are reconciled, being
          made obedient even unto death. For we were debtors to none other but
          to Him whose commandment we had transgressed at the beginning.
