          Let no one, again, trespass upon the boundaries of another, nor
          presume to judge or excommunicate one belonging to another's parish;
          because such judgment or ordination, or excommunication or
          condemnation, shall neither be ratified nor have any virtue; since no
          one shall be bound by the decision of another judge than his own,
          neither shall he be condemned by such. Whence also the Lord speaks to
          this effect: "Pass not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have
          set." Moreover, let no primate or metropolitan invade the church or
          parish of a diocesan (dioecesani), or presume to excommunicate or
          judge any one belonging to his parish, or do anything without his
          counsel or judgment; but let him observe this law, which has been laid
          down by the apostles and fathers, and our predecessors, and has been
          ratified by us: to wit, that if any metropolitan bishop, except in
          that which pertains to his own proper parish alone, shall attempt to
          do anything without the counsel and good-will of all the comprovincial
          bishops, he will do it at the risk of his position, and what he does
          in this manner shall be held null and void; but whatever it may be
          necessary to do or to arrange with regard to the cases of the body of
          provincial bishops, and the necessities of their churches and clergy
          and laity, this should be done by consent of all the pontiffs of the
          same province, and that too without any pride of lordship, but with
          the most humble and harmonious action, even as the Lord says: "I came
          not to be ministered unto, but to minister." And in another passage He
          says: "And whosoever of you is the greater, shall be your servant,"
          and so forth. And in like manner the bishops of the same province
          themselves should do all things in counsel with him, except so much as
          pertains to their own proper parishes, in accordance with the statutes
          of the holy fathers (who, although they have preceded us by a certain
          interval of time, have yet drawn the light of truth and faith from one
          and the same fountain of purity, and have sought the prosperity of the
          Church of God and the common advantage of all Christians by the same
          enlightening and guiding Spirit), that with one mind, and one mouth,
          and one accord, the Holy Trinity may be glorified for ever. No
          primate, no metropolitan, nor any of the other bishops, is at liberty
          to enter the seat of another, or to occupy a possession which does not
          pertain to him, and which forms part of the parish of another bishop,
          at the direction of any one, unless he is invited by him to whose
          jurisdiction it is acknowledged to belong; nor can he set about any
          arrangement or ordinance, or judgment there, if he wishes to keep the
          honour of his station. But if he presume to do otherwise, he shall be
          condemned; and not only he, but those who co-operate and agree with
          him: for just as the power of making appointments (ordinatio) is
          interdicted in such circumstances, so also is the power of judging or
          of disposing of other matters. For if a man has no power to appoint,
          how shall he judge? Without doubt, he shall in no wise judge or have
          power to judge: for just as another man's wife cannot intermarry with
          anyone (adulterari), nor be judged or disposed of by any one but by
          her own husband so long as he liveth; so neither can it in anywise be
          allowed that the wife of a bishop, by whom undoubtedly is meant his
          church or parish, should be judged or disposed of by another without
          his (the bishop's) judgment and good-will so long as he liveth, or
          enjoy another's embrace, that is, his ordaining. Wherefore the apostle
          says: "The wife is bound by the law so long as her husband liveth; but
          if he be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband." In like
          manner also, the spouse of a bishop (for the church is called his
          spouse and wife) is bound to him while he liveth; but when he is dead
          she is loosed, and may be wedded to whomsoever she will, only in the
          Lord, that is, according to order. For if, while he is alive, she
          marry another, she shall be judged to be an adulteress. And in the
          same manner, he too, if he marry another of his own will, shall be
          held to be an adulterer, and shall be deprived of the privilege of
          communion. If, however, he is persecuted in his own church, he must
          flee to another, and attach himself to it, as the Lord says: "If they
          persecute you in one city, flee ye into another." If, however, the
          change be made for the sake of the good of the church, he may not do
          this of himself, but only on the invitation of the brethren, and with
          the sanction of this holy seat, and not for ambition's sake, but for
          the public good.<br />
