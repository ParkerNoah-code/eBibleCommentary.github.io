        <p>
          "In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
          requests be made known unto God." -- Philippians 4:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          ACCORDING TO THE TEXT, we are both by prayer and supplication to make
          known our requests unto God. If any distinction be intended here, I
          suppose that by prayer is meant the general act of devotion and the
          mention of our usual needs; and by supplication I think would be
          intended our distinct entreaties and special petitions. We are to
          offer the general prayer common to all the saints, and we are to add
          thereto the special and definite petitions which are peculiar to
          ourselves. We are to worship in prayer, for God is to be adored by all
          his saints, and then we are to beseech his favours for ourselves,
          according to the words of the text, letting our requests be made known
          unto God. Do not forget this second form of worship. There is a good
          deal of generalizing in prayer, and God forbid that we should say a
          word against it, so far as it is sincere worship, but we want to have
          more of specific, definite pleading with God, asking him for
          such-and-such things, with a clear knowledge of what we ask. You will
          hear prayers at prayer-meetings, in which everything is asked in
          general but nothing in particular, and yet the reality and heartiness
          of prayer will often be best manifested by the putting up of requests
          for distinct blessings. See how Abraham, when he went to worship the
          Lord, did not merely adore him, and in general pray for his glory, but
          on a special occasion he pleaded concerning the promised heir, at
          another time he cried, "O that Ishmael might live before thee," and on
          one special occasion he interceded for Sodom. Elijah, when on the top
          of Carmel, did not pray for all the blessings of providence in
          general, but for rain, for rain there and then. He knew what he was
          driving at, kept to his point, and prevailed. So, my beloved friends,
          we have many wants which are so pressing as to be very distinct and
          definite, and we ought to have just so many clearly defined petitions
          which we offer unto God by way of supplication, and for the divine
          answers to these we are bound to watch with eager expectancy, so that
          when we receive them we may magnify the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point to which I would draw your attention is this: that whether
          it be the general prayer or the specific supplication we are to offer
          either or both "with thanksgiving." We are to pray about everything,
          and with every prayer we must blend our thanksgivings. Hence it
          follows that we ought always to be in a thankful condition of heart:
          since we are to pray without ceasing, and are not to pray without
          thanksgiving, it is clear that we ought to be always ready to give
          thanks unto the Lord. We must say with the Psalmist, "Thus will I
          bless thee while I live; I will lift up my hands in thy name." The
          constant tenor and spirit of our lives should be adoring gratitude,
          love, reverence, and thanksgiving to the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blending of thanks with devotion is always to be maintained.
          Always must we offer prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. No
          matter though the prayer should struggle upward out of the depths, yet
          must its wings be silvered o'er with thanksgiving. Though the prayer
          were offered upon the verge of death, yet in the last few words which
          the trembling lips can utter there should be notes of gratitude as
          well as words of petition. The law saith: "With all thy sacrifices
          thou shalt offer salt;" and the gospel says with all thy prayers thou
          shalt offer praise. "One thing at a time" is said to be a wise
          proverb, but for once I must venture to contradict it, and say two
          things at a time are better, when the two are prayer and thanksgiving.
          These two holy streams flow from one common source, the Spirit of life
          which dwells within us; and they are utterances of the same holy
          fellowship with God; and therefore it is right that they should mingle
          as they flow, and find expression in the same holy exercise.
          Supplication and thanksgiving so naturally run into each other that it
          would be difficult to keep them separate: like kindred colours, they
          shade off into each other. Our very language seems to indicate this,
          for there is small difference between the words "to pray," and "to
          praise." A psalm may be either a prayer or praise, or both; and there
          is yet another form of utterance which is certainly prayer, but is
          used as praise, and is really both. I refer to that joyous Hebrew word
          which has been imported into all Christian languages, "Hosanna." Is it
          a prayer? Yes. "Save, Lord." Is it not praise? Yes; for it is
          tantamount to "God save the king," and is used to extol the Son of
          David. While we are here on earth we should never attempt to make such
          a distinction between prayer and praise that we should either praise
          without prayer or pray without praise; but with every prayer and
          supplication we should mingle thanksgiving, and thus make known our
          requests unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This commingling of precious things is admirable. It reminds me of
          that verse in the Canticles where the king is described as coming up
          from the wilderness in his chariot, "like pillars of smoke, perfumed
          with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant." There
          is the myrrh of prayer, and the frankincense of praise. So, too, the
          holy incense of the sanctuary yielded the smoke of prayer which filled
          the holy place, but with it there was the sweet perfume of choice
          spices, which may be compared to praise. Prayer and praise are like
          the two cherubim on the ark, they must never be separated. In the
          model of prayer which our Saviour has given us, saying, "After this
          manner pray ye," the opening part of it is rather praise than prayer
          -- "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name," and the
          closing part of it is praise, where we say, "For thine is the kingdom,
          the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen." David, who is the
          great tutor and exemplar of the church as to her worship, being at
          once her poet and her preacher, takes care in almost every psalm,
          though the petition may be agonizing, to mingle exquisite praise. Take
          for instance, that psalm of his after his great sin with Bathsheba.
          There one would think, with sighs and groans and tears so multiplied,
          he might have almost forgotten or have feared to offer thanksgiving
          while he was trembling under a sense of wrath; and yet ere the psalm
          that begins "Have mercy upon me, O God," can come to a conclusion the
          psalmist has said: "O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show
          forth thy praise," and he cannot pen the last word without beseeching
          the Lord to build the walls of Jerusalem, adding the promise, "then
          shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt
          offering and whole burnt offering: then shalt they offer bullocks upon
          thine alter." I need not stop to quote other instances, but it is
          almost always the case that David by the fire of prayer warms himself
          into praise. He begins low, with many a broken note of complaining,
          but he mounts and glows, and, like the lark, sings as he ascends. When
          at first his harp is muffled he warbles a few mournful notes and
          becomes excited, till he cannot restrain his hand from that well-known
          and accustomed string which he had reserved for the music of praise
          alone. There is a passage in the eighteenth Psalm, at the third verse,
          in which indeed he seems to have caught the very idea which I want to
          fix upon your minds this morning. "I will call upon the Lord, who is
          worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies." He was
          in such a condition that he says, "The sorrows of death compassed me,
          and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. The sorrows of hell
          compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me." Driven by
          distress, he declares that he will call upon the Lord, that is, with
          utterances of prayer; but he does not alone regard his God as the
          object of prayer, but as One who is to be praised. "I will call upon
          the Lord, who is worthy to be praised;" and then, as if inspired to
          inform us of the fact that the blending of thanksgiving with prayer
          renders it infallibly effectual, as I shall have to show you it does,
          he adds, "So shall I be saved from mine enemies."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if this habit of combining thanksgiving with prayer is found in
          the Old Testament saints, we have a right to expect it yet more in New
          Testament believers, who in clearer light perceive fresh reasons for
          thanksgiving; but I shall give you no instance except that of the
          writer of my text. Does he not tell us in the present chapter that
          those things which we have seen in him we are to do, for his life was
          agreeable with his teachings? Now, observe, how frequently he
          commences his epistles with a blending of supplication and
          thanksgiving. Turn to Romans 1:8-9, and note this fusion of these
          precious metals -- "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you
          all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. For God
          is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son,
          that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers."
          There is "I thank my God," and "I make mention of you always in my
          prayers." This was not written with a special eye to the percept of
          our text; it was natural to Paul so to thank God when he prayed. Look
          at Colossians 1:3 -- "We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, praying always for you." To the same effect we read in
          First Thessalonians 1:2 -- "We give thanks to God always for you all,
          making mention of you in our prayers." Look also at Second Timothy 1:3
          -- "I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
          conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my
          prayers night and day." And if it be so in other epistles, we are not
          at all surprised to find it so in Philippians 1:3-4 -- "I thank my God
          upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you
          all making request with joy." Nor need I confine you to the language
          of Paul's epistle, since it is most noteworthy that in Philippi itself
          (and those to whom he wrote must have remembered the incident) Paul
          and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God at midnight, so that the
          prisoners heard them. It is clear that Paul habitually practised what
          he here enjoins. His own prayers had not been offered without
          thanksgiving; what God hath joined together he had never put asunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this as a preface, I invite you to consider, carefully and
          prayerfully, first, the grounds of thanksgiving in prayer; secondly,
          the evil of its absence; and thirdly, the result of its presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, there are REASONS FOR MINGLING THANKSGIVING WITH
          PRAYER. In the nature of things it ought to be so. We have abundant
          cause, my brethen, for thanksgiving at all times. We do not come to
          God in Prayer as if he had left us absolutely penniless, and we cried
          to him like starving prisoners begging through prison bars. We do not
          ask as if we had never received a single farthing of God before, and
          hardly thought we should obtain anything now; but on the contrary,
          having been already the recipients of immense favours, we come to a
          God who abounds in lovingkindness, who is willing to bestow good gifts
          upon us, and waits to be gracious to us. We do not come to the Lord as
          slaves to an unfeeling tyrant craving for a boon, but as children who
          draw nigh to a loving father, expecting to receive abundantly from his
          liberal hands. Thanksgiving is the right spirit in which to come
          before the God who daily loadeth us with benefits. Bethink you for
          awhile what cause you have for thanksgiving in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first you have this, that such a thing as prayer is possible, that
          a finite creature can speak with the infinite Creator, that a sinful
          being can have audience with the thrice-holy Jehovah. It is worthy of
          thanksgiving that God should have commanded prayer and encouraged us
          to draw near unto him; and that moreover he should have supplied all
          things necessary to the sacred exercise. He has set up a mercy seat,
          blood besprinkled; and he has prepared a High Priest, ever living to
          make intercession; and to these he has added the Holy Ghost to help
          our infirmities and to teach us what we should pray for as we ought.
          Everything is ready, and God waits for us to enquire at his hands. He
          has not only set before us an open door and invited us to enter, but
          he has given us the right spirit with which to approach. The grace of
          supplication is poured out upon us and wrought in us by the Holy
          Ghost. What a blessing it is that we do not attempt prayer with a
          peradventure, as if we were making a doubtful experiment, nor do we
          come before God as a forlorn hope, desperately afraid that he will not
          listen to our cry; but he has ordained prayer to be the ordinary
          commerce of heaven and earth, and sanctioned it in the most solemn
          manner. Prayer may climb to heaven, for God has himself prepared the
          ladder and set it down just by the head of his lonely Jacob, so that
          though that head be pillowed on a stone it may rest in peace. Lo, at
          the top of that ladder is the Lord himself in his covenant capacity,
          receiving our petitions and sending his attendant angels with answers
          to our requests. Shall we not bless God for this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us praise his name, dear friends, also especially that you and I
          are still spared to pray and permitted to pray. What if we are greatly
          afflicted, yet it is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed. If
          we had received our desserts we should not now have been on praying
          ground and pleading terms with him. But let it be for our comfort and
          to God's praise that still we may stand with bowed head and cry each
          one -- "God be merciful to me a sinner." Still may we cry like sinking
          Peter, "Lord save, or I perish." Like David, we may be unable to go up
          to the temple, but we can still go to our God in prayer. The prodigal
          has lost his substance, but he has not lost his power to supplicate.
          He has been feeding swine, but as yet he is still a man, and has not
          lost the faculty of desire and entreaty. He may have forgotten his
          father, but his father has not forgotten him; he may arise and he may
          go to him, and he may pour out his soul in his father's bosom.
          Therefore, let us give thanks unto God that he has nowhere said unto
          us -- "Seek ye my face in vain." If we find a desire to pray trembling
          within our soul, and if though almost extinct we feel some hope in the
          promise of our gracious God, if our heart still groans after holiness
          and after God, though she hath lost her power to pray with joyful
          confidence as once she did, yet let us be thankful that we can pray
          even if it be but a little. In the will and power to pray there lies
          the capacity for infinite blessedness: he who hath the key of prayer
          can open heaven, yea, he hath access to the heart of God; therefore,
          bless God for prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, beloved, beyond the fact of prayer and our power to exercise
          it, there is a further ground of thanksgiving that we have already
          received great mercy at God's hands. We are not coming to God to ask
          favours and receive them for the first time in our lives. Why, blessed
          be his name, if he never granted me another favour, I have enough for
          which to thank him as long as I have any being. And this, moreover, is
          to be recollected, that whatever great things we are about to ask, we
          cannot possibly be seeking for blessings one-half so great as those
          which we have already received if we are indeed his children. If thou
          art a Christian, thou hast life in Christ. Art thou about to ask for
          meat and raiment? The life is more than these. Thou hast already
          obtained Christ Jesus to be thine, and he that spared him not will
          deny thee nothing. Is there, I was about to say, anything to compare
          with the infinite riches which are already ours in Christ Jesus? Let
          us perpetually thank our Benefactor for what we have while we make
          request for something more. Should it not be so? Shall not the
          abundant utterances of the memory of his great goodness run over into
          our requests, till our petitions are baptized in gratitude. While we
          come before God, in one aspect, empty handed to receive of his
          goodness, on the other hand we should never appear before him empty,
          but come with the fat of our sacrifices, offering praise and
          glorifying God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, there is this to be remembered, that when we come before
          God in the hour of trouble, remembering his great goodness to us in
          the past, and therefore thanking him, we ought to have faith enough to
          believe that the present trouble, about which we are praying, is sent
          in love. You will win with God in prayer if you can look at your
          trials in this light: -- "Lord, I have this thorn in the flesh. I
          beseech thee, deliver me from it, but meanwhile I bless thee for it;
          for though I do not understand the why or the wherefore of it, I am
          persuaded there is love within it; therefore, while I ask thee to
          remove it, so far as it seemeth evil to me, yet wherein it may to thy
          better knowledge work my good, I bless thee for it, and I am content
          to endure it so long as thou seest fit." Is not that a sweet way of
          praying? "Lord, I am in want, be pleased to supply me; but, meanwhile,
          if thou do not, I believe it is better for me to be in need, and so I
          praise thee for my necessity while I ask thee to supply it. I glory in
          mine infirmity, even while I ask thee to overcome it. I triumph before
          thee in my affliction, and bless thee for it even while I ask thee to
          help me in it and to rescue me out of it." This is a royal way of
          praying: such an amalgam of prayer and thanksgiving is more precious
          than the gold of Ophir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, beloved, whenever we are on our knees in prayer, it
          becomes us to bless God that prayer has been answered so many times
          before. Here thy poor petitioner bends before thee to ask again, but
          ere he asks he thanks thee for having heard him so many times before.
          I know that thou hearest me always, therefore do I continue still to
          cry to thee. My thanksgivings urge me to make fresh petitions,
          encouraging me in the full confidence that thou wilt not send me away
          empty. Why, many of the mercies which you possess today, and rejoice
          in, are answers to prayer. They are dear to you because, like Samuel,
          whom his mother so named because he was "asked of God," they came to
          you as answers to your supplications. When mercies come in answer to
          prayer they have a double delight about them, not only because they
          are good in themselves, but because they are certificates of our
          favour with the Lord. Well, then, as God has heard us so often and we
          have the proofs of his hearing, should we ever pray with murmurings
          and complainings? Should we not rather feel an intense delight when we
          approach the throne of grace, a rapture awakened by sunny memories of
          the past?
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we ought to pray with thanksgiving in its highest of all
          senses, by thanking God that we have the mercy which we seek. I wish
          we could learn this high virtue of faith. When I was conversing lately
          with our dear friend George Miller, he frequently astonished me with
          the way in which he mentioned that he had for so many months and years
          asked for such and such a mercy, and praised the Lord for it. He
          praised the Lord for it as though he had actually obtained it. Even in
          praying for the conversion of a person, as soon as he had begun to
          intercede he began also to praise God for the conversion of that
          person. Though I think he told us he had in one instance already
          prayed for thirty years and the work was not yet done, yet all the
          while he had gone on thanking God, because he knew the prayer would be
          answered. He believed that he had his petition, and commenced to
          magnify the Giver of it. Is this unreasonable? How often do we
          antedate our gratitude among the sons of men! If you were to promise
          some poor person that you would pay his rent when it came due, he
          would thank you directly, though not a farthing had left your pocket.
          We have enough faith in our fellow-men to thank them beforehand, and
          surely we may do the same with our Lord. Shall we not be willing to
          trust God for a few months ahead, ay, and for years beforehand, if his
          wisdom bids us wait. This is the way to win with him. When ye pray,
          believe that ye receive the boons ye ask, and ye shall have them.
          "Believe that ye have it," says the Scripture, "and ye shall have it."
          As a man's note of hand stands for the money, so let God's promise be
          accounted as the performance. Shall not heaven's bank-notes pass as
          cash? Yea, verily, they shall have unquestioned currency among
          believers. We will bless the Lord for giving us what we have sought,
          since our having it is a matter of absolute certainty. We shall never
          thank God by faith and then find that we were befooled. He has said,
          "All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall
          receive." And therefore we may rest assured that the thanksgiving of
          faith shall never bring shame into the face of the man who offers it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, and then I will say no more upon these grounds of
          thanksgiving; surely, brethren, if the Lord do not answer the prayer
          which we are offering, yet still he is so good, so supremely good,
          that we will bless him whether or no. We ought even to praise him when
          he does not answer us, ay, and bless him for refusing our desires. How
          devoutly might some of us thank him that he did not answer our prayers
          when we sought for evil things in the ignorance of our childish minds.
          We asked for flesh, and He might have sent us quails in His anger, and
          while the flesh was yet in our mouths his wrath might have come upon
          us; but in love he would not hear us. Blessed be his name for closing
          his ear in pity! Let us adore him when he keeps us waiting at his
          doors; thank him for rebuffs, and bless him for refusals, believing
          always that Ralph Erskine spoke the truth when he said:
        </p>
        <p>"I'm heard when answered soon or late,</p>
        <p>Yea, heard when I no answer get:</p>
        <p>Yea, kindly answered when refused,</p>
        <p>And treated well when harshly used."</p>
        <p>
          Faith glorifies the love of God, for she knows that the Lord's
          roughest usage is only love in disguise. We are not so sordid as to
          make our songs depend upon the weather, or on the fulness of the
          olive-press and the wine-fat. Blessed be his name, he must be right
          even when he seems at cross purposes with his people; we are not going
          to quarrel with him, like silly babes with their nurses, because he
          does not happen to grant us every desire of our foolish hearts. Though
          he slay us we will trust in him, much more if he decline our requests.
          We ask him for our daily bread, and if he withhold it we will praise
          him. Our praises are not suspended upon his answers to our prayers. If
          the labour of the olive should fail, and the field should yield no
          fruit; if the flock should be cut off from the fold, and the herd from
          the stall, yet still would we rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God
          of our salvation. Blessed Spirit, raise us to this state of grace and
          keep us there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of that which we have spoken this is the sum: under every condition,
          and in every necessity, draw nigh to God in prayer, but always bring
          thanksgiving with you. As Joseph said to his brethren, "Ye shall not
          see my face, except your brother be with you;" so may the Lord say to
          you, "You shall not receive my smile unless you bring thankfulness
          with you." Let your prayers be like those ancient missals which one
          sometimes sees, in which the initial letters of the prayers are gilded
          and adorned with a profusion of colours, the work of cunning writers.
          Let even the general confession of sin and the litany of mournful
          petitions have at least one illuminated letter. Illuminate your
          prayers; light them up with rays of thanksgiving all the way through;
          and when you come together to pray forget not to make melody unto the
          Lord with psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, I shall drive at the same point, while I try to show THE
          EVIL OF THE ABSENCE OF THANKSGIVING in our prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, we should be chargeable with ingratitude. Are we
          to be always receiving and never to return thanks? Aristotle rightly
          observes: "A return is required to preserve friendship between two
          persons," and as we have nothing else to give to God except gratitude,
          let us abound therein. If we have no fruit of the field, let us at
          least render to him the fruit of our lips. Have you no thanks to
          bring? How, then, can you expect further favours? Does not liberality
          itself close its hand when ingratitude stands in the way? What, never
          a word of gratitude to him from whom all blessings flow! Then may even
          the ungodly despise you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, it would argue great selfishness if we did not combine praise
          with prayer. Can it be right to think only of ourselves, to pray for
          benefits and never honour our Benefactor? Are we going to import the
          detestable vice of avarice into spiritual things, and only care for
          our own souls' good? What, no thought for God's glory! No idea of
          magnifying his great and blessed name! God forbid that we should fall
          into a spirit so mean and narrow. Healthy praise and thanksgiving must
          be cultivated, because they prevent prayer from becoming overgrown
          with the mildew of selfishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanksgiving also prevents prayer from becoming an exhibition of the
          want of faith; for indeed some prayer is rather a manifestation of the
          absence of faith than the exercise of confidence in God. If when I am
          in trouble I still bless the Lord for all I suffer, therein my faith
          is seen. If before I obtain the mercy, I thank God for the grace which
          I have not yet tasted, therein my faith is manifest. What, is our
          faith such that it only sings in the sunshine? Have we no nightingale
          music for our God? Is our trust like the swallow, which must leave us
          in winter? Is our faith a flower which needs the conservatory to keep
          it alive? Can it not blossom like the gentian at the foot of the
          frozen glacier, where the damp and chill of adversity surround it? I
          trust it can, it ought to do so, and we ought to feel that we can
          praise and bless God when outward circumstances appear rather to
          demand sighs than songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to thank God in our prayers would argue willfulness, and want of
          submission to his will. Must everything be ordered according to our
          mind? To refuse to praise unless we have our own way is great
          presumption, and shows that like a naughty child we will sulk if we
          cannot be master. I might illustrate the willfulness of many a
          supplication by that of a little boy who was very diligent in saying
          his prayers, but was at the same time disobedient, ill-tempered, and
          the pest of the house. His mother told him that she thought it was
          mere hypocrisy for him to pretend to pray. He replied, "No, mother,
          indeed it is not, for I pray God to lead you and father to like my
          ways better than you do." Numbers of people want the Lord to like
          their ways better, but they do not intend to follow the ways of the
          Lord. Their minds are contrary to God and will not submit to his will,
          and therefore there is no thanksgiving in them. Praise in a prayer is
          indicative of an humble, submissive, obedient spirit, and when it is
          absent we may suspect willfulness and self-seeking. Very much of the
          prayer of rebellious hearts is the mere growling of an angry
          obstinacy, the whine of an ungratified self-conceit. God must do this
          and he must do that, or else we will not love him. What baby talk!
          What spoiled children such are! A little whipping will do them good.
          "I have never believed in the goodness of God," said one, "ever since
          he took my dear mother away." I knew a good man whose child was on the
          verge of the grave; when I went to see her he charged me not to
          mention death to her, for he said, "I do not believe God could do such
          an unkind action as take my only child away." When I assured him that
          she would surely die in a few days, and that he must not quarrel with
          the will of the Lord, he stood firm in his rebellion. He prayed, but
          he could not bless God, and it was no marvel that his heart sank
          within him, and he refused to be comforted, when at last his child
          died, as we all felt sure she would. He became afterwards resigned,
          but his want of acquiescence cost him many a smart. This will not do;
          this quarreling with God is poor work! Resignation comes to the heart
          like an angel unawares, and when we entertain it our soul is
          comforted. We may ask for the child's life, but we must also thank the
          Lord that the dear life has been prolonged so long as it has been, and
          we must put the child and everything else into our Father's hands and
          say, "If thou shouldest take all away, yet still will I bless thy
          name, O thou Most High." This is acceptable prayer, because it is not
          soured by the leaven of self-will, but salted with thankfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must mingle our thanksgivings with our prayers, or else we may fear
          that our mind is not in harmony with the divine will. Recollect, dear
          friends, that prayer does not alter the mind of God: it never was the
          intent of prayer that it should attempt anything of the kind. Prayer
          is the shadow of the decrees of the Eternal. God has willed such a
          thing, and he makes his saints to will it, and express their will in
          prayer. Prayer is the rustling of the wings of the angels who are
          bringing the blessing to us. It is written, "Delight thyself also in
          the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart." It is
          not said that he will give the desire of his heart to every Jack and
          Tom; but you must first delight in the Lord, and when your mind finds
          all her joy in God then it is clear that God and you, as far as it can
          be, are standing on the same plane and moving in the same direction,
          and now you shall have the desire of your heart because the desire of
          your heart is the desire of God's heart. Character, as much as faith,
          lies at the basis of prevalence in prayer. I do not mean in the case
          of the prayer of the sinner when he is seeking mercy, but I mean in
          the habitual prayers of the godly. There are some men who cannot pray
          so as to prevail, for sin has made them weak, and God walks contrary
          to them because they walk contrary to him. He who has lost the light
          of God's countenance has also lost much of the prevalence of his
          prayers. You do not suppose that every Israelite could have gone to
          the top of Carmel and opened the windows of heaven as Elijah did. No,
          he must first be Elijah, for it is the effectual, fervent prayer, not
          of every man, but of a righteous man, that availeth much; and when the
          Lord has put your heart and my heart into an agreement with him then
          we shall pray and prevail. What did our Lord say -- "If ye abide in
          me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall
          be done unto you." Doubtless many lose power in prayer because their
          lives are greivous in the sight of the Lord, and he cannot smile upon
          them. Will any father listen to the requests of a child who has set
          himself up in opposition to parental authority? The obedient, tender,
          loving child, who would not wish for anything which you did not think
          right to give, is he whose requests you are pleased to consider and
          fulfil; yea, more, you even anticipate the wishes of such a child, and
          before he calls you answer him. May we be such children of the great
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the third place, let us consider THE RESULT OF THE
          PRESENCE OF THIS THANKSGIVING IN CONNECTION WITH PRAYER. According to
          the context, the presence of thanksgiving in the heart together with
          prayer is productive of peace. "In everything by prayer and
          supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
          God, and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
          your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Now that peace, that
          conscious calm, that divine serenity, which is described as the peace
          of God, is not produced by prayer alone, but by prayer with
          thanksgiving. Some men pray, and therein they do well; but for lack of
          mixing thanksgiving with it their prayer agitates them, and they come
          away from the closet even more anxious than when they entered it. If
          they mingled in their petitions that sweet powder of the merchants,
          which is called praise, and mixed it after the art of the apothecary,
          in due proportions, the blessing of God would come with it, causing
          repose of heart. If we bless our gracious Lord for the very trouble we
          pray against; if we bless him for the very mercy which we need, as
          though it had already come; if we resolve to praise him whether we
          receive the boon or not, learning in whatsoever state we are therewith
          to be content, then "the peace of God, which passeth all
          understanding, will keep our hearts and minds by Christ Jesus."
          Brethren, as you value this divine rest of spirit, as you prize
          constant serenity of soul, I beseech you, mingle praises with your
          prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next effect of it will be this: the thanksgiving will often warm
          the soul, and enable it to pray. I believe it is the experience of
          many who love secret devotion that at times they cannot pray, for
          their heart seems hard, cold, dumb, and almost dead. Do not pump up
          unwilling and formal prayer, my brethren; but take down the hymn-book
          and sing. While you praise the Lord for what you have, you will find
          your rocky heart begin to dissolve and flow in rivers. You will be
          encouraged to plead with the Lord because you will remember what you
          have aforetime received at his hand. If you had an empty wagon to
          raise to the mouth of a coal-pit, it might be a very difficult task
          for you; but the work is managed easily by the common-sense of the
          miners. They make the full wagons, as they run down, pull the empty
          wagons up the incline. Now, when your heart is loaded with praise for
          mercy received, let it run down the incline, and draw up the empty
          wagon of your desires, and you will thus find it easy to pray. Cold
          and chill prayers are always to be deplored, and if by so simple a
          method as entreating the Lord to accept our thanksgiving our hearts
          can be warmed and renewed, let us by all means take care to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I believe that when a man begins to pray with thanksgiving he
          is upon the eve of receiving the blessing. God's time to bless you has
          come when you begin to praise him as well as pray to him. God has his
          set time to favour us, and he will not grant us our desire until the
          due season has arrived. But the time has come when you begin to bless
          the Lord. Now, take an instance of this in Second Chronicles 20:20 --
          Jehoshaphat went out to fight with an exceeding great army, and mark
          how he achieved the victory. "They rose early in the morning and went
          forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth,
          Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of
          Jerusalem; believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
          believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. And when he had consulted
          with the people he appointed" -- what? warriors, captains? No, that
          was all done, but he "appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should
          praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and
          to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when
          they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the
          children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against
          Judah; and they were smitten." Victory came when they began to sing
          and praise. You shall get your answers to prayer when you multiply
          your thanksgivings in all your prayers and supplications: rest you
          sure of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our thanksgiving will show that the reason for our waiting is now
          exhausted; that the waiting has answered its purpose, and may now come
          to a joyful end. Sometimes we are not in a fit state to receive a
          blessing, but when we reach the condition of thankfulness, then is the
          time when it is safe for God to indulge us. A professing Christian
          came to his minister once and said, "Sir, you say we should always
          pray." "Yes, my friend, undoubtedly." "But then, Sir, I have been
          praying for twelve months that I might enjoy the comforts of religion,
          and I am no happier than before. I have made that my one perpetual
          prayer, that I might enjoy the comforts of religion, and I do not feel
          joy nor even peace of mind; in fact, I have more doubts and fears than
          ever I had." "Yes," said his minister, "and that is the natural result
          of such a selfish prayer. Why, dear friend," he said, "come and kneel
          down with me, and let us pray in another manner, Father, glorify thy
          name! Thy kingdom come.' Now," said he, "go and offer those petitions
          and get to work to try to make it true, and see if you do not soon
          enjoy the comforts of religion." There is a great deal in that fact:
          if you will but desire God to be glorified, and aim at glorifying him
          yourself, then shall the joys of true godliness come to you in answer
          to prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time for the blessing is when you begin to praise God for it. For,
          brethren, you may be sure that when you put up a thanksgiving on the
          ground that God has answered your prayer, you really have prevailed
          with God. Suppose you had promised to some poor woman that you would
          give her a meal tomorrow. You might forget it, you know; but suppose
          when the morning came she sent her little girl with a basket for it,
          she would be likely to get it I think. But, suppose that she sent in
          addition a little note in which the poor soul thanked you for your
          great kindness, could you have the heart to say, "My dear girl, I
          cannot attend to you today. Come another time"? Oh dear no, if the
          cupboard was bare you would send out to get something, because the
          good soul so believed in you that she had sent you thanks for it
          before she received your gift. Well, now, trust the Lord in the same
          manner. He cannot run back from his Word, my brethren. Believing
          prayer holds him, but believing thanksgiving binds him. If it is not
          in your own heart, though you be evil, to refuse to give what you have
          promised when that promise is so believed that the person rejoices as
          though he had it; then depend upon it the good God will not find it in
          his heart to refuse. The time for reception is fully come because
          thanksgiving for that reception fills your heart. I leave the matter
          with you. If you are enabled to pray in that fashion, great good will
          come to yourselves, and to the church of God, and to the world at
          large by such prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think I hear in this audience somebody saying, "But I cannot
          pray so. I do not know how to pray. Oh, that I knew how to pray! I am
          a poor, guilty sinner. I cannot mix any thanksgiving with my
          supplications." Ah, my dear soul, do not think about that just now. I
          am not so much preaching to you as I am preaching to the people of
          God. For you it is quite enough to say -- "God be merciful to me a
          sinner." And yet I will venture to say that there is praise in such a
          petition. You are implicitly praising the justice of God, and you are
          praising his mercy by appealing to him. When the prodigal returned,
          and he began his prayer by saying, "I am not worthy to be called thy
          son," there was in that confession a real praise of the father's
          goodness, of which he was unworthy to partake. But you need not to
          think about this matter at present, for first you have to find Jesus,
          and eternal life in him. Go and plead the merit of Jesus, and cast
          yourself upon the love and mercy of God in him and he will not cast
          you away: and then another day, when you thus have found and known
          him, take care that the thanksgiving for your salvation never ceases.
          Even when you are most hungry, and poor, and needy in the future
          continue to bless your saving Lord, and say, "This poor man cried, and
          the LORD heard him: and because the LORD inclined his ear unto me I
          will praise his name as long as I live."

        <p>God bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>
