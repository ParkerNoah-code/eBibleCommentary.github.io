        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.96</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, August 10, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors." -- Romans 8:12.</p>
        <p>
          OBSERVE the title whereby he addressed the Church -- "Brethren." It
          was the gospel which taught Paul how to say brother. If he had not
          been a Christian, his Jewish dignity would never have condescended to
          call a Roman -- "brother;" for a Jew sneered at the Gentile, and
          called him "dog." But now in the breast of this "Hebrew of Hebrews,"
          there is the holy recognition of Christian fraternity without reserve
          or hypocrisy. The gospel softened the breast of Paul, and made him
          forget all national animosities, otherwise, one of the down-trodden
          race would not have called his oppressor, "brother." The Roman had his
          iron foot on the Jew; yet Paul addresses those, who subjugated his
          race, as "brethren." We repeat, a third time, it was the gospel which
          implanted in the soul of Paul the feeling of brotherhood, and removed
          every wall of partition which divided him from any of the Lord's
          elect. "So then," he said, "we are no more strangers and foreigners,
          but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God." He
          proclaimed the doctrine of the "one blood," and gloried in the fact of
          "one family" in Christ. He felt within him affinities with all the
          blood-bought race, and loved them all. He had not seen many of those
          whom he addressed; yet they were known to him, in the Spirit, as
          partakers of one glorious and blessed hope, and, therefore, he called
          them "brethren." My friends, there is a cementing power in the grace
          of God which can scarcely be over estimated. It resets the dislocated
          bones of society, rivets the bonds of friendship, and welds the broken
          metal of manhood into one united mass. It makes all brethren who feel
          its power. Grace links mankind in a common brotherhood; grace makes
          the great man give his hand to the poor, and confess a heavenly
          relationship; grace constrains the intellectual, the learned, the
          polite, to stoop from their dignity to take hold of the ignorant and
          unlettered, and call them friends; grace weaves the threads of our
          separate individualities into one undivided unity. Let the gospel be
          really felt in the mind and it will toll the knell of selfishness, it
          will bring down the proud from their elevated solitude, and it will
          restore the down-trodden to the rights of our common manhood. We need
          only the gospel thoroughly preached to bring about "liberty, equality,
          and fraternity," in the highest and best sense of these words. Not the
          "liberty, equality and fraternity," which the democrat seeks for,
          which is frequently another name for his own superiority, but that
          which is true and real -- that which will make us all free in the
          Spirit, make us all equal in the person of Christ Jesus, and give us
          all the fraternity of brethren, seeing that we are all one with our
          Lord, in the common bond of gospel relationship. Let the truths of
          Christianity work out their perfect work: and pride, bitterness,
          wrath, envy, and malice, must see their graves. This and this alone
          can restore the peace of divided families, and unite disputing
          relatives. Only let the gospel be preached, and there shall be an end
          of war; let it thoroughly pervade all ranks of society, and saturate
          the mind of nations, and there shall be no more lifting of the spears,
          they shall be used for pruning hooks; no bathing of swords in blood,
          for they shall be turned into the peaceful ploughshares of the soil;
          we shall then have no hosts encountering hosts; we shall have no
          millions slain for widows to deplore; but every man shall meet every
          other man, and call him "brother." And men of every kindred, and of
          every tribe, shall see in the face of every man, a relative allied to
          them by ties of blood. I am sure I feel, myself, the force of this
          word "brother," with regard to many of you. If ye be partakers of that
          glorious hope, if ye be believers in our glorious Redeemer, if ye have
          put your trust under the shadow of his wings, my hand and my heart
          with it, there is that word "brother" for you. And so addressing you,
          who love the Lord, under that title; I come at one to the text,
          "Brethren, we are debtors." We are all of us under obligations; let us
          consider the fact in the following manner: -- First, how are we to
          understand this? and secondly, how ought it to affect us?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. HOW ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND THIS, "Brethren, we are debtors"? We may
          understand it in a thousand sense, for indeed we are debtors.
          Brethren, we who know and love the Lord, are debtors, not to one
          creditor, but to many.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are debtors to the past. Methinks I see the fathers at their
          midnight lamps, the ancient saints in their much-frequented closets,
          the thrice brave preachers in their pulpits denouncing error, and the
          faithful pastors reproving wrong. To such who have preceded us we owe
          the purity of the Church, and to them we are debtors. methinks I see
          the martyrs and confessors rising from their tombs -- I mark their
          hands still stained with blood, and their bodies scarred with the
          wound of persecution. They tell me, that they of old maintained the
          truth, and preached it, in the midst of fire and sword -- that they
          bore death in defence of the cause of God, that they might hand down
          his holy word inviolate to us! I look on them, and see among their
          glorious ranks, some whose names are celebrated in every Christian
          land as the bold "lions of God," the immovable pillars of truth; men
          of whom the world was not worthy, whose praise is in all the churches,
          and who are now nearest the eternal throne. And as I look on them, and
          they on me, I turn to you all and say, "Brethren, we are debtors." We
          are debtors to the men who crossed the sea, and laughed at the fury of
          the storm, who risked the journeying, and the weariness, and all the
          various perils to which they were exposed, by reason of robbers and
          false brethren; we are debtors to each stake at Smithfield; we are
          debtors to the sacred ashes of the thousands who have there followed
          Jesus even unto death; we are debtors to the headless bodies of those
          who were beheaded for Christ Jesus; we are debtors to those who dared
          the lions in the amphitheatre and fought with wild beasts at Ephesus;
          we are debtors to the massacred thousands of the bloody church of
          Rome, and the murdered myriads of her pagan predecessors; we are
          debtors to them all. Remember the bloody day of St. Bartholomew, the
          valleys of Piedmont, and the mountains of Switzerland. Let the sacred
          mounds of our fathers' sepulchres speak to us. Is not this Bible
          opened and read by us all, the gift of their self-denying
          faithfulness? Is not the free air we breathe the purchase of their
          death? Did not they, by bitter suffering, achieve our liberty for us?
          And are we not debtors to them? Shall we not, in some degree, repay
          the immense debt of our obligation by seeking to make the future also
          debtors to us, that our descendants may look back and acknowledge that
          they owe us thank for preserving the Scriptures, for maintaining
          liberty, for glorifying God? Brethren, we are debtors to the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I am quite sure we are debtors to the present. Wherever we go, we
          gather fresh proofs of the common observation, that we are living in a
          most marvellous age. It is an oft-repeated truth, and one which,
          perhaps, has almost lost its meaning from being so oft repeated, that
          this is the very crisis. The world has always been in a crisis, but
          this seems to use to be a peculiar one. We have around us appliances
          for doing good, such as men never possessed before; we behold around
          us machinery for doing evil, such as never was at work even in earth's
          worst days. Good men are labouring, at least with usual zeal, and bad
          men are strenuously plying their craft of evil. Infidelity, popery,
          and every other phase of anti-Christ are now straining every nerve.
          The tug of war is now with us. Look around you and learn your duty.
          The work is not yet done, the time of folding of hands has not yet
          arrived; our swords must not yet see their scabbards, for the foe is
          not yet slain. We see, in many a land, the proudest dynasties and
          tyrannies still crushing, with their mountain-weight, every free
          motion of the consciences and hearts of men. We see, on the other
          hand, the truest heroism for the right, and the greatest devotion to
          the truth in hearts that God has touched. We have a work to do, as
          great as our forefathers, and, perhaps, far greater. The enemies of
          truth are more numerous and subtle than ever, and the needs of the
          Church are greater than at any preceding time. If we be not debtors to
          the present, then men were never debtors to their age and their time.
          Brethren, we are debtors to the hour in which we live. Oh! that we
          might stamp it with truth, and that God might help us to impress upon
          its wings some proof that it has not flown by neglected and unheeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, brethren, we are debtors to the future. If we, the children of
          God, are not valiant for truth now, if we maintain not the great
          standard of God's omnipotent truth, we shall be traitors to our liege
          Lord. Who can tell the fearful consequences to future generations if
          we now betray our trust. If we suffer orthodoxy to fail, or God's
          truth to be dishonored, future generations will despise and execrate
          our name. If we now suffer the good vessel of gospel truth to be
          drifted by adverse winds upon the rock, if we keep not good watch to
          her helm, and cry not well to her great Master that she may led to a
          prosperous end, surely those who are to succeed us will look on us
          with scorn, and say, "Shame on the men, who had so great and glorious
          a mission, and neglected it, and handed down to us a beclouded gospel
          and an impure Church." Stand up ye warriors of the truth, stand up
          firmly, for ye are debtors to the future, even as ye are debtors to
          the past. Sow well, for others must reap. You are fountains for coming
          generations; O, be careful that your streams are pure. May the Spirit
          of God enable you so to live, that you can bequeath your example as a
          legacy to the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as we are debtors to all times, so we are all debtors to all
          classes. But there are some that always get well paid for what they
          do, and, therefore, I shall not mention them, since I am not aware
          that their claims need my advocacy. We may be remarkably indebted to
          members of parliament, but for the little they do they are tolerably
          well rewarded; at least, we take it that the place is more an honour
          to some of them than they are to their place. It may be true that we
          owe a great deal to the higher ranks of society; we may possibly, in
          some mysterious way, be much under obligation to the sacred personages
          who are styled lords and bishops, but it is not necessary that I
          should stand up for their claims, for I have no doubt they will take
          good care of themselves; at any rate they have usually done so, and
          have not allowed themselves to be robbed of much of their deservings.
          (Who would wish that they should? but it is possible to pay too dear,
          especially when you could get on as well without them as with them.) I
          shall not refer to any class of society, and say of them, we are
          debtors, except to one, and that is the poor. My brethren, we are
          debtors to the poor. "What!" says some one, "I, debtor to the poor?"
          Yes, my lady, thou art a debtor to the poorest man that ever walked
          the earth. The beggar shivering in his rags, may owe thee something,
          if thou givest him alms; but thou owest him something more. Charity to
          the poor is a debt. We are not at liberty to give or to refuse. God
          requires us to remember the poor, and their poverty is a claim upon
          our generosity. But in the case of the believing poor, their claim
          upon us is far more binding, and I beseech you do not neglect it. O
          how much we owe them. When I think how the poor toil day after day and
          receive barely enough to keep their souls within their bodies: when I
          think how frequently they serve their Church, unhonored and
          unrewarded, when I know some of them who perform the hardest deeds of
          service for our common Christianity, and are yet passed by with
          neglect and scorn; when I remember how many of them are toiling in the
          Sabbath-school, having neither emolument nor reward; when I consider
          how many of the lower classes are as prayerful, as careful, as honest,
          as upright, as devout, as spiritual as others are, and frequently more
          so, I cannot but say that we are debtors to all God's poor in a very
          large degree. We little know how many a blessing the poor man's prayer
          brings down upon us. I beseech you then, beloved, wherever you see a
          poor saint, wherever you behold an aged Christian, recollect he cannot
          be so much in debt to you as you are to him, for you have much, and he
          has but little, and he cannot be in debt for what he has not. Many of
          you will not feel the force of Christian reasons, let me remind you,
          that even you are obliged to the laboring poor. The rich man hoards
          wealth, the poor man makes it. Great men get the blessing, but poor
          men bring it down from heaven. Some men are the cisterns that hold
          God's rain; but other men are those who pray the rain from heaven,
          like very Elijahs, and many of these are to be found in the lower
          ranks of society. "Brethren, we are debtors;" what I have is not my
          own, but God's; and if it be God's, then it belongs to God's poor.
          What the wealthiest man has is not his own, but God's, and if it be
          God's then it is Christ's, and if Christ's, then his children's; and
          Christ's children are often those who are hungry, and thirsty, and
          destitute, and afflicted, and tormented. Take care then of that class,
          brethren, for we are debtors to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while I have thus mentioned some of the different classes to whom
          we are debtors, I have not yet come to the point on which I desire to
          press your attention. Brethren, we are debtors to our covenant God;
          that is the point which swallows up all. I owe nothing to the past, I
          owe nothing to the future, I owe nothing to the rich, and nothing to
          the poor, compared with what I owe to my God. I am mainly indebted to
          these because I owe so much to my God. Now, Christian, consider how
          thou art a debtor to thy God. Remember thou art now a debtor to God in
          a legal sense, as thou art in Adam, thou art no longer a debtor to
          God's justice as thou once wast. We are all born God's creatures, and
          as such we are debtors to him; to obey him with all our body, and
          soul, and strength. When we have broken his commandments, as we all of
          us have, we are debtors to his justice, and we owe to him a vast
          amount of punishment, which we are not able to pay. But of the
          Christian, it can be said, that he does not owe God's justice a
          solitary farthing; for Christ has paid the debt his people owed. I am
          a debtor to God's love, I am a debtor to God's grace, I am a debtor to
          God's power, I am a debtor to God's forgiving mercy; but I am no
          debtor to his justice -- for he, himself, will never accuse me of a
          debt once paid. It was said, "It is finished!" and by that was meant,
          that what'er his people owed was wiped away for ever from the book of
          remembrance. Christ, to the uttermost, has satisfied divine justice;
          the debt is paid, the hand-writing is nailed to the cross, the receipt
          is given, and we are debtors to God's justice no longer. But then
          because we are not debtors to God in that sense, we become ten times
          more debtors to God than we should have been otherwise. Because he has
          remitted all our debt of sin, we are all the more indebted to him in
          another sense. Oh! Christian, stop and ponder for a moment! What a
          debtor thou art to Divine Sovereignty! Thou art not as some, who say,
          that thou didst choose thyself to be saved; but thou believest that
          God could have destroyed thee, if he had pleased and that it is
          entirely of his own good pleasure that thou art made one of his, while
          others are suffered to perish. Consider, then, how much thou owest to
          his Sovereignty! If he had willed it, thou wouldst have been among the
          damned; if he had not willed thy salvation, all thou couldst do would
          have been utterly powerless to deliver thee from perdition. Remember
          how much thou owest to his disinterested love, which rent his own Son
          from his bosom that he might die for thee! let the cross and bloody
          sweat remind thee of thine obligation. Consider how much you owe to
          his forgiving grace, that after ten thousand affronts he loves you as
          infinitely as ever; and after a myriad of sins, his Spirit still
          resides within you. Consider what you owe to his power; how he has
          raised you from your death in sin, and how he has preserved your
          spiritual life, how he has kept you from falling, and how, though a
          thousand enemies have beset your path, you have been able to hold on
          your way! Consider what thou owest to his immutability. Though thou
          hast changed a thousand times, he has not changed once; though thou
          hast shifted thy intentions, and thy will, yet he has not once swerved
          from his eternal purpose, but still has held thee fast. Consider thou
          art as deep in debt as thou canst be to every attribute of God. To God
          thou owest thyself, and all thou hast. "Brethren, we are debtors."
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not only debtors to God in the light of gratitude for all these
          things; but because of our relationship to him. Are we not his sons,
          and is there not a debt the son owes to the father which a lifetime of
          obedience can never remove? I feel that to the knee that dandled me
          and the breast that gave me sustenance, I owe more than I can ever
          pay; and to him who taught me, and led me in the paths of truth I owe
          so much, that I dare not speak of the tremendous weight of obligation
          due to him. Beloved, if God be a father, where is honor? And if we be
          his sons, are we not thereby bound to love, serve, and obey him?
          Sonship towards an earthly parent brings with it a host of duties, and
          shall the Everlasting Father be unregarded? No. The true son of God
          will never blush to acknowledge that he is in subjection to the Father
          of spirits. He will rather glory in his high connection, and with
          reverence obey the commands of his Heavenly Parent. Remember again, we
          are Christ's brethren, and there is a debt in brotherhood. Brother
          owes to brother what he cannot pay until he dies. It is more than some
          men think to have been rocked in the same cradle and dandled on the
          same knee. Some esteem it nothing. Alas! it is a well-known truth,
          that if you want help you must go anywhere for it, save to your
          brother's house. Go not into thy brother's house in the day of thine
          adversity. Go to the greatest stranger, and he shall help thee; go to
          thy brother, and he shall oft upbraid thee. But this should not be so.
          Brotherhood has its ties of debt, and to my brother I owe what I shall
          not yet pay him. Beloved, are ye brothers of Christ, and do ye think
          that ye owe him no love? Are ye brothers and sisters of the saints,
          and think ye that ye ought not to love and serve them, even to the
          washing of their feet? Oh, yes, I am sure ye ought. I am afraid none
          of us feel enough how much we are debtors to God. Yea, I am certain
          that we do not. It is astonishing how much gratitude a man will feel
          to you if you have been only the instrument of doing him good; but how
          little gratitude he feels to God, the first cause of all! There have
          been many who have been won from drunkenness by hearing the preaching
          of God's Word even under myself, and those persons have been ready to
          carry me on their shoulders, from very gratitude, for joy; but I would
          be bound to say they make a far more feeble display of their
          thankfulness to my Master. At least, they seem to have lost their
          first love to him far sooner than they did to his servant. We remember
          to be grateful to all except our God. Our little debts we can pay.
          Debts of honor, as we call them -- which are no debts in some men's
          eyes -- we can discharge; but the great and solemn debt we owe to God
          is ofttimes passed by, neglected and forgotten. "Brethren, we are
          debtors."

          II. In the second place, very briefly, WHAT OUGHT WE TO DRAW FROM THIS
          DOCTRINE, that we are debtors?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we think we should learn a lesson of humility. If we be debtors
          we never ought to be proud. All we can do for God is but a trifling
          acknowledgment of an infinite obligation; yea, more, our good works
          are gifts of his grace, and do but put us under greater debt to the
          author of them. Stay, then, ye who are puffed up by your achievements,
          consider ye have but poorly performed, not a deed of supererogation,
          but of ordinary duty. How much have you done after all, young man? I
          thought I saw you the other day looking amazingly great, because on
          such an occasion you really had done some little service to Christ's
          Church; and you looked astonishingly proud about it. Young man, didst
          thou do more than thou oughtest to have done? "No, I did not," you
          say; "I was a debtor." Then who should be proud of having paid only a
          part of his debt, when, after all, he owes a great deal more than he
          is worth? Is there anything to be proud of in having paid a farthing
          in the pound? I take it there is not. Let us do what we may, it is but
          a farthing in the pound that we shall ever be able to pay of the debt
          of gratitude we owe to God. It is curious to see how some men are
          proud of being greater debtors than others. One man has ten talents,
          and oh how proud he is, and how he looks down upon another who has but
          one, and says: "Ah, you are a mean man; I have ten talents." Well,
          then, thou owest ten talents, and thy brother owes only one; why
          should you be proud that you owe more than he does? It would be a
          foolish pride indeed, if two prisoners in the Queen's Bench were to
          boast, one saying, "I owe a hundred pounds," and the other replying,
          "I am a greater gentleman than you are, for I owe a thousand." I have
          heard that in the Marshalsea of old they did take rank according to
          the greatness of their debts. It is often so on earth: we take rank at
          times according to the greatness of our talents. But the greatness of
          our talents is only the amount of our debt; for, the more we have, the
          more we owe. If a man walks the streets, sticking his bill upon his
          breast, and proclaiming with pride that he is a debtor, you would say,
          "Sure he must be a madman; lock him up." And so if a man walk through
          the earth and lift up his head because of what God has given him, and
          say, "I am not to notice the poor, I am not to shake hands with the
          ignorant, because I am so great and mighty," you may with equal reason
          say, "Take away that poor creature, his pride is his insanity; put him
          in safe custody, and let him learn that all he has is his debt, and
          that he has no cause for pride."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, how zealous we should be for our Master! Though we cannot
          pay all, we can at least acknowledge the debt. It is something on the
          part of a debtor if he will but acknowledge the claim of his creditor.
          Oh! how ought we day by day to seek, by living unto God, to
          acknowledge the debt we owe to him; and, if we cannot pay him the
          principal, yet to give him some little interest upon the talent which
          he has lent to us, and upon those stupendous mercies which he has
          granted to us. I beseech you, my dear friends, take this thought with
          you wherever you go: "I am a debtor, I must serve my God. It is not
          left to my pleasure whether I will do it or no; but I am a debtor, and
          I must serve him."
        </p>
        <p>
          If we all believed this, how much easier it would be to get our
          churches into good order! I go to one brother, and I say, "Brother,
          there is such-and-such an office in the Sabbath-school; will you take
          it?" "Well, sir, you know how much I love the cause, and how earnest I
          am in doing everything that I can to serve my Maker; but (now comes
          the end of it all) I really work so hard all the week that I cannot
          afford to go out on the Sabbath to Sunday-schools." There you see,
          that man does not know that he is a debtor. I take him a bill
          to-morrow morning, and he says, "Do you coming begging?" I say, "No; I
          have brought a bill; look at it." "Oh, yes," he says, "I see; there is
          the cash." Now that is the way to act; to feel and acknowledge that
          you are a debtor; when there is a thing to be done, to do it, and to
          say, "Do not thank me for it, I have only done what I ought to have
          done; I have only paid the debt that I owed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let me give you just one piece of homely advice before I send you
          away. Be just before you are generous, and especially before you are
          generous to yourselves. Take care that you pay your debts before you
          spend money upon your pleasures. I would recommend that to many
          Christians. Now, there are some of you here incommoding us to-night,
          and making us very hot. You have been very generous to yourselves by
          coming here, but not very just to your ministers in neglecting the
          places of worship where you ought to have gone. You said to
          yourselves, "We have no doubt we ought to be there; that is our debt;
          nevertheless we should like to gratify our curiosity for once, by
          hearing this singular preacher, who will be sure to say something
          extravagant that will furnish the occasion for a joke for the next
          fortnight." Now, why did you come here till you had paid your debt?
          You should have rallied round your own minister and strengthened his
          hands in the work of the Lord. Again; how many a man is there who
          says, "I want such-and-such a luxury; I know the cause of God demands
          of me more than I give it, but I must have that luxury, that shilling
          shall go to myself, and not to God." Now if you had a debtor who owed
          you more than he could pay, and you saw him going off on pleasure in a
          horse and gig to-morrow, you would say, "It is all very well his
          having that fine horse and gig, and going down to Greenwich; but I
          would rather that he should pay me the ten pound note I lent him the
          other day. If he cannot afford to pay, he ought to keep at home till
          he can." So in regard to God. We come and spend our time and our money
          upon our pleasures before we pay our just and fair debts. Now, what is
          not right towards man is not right towards God. If it is robbing man
          to spend the money in pleasure wherewith we ought to pay our debts; it
          is robbing God if we employ our time, our talents, or our money, in
          anything but his service, until we feel we have done our share in that
          service. I beseech you, members of churches, deacons, or whatever you
          may be, lay this to heart. To God's cause you are debtors. Do not
          expect to get thanked at last for doing much, for after all you have
          done, you will only have done what is your duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, farewell to such of you as are debtors in that sense; but just
          one word to those who are debtors in the other sense; Sinner, thou who
          owest to God's justice, thou who hast never been pardoned; what wilt
          thou do when pay-day comes/ My friend over there, you who have run up
          a score of black sins, what will you do when pay-day comes, and no
          Christ to pay your debts for you? What will you do if you are out of
          God and out of Christ at the last pay-day, when the whole roll of your
          debts to God shall be opened, and you have no Christ to give you a
          discharge? I beseech thee, "Agree with thy creditor quickly, whilst
          thou art in the way with him; lest he deliver thee to the judge, and
          the judge deliver thee to the officer to cast thee into prison: verily
          I say unto thee, thou shall not come out till thou hast paid the
          uttermost farthing." But if thou agreest with thy creditor, he will,
          for Jesus' sake, blot out all thy debts, and set thee at liberty, so
          that thou shalt never be amenable for thine iniquities.<br />
