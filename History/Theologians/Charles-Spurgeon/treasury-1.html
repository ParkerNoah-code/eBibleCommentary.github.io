        <font color="#0000ff">BLESSED</font>—see how this Book of Psalms opens
        with a benediction, even as did the famous Sermon of our Lord upon the
        Mount! The word translated "blessed" is a very expressive one. The
        original word is <i> plural</i>, hence we may learn the
        <i>multiplicity of the blessings </i>
        which shall rest upon the man whom God has justified, and the perfection
        and greatness of the blessedness he shall enjoy. We might read it, "Oh,
        the blessednesses!" and we may well regard it as a joyful acclamation of
        the gracious man's felicity. May the like benediction rest on us!
        <p align="justify">
          Here the gracious man is described both <b>negatively </b> (Psalm 1:1)
          and positively (Psalm 1:2). He is a man:
          <font color="#0000ff">
            who does not <i>walk </i>in the counsel of the ungodly. </font
          >He takes wiser counsel, and walks in the commandments of the Lord his
          God. To him the ways of piety are paths of peace and pleasantness. His
          footsteps are ordered by the Word of God, and not by the cunning and
          wicked devices of carnal men. It is a rich sign of inward grace—when
          the outward walk is changed, and when ungodliness is put far from our
          actions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Note next,
          <font color="#0000ff"
            >he <i>stands </i>not in the way of sinners. </font
          >His company is of a choicer sort than it was. Although a sinner
          himself, he is now a blood-washed sinner, quickened by the Holy
          Spirit, and renewed in heart. Standing by the rich grace of God in the
          congregation of the righteous, he dares not herd with the multitude
          that do evil.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again it is said,
          <font color="#0000ff"
            >nor <i>sits </i> in the seat of the scornful. </font
          >He finds no rest in the atheist's scoffings. Let others make a mock
          of sin, of eternity, of hell and heaven, and of the Eternal God; this
          man has learned better philosophy than that of the infidel, and has
          too much sense of God's presence to endure to hear His name
          blasphemed. The seat of the scorner may be very lofty—but it is very
          near to the gate of hell! Let us flee from it, for it shall soon be
          empty, and destruction shall swallow up the man who sits therein.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Mark the <i>downward gradation</i> in the first verse:
          <br />
          He <i>walks </i>not in the <i>counsel of the ungodly</i>, <br />
          Nor <i>stands </i>in the <i>way </i>of <i>sinners, <br /> </i>Nor
          <i>sits </i>in the <i>seat of scornful</i>.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          When men are living in sin they go from bad to worse. At first they
          merely <i>walk </i>in the counsel of the careless and
          <i>ungodly, </i>who forget God—the evil is rather practical than
          habitual—but after that, they become habituated to evil, and they
          <i>stand </i>in the way of open <i>sinners </i>who willfully violate
          God's commandments; and if let alone, they go one step further, and
          become themselves pestilent teachers and tempters of others, and thus
          they <i>sit in the seat of the scornful. </i>They have taken their
          degree in vice, and they are installed as true
          <i> Doctors of Damnation</i>, and are looked up to by others as
          <i>Masters in Belial</i>. But the blessed man, the man to whom all the
          blessings of God belong, can hold no communion with such characters as
          these. He keeps himself pure from these <i>moral lepers; </i>he puts
          away evil things from him as garments spotted by the flesh; he comes
          out from among the wicked, and goes outside the camp, bearing the
          reproach of Christ. O for grace to be thus separate from sinners!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The psalmist says more to the point about <i>true happiness </i>in
          this short Psalm than any one of the philosophers, or all of them put
          together; they did but beat the bush, God has here put the bird into
          our hand!<i> John Trapp, 1660</i>
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"

        >And now mark his <b>positive </b> character.<font color="#0000ff">
          His delight is in the law of the Lord. </font
        >He is not <i>under </i>the law as a curse and condemnation—but he is
        <i>in </i>it, and he delights to be in it as his rule of life. He
        delights, moreover, to <font color="#0000ff">meditate </font>in it, to
        read it <i>by day, </i>and think upon it <i>by night. </i>He takes a
        text and carries it with him all day long; and in the night watches,
        when sleep forsakes his eyelids, he muses upon the Word of God. In the
        <i>day </i>of his prosperity he sings <i>psalms </i>out of the Word of
        God, and in the <i>night </i>of his affliction he comforts himself with
        <i>promises </i>out of the same book.
        <p align="justify">
          Meditation manifests what a man really is; by his meditations—he may
          take a measure of his heart, whether it be good or bad. "For as a man
          thinks in his heart—so is he." Proverbs 23:7. As the meditation
          is—such is the man. Meditation is the touchstone of a Christian; it
          shows what metal he is made of. It is a spiritual index; the index
          shows what is in the book, so meditation shows what is in the heart.
          <i>Thomas Watson's Saints' Spiritual Delight.</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Meditation <i>chews the cud</i>, and gets the sweetness and nutritive
          virtue of the Word into the heart and life! This is the way the godly
          bring forth much fruit. <i>Ashwood's Heavenly Trade, 1688.</i>

        And yet, in David's day, how small was the volume of inspiration, for
        they had scarcely anything but the first five books of Moses! How much
        more, then, should we prize the whole written Word which it is our
        privilege to have in all our houses! But, alas, what ill treatment is
        given to this <i>angel from heaven! </i>We are not all
        <i> Berean searchers </i>of the Scriptures. How few among us can lay
        claim to the blessing of the text! Perhaps some of you can claim a sort
        of <i> negative purity</i>, because you do not walk in the way of the
        ungodly; but let me ask you—Is your delight in the law of God? Do you
        study God's Word? Is it your best companion and hourly guide? If not,
        this blessing belongs not to you!
        <font color="#0000ff"
          ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></b>And he shall be like a tree
          planted</font
        >—not a wild tree—but "a tree <i>planted," </i>chosen, considered as
        property, cultivated and secured from the last terrible uprooting, for
        "every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted
        up!" Mt 15:13.
        <font color="#0000ff">
          <p align="justify">By the rivers of water;</p></font
        >
        so that even if one river should fail, he has another. The rivers of
        pardon and the rivers of grace, the rivers of the promise and the rivers
        of communion with Christ, are never failing sources of supply. He is
        "like a tree planted by the rivers of water",
        <font color="#0000ff">that brings forth his fruit in his season;</font>
        not unseasonable graces, like untimely figs, which are never full
        flavored. But the man who delights in God's Word, being taught by it,
        brings forth patience in the time of suffering, faith in the day of
        trial, and holy joy in the hour of prosperity.
        <p align="justify">
          Fruitfulness is an essential quality of a gracious man, and that
          fruitfulness should be seasonable. The Lord's trees are all
          evergreens. No winter's cold can destroy their verdure; and yet,
          unlike evergreens in our country, they are all fruit bearers.
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff">
          <p align="justify">His leaf also shall not wither;</p></font
        >
        his faintest word shall be everlasting; his little deeds of love shall
        be had in remembrance. Not simply shall his fruit be preserved—but
        <i>his leaf </i>also. He shall neither lose his beauty nor his
        fruitfulness.
        <font color="#0000ff">
          <p align="justify">And whatever he does shall prosper.</p></font
        >Blessed is the man who has such a promise as this! But we must not
        always estimate the fulfillment of a promise—by our own eye sight. How
        often, my brethren, if we judge by feeble sense, may we come to the
        mournful conclusion of Jacob, "All these things are against me!" For
        though we know our interest in the promise, yet we are so tried and
        troubled—that sight sees the very reverse of what that promise
        foretells. But to the 'eye of faith' this word is sure, and by it we
        perceive that our works are prospered, even when everything seems to go
        against us.
        <p align="justify">
          It is not outward prosperity which the Christian most desires and
          values; it is soul prosperity which he longs for. Even in adversity,
          there is a true prospering, for it is often for the soul's health—that
          we would be poor, afflicted and tried. Our worst things—are often our
          best things! As there is a curse wrapped up in the wicked man's
          mercies—so there is a blessing concealed in the godly man's crosses,
          losses and sorrows. The trials of the saint are a divine husbandry, by
          which he grows and brings forth abundant fruit.
        </p>

          ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 4.</p></b></font
        ><font color="#818100"> </font>We have now come to the second head of
        the Psalm. In this verse the contrast of the dreadful estate of the
        wicked—is employed to heighten the coloring of that lovely and pleasant
        picture which precedes it. This may be rendered as,
        <font color="#0000ff">Not so the ungodly, not so! </font>And we are
        hereby to understand that whatever good thing is said of the righteous
        is <i>not </i>true in the case of the ungodly.
        <p align="justify">
          Oh! how terrible is it to have a <i>double negative </i> put upon the
          promises! and yet this is just the condition of the ungodly. Mark the
          use of the term <font color="#0000ff">ungodly</font>, for, as we have
          seen in the opening of the Psalm, these are the beginners in evil, and
          are the least offensive of sinners. Oh! if such is the sad state of
          those who quietly continue in their morality, and neglect their
          God—what must be the condition of open sinners and shameless infidels!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The first sentence is a negative description of the ungodly, and the
          second is the positive picture. Here is their <i>character</i>,
          <font color="#0000ff">they are like chaff</font>, intrinsically
          worthless, dead, unserviceable, without substance, and easily carried
          away. Here, also, mark their <i>doom, </i
          ><font color="#0000ff">the wind drives away; </font> death shall hurry
          them with its terrible blast into the fire in which they shall be
          utterly consumed!
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Chaff.</p></font> Here, by the
        way, we may let the wicked know they have a thanks to give, which they
        little think of; that they may thank the godly for all the good days
        they live upon the earth, seeing it is for their sakes and not for their
        own—that they enjoy them. For as the chaff while it is united and keeps
        close to the wheat, enjoys some privileges for the wheat's sake, and is
        laid up carefully in the barn; but as soon as it is divided, and parted
        from the wheat—it is cast out and scattered by the wind. So the wicked,
        while the godly are in company and live among them, partake for their
        sake of some blessedness promised to the godly; but if the godly forsake
        them or be taken from them, then either a deluge of water comes suddenly
        upon them, as it did upon the old world when <i>Noah </i>left it; or a
        deluge of fire, as it did upon Sodom, when <i>Lot </i>left it, and went
        out of the city. <i>Sir Richard Baker. </i
        ><font color="#0000ff"> <p align="justify">Drives away,</p></font>This
        shows the vehement tempest of death, which sweeps away the soul of the

        stand their ground; they shall flee away; they shall not stand in their
        own defense; for they shall blush and be covered with eternal contempt.

          Well may the saints long for heaven, for no evil men shall dwell

          All our congregations upon earth are <i>mixed</i>. Every Church has
          one devil in it. The <i>tares </i>grow in the same furrows as the

          chaff. Sinners <i>MIX </i>with saints—as dross mingles with gold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God's precious diamonds still lie in the same field with worthless
          pebbles. Righteous Lots are continually vexed by the men of Sodom, on
          this side heaven. Let us rejoice then, that in "the general assembly
          and church of the firstborn" above, there shall by no means be
          admitted a single unrenewed soul.

          Sinners cannot live in heaven. They would be out of their element.
          Sooner could a fish live in a tree—than the wicked in Paradise. Heaven
          would be an intolerable hell—to an impenitent man, even if he could be
          allowed to enter. But such a privilege shall never be granted to the
          man who perseveres in his iniquities. May God grant that we may have a

          He is constantly looking on their way, and though it may be often in
          mist and darkness, yet the Lord knows it. If it is in the clouds and
          tempest of affliction—he understands it. He numbers the hairs of our
          head; he will not allow any real evil to befall us. "He knows the way

        ploughs the furrows of earth, and sows a harvest here, which shall never
        be fully reaped until he enters the enjoyments of eternity. But as for
        the wicked, he ploughs the sea, and though there may seem to be a
        shining trail behind his keel, yet the waves shall pass over it, and the
        place that knew him shall know him no more forever.
        <p align="justify">
          The very "way" of the ungodly shall perish. If it exists in
