          If these things are so, it is certain that believers contracting
          marriages with Gentiles are guilty of fornication, and are to be
          excluded from all communication with the brotherhood, in accordance
          with the letter of the apostle, who says that "with persons of that
          kind there is to be no taking of food even." Or shall we "in that day"
          produce (our) marriage certificates before the Lord's tribunal, and
          allege that a marriage such as He Himself has forbidden has been duly
          contracted? What is prohibited (in the passage just referred to) is
          not "adultery;" it is not "fornication." The admission of a strange
          man (to your couch) less violates "the temple of God," less commingles
          "the members of Christ" with the members of an adulteress. So far as I
          know, "we are not our own, but bought with a price;" and what kind of
          price? The blood of God. In hurting this flesh of ours, therefore, we
          hurt Him directly. What did that man mean who said that "to wed a
          stranger' was indeed a sin, but a very small one?" whereas in other
          cases (setting aside the injury done to the flesh which pertains to
          the Lord) every voluntary sin against the Lord is great. For, in as
          far as there was a power of avoiding it, in so far is it burdened with
          the charge of contumacy.

          Let us now recount the other dangers or wounds (as I have said) to
          faith, foreseen by the apostle; most grievous not to the flesh merely,
          but likewise to the spirit too. For who would doubt that faith
          undergoes a daily process of obliteration by unbelieving intercourse?
          "Evil confabulations corrupt good morals;" how much more fellowship of
          life, and indivisible intimacy! Any and every believing woman must of
          necessity obey God. And how can she serve two lords -- the Lord, and
          her husband -- a Gentile to boot? For in obeying a Gentile she will
          carry out Gentile practices, -- personal attractiveness, dressing of
          the head, worldly elegancies, baser blandishments, the very secrets
          even of matrimony tainted: not, as among the saints, where the duties
          of the sex are discharged with honour (shown) to the very necessity
          (which makes them incumbent), with modesty and temperance, as beneath
          the eyes of God.<br />
