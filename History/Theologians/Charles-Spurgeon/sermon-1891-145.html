          1. Now God shall be glorified in His handiwork, fitting it so as to be
          conformable to, and modelled after, His own Son. For by the hands of
          the Father, that is, by the Son and the Holy Spirit, man, and not
          [merely] a part of man, was made in the likeness of God. Now the soul
          and the spirit are certainly a part of the man, but certainly not the
          man; for the perfect man consists in the commingling and the union of
          the soul receiving the spirit of the Father, and the admixture of that
          fleshly nature which was moulded after the image of God. For this
          reason does the apostle declare, "We speak wisdom among them that are
          perfect," terming those persons "perfect" who have received the Spirit
          of God, and who through the Spirit of God do speak in all languages,
          as he used Himself also to speak. In like manner we do also hear many
          brethren in the Church, who possess prophetic gifts, and who through
          the Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the
          general benefit the hidden things of men, and declare the mysteries of
          God, whom also the apostle terms "spiritual," they being spiritual
          because they partake of the Spirit, and not because their flesh has
          been stripped off and taken away, and because they have become purely
          spiritual. For if any one take away the substance of flesh, that is,
          of the handiwork [of God], and understand that which is purely
          spiritual, such then would not be a spiritual man but would be the
          spirit of a man, or the Spirit of God. But when the spirit here
          blended with the soul is united to [God's] handiwork, the man is
          rendered spiritual and perfect because of the outpouring of the
          Spirit, and this is he who was made in the image and likeness of God.
          But if the Spirit be wanting to the soul, he who is such is indeed of
          an animal nature, and being left carnal, shall be an imperfect being,
          possessing indeed the image [of God] in his formation (in plasmate),
          but not receiving the similitude through the Spirit; and thus is this
          being imperfect. Thus also, if any one take away the image and set
          aside the handiwork, he cannot then understand this as being a man,
          but as either some part of a man, as I have already said, or as
          something else than a man. For that flesh which has been moulded is
          not a perfect man in itself, but the body of a man, and part of a man.
          Neither is the soul itself, considered apart by itself, the man; but
          it is the soul of a man, and part of a man. Neither is the spirit a
          man, for it is called the spirit, and not a man; but the commingling
          and union of all these constitutes the perfect man. And for this cause
          does the apostle, explaining himself, make it clear that the saved man
          is a complete man as well as a spiritual man; saying thus in the first
          Epistle to the Thessalonians, "Now the God of peace sanctify you
          perfect (perfectos); and may your spirit, and soul, and body be
          preserved whole without complaint to the coming of the Lord Jesus
          Christ." Now what was his object in praying that these three -- that
          is, soul, body, and spirit -- might be preserved to the coming of the
          Lord, unless he was aware of the [future] reintegration and union of
          the three, and [that they should be heirs of] one and the same
          salvation? For this cause also he declares that those are "the
          perfect" who present unto the Lord the three [component parts] without
          offence. Those, then, are the perfect who have had the Spirit of God
          remaining in them, and have preserved their souls and bodies
          blameless, holding fast the faith of God, that is, that faith which is
          [directed] towards God, and maintaining righteous dealings with
          respect to their neighbours.

          2. Whence also he says, that this handiwork is "the temple of God,"
          thus declaring: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that
          the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man, therefore, will defile
          the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is
          holy, which [temple] ye are." Here he manifestly declares the body to
          be the temple in which the Spirit dwells. As also the Lord speaks in
          reference to Himself, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will
          raise it up. He spake this, however," it is said, "of the temple of
          His body." And not only does he (the apostle) acknowledge our bodies
          to be a temple, but even the temple of Christ, saying thus to the
          Corinthians, "Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ?
          Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of
          an harlot?" He speaks these things, not in reference to some other
          spiritual man; for a being of such a nature could have nothing to do
          with an harlot: but he declares "our body," that is, the flesh which
          continues in sanctity and purity, to be "the members of Christ;" but
          that when it becomes one with an harlot, it becomes the members of an
          harlot. And for this reason he said, "If any man defile the temple of
          God, him will God destroy." How then is it not the utmost blasphemy to
          allege, that the temple of God, in which the Spirit of the Father
          dwells, and the members of Christ, do not partake of salvation, but
          are reduced to perdition? Also, that our bodies are raised not from
          their own substance, but by the power of God, he says to the
          Corinthians, "Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord,
          and the Lord for the body. But God hath both raised up the Lord, and
          shall raise us up by His own power." <br />
