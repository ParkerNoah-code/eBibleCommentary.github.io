        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.254)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, January 30th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"He shewed them his hands and his feet." -- Luke 24:40.</p>
        <p>
          I HAVE selected this sentence as the text, although I shall not
          strictly adhere to it. What was to be seen on Christ's hands and feet?
          We are taught that the prints of the nails were visible, and that in
          his side there was still the gash of the spear. For did he not say to
          Thomas? "Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach hither
          thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but
          believing." I wish to draw your attention to the ample fact, that our
          Lord Jesus Christ, when he rose again from the dead had in his body
          the marks of his passion. If he had pleased he could readily have
          removed them. He rose again from the dead, and he might have erased
          from his body everything which could be an indication of what he had
          suffered and endured before be descended into the tomb. But, no!
          Instead thereof, there were the pierced hands and feet, and there was
          the open side. What was the reason for this? There was no absolute
          necessity for it: it could easily have been dispensed with, What,
          then, were the reasons? I shall endeavor to enter into this subject,
          and I hope we may draw some profitable instructions therefrom.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, what influence did the exhibition of the hands and feet have
          upon the disciples? Secondly, why is it that Jesus Christ, now in
          heaven, bears with him the scars in his flesh? And, then, thirdly, is
          there any lesson to us in the fact that Jesus Christ still wears his
          wounds? I think there is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, OF WHAT USE WAS THE EXHIBITION OF THOSE WOUNDS TO THE
          DESCIPLES? I reply at once that they were infallible proofs that he
          was the same person. He said, "Behold my hands and feet, that it is,
          I, myself." It was to establish his identity, that he was the very
          same Jesus whom they had followed, whom at last they had deserted,
          whom they had beheld afar off crucified and slain, and whom they had
          carried to the tomb in the gloom of the evening; it was the very same
          Christ who was now before them, and they might know it, for there was
          the seal of his sufferings upon him. He was the same person; the hands
          and feet could testify to that. You know, beloved, had not some such
          evidence been visible upon our Saviour, it is probable that his
          disciples would have been unbelieving enough to doubt the identity of
          his person. Have you never seen men changed, extremely changed in
          their external appearance. I have known a man, perhaps, five or six
          years ago; he has passed through a world of suffering and pain, and
          when I hare seen him again, l have declared, "I should not have known
          you if I had met you in the street." Now, when the disciples parted
          with Jesus it was at the Lord's Supper. They then walked with him into
          the garden. There did the Saviour sweat, "as it were great drops of
          blood." Do you not imagine that such a wrestling, such a bloody sweat
          as that, must have had some effect upon his visage. It had surely had
          enough to mar it before. But now the ploughshares of grief were
          sharpened, and anguish made deep furrows upon him. There must have
          been lines of grief upon his brow, deeper than they had ever seen
          before. This would have produced a change great enough to make them
          forget his countenance. Nor was this all. You know he had to undergo
          the flagellation at the pillar of the Praetorium, and then to die. Can
          you imagine that a man could pass through the process of death,
          through such astonishing agony as that which the Saviour endured, and
          yet that there should be no change in his visible appearance? I can
          conceive that in passing through such a furnace as this, the very
          lineaments of Christ's face would seem to have been melted, and would
          have need to be restruck ere the disciples could discern that he was
          the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides that? when Jesus rose, he rose, you know, as he now sits in
          heaven. His body was flesh and bone, but, nevertheless, it had
          miraculous powers; it was capable of entering into a room without the
          ordinary modes of access. We find our Saviour standing in the midst of
          his disciples, the doors being shut. I believe that Jesus had a body
          such as we are to have in the next world. Jesus Christ was not a
          phantom or spectra. His body was not a spirit; it was a real body. And
          so in heaven imagine not that we are to be spirits. We are to be
          spirits until the great resurrection day; but, then, our spirit is
          afterwards to receive a spiritual body; it is to be clothed upon; it
          is not for ever to be a naked, bodiless spirit. That body will be to
          all intents and purposes the same body which shall be laid in the
          tomb. It is sown in dishonor, and the same it is raised in glory: it
          is sown in weakness, and the same it is raised in power. Mark, Jesus
          was flesh still! All flesh is not the same flesh: all bodies have not
          the same qualities. So our Saviour's flesh was flesh that could not
          suffer, -- flesh that had extraordinary powers about it, -- flesh
          however, that could eat, although it was under no necessity to do so.
          And such may be the body, the glorified body, which shall be given to
          us when we shall rise at the first resurrection, and shall be made
          like unto our head. But, now, think! If Christ had to undergo in his
          countenance those matchless transformations, that must have been,
          first of all, connected with his bloody sweat, then, with his agony,
          and after that, with the transforming, or, if I may use such a word,
          the transmutation of his body into a spiritual body, can you not
          conceive that his likeness would be changed, that the disciples would
          scarcely know him if there had not been some deeply graven marks
          whereby they would be able to discover him? The disciples looked upon
          the very face, but, even then they doubted. There was a majesty about
          him which most of them had not seen. Peter, James, and John, had seen
          him transfigured, when his garments were whiter than any fuller could
          make them; but the rest of the disciples had only seen him as a man of
          sorrows; they had not seen him as the glorious Lord, and, therefore,
          they would be apt to doubt whether he was the same. But these
          nail-prints, this pierced side, these were marks which they could not
          dispute, which unbelief itself could not doubt. And they all were
          convinced and confessed that he was the Lord; and even faithless
          Thomas, was constrained to cry, " My Lord and my God!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us turn to tile second question: Why SHOULD CHRIST WEAR THESE
          WOUNDS IN HEAVEN AND OF WHAT AVAIL ARE THEY? Let me give you some
          thoughts upon the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can conceive, first, that the wounds of Christ in heaven will be a
          theme of eternal wonder to the angels. An old writer represents the
          angels as saying, "Oh, Lord of glory, what are these wounds in thy
          hand?" They had seen him depart from heaven, and they had gone with
          him as far as they might go, singing, Glory to God in the highest,
          peace on earth.'" Some of them had watched him through his pilgrimage,
          for "he was seen of angels." But when he returned, I doubt not that
          they crowded round him, bowed before him in adoration, and then put
          the holy question, "What are these wounds in thy hand?" At any rate
          they were enabled to behold for themselves in heaven the man who
          suffered, and they could see the wounds which were produced in his
          body by his sufferings; and I can readily imagine that this would
          cause them to lift their songs higher, would prolong their shouts of
          triumph, and would cause them to adore him with a rapture of
          wonderment, such as they had never felt before. And I doubt not that
          every time they look upon his hands, and behold the crucified man
          exalted by his Father's side, they are afresh wrapt in wonder, and
          again they strike their harps with more joyous lingers at the thought
          of what be must have suffered who thus bears the sears of his
          hard-fought battles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Christ wears these sears in his body in heaven as his
          ornaments. The wounds of Christ are his glories, they are his jewels
          and his precious things. To the eye of the believer Christ is never so
          glorious, never so passing fair, as when we can say of him, "My
          beloved is white and ruddy," white with innocence, and ruddy with his
          own blood. He never seems so beautiful a' when he can see him as the
          rose and the lily; as the lily, matchless purity, and as the rose,
          crimsoned with his own gore. We may talk of Christ in his beauty, in
          divers places raising the dead and stilling the tempest, but oh! there
          never was such a matchless Christ as he that did hang upon the cross.
          There I behold all his beauties, all his attributes developed, all his
          love drawn out, all his character expressed in letters so legible,
          that even my poor stammering heart call read those lines and speak
          them out again, as I see them written in crimson upon the bloody tree.
          Beloved, these are to Jesus what they are to us; they are his
          ornaments, his royal jewels, his fair array. He does not care for the
          splendor and pomp of kings. The thorny crown is his diadem -- a diadem
          such as no monarch ever wore. It is true that he bears not now the
          scepter of reed, but there is a glory in it that there never flashed
          from scepter of gold. It is true he is not now buffeted and spit upon:
          his face is not now marred more than that of any other man by grief
          and sorrow, for he is glorified and full of blessedness; but he never
          seems so lovely as when we see him buffeted of men for our sakes,
          enduring all manner of grief, bearing our iniquities, and carrying our
          sorrows. Jesus Christ finds such beauties in his wounds that he win
          not renounce them, he will wear the court dress in which he wooed our
          souls, and he will wear the royal purple of his atonement throughout
          eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor are these only the ornaments of Christ: they are his trophies --
          the trophies of his love. Have you never seen a soldier with a gash
          across his forehead or in his cheek? Why every soldier will tell you
          the wound in battle is no disfigurement -- it is his honor. "If" said
          he, "I received a wound when I was retreating, a wound in the back,
          that were to my disgrace, If I have received a wound in a victory,
          then it is an honorable thing to be wounded." Now, Jesus Christ has
          scars of honor in his flesh and glory in his eyes He has other
          trophies He has divided the spoil with the strong: he has taken the
          captive away from his tyrant master; he has redeemed for himself a
          host that no man can number, who are all the trophies of his
          victories: but these scars, these are the memorials of the fight, and
          these the trophies, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          For do you not know it was from the side of Jesus that Death sucked
          its death. Jesus did hang upon the cross, and Death thought to get the
          victory. Aye, but in its victory it destroyed itself. There are three
          things in Christ that Death never met with before, all of which are
          fatal to it. There was in Christ innocence. Now; as long as man was
          innocent, he could not die. Adam lived as long as he was innocent. Now
          Christ was about to die; but Death sucked in innocent blood; he sucked
          in his own poison and he died. Again, blessedness is that which takes
          away the sting of death. Now Christ, even when he was dying, was "God
          over all, blessed for ever." All that Death had ever killed before was
          under the curse; but this man was never by nature under the curse,
          because for our sakes he was not born into this world a cursed man. He
          was the seed of woman it is true, but still not of carnal generation.
          He did come under the curse when he took upon himself our sins, but
          not for his own sins. He was in himself blessed. Death sucked in
          blessed blood: he had never done that before -- all others have been
          under the curse -- and that slew Death. It was innocence combined with
          blessedness that was the destruction of Death. Yet another thing.
          Death had never met before with any man who had life in himself. But
          when Death drank Christ's blood it drank life. For his blood is the
          life of the soul, and is the seed of life eternal. Wheresoever it
          goeth, doth it not give life to the dead? And Death, finding that it
          had drunk into its own veins life in the form of Jesus' blood gave up
          the ghost; and Death itself is dead, for Christ hath destroyed it, by
          the sacrifice of himself; he hath put it away; he hath said, "Oh
          death, where is thy sting? oh grave, where is thy victory?" But now,
          since it was from these very wounds that Death sucked in its own
          death, and that hell was destroyed; since these were the only weapons
          of a weaponless Redeemer, he wears and bears them as his trophies in
          heaven. David laid up Goliath's sword before the Lord for ever. Jesus
          lays up his wounds before the Lord, for his wounds were his weapons,
          and this is why he wears them still.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking while coming here of Jesus Christ in heaven with his
          wounds, and another thought struck me. Another reason why Jesus wears
          his wounds is, that when he intercedes he may employ them as powerful
          advocates. When he rises up to pray for his people, he needs not speak
          a word; he lifts his hands before his Father's face; he makes bare his
          side, and points to his feet. These are the orators with which he
          pleads with God -- these wounds. Oh, he must prevail. Do you not see
          that Christ without his wounds, in heaven might be potent enough. but
          there would not be that glorious simplicity of intercession which now
          you see. He has nothing to do but to shew his hands. Him the Father
          heareth always. His blood crieth and is heard, His wounds plead and
          prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us think again. Jesus Christ appears in heaven as the wounded one,
          this shews again that he has not laid aside his priesthood. You know
          how Watts paraphrases the idea He says,
        </p>
        <p>"Looks like a lamb that has been slain,</p>
        <p>And wears his priesthood still."</p>
        <p>
          If the wounds had been removed we might have forgotten that there was
          a sacrifice; and, mayhap, next we might have forgotten that there was
          a priest. But the wounds are there: then there is a sacrifice, and
          there is a priest also, for he who is wounded is both himself, the
          sacrifice and the priest. The priesthood of Melchisedec is a glorious
          subject. He who reads that with the eye of faith, and is blessed with
          the Spirit, will find much cause for joy when he contrasts the
          priesthood of Christ with that of Aaron. The priesthood of Aaron
          began, and it finished; but the priesthood of Melchisedec had no
          beginning, and it had no end. He was, we are told, "Without beginning
          of days, and without end of years;" without father, without mother,
          without descent. Such is the priesthood of Christ' It shall never end.
          He himself is without beginning, and his priesthood is without end.
          When the last ransomed soul is brought in. when there shall be no more
          prayers to offer, Christ shall still be a priest. Though he has no
          sacrifice now to slay, for he is the sacrifice himself, "once for
          all," yet still he is a priest, and when all his people as the result
          of that sacrifice shall be assembled around his glorious throne, he
          shall still be the priest. "For thou art a priest for ever after the
          order of Melchisedec." I take it that this is a further reason why he
          still bears his wounds in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another and a terrible reason why Christ wears his wounds
          still. It is this. Christ is coming to judge the world. Christ has
          with himself to-day the accusers of his enemies. Every time that
          Christ lifts his hands to heaven, the men that hate him, or despise
          him, are accused. The Jewish nation is brought in guilty every day.
          The cry is remembered, "His blood be on us and on our children;" and
          the sin of casting Christ away, and rejecting him, is brought before
          the mind of the Most High. And when Christ shall come a second time to
          judge the world in righteousness, seated on the great white throne,
          that hand of his shall be the terror of the universe." They shall look
          on him whom they have pierced," and they shall mourn for their sins.
          They would not mourn with hopeful penitence in time, they shall mourn
          with sorrowful remorse throughout eternity. When the multitude are
          gathered together, when in the valley of Jehoshaphat Christ shall
          judge the nations, what need he to summon accusers? His own wounds are
          his witnesses. Why need he to summon any to convict men of sin? His
          own side bears their handiwork. Ye murderers, did you not do this? Ye
          sons of an evil generation did ye not pierce the Saviour? Did ye not
          nail him to the tree? Behold these holes in my hand, and this stab in
          my side; these are swift witnesses against you to condemn you I There
          is a terrible side, then to this question. A crucified Christ with his
          wounds still open will be a terrible sight for an assembled universe.
          "Well," but says one of my congregation "What is that to us? We have
          not crucified the Saviour." No but let me assure You that his blood
          shall be on you. If ye die unbelievers his blood shall be required at
          your hand. The death of Christ was wrought by the hand of manhood, of
          all and entire manhood. Others did it for you, and though you gave no
          consent verbally, yet you do assent in your heart every day. As long
          as you hate Christ you give an assent to his death. As long as you
          reject his sacrifice, and despise his love, you give evidence in your
          hearts that you would have crucified the Lord of glory had you been
          there. Nay, and you do yourself, so fares you can, crucify him afresh
          and put him to an open shame. When you laugh at his people, when you
          despise his word, and mock at his ordinances, you are driving nails
          into his hands, and thrusting the spear into his side; therefore those
          open hands and that pierced side shall be witnesses against you, even
          against you, if ye die rejecting him, and enter into eternity enemies
          to Christ by wicked works.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have thus supplied severe excellent reasons. But now there
          is one more which I shall offer to your consideration before I come to
          the lesson which you shall learn. Christ v, ears those marks in his
          hands that, as believers, you may never forget that he has died. We
          shall need, perhaps, nothing to refresh our memories in heaven. but
          still' even if we should, we have it here. When we shall have been in
          heaven many a thousand years we shall still have the death of Christ
          before us, we shall see him reigning. But can you not conceive that
          the presence of the wounded Christ will often stir up the holy hearts
          of the celestial beings to a fresh outpouring of their grateful songs?
          They begin the song thus, "Unto him that liveth." Jesus looks upon
          them and shows his hand and they add, "and was dead, and is alive for
          evermore, and hath the keys of hell and death." They would not forget
          that he died; but certainly that part of the song where it said, "and
          was dead," will have all the more sweetness, because there he sits
          with the very marks of his passion -- with the nail-prints of his
          crucifixion. If we shall be in heaven at all constituted as we are on
          earth, we shall need some visible token to keep us continually in
          remembrance. Here, you know, the most spiritual saint needs the bread
          and wine -- sweet emblems of the Saviour's body. There we shall have
          nothing to do with emblems, for we shall have the sight of him. And I
          say, if we be in heaven anything like what we are here, I can imagine
          that the presence of Jesus may be highly beneficial, may be gloriously
          precious to the saints in reviving their love continually, and causing
          their hearts, which are like fountains of love, to bubble up afresh,
          and send out again the living water of gratitude and thanksgiving. At
          any rate, I know this thought is very delightful to me, that I shall
          see the man that did hang on Calvary's cross, and that I shall see him
          as he did inane there. I delight to see my Saviour in all the glories
          of his Father, but I long to go back and see him as he was, as well as
          he is. I think I should sometimes envy Peter and the rest of them that
          they should have seen him crucified. Yes, I should say, I see him
          glorified, but you saw the most marvellous sight. To see a God is an
          every-day sight with glorified beings, but to see a God covered with
          his blood, this is an extraordinary thing. To see Christ glorified,
          that we may see each day, but to have seen him on that special
          occasion, made obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross,
          that was an extraordinary sight which even angels themselves could see
          but once. You and I cannot see that. But those wounds are there still
          manifest and visible, and we shall be delighted with the rapturous
          sight of the Lord in glory, with his wounds still fresh upon him. May
          the Lord grant that we may all be there to see it. May we refresh
          ourselves with that glorious sight. I can say that I would part with
          all the joys of sense to view his face Everything that is good on
          earth I would give away without a wish, without one single lingering
          thought, if I might but behold his face, and lie in his bosom, and see
          the dear pierced hands and the wide-open side. We must wait his
          pleasure. A few more rolling suns shall do it. The moon shall rise and
          wane for us a few more times, and then
        </p>
        <p>"We shall see his face, and never, never sin</p>
        <p>But from tile rivers of his grace, drink endless pleasures in."</p>
        <p>
          III. This brings me now to the third point. WHAT DOES CHRIST MEAN BY
          SHOWING TO US HIS HANDS AND FEET? He means this that suffering is
          absolutely necessary. Christ is the head, and his people are the
          members. If suffering could have been avoided, surely our glorious
          Head ought to have escaped; but inasmuch as he shows us his wounds, it
          is to tell us, that we shall have wounds too. Innocence ought to
          escape suffering. Did not Pilate mean as much when be said, "I find no
          fault in him, therefore let him go?" But innocence did not escape
          suffering. Even the captain of our salvation must be made perfect
          through suffering; therefore, we who are guilty, we who are far from
          being perfect, must not wonder that we have to be wounded too. Shall
          the head be crowned with thorns, and do you imagine that the other
          members of the body are to be rocked upon the dainty lap of ease? Must
          Jesus Christ swim through seas of his own blood to win the crown, and
          are you and I to walk to heaven dryshod in silver slippers? No, the
          wounds of Christ are to teach us that suffering is necessary. In fact,
          that doctrine was taught upon Mount Calvary. There are only three
          sorts of men that have ever lived -- a good man, a bad man, and the
          God-man. Now, on Calvary's cross, I see three characters, I see the
          thief, the representative of the bad. I see the penitent thief, the
          representative of the righteous, and I see the God-man in the midst.
          All three must suffer. Do not imagine, for a moment, that wicked men
          get through this world without suffering. Oh, no. The path to hell is
          very rough, though it seems smooth. When men will damn themselves,
          they will not find it a very pleasurable task. The cutting the throat
          of one's soul is not such a pleasant operation. The drinking the
          poison of damnation is not, after all, an enviable task. The path of
          the sinner may seem to be happy, but it is not. It is a gilded deceit.
          He knows there is bitterness in his bowels, even here on earth. Even
          the wicked must suffer. But, mark, if any out of the world would have
          escaped it would be the God-man; but the God-man did not escape. He
          shows us his wounds; and do you think that you shall remain unwounded?
          Not if you are his, at any rate. Men sometimes escape on earth; but
          the true-born child of God must not, and would not, if he might, for
          if he did, he would then give himself cause to say, "I am no part of
          the body; if I were a part of the body, my head suffered, and so must
          I suffer, for I am part of his living body." That is the first lesson
          he teaches us, the necessity of suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          But next he teaches us his sympathy with us in our suffering. "There,"
          says he, "see this hand! I am not an high priest that cannot be
          touched with the feeling of your infirmities. I have suffered, too. I
          was tempted in all ways like as you are. Look here! there are the
          marks -- there are the marks. They are not only tokens of my love,
          they are not only sweet forget-me-nots that bind me to love you for
          ever. But besides that they are the evidence of my sympathy. I can
          feel for you. Look -- look -- I have suffered. Have you the
          heart-ache? Ah, look yon here, what a heartache I had when this heart
          was pierced Do you suffer, even unto blood wrestling against sin? So
          did I. I have sympathy with you." It was this that sustained the early
          martyrs. One of them declared that while he was suffering he fixed his
          eyes on Christ; and when they were pinching his flesh dragging it off
          with the hot harrows, when they were putting him to agonies so
          extraordinary, that I could not dare to mention them here, lest some
          of you should faint even under the very narrative, he said, "My soul
          is not insensible but it loves." What a glorious speech was that! It
          loves -- it loves Christ. It was not insensible, but love gave it
          power to overcome suffering, a power as potent as insensibility.
          "For," said he, "my eyes are fixed on him that suffered for me, and I
          can suffer for him; for my soul is in his body; I have sent my heart
          up unto him. He is my brother, and there my heart is. Plough my flesh,
          and break my bones; smash them with veer irons, I can bear it all, for
          Jesus suffered, and he suffers in me now; but he sympathises with me,
          arid this makes me strong." Yes, beloved, lay hold on this in all
          times of your agony. When you are sweating, think of his bloody so
          eat. When you are bruised, think of the whips that tore his flesh. And
          when you are aging, think of his death. And when God hides his face
          for a little from you, think of "My God, my God, why hast thou
          forsaken me!" This is why he wears his wounds in his hands, that he
          may show that he sympathises with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing. Christ wears these wounds to show that suffering is an
          honorable thing. To suffer for Christ is glory. Men will say, "It is
          glorious to make others suffer." When Alexander rides over the necks
          of princes, and treads nations beneath his feet, that is glorious. The
          Christian religion teaches us it is glorious to be trodden on,
          glorious to be crushed, glorious to suffer. This is hard to learn.
          There we see it in our glorified Master. He makes his wounds his
          glory, and his sufferings are part of the drapery of his regal attire
          in Paradise Now, then, it is an honorable thing to suffer. Oh,
          Christian, when you are overtaken by strange troubles, be not afraid.
          God is near you. It was Christ's honor to suffer, and it is yours too.
          The only degree that God gives to his people is the degree of "Masters
          in tribulation." If you would be one of God's nobles you must be
          knighted. Men are knighted with A blow of the sword. The Lord knights
          us with the sword of affliction; and when we fight hard in many a
          battle, he makes us barons of the kingdom of heaven, he makes us dukes
          and lords in the kingdom of sorrowful honor, not through honor of man,
          but through dishonor of man, not through joy, but through suffering,
          and grief, and agony, and death. The highest honor that God can confer
          upon his children is the blood-red crown of martyrdom. When I read, as
          I have been reading lately, the story of the catacombs of Rome, and
          those short but very pithy inscriptions that are written over the
          graves of the martyrs, I felt sometimes as it I could envy them. I do
          not envy them their racks, their hot irons, their being dragged at the
          heels of horses; but I do envy them when I see them arrayed in the
          blood-red robe of martyrdom. Who are they that stand nearest to the
          eternal throne, foremost of the saints in light? Why, the noble army
          of martyrs. And just as God shall give us grace to suffer for Christ,
          to suffer with Christ, and to suffer as Christ, just so much does he
          honor us. The jewels of a Christian are his afflictions. The regalia
          of the kings, that God hath made, are their troubles, their sorrows,
          and their griefs Let us not, therefore, shun being honored. Let us not
          turn aside from being exalted. Griefs exalt us, and troubles lift us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, there is one sweet thought connected with the wounds of Christ
          that has charmed my soul, and made my heart run over with delight. It
          is this: I have sometimes thought that if I am a part of Christ's body
          I am a poor wounded part; if I do belong to that all-glorious whole,
          the church, which is his fullness, the fullness of him that filleth
          all in all, yet have I said within me, "I am a poor maimed part,
          wounded, full of putrifying sores." But Christ did not leave even his
          wounds behind him, even those he took to heaven. "Not a bone of him
          shall be broken," and the flesh when wounded shall not be discarded,
          -- shall not be left. He shall carry that with him to heaven, and he
          shall glorify even the wounded member. Is not this sweet, is not this
          precious to the troubled child of God? This, indeed, is a thought from
          which one may suck honey. Poor, weak, and wounded though I am, he will
          not discard me. His wounds are healed wounds, mark! they are not
          running sores; and so, though we be the wounded parts of Christ, we
          shall be healed; though we shall seem to ourselves in looking back
          upon what we were upon earth only as wounds, only parts of a wounded
          body, still we shall rejoice that he has healed those wounds, and that
          he has not cast us away. Precious, precious truth I The whole body he
          will present before his Father's face, and wounded though he be, he
          shall not cast his own wounds away, Let us take comfort, then, in
          this; let us rejoice therein. We shall be presented at last, without
          spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. Mark, Christ's wounds are no spots
          to him, no wrinkles, they are ornaments; and even those parts of his
          church on earth that despair of themselves, thinking themselves to be
          as wounds shall be no spots, no wrinkles in the complete church above,
          but even they shall be the ornaments and the glory of Christ. Let us
          now look up by faith and see Jesus, the Wounded Jesus, sitting on his
          throne. Will not this help us to gird up our loins to "run with
          patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author
          and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him
          endured the cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the right
          hand of the throne of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot send you away without this last remark. Poor sinner, thou art
          troubled on account of sin. There is a sweet thought for thee. Men are
          afraid to go to Christ, or else they say, "My Sins are so many I
          cannot go to him; he will be angry with me." Do you see his hands
          outstretched to you to night? He is in heaven, and he still says,
          "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest." Are you afraid to come? Then, look at his hand -- look at
          his hand, will not that induce you? "Oh," but you say, "I cannot think
          that Christ can have it in his heart to remember such a worm as I."
          Look at his side, there is easy access to his heart. His side is open,
          and even your poor prayers may be thrust into that side, and they
          shall reach his heart, holy though it be. Only do thou look to his
          wounds, and thou shalt certainly find peace through the blood of
          Jesus. There were two monks of late years in different cells in their
          convent. They were reading the Bible. One of them found Christ while
          reading the Scriptures, and he believed with a true evangelical faith.
          The other one was timid, and could scarcely think it true; the scheme
          of salvation seemed so great to him he could scarcely lay hold upon
          it. But, at last, he lay upon the point to die, and he sent for the
          other to come and sit by him, and to shut the door; because if the
          superior had heard of that of which they were about to speak, he might
          have condemned them both. When the monk had sat down, the sick man
          began to tell how his sins lay heavy on him; the other reminded him of
          Jesus. "If you would be saved, brother, you must look to Jesus who did
          hang upon the cross. His wounds must save." The poor man heard and he
          believed. Almost immediately afterwards came in the superior, with the
          brethren and the priests; and they began to grease him in extreme
          unction. This poor man tried to push them away; he could not bear the
          ceremony, and as well as he could he expressed his dissent. At last
          his lips were opened, and he said in Latin, "Tu vulnera Jesu!" -- thy
          wounds, oh Jesus! thy wounds, oh Jesus! -- clasped his hands, lifted
          them to heaven, fell back and died. Oh, I would that many a Protestant
          would die with these words on his lips. There was the fullness of the
          gospel in them. Thy wounds, oh Jesus! thy wounds; these are my refuge
          in my trouble. Oh sinner, may you be helped to believe in his wounds!
          They cannot fail; Christ's wounds must heal those that put their trust
          in him.<br />
