        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.369)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Monday Afternoon, March 25th, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>
          "And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach
          and preach Jesus Christ." -- Acts 5:42.
        </p>
        <p>
          I DO not know whether there are any persons here present who can
          contrive to put themselves into my present position, and to feel my
          present feelings. If they can effect that, they will give me credit
          for meaning what I say, when I declare that I feel totally unable to
          preach. And, indeed, I think I shall scarcely attempt a sermon, but
          rather give a sort of declaration of the truths from which future
          sermons shall be made. I will give you bullion rather than coin; the
          block from the quarry, and not the statue from the chisel. It appears
          that the one subject upon which men preached in the apostolic age was
          Jesus Christ. The tendency of man, if left alone, is continually to go
          further and further from God, and the Church of God itself is no
          exception to the general rule. For the first few years, during and
          after the apostolic era, Christ Jesus was preached, but gradually the
          Church departed from the central point, and began rather to preach
          ceremonials and church offices than the person of their Lord. So has
          it been in these modern times: we also have fallen into the same
          error, at least to a degree, and have gone from preaching Christ to
          preaching doctrines about Christ, inferences which may be drawn from
          his life, or definitions which may be gathered from his discourses. We
          are not content to stand like angels in the sun; our fancies disturb
          our rest and must needs fly on the sunbeams, further and further from
          the glorious source of light. In the days of Paul it was not difficult
          at once, in one word, to give the sum and substance of the current
          theology. It was Christ Jesus. Had you asked anyone of those disciples
          what he believed, he would have replied, "I believe Christ." If you
          had requested him to show you his Body of Divinity, he would have
          pointed upward, reminding you that divinity never had but one body,
          the suffering and crucified human frame of Jesus Christ, who ascended
          up on high. To them, Christ was not a notion refined, but
          unsubstantial; not an historical personage who had left only the
          savour of his character behind, but whose person was dead; to them he
          was not a set of ideas, not a creed, nor an incarnation of an abstract
          theory; but he was a person, one whom some of them had seen, whose
          hands they had handled, nay, one of whose flesh they had all been made
          to eat, and of whose blood they had spiritually been made to drink.
          Christ was substance to them, I fear he is too often but shadow to us.
          He was a reality to their minds; to us -- though, perhaps, we would
          scarcely allow it in so many words -- rather a myth than a man; rather
          a person who was, than he who was, and is, and is to come -- the
          Almighty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would propose (and O may the Lord grant us grace to carry out that
          proposition, from which no Christian can dissent), I would propose
          that the subject of the ministry of this house, as long as this
          platform shall stand, and as long as this house shall be frequented by
          worshippers, shall be the person of Jesus Christ. I am never ashamed
          to avow myself a Calvinist, although I claim to be rather a Calvinist
          according to Calvin, than after the modern debased fashion. I do not
          hesitate to take the name of Baptist. You have there (pointing to the
          baptistery) substantial evidence that I am not ashamed of that
          ordinance of our Lord Jesus Christ; but if I am asked to say what is
          my creed, I think I must reply: "It is Jesus Christ." My venerable
          predecessor, Dr. Gill, has left a body of divinity admirable and
          excellent in its way; but the body of divinity to which I would pin
          and bind myself for ever, God helping me, is not his system of
          divinity or any other human treatise, but Christ Jesus, who is the sum
          and substance of the gospel; who is in himself all theology, the
          incarnation of every precious truth, the all-glorious personal
          embodiment of the way, the truth, and the life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This afternoon I will try to describe the subject, Christ Jesus; then,
          secondly, to speak for a little while upon its comprehensiveness; then
          to enlarge upon sundry of its excellencies; and conclude by testing
          its power.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, the SUBJECT.</p>
        <p>
          They continued both to teach and preach Jesus Christ. To preach Jesus
          Christ aright we must preach him in his infinite and indisputable
          Godhead. We may be attacked by philosophers, who will either make him
          no God at all, or one constituted temporarily and, I must add,
          absurdly a God for a season. We shall have at once upon us those who
          view Christ as a prophet, as a great man, as an admirable exemplar; we
          shall be assailed on all sides by those who choose rather to draw
          their divinity from their own addled brains than from the simplicity
          of Holy Writ; but what mattereth this? We must reiterate again and
          again the absolute and proper deity of Christ; for without this we are
          in the position of those described by the prophet: -- "Their tacklings
          are loosed, they could not well strengthen their mast" and soon will
          our enemies prevail against us, and the prey of a great spoil shall be
          taken. Take away the divinity of Christ from the gospel, and you have
          nothing whatever left upon which the anxious soul can rest. Remove the
          Word who was in the beginning with God, and who was God, and the
          Jachin and Boaz of the temple are overturned. Without a divine
          Saviour, your gospel is a rope of sand; a bubble; a something less
          substantial than a dream. If Christ were not God, he was the basest of
          impostors. He was either one of two things, very God of very God, or
          else an arch-deceiver of the souls of men, for he made many of them
          believe he was God, and brought upon himself the consequences of what
          they called blasphemy; so that if he were not God, he was the greatest
          deceiver that ever lived. But God he is; and here, in this house, we
          must and will adore him. With the multitude of his redeemed we will
          sing:
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus is worthy to receive,</p>
        <p>Honour and power divine,</p>
        <p>And blessings more, than we can give</p>
        <p>Be Lord for ever thine."</p>
        <p>
          To preach Christ, however, we must also preach his true humanity. We
          must never make him to be less manlike because he was perfectly
          divine. I love that hymn of Hart which begins --
        </p>
        <p>"A man there was -- a real man,</p>
        <p>Who once on Calvary died."</p>
        <p>
          "Real man!" I think we do not often realize that manhood of Christ; we
          do not see that he was bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh;
          feeling, thinking, acting, suffering, doing, just like ourselves --
          one of our fellows, and only above us because he is "exalted with the
          oil of gladness above his fellows." We must have a human Christ, and
          we must have one of real flesh and blood too; not of shadows or filmy
          fancies. We must have one to whom we can talk, one with whom we can
          walk, one
        </p>
        <p>"Who in his measure feels afresh</p>
        <p>What every member bears;"</p>
        <p>
          who is so intimately connected with us in ties of blood, that he is as
          with us one, the head of the family, first-born among many brethren. I
          am never more glad than when I am preaching a personal Christ. A
          doctrinal Christ, a practical Christ, or an experimental Christ, as
          some good men make him to be according to the temper of their minds, I
          do not feel to be sufficient for the people of God. We want a personal
          Christ. This has been a power to the Romish church -- a power which
          they have used for ill, but always a power; they have had a personal
          Christ, but then it has either been a baby Christ in his mother's
          arms, or else a dead Christ upon the cross. They never reached the
          force of a real full-grown Christ, one who not only lived and
          suffered, but who died and rose again, and sits at the right hand of
          God, the Head of the Church, the one ruler of men. Oh! we must bring
          out more and more clearly each day the real personality of the
          Redeemer in his complex person. Whatever we fail to preach, we must
          preach him. If we are wrong in many points, if we be but right here,
          this will save our ministry from the flames; but if we be wrong here,
          however orthodox we may pretend to be, we cannot be right in the rest
          unless we think rightly of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, further, to preach Christ Jesus, it is absolutely necessary we
          should preach him as the only mediator between God and man. Admitting
          the efficacy of the intercession of living saints for sinners, never
          for a moment denying that every man is bound to make supplication for
          all ranks and conditions of men, yet must we have it that the only
          mediator in the heavens, and the only direct intercessor with God, is
          the man Christ Jesus. Nay, we must not be content with making him the
          only mediator; we must set aside all approach to God in any way
          whatever, except by him. We must not only have him for the priest, but
          we must have him for the altar, the victim, and the offerer too. We
          must learn in full the meaning of that precious text -- "Christ is
          all." We must not see a part of the types here and a part there, but
          all gathered up in him, the one door of heaven, the one crimson way by
          which our souls approach to God. We must not allow that approaches can
          be made in human strength, by human learning, or by human effort; but
          in him and through him, and by him, and in dependence upon him, must
          all be done between God and man. We have no wings, my brethren, with
          which to fly to heaven; our journey thither must be on the rounds
          [rungs] of Jacob's ladder. We cannot approach God by anything we have,
          or know, or do. Christ crucified, and he alone, must lift us up to
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And more, we must preach Christ in the solitariness of his redemption
          work. We must not permit for a moment the fair white linen of his
          righteousness to be stained by the patch-work of our filthy rags. We
          must not submit that the precious blood of his veins should be diluted
          by any offering of ours co-acting therewith, for our salvation. He
          hath, by one sacrifice, for ever put away sin. We shall never preach
          Christ unless we have a real atonement. There be certain people
          nowadays who are making the atonement, first a sort of compromise, and
          the next step is to make the atonement a display of what ought to have
          been, instead of the thing which should have been. Then, next, there
          are some who make it to be a mere picture, an exhibition, a shadow --
          a shadow, the substance of which they have not seen. And the day will
          come, and there are sundry traces of it here and there, in which in
          some churches the atonement shall be utterly denied, and yet men shall
          call themselves Christians, while they have broken themselves against
          the corner-stone of the entire system. I have no kith nor kin, nor
          friendship, nor Christian amity, with any man whatever who claims to
          be a Christian and yet denies the atonement. There is a limit to the
          charity of Christians, and there can be none whatever entertained to
          the man who is dishonest enough to occupy a Christian pulpit and to
          deny Christ. It is only in the Christian church that such a thing can
          be tolerated. I appeal to you. Was there ever known a Buddhist
          acknowledged in the temple of Buddha who denied the basis doctrine of
          the sect? Was there ever known a Mahomadan Imaum who was sanctioned in
          the mosque while he cried down the Prophet? It remains for Christian
          churches only to have in their midst men who can bear the name of
          Christian, who can even venture to be Christian teachers, while they
          slander the Deity of him who is the Christian's God, and speak lightly
          of the efficacy of his blood who is the Christian's atonement. May
          this deadly cancer be cut out root and branch; and whatever tearing of
          the flesh there may be, better cut it out with a jagged knife than
          suffer to exist because no lancet is to be found to do it daintily. We
          must have, then, Christ in the efficacy of his precious blood as the
          only Redeemer of the souls of men, and as the only mediator, who,
          without assistance of ours, has brought us to God and made
          reconciliation through his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our ministry will scarcely be complete unless we preach Christ as the
          only lawgiver and Rabbi of the Church. When you put it down as a canon
          of your faith that the church has right and power to decree rites and
          ceremonies, you have robbed Christ at once of his proper position as
          the only teacher of the church. Or when you claim the office of
          controlling other men's consciences by the decree of the church, or
          the vote of a synod, apart from the authority of Christ, you have
          taken away from Christ that chair which he occupies in the Christian
          church, as the teacher in the great Christian school, as the Rabbi,
          and the only Rabbi, of our faith. God forbid that we should hold a
          single truth except on his authority. Let not our faith stand in the
          wisdom of man, but in the power of God. You refer me to the writings
          of Doctor this and Doctor the other: what are these? The words of
          Christ, these are truth, and these are wisdom. You bring me authority
          from the practice of a church three or four centuries removed from the
          crucifixion as the proof of the existence of a certain ceremony and
          the righteousness of certain ecclesiastical offices. What is your
          proof worth? If Christ hath not specially ordained it, and if he hath
          not commanded his people to obey it, of what value is any rite
          whatever? We acknowledge Christ as ordaining all things for his
          church, and presenting that church with a finished code of laws, from
          which any deviation is a sin, and to which any addition is a high
          crime. Any church officer who is not ordained of Christ occupies an
          office which he ought to resign. Any person who practices a ceremony
          for which he has not scriptural authority should renounce it; and any
          man who preaches a doctrine for which he has not Christ as his
          certifier, should not demand for it the faith of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I fear there are times coming when the minister will not be true
          to his duty unless he goes further, and preaches Christ as the sole
          King of the Church. There has been a disposition on the part of the
          state, especially with regard to the Free Church of Scotland, to
          exercise power and judgement over church decrees. No king, no queen
          that ever lived, or can live, has any authority whatever over the
          church of Christ. The church has none to govern and rule over her but
          her Lord and her King. The church can suffer, but she cannot yield;
          you may break her confessors alive upon the wheel, but she, in her
          uprightness, will neither bend nor bow. From the sentence of our
          church there is no appeal whatever on earth. To the court of heaven a
          man may appeal if the sentence of the church be wrong, but to Caesar
          never. Neither the best nor the worst of kings or queens may ever dare
          to put their finger upon the prerogative of Christ as the head of the
          church. Up, church of God! If once there be any laws of man passed to
          govern thee, up, dash them in pieces! Let us each catch up the war
          cry, and uplift the lion standard of the tribe of Judah; let us
          challenge the kings of the earth and say, "Who shall rouse him up?"
          The church is queen above all queens, and Christ her only King. None
          have jurisdiction or power in the church of Christ save Jesus Christ
          himself. If any of our acts violate the civil laws, we are men and
          citizens, and we acknowledge the right of a state to govern us as
          individuals. None of us wish to be less subjects of the realm because
          we are kings and priests unto God. But as members of Christian
          churches we maintain that the excommunication of a Christian church
          can never be reversed by the civil power, or by any state act, nor are
          its censures to be examined, much less to be removed, mitigated, or
          even judged. We must have, as Christ's church, a full recognition of
          his imperial rights, and the day will come when the state will not
          only tolerate us as a mere society, but admit that as we profess to be
          the church of Christ, we have a right by that very fact to be
          self-governing, and never to be interfered with in any sense whatever,
          so far as our ecclesiastical affairs are concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ must be preached, then, and exalted in all these respects, or
          else we have not preached a full Christ; but I go one step further. We
          have not yet mounted to the full height of our ministry unless we
          learn to preach Christ as the King of kings. He has an absolute right
          to the entire dominion of this world. The Christian minister, as
          ordained of God to preach, has a perfect right in God's name to preach
          upon any subject touching the Lord's kingdom, and to rebuke and exhort
          even the greatest of men. Sometimes I have heard it said, when we have
          canvassed the acts of an emperor or senator, "These are politics;" but
          Christ is King of politics as well as theology. "Oh! but" -- say they
          -- "what have you to do with what the state does?" Why, just this:
          that Christ is the head of all states, and while the state has no
          authority over the church, yet Christ himself is King of kings, and
          Lord of lords. Oh, that the church would put her diadem upon her head,
          and take her right position! We are not slaves. The church of God is
          not a grovelling corporation bound for ever to sit upon a dunghill;
          never queen was so fair as she, and never robe so rich as the purple
          which she wears. Arise, O Church! arise, the earth is thine; claim it.
          Send out thy missionary, not as a petitioner to creep at the feet of
          princes, but as an ambassador for God to make peace between God and
          man. Send him out to claim the possession which belongs to thee, and
          which God has given to thee to be thine for ever and ever, by a right
          which kings may dispute, but which one day every one of them shall
          acknowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact is, we must bring Christ himself back into camp once more. It
          is of little use having our true Jerusalem swords, and the shields,
          and the banners, and the trumpets, and the drums; we want the King
          himself in the midst of us. More and more of a personal Christ is the
          great lack of the time. I would not wish for less doctrine, less
          experience, or less practice, but more of all this put into Christ,
          and Christ preached as the sum and substance of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But, secondly, I am now to speak, for a short time, upon the
          COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE SUBJECT which the text announces.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an old and trite saying that the ministers of the gospel may be
          divided into three kinds -- the doctrinal, the experimental, and the
          practical. The saying is so often repeated that very few would
          contradict it. But it betrays at once, if it be true, the absence and
          lack of a something essentially necessary for the church's success.
          Where is the preacher of Christ out of these? I propound this, that if
          a man be found a preacher of Christ, he is doctrinal, experimental,
          and practical. The doctrinal preacher generally has a limited range.
          He is useful, exceedingly useful; God constitutes him a barrier
          against the innovations of the times: he preaches upon his subjects so
          frequently that he is well versed in them, and becomes one of the
          armed men about the bed of Solomon. But suppose the doctrinal preacher
          should have it all his own way, and there should be none others at
          all, what would be the effect? See it in our Baptist churches about
          one hundred and fifty years ago. They were all sound and sound asleep.
          Those doctrines had preached them into a lethargy, and had is not been
          for some few who started up and proposed the missions for the heathen,
          and who found but little sympathy at first, the church would have been
          utterly inactive. Now, I would not be hard with any, but there are
          some brethren still whose preaching might justly be summed up as being
          doctrinal, nothing more than doctrinal, and what is the effect of
          their ministry? Bitterness. They learn to contend not only earnestly
          for the faith, but savagely for it. Certainly we admire their
          earnestness, and we thank God for their soundness, but we wish there
          were mingled with their doctrine a somewhat else which might tone down
          their severity and make them seek rather the unity and fellowship of
          the saints than the division and discord which they labour to create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I will refer you to the next class of preachers, the
          experimental. How delightful it is to sit under an experimental
          preacher! Perhaps of all ministries this one is the most useful, he
          who preaches the doubts, the fears, the joys, the ecstasies of the
          people of God. How often do the saints see the footsteps of the flock,
          and then they find the shepherd under an experimental minister! But do
          you know the effect of an experimental minister, purely so, I mean,
          when all else is put aside to make room for experience? There is one
          school of divines always preaching the corruption of the human heart.
          This is their style; "Except thou be flayed alive by the law; except
          thou art daily feeling the utter rottenness of thine heart; except
          than art a stranger to full assurance, and dost always doubt and fear;
          except thou abidest on the dunghill and dost scrape thyself with a
          potsherd, thou art no child of God." Who told you that? This has been
          the preaching of some experimental preachers, and the effect has been
          just this. Men have come to think the deformities of God's people to
          be their beauty. They are like certain courtiers of the reign of
          Richard III, who is said by history to have had a hump upon his back
          and his admirers stuffed their backs that they might have a graceful
          hump too. And there be many who, because a minister preaches of doubts
          and fears, feel they must doubt and fear too; and then that which is
          both uncomfortable to themselves and dishonouring to God comes to be
          the very mark of God's people. This is the tendency of experimental
          preaching, however judiciously managed, when ministers harp on that
          string and on that alone; the tendency is either to preach the people
          into a soft and savoury state, in which there is not a bit of
          manliness or might, or else into that dead and rotten state in which
          corruption outswells communion, and the savour is not the perfume of
          the king's ointments, but the stench of a corrupt and filthy heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take also the practical preacher; who would say a word against this
          good man? He stirs the people up, excites the children of God to holy
          duties, promotes every excellent object, and is in his way an
          admirable supplement to the two other kinds of ministers. But sit
          under she practical preacher; sit under him all the year round and
          listen to his people as they come out. There is one who says, "the
          same thing over again -- Do, do, do, nothing but do." There is a poor
          sinner yonder just gone down the front steps. Follow him, "Oh," says
          he, "I came here to find out what Christ could do for me, and I have
          only been told what I must do for myself" Now this it a great evil,
          and persons who sit under such a ministry become lean, starvelling
          things. I would that practical preachers would listen to our farmers,
          who always say it is better to put the whip in the manger than upon
          the horse's back. Let them feed the people with food convenient for
          them, and they will be practical enough; but all practice and no
          promise, all exhortation and no sound doctrine, will never make the
          man of God perfect and zealous for good works.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what am I driving at in bringing up these three sorts of
          ministers? Why just this: to show you that there is one minister who
          can preach all this, without the dangers of any one of the others, but
          with the excellencies of the whole. And who is he? Why, any man in the
          world who preaches Christ. If he preaches Christ's person he must
          preach doctrine. If I preach Christ I must preach him as the covenant
          head of his people, and how far am I then from the doctrine of
          election? If I preach Christ I must preach the efficacy of his blood,
          and how far am I removed then from the great doctrine of an effectual
          atonement? If I preach Christ I must preach the love of his heart, and
          how can I deny the final perseverance of the saints? If I preach the
          Lord Jesus as the great Head and King, how far am I removed from
          divine Sovereignty? Must I not, if I preach Christ personally, preach
          his doctrines? I believe they are nothing but the natural outgrowth of
          that great root thought, or root substance rather, the person of the
          Lord Jesus Christ. He who will preach Christ fully will never be lax
          in doctrine. And what better experience can you preach than in
          preaching Christ? Would you preach the sufferings of the saints,
          preach his agony and bloody sweat, his cross and passion; for the true
          sufferings of the saints are in fellowship with him. If you would
          preach their joys, preach his resurrection, his ascension, and his
          advent; you are never far from the joys of the saints when you are
          near to the joys of Christ; for did not he say, "My joy shall be in
          them that their joy may be full"? And what better practice can be
          preached than preaching Christ? Of every virtue he is the pattern; of
          the perfection of human character he is the very mirror; of everything
          that is holy and of good report, he is the abiding incarnation. He
          cannot fail, then, to be a good doctrinal, experimental, practical
          preacher, who preaches Christ. Did you ever know a congregation grow
          less spiritual by a minister preaching Christ? Did you ever know them
          get full of doubts and fears by preaching Christ? Did you ever hear of
          their getting lax in sentiment by his preaching Christ? Did you ever
          hear a whisper that men became unholy in their lives because they
          heard too much about Christ? I think that all the excellencies of all
          ministers may be gathered up into the teaching of the man who can
          preach Christ every day in the week, while there will not be any of
          the evils connected with the other forms of preaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall now pass onto notice some of the surpassing excellencies
          of the subject
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he will always have a blessed variety in his preaching. In
          Australia I have heard that the only change for the backwoodsmen is to
          have one day damper [unleavened cake baked in wood ashes), tea, and
          bread; the next day, bread, damper, and tea; and the next day, tea,
          bread, and damper. The only variety some ministers give, is one Sunday
          to have depravity, election, and perseverance, and the next Sunday,
          election, perseverance, and depravity. There are many strings to the
          harp of the gospel. There are some brethren who are so rightly charmed
          with five of the strings, which certainly have very rich music in
          them, that they never meddle with any of the other strings; the
          cobwebs hang on the rest, while these five are pretty well worn out.
          It is always pretty much the same thing from the first of January to
          the last of December. Their organ has very few keys, and upon these
          they may make a very blessed variety, but I think not a very extensive
          one. Any man who preaches Christ will ensure variety in his preaching.
          He is all manner of precious perfume, myrrh, and aloes, and cassia. He
          is all sorts of music, he is everything that is sweet to the ear; he
          is all manner of fruits; there is not one dainty in him but many. This
          tree of life bears twelve manner of fruits. He is all manner of
          raiment; he is golden raiment for beauty, he is the warm raiment for
          comfort, he is the stout raiment for harness in the day of battle.
          There are all things in Christ, and he that hath Christ will have as
          great a variety as there is to be found in the scenery of the world
          where are no two rocks alike, and no two rivers wind in precisely the
          same manner, and no two trees grow in precisely the same form. Any
          other subject you may preach upon till your hearers feel satiety; but
          with Christ for a subject, you may go on, and on, and on, till the
          sermon swells into the eternal song, and you begin to sing, "Unto him
          that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another excellence about this subject, namely, that it
          suits all sorts of people. Are there rebels present? Preach Christ; it
          will suit them. Are there pardoned sinners present? What is better, to
          melt their hearts than the blood of the Lord Jesus. Are there doubting
          Christians? What can cheer them better than the name of Christ. Are
          there strong believers? What is stronger meat than Jesus crucified?
          Are there learned, polite, intellectual hearers? If they are not
          satisfied with Christ, they ought to be. Are there poor, ignorant,
          unlettered men? Jesus Christ is just the thing to preach to them -- a
          naked Christ to their simple ears. Jesus Christ is a topic that will
          keep in all climates. Land in New Zealand in the midst of uncivilised
          men, move off to another post and stand in the midst of poetical
          Persia or fickle France, the cross is adapted to all. We need not
          inquire into the doctrinal opinion of our hearers. If they are high, I
          am sure Christ will suit them. If they are low, if they be true
          believers, I am sure Christ Jesus will suit them. No Christians will
          reject such meat as this; only prepare it, and with a hot heart serve
          it up on the table, and they will be satisfied and feed to the full.
          So that there is adaptation as well as variety in this subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But more than this, I must add, and this will bring me to my last
          point, for my time flies -- there is a power about this subject when
          it is preached with the demonstration of the Spirit, which is not
          found in any other. My brethren, what power there is in this subject
          to promote the union of the people of God! There is a man there, he is
          almost a Puseyite. "I do not like him," says one. Stop till I tell you
          something more about him, and you will. There is another man there, a
          Presbyterian -- true blue; he cannot bear Independency, or anything
          but Presbytery -- a covenant man. "Well," says one, "I like him a
          little better; but I do not suppose we shall get on very well." Stop!
          I will tell you some more about him. There is another man down there;
          he is a very strong Calvinist. "Humph," says one, "I shall not admire
          him." Stop, stop! Now, here are these three men; let us hear what they
          say of each other. If they know nothing of each other except what I
          have stated, the first time they meet there will be a magnificent
          quarrel. There is yonder clergyman -- he will have little fraternity
          whatever with the ultra-Evangelical; while the Presbyterian will
          reject them both, for he abhors black prelacy. But, my dear brethren,
          all three of you, we of this congregation will approve of you all, and
          you will approve of one another when I have stated your true
          character. That man yonder, whom I called almost a Puseyite, was
          George Herbert. How he loved the doornails of the church! I think he
          would scarce have had a spider killed that had once crept across the
          church aisles. He was a thorough churchman, to the very centre of the
          marrow of his bones; but what a Christian! What a lover of his sweet
          Lord Jesus! You know that hymn of his which I have so often quoted,
          and mean to quote a hundred times more: "How sweetly doth my Master's
          sound," and so forth. I hear a knock at the door. "Who is that?" "Why,
          it is a very strong churchman." "Do not show him in; I am at prayer; I
          cannot pray with him." "Oh, but it is George Herbert!" "Oh, let him
          in, let him in! No man could I pray better with than Mr. Herbert. Walk
          in, Mr. Herbert; we are right glad to see you; you are our dear
          companion; your hymns have made us glad."
        </p>
        <p>
          But who was that second man, the Presbyterian, who would not have
          liked George Herbert at all? Why, that was Samuel Rutherford. What a
          seraphic spirit! What splendid metaphors he uses about his sweet Lord
          Jesus! He has written all Solomon's Song over without knowing it. He
          felt and proved it to be divine. The Spirit in him re-dictated the
          song. Well now, I think, we will introduce Mr. Rutherford and Mr.
          Herbert together, and I am persuaded when they begin to speak about
          their Master they will find each other next of kin; and I feel sure
          that, by this time, Samuel Rutherford and George Herbert have found
          each other out in heaven, and are sitting side by side. Well, but then
          we mentioned another; who was that high Calvinist? He was the man who
          was called the Leviathan of Antinomians. That he was a leviathan I
          will grant, but that he was an Antinomian is false. It was Dr. Hawker.
          Now, I am sure, George Herbert would not have liked Dr. Hawker, and I
          am certain that Dr. Hawker would not have liked George Herbert, and I
          do not suppose that Samuel Rutherford would have had anything to do
          with either of them. "No, no," he would say, "your black prelacy I
          hate." But look at Hawker, there is a sweet spirit; he cannot take up
          his pen but he dips it in Christ, and begins to write about his Lord
          at once "Precious Immanuel -- precious Jesus." Those words in his
          morning and evening portions are repeated again and again, and again.
          I recollect hearing of Mr. Rowland Hill, that he said to a young man
          who was at tea with him one night when he was about to go: -- "Where
          are you going to?" "Oh!" said he, "I am going to hear Dr. Hawker, at
          St. George's in the Borough." "Oh, go and hear him," he said; "he is a
          right good man, worth hearing. But there is this difference between
          him and me; my preaching is something like a pudding, with here and
          there a plum; but Dr. Hawker's is all plum." And that was very near
          the mark, because Dr. Hawker was all Christ. He was constantly
          preaching of his Master; and even if he gave an invitation to a
          sinner, it was generally put in this way: "What sayest thou? Wilt thou
          go with this man, and be married and espoused unto him? It was the
          preaching of a personal Christ that made his ministry so full of
          marrow and fatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends, let a man stand up and exalt Christ, and we are all
          agreed. I see before me this afternoon members of all Christian
          denominations; but if Christ Jesus is not the topic that suits you,
          why then I think we may question your Christianity. The more Christ is
          preached, the more will the Church prove, and exhibit, and assert, and
          maintain her unity; but the less Christ is preached, and the more of
          Paul, and Apollos, and Cephas, the more of strife and division, and
          the less of true Christian fellowship.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only mention the power of the preaching of Christ upon the
          heart of sinners. There is a person, now a member of my church, whose
          conversion was owing to the reading of that hymn:
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, lover of my soul."</p>
        <p>
          "Ah," said he "does Jesus love my soul? Then how vile I have been to
          neglect him." There are scores whose conversion is distinctly and
          directly traceable, not to doctrine -- though that is often useful --
          nor experience, nor practice, though these are fruitful, but to the
          preaching of Christ. I think you will find the most fertile sermons
          have always been the most Christly sermons. This is a seed which
          seldom rots under the clod. One may fall upon the stony ground, but it
          oftener happens that the seed breaks the stone when it falls, and as
          Christ is a root out of a dry ground, so this finds root for itself
          even in dry, hard, stony hearts. We ought to preach the law, we ought
          to thunder out the threatenings of God, but they must never be the
          main topic. Christ, Christ, Christ, if we would have men converted. Do
          you want to convince yonder careless one? Tell him the story of the
          cross. Under God it will arrest his attention and awaken his thoughts.
          Would you subdue the carnal affections of yonder profligate? Preach
          the love of Christ, and that new love shall uproot the old. Would you
          bind up yonder broken heart? Bring forth Christ, for in him there is a
          cordial for every fear. Christ is preached and we do rejoice, yea, and
          will rejoice "for he is the power of God unto salvation unto every one
          that believeth." Judge not, my dear brethren, any man's ministry. The
          world has too often condemned the man whom God intended to honour. Say
          not of such an one "He can do no good, for his language is rough and
          rude." Say not of another that his style is too often marred with
          flippancy. Say not of a third that he is too erudite or soars too
          high. Every man in his own order. If that man preach Christ, whether
          he be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, we wish him God speed; for God will
          bless the Christ he preaches, and forgive the error which mingled with
          his ministry. I must even frankly admit the truth of many a criticism
          that has been uttered on my ministry, but I know it has been
          successful, and under God it has been, because I have sought to preach
          Christ. I say that without boasting or egotism, because if I had not
          done so I had no right so be a minister of Christ at all, and as I
          claim to be God's minister, I will and must declare it, whatever I
          have not preached, I have preached Christ, and into whatever mistakes
          I have fallen, I have sought to point to his cross, and say, "Behold
          the way to God." And if ye see others preaching Christ, be not you
          their foe. Pray for them; bear them in your arms before God; their
          errors may yet be outgrown, if they preach Christ; but if not, I care
          not what their excellency may be, the excellency shall die and expire
          like sparks that go out in darkness. They have not the fuel of the
          flame, for they have not Christ Jesus as the substance of their
          ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          May I entreat, in closing, your earnest prayer, each one of you, that
          in this house as well as in all the places of worship round about,
          Christ may evermore be preached, and I may add my own sincere desire
          that this place may become a hissing and the abode of dragons, and
          this pulpit be burned with fire, or ever any other gospel be preached
          here than that which we have received of the holy apostles of God; and
          of which Jesus Christ himself is the chief corner stone. Let me have
          your incessant prayers. May God speed every minister of Christ. But
          where there is so large a field of labour may I claim your earnest and
          constant intercessions, that where Christ is lifted up, men may be
          drawn to hear, and afterwards drawn to believe, that they may find
          Christ the Saviour of our souls. "He that believeth, and is baptized,
          shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned." "Repent and be
          converted, every one of you," said Peter. Yet again said Paul to the
          jailer, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, and thy
          house." God give us grace to believe, and unto him be glory for ever
          and ever. Amen.<br />
