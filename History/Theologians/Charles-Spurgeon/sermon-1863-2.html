        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.494)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 15th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called
          Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus
          to kiss him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of
          man with a kiss?" -- Luke 22:47, 48.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN SATAN HAD BEEN ENTIRELY worsted in his conflict with Christ in
          the garden, the man-devil Judas came upon the scene. As the Parthian
          in his flight turns round to shoot the fatal arrow, so the arch-enemy
          aimed another shaft at the Redeemer, by employing the traitor into
          whom he had entered. Judas became the devil's deputy, and a most
          trusty and serviceable tool he was. The Evil One had taken entire
          possession of the apostate's heart, and, like the swine possessed of
          devils, he ran violently downwards towards destruction. Well had
          infernal malice selected the Savior's trusted friend to be his
          treacherous betrayer, for thus he stabbed at the very center of his
          broken and bleeding heart. But, beloved, as in all things God is wiser
          than Satan, and the Lord of goodness outwitteth the Prince of Evil,
          so, in this dastardly betrayal of Christ, prophecy was fulfilled, and
          Christ was the more surely declared to be the promised Messiah. Was
          not Joseph a type? and, lo! like that envied youth, Jesus was sold by
          his own brethren. Was he not to be another Samson, by whose strength
          the gates of hell should be torn from their posts? lo! like Samson, he
          is bound by his countrymen, and delivered to the adversary. Know ye
          not that he was the anti-type of David? and was not David deserted by
          Ahithophel, his own familiar friend and counsellor? Nay, brethren, do
          not the words of the Psalmist receive a literal fulfillment in our
          Master's betrayal? What prophecy can be more exactly true than the
          language of the forty-first and fifty-fifth Psalms? In the first we
          read, "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
          of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me;" and in the
          fifty-fifth the Psalmist is yet more clear; "For it was not an enemy
          that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that
          hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid
          myself from him: but it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
          acquaintance. We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the
          house of God in company. He hath put forth his hands against such as
          be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. The words of his
          mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words
          were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords." Even an obscure
          passage in one of the lesser prophets, must have a literal
          fulfillment, and for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a base
          slave, must the Savior be betrayed by his choice friend. Ah! thou foul
          fiend, thou shalt find at the last that thy wisdom is but intensified
          folly; as for the deep plots and plans of thy craft, the Lord shall
          laugh them to scorn; after all, thou art but the unconscious drudge of
          him whom thou abhorrest; in all the black work thou doest so greedily,
          thou art no better than a mean scullion in the royal kitchen of the
          King of kings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without further preface, let us advance to the subject of our Lord's
          betrayal. First, concentrate your thoughts upon Jesus, the betrayed
          one; and when ye have lingered awhile there, solemnly gaze into the
          villanous countenance of Judas, the betrayer -- he may prove a beacon
          to warn us against the sin which gendereth apostacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. LET US TARRY AWHILE, AND SEE OUR LORD UNGRATEFULLY AND DASTARDLY
          BETRAYED.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is appointed that he must die, but how shall he fall into the hands
          of his adversaries? Shall they capture him in conflict? It must not
          be, lest he appear an unwilling victim. Shall he flee before his foes
          until he can hide no longer? It is not meet that a sacrifice should be
          hunted to death. Shall he offer himself to the foe? That were to
          excuse his murderers, or be a party to their crime. Shall he be taken
          accidentally or unawares? That would withdraw from his cup the
          necessary bitterness which made it wormwood mingled with gall. No; he
          must be betrayed by his friend, that he may bear the utmost depths of
          suffering, and that in every separate circumstance there may be a well
          of grief. One reason for the appointment of the betrayal, lay in the
          fact that it was ordained that man's sin should reach its culminating
          point in his death. God, the great owner of the vineyard, had sent
          many servants, and the husbandmen had stoned one and cast out another;
          last of all, he said, "I will send my Son; surely they will reverence
          my Son." When they slew the heir to win the inheritance, their
          rebellion had reached its height. The murder of our blessed Lord was
          the extreme of human guilt; it developed the deadly hatred against God
          which lurks in the heart of man. When man became a deicide, sin had
          reached its fullness; and in the black deed of the man by whom the
          Lord was betrayed, that fullness was all displayed. If it had not been
          for a Judas, we had not known how black, how foul, human nature may
          become. I scorn the men who try to apologize for the treachery of this
          devil in human form, this son of perdition, this foul apostate. I
          should think myself a villain if I tried to screen him, and I shudder
          for the men who dare extenuate his crimes. My brethren, we should feel
          a deep detestation of this master of infamy; he has gone to his own
          place, and the anathema of David, part of which was quoted by Peter,
          has come upon him, "When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and
          let his prayer become sin. Let his days be few; and let another take
          his office." Surely, as the devil was allowed unusually to torment the
          bodies of men, even so was he let loose to get possession of Judas as
          he has seldom gained possession of any other man, that we might see
          how foul, how desperately evil is the human heart. Beyond a doubt,
          however, the main reason for this was that Christ might offer a
          perfect atonement for sin. We may usually read the sin in the
          punishment. Man betrayed his God. Man had the custody of the royal
          garden, and should have kept its green avenues sacred for communion
          with his God; but he betrayed the trust; the sentinel was false; he
          admitted evil into his own heart, and so into the paradise of God. He
          was false to the good name of the Creator, tolerating the insinuation
          which he should have repelled with scorn. Therefore must Jesus find
          man a traitor to him. There must be the counterpart of the sin in the
          suffering which he endured. You and I have often betrayed Christ. We
          have, when tempted, chosen the evil and forsaken the good; we have
          taken the bribes of hell, and have not followed closely with Jesus. It
          seemed most fitting, then, that he who bore the chastisement of sin
          should be reminded of its ingratitude and treachery by the things
          which he suffered. Besides, brethren, that cup must be bitter to the
          last degree which is to be the equivalent for the wrath of God. There
          must be nothing consolatory in it; pains must be taken to pour into it
          all that even Divine wisdom can invent of awful and unheard of woe,
          and this one point -- "He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
          heel against me," was absolutely necessary to intensify the
          bitterness. Moreover, we feel persuaded that by thus suffering at the
          hand of a traitor the Lord became a faithful High Priest, able to
          sympathize with us when we fall under the like affliction. Since
          slander and ingratitude are common calamities, we can come to Jesus
          with lull assurance of faith; he knows these sore temptations, for he
          has felt them in their very worst degree. We may cast every care, and
          every sorrow upon him, for he careth for us, having suffered with us.
          Thus, then, in our Lord's betrayal, Scripture was fulfilled, sin was
          developed, atonement was completed, and the great all-suffering High
          Priest became able to sympathize with us in every point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let us look at the treason itself. You perceive how black it was.
          Judas was Christ's servant, what if I call him his confidential
          servant. He was a partaker in apostolic ministry and the honor of
          miraculous gifts. He had been most kindly and indulgently treated. He
          was a sharer in all the goods of his Master, in fact he fared far
          better than his Lord, for the Man of Sorrows always took the lion's
          share of all the pains of poverty and the reproach of slander. He had
          food and raiment given him out of the common stock, and the Master
          seems to have indulged him very greatly. The old tradition is, that
          next to the apostle Peter he was the one with whom the Savior most
          commonly associated. We think there must be a mistake there, for
          surely John was the Savior's greatest friend; but Judas, as a servant
          had been treated with the utmost confidence. Ye know, brethren, how
          sore is that blow which comes from a servant in whom we have put
          unlimited trust. But Judas was more than this: he was a friend, a
          trusted friend. That little bag into which generous women cast their
          small contributions had been put into his hands, and very wisely too,
          for he had the financial vein. His main virtue was economy, a very
          needful quality in a treasurer. As exercising a prudent foresight for
          the little company, and watching the expenses carefully, he was, as
          far as men could judge, the right man in the right place. He had been
          thoroughly trusted. I read not that there was any annual audit of his
          accounts; I do not discover that the Master took him to task as to the
          expenditure of his privy purse. Everything was given to him, and he
          gave, at the Master's direction, to the poor, but no account was
          asked. This is vile indeed, to be chosen to such a position, to be
          installed purse-bearer to the Ring of kings, Chancellor of God's
          exchequer, and then to turn aside and sell the Savior; this is treason
          in its uttermost degree. Remember that the world looked upon Judas as
          colleague and partner with our Lord. To a great extent the name of
          Judas was associated with that of Christ. When Peter, James, or John
          had done anything amiss, reproachful tongues threw it all on their
          Master. The twelve were part and parcel of Jesus of Nazareth. One old
          commentator says of Judas -- "He was Christ's alter ego" -- to the
          people at large there was an indentification of each apostle with the
          leader of the band. And oh! when such associations have been
          established, and then there is treachery, it is as though our arm
          should commit treason against our head, or as if our foot should
          desert the body. This was a stab indeed! Perhaps, dear brethren, our
          Lord saw in the person of Judas a representative man, the portraiture
          of the many thousands who in after ages imitated his crime. Did Jesus
          see in Iscariot all the Judases who betray truth, virtue, and the
          cross? Did he perceive the multitudes of whom we may say, that they
          were, spiritually, in the loins of Judas? Hymeneus, Alexander,
          Hermogenes, Philetus, Demas, and others of that tribe, were all before
          him as he saw the man, his equal, his acquaintance, bartering him away
          for thirty pieces of silver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, the position of Judas must have tended greatly to
          aggravate his treason. Even the heathens have taught us that
          ingratitude is the worst of vices. When Caesar was stabbed by his
          friend Brutus, the world's poet writes --
        </p>
        <p>"This was the most unkindest cut of all;</p>
        <p>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
        <p>Ingratitude, more strong than traitor's arms,</p>
        <p>Quite vanquish'd him; then burst his mighty heart;</p>
        <p>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
        <p>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</p>
        <p>________________________great Caesar fell."</p>
        <p>
          Many ancient stories, both Greek and Roman, we might quote to show the
          abhorrence which the heathens entertain towards ingratitude and
          treachery. Certain, also, of their own poets, such, for instance, as
          Sophocles, have poured out burning words upon deceitful friends; but
          we have no time to prove what you will all admit, that nothing can be
          more cruel, nothing more full of anguish, than to be sold to
          destruction by one's bosom friend. The closer the foeman comes the
          deeper will be the stab he gives; if we admit him to our heart, and
          give him our closest intimacy, then can he wound us in the most vital
          part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us notice, dear friends, while we look at the breaking heart of
          our agonizing Savior, the manner in which he met this affliction. He
          had been much in prayer; prayer had overcome his dreadful agitation;
          he was very calm; and we need to be very calm when we are forsaken by
          a friend. Observe his gentleness. The first word he spake to Judas,
          when the traitor had polluted his cheek with a kiss, was this --
          "FRIEND!" FRIEND!! Note that! Not "Thou hateful miscreant," but
          "Friend, wherefore art thou come?" not "Wretch, wherefore dost thou
          dare to stain my cheek with thy foul and lying lips?" no, "Friend,
          wherefore art thou come?" Ah! if there had been anything good left in
          Judas, this would have brought it out. If he had not been an
          unmitigated, incorrigible, thrice-dyed traitor, his avarice must have
          lost its power at that instant, and he would have cried -- "My master!
          I came to betray thee, but that generous word has won my soul; here,
          if thou must be bound, I will be bound with thee; I make a full
          confession of my infamy!" Our Lord added these words -- there is
          reproof in them, but notice how kind they are still, how much too good
          for such a caitiff -- "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a
          kiss?" I can conceive that the tears gushed from his eyes, and that
          his voice faltered, when he thus addressed his own familiar friend and
          acquaintance -- "Betrayest thou," my Judas, my treasurer, "betrayest
          thou the Son of Man," thy suffering, sorrowing friend, whom thou hast
          seen naked and poor, and without a place whereon to lay his head.
          Betrayest thou the Son of Man -- and dost thou prostitute the fondest
          of all endearing signs -- a kiss -- that which should be a symbol of
          loyalty to the King, shall it be the badge of thy treachery -- that
          which was reserved for affection as her best symbol -- dost thou make
          it the instrument of my destruction? Betrayest thou the Son of Man
          with a kiss?" Oh! if he had not been given up to hardness of heart, if
          the Holy Ghost had not utterly left him, surely this son of perdition
          would have fallen prostrate yet again, and weeping out his very soul,
          would have cried -- "No, I cannot betray thee, thou suffering Son of
          man; forgive, forgive; spare thyself; escape from this bloodthirsty
          crew, and pardon thy treacherous disciple!" But no, no word of
          compunction, while the silver is at stake! Afterwards came the sorrow
          that worketh death, which drove him, like Ahithophel, his prototype,
          to court the gallows to escape remorse. This, also, must have
          aggravated the woe of our beloved Lord, when he saw the final
          impenitence of the traitor, and read the tearful doom of that man of
          whom he had once said, it would be better for him that he had never
          been born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I would have you fix your eyes on your Lord in your quiet
          meditations as being thus despised and rejected of men, a man of
          sorrows and acquainted with grief; and gird up the loins of your
          minds, counting it no strange thing if this fiery trial should come
          upon you, but being determined that though your Lord should be
          betrayed by his most eminent disciples, yet, through his grace you
          will cling to him in shame and in suffering, and will follow him, if
          needs be, even unto death. God give us grace to see the vision of his
          nailed hands and feet, and remembering that all this came from the
          treachery of a friend, let us be very jealous of ourselves, lest we
          crucify the Lord afresh and put him to an open shame by betraying him
          in our conduct, or in our words, or in our thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Grant me your attention while we make an estimate of the man by
          whom the Son of man was betrayed -- JUDAS THE BETRAYER.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would call your attention, dear friends, to his position and public
          character. Judas was a preacher; nay, he was a foremost preacher, "he
          obtained part of this ministry," said the Apostle Peter. He was not
          simply one of the seventy; he had been selected by the Lord himself as
          one of the twelve, an honorable member of the college of the apostles.
          Doubtless he had preached the gospel so that many had been gladdened
          by his voice, and miraculous powers had been vouchsafed to him, so
          that at his word the sick had been healed, deaf ears had been opened;
          and the blind had been made to see; nay, there is no doubt that he who
          could not keep the devil out of himself, had cast devils out of
          others. Yet how art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
          morning! He that was as a prophet in the midst of the people, and
          spake with the tongue of the learned, whose word and wonders proved
          that he had been with Jesus and had learned of him -- he betrays his
          Master. Understand, my brethren, that no gifts can ensure grace, and
          that no position of honor or usefulness in the Church will necessarily
          prove our being true to our Lord and Master. Doubtless there are
          bishops in hell, and crowds of those who once occupied the pulpit are
          now condemed for ever to bewail their hyprocrisy. You that are
          Church-officers, do not conclude that because you enjoy the confidence
          of the Church, that therefore of an absolute certainty the grace of
          God is in you. Perhaps it is the most dangerous of all positions for a
          man to become well known and much respected by the religious world,
          and yet to be rotten at the core. To be where others can observe our
          faults is a healthy thing though painful; but to live with beloved
          friends who would not believe it possible for us to do wrong, and who
          if they saw us err would make excuses for us -- this is to be where it
          is next to impossible for us ever to be aroused if our hearts be not
          right with God. To have a fair reputation and a false heart is to
          stand upon the brink of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judas took a very high degree officially. He had the distinguished
          honor of being entrusted with the Master's financial concerns, and
          this, after all, was no small degree to which to attain. The Lord, who
          knows how to use all sorts of gifts, perceived what gift the man had.
          He knew that Peter's unthinking impetuosity would soon empty the bag
          and leave the company in great straits, and if he had entrusted it to
          John, his loving spirit might have been cajoled into unwise
          benevolence towards beggars of unctious tongue; he might even have
          spent the little moneys in buying alabaster boxes whose precious
          ointments should anoint the Master's head. He gave the bag to Judas,
          and it was discreetly, prudently, and properly used; there is no doubt
          he was the most judicious person, and fitted to occupy the post. But
          oh! dear friends, if the Master shall choose any of us who are
          ministers or Church-officers, and give us a very distinguished
          position; if our place in the ranks shall be that of commanding
          officers, so that even our brother ministers look up with esteem, and
          our fellow-elders or deacons regard us as being fathers in Israel --
          oh! if we turn, if we prove false, how damnable shall be our end at
          the last! What a blow shall we give to the heart of the Church, and
          what derision will be made in hell!

          You will observe that the character of Judas was openly an admirable
          one. I find not that he committed himself in any way. Not the
          slightest speck defiled his moral character so far as others could
          perceive. He was no boaster, like Peter; he was free enough from the
          rashness which cries, "Though all men should forsake thee yet will not
          I." He asks no place on the right hand of the throne, his ambition is
          of another sort. He does not ask idle questions. The Judas who asks
          questions is "not Iscariot." Thomas and Philip are often prying into
          deep matters, but not Judas. He receives truth as it is taught him,
          and when others are offended and walk no more with Jesus, he
          faithfully adheres to him, having golden reasons for so doing. He does
          not indulge in the lusts of the flesh or in the pride of life. None of
          the disciples suspected him of hypocrisy; they said at the table,
          "Lord, is it I?" They never said, "Lord, is it Judas?" It was true he
          had been filching for months, but then he did it by littles, and
          covered his defalcations so well by financial manipulations that he
          ran no risk of detection from the honest unsuspecting fishermen with
          whom he associated. Like some merchants and traders we have heard of
          -- invaluable gentlemen as chairmen of speculating companies and
          general managers of swindling banks -- he could abstract a decent
          per-centage and yet make the accounts exactly tally. The gentlemen who
          have learned of Judas, manage to cook the accounts most admirably for
          the shareholders, so as to get a rich joint for their own table; over
          which they, no doubt, entreat the divine blessing. Judas was, in his
          known life, a most admirable person. He would have been an alderman
          ere long there is no doubt, and being very pious and richly-gifted,
          his advent at churches or chapels would have created intense
          satisfaction. "What a discreet and influential person;" say the
          deacons. "Yes," replies the minister; "what an acquisition to our
          councils; if we could elect him to office he would be of eminent
          service to the Church." I believe that the Easter chose him as apostle
          on purpose that we might not be at all surprised if we find such a man
          a minister in the pulpit, or a colleague of the minister, working as
          an officer in Christ's Church. These are solemn things, my brethren;
          let us take them to heart, and if any of us wear a good character
          among men and stand high in office, let this question come home close
          to us -- "Lord, is it I? Lord, is it I?" Perhaps he who shall last ask
          the question is just the man who ought to have asked it first.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, secondly, I call your attention to his real nature and sin. Judas
          was a man with a conscience. He could not afford to do without it. He
          was no Sadducee who could fling religion overboard; he had strong
          religious tendencies. He was no debauched person; he never spent a
          two-pence in vice on his life, not that he loved vice less, but that
          he loved the two-pence more. Occasionally he was generous, but then it
          was with other people's money. Well did he watch his lovely charge,
          the bag. He had a conscience, I say, and a ferocious conscience it was
          when it once broke the chain, for it was his conscience which made him
          hang himself. But then it was a conscience that did not sit regularly
          on the throne; it reigned by fits and starts. Conscience was not the
          leading element. Avarice predominated over conscience. He would get
          money, if honestly, he liked that best, but if he could not get it
          conscientiously, then anyhow in the world. He was but a small trader;
          his gains were no great things, or else he would not have sold Christ
          for so small a sum as that -- ten pounds at the outside, of our money
          at its present value -- some three or four pounds, as it was in those
          days. It was a poor price to take for the Master; but then a little
          money was a great thing to him. He had been poor; he had joined Christ
          with the idea that he would soon be proclaimed King of the Jews, and
          that then he should become a nobleman, and be rich. Finding Christ a
          long while in coming to his kingdom, he had taken little by little,
          enough to lay by in store; and now, fearing that he was to be
          disappointed in all his dreams, and never having had any care for
          Christ, but only for himself, he gets out of what he thinks to have
          been a gross mistake in the best way he can, and makes money by his
          treason against his Lord. Brethren, I do solemnly believe, that of all
          hypocrites, those are the persons of whom there is the least hope
          whose God is their money. You may reclaim a drunkard; thank God, we
          have seen many instances of that; and even a fallen Christian, who has
          given way to vice, may loathe his lust, and return from it; but I fear
          me that the cases in which a man who is cankered with covetousness has
          ever been saved, are so few, that they might be written on your
          finger-nail. This is a sin which the world does not rebuke; the most
          faithful minister can scarce smit its forehead. God knoweth what
          thunders I have launched out against men who are all for this world,
          and yet pretend to be Christ's followers; but yet they always say, "I
          is not for me." What I should call stark naked covetousness, they call
          prudence, discretion, economy, and so on; and actions which I would
          scorn to spit upon, they will do, and think their hands quite clean
          after they have done them, and still sit as God's people sit, and hear
          as God's people hear, and think that after they have sold Christ for
          paltry gain, they will go to heaven. O souls, souls, souls, beware,
          beware, beware, most of all of greed! It is not money, nor the lack of
          money, but the love of money which is the root of all evil. It is not
          getting it; it is not even keeping it; it is loving it; it is making
          it your god; it is looking at that as the main chance, and not
          considering the cause of Christ, nor the truth of Christ, nor the holy
          life of Christ, but being ready to sacrifice everything for gains'
          sake. Oh! such men make giants in sin; they shall be set up for ever
          as butts for infernal laughter; their damnation shall be sure and
          just.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third point is, the warning which Judas received, and the way in
          which he persevered. Just think -- the night before he sold his Master
          what do you think the Master did? Why, he washed his feet! And yet he
          sold him! Such condescension! Such love! Such familiarity! He took a
          towel, and girded himself, and washed Judas's feet! And yet those very
          feet brought Judas as a guide to them that took Jesus! And you
          remember what he said when he had washed his feet -- "Now ye are
          clean, but not all;" and he turned a tearful eye on Judas. What a
          warning for him! What could be more explicit? Then when the Supper
          came, and they began to eat and drink together, the Lord said -- "One
          of you shall betray me." That was plain enough; and a little farther
          on he said explicitly -- "He that dippeth with me in the dish the same
          is he." What opportunities for repentance! He cannot say he had not a
          faithful preacher. What could have been more personal? If he does not
          repent now, what is to be done? Moreover, Judas saw that which was
          enough to make a heart of adamant bleed; he saw Christ with agony on
          his face, for it was just after Christ had said "Now is my soul
          troubled," that Judas left the feast and went out to sell his Master.
          That face, so full of grief, ought to have turned him, must have
          turned him, if he had not been, given up and left alone, to deliver
          over his soul unto his own devices. What language could have been more
          thundering than the words of Jesus Christ, when he said, "Woe unto
          that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for that
          man if he had not been born." He had said, "Have not I chosen you
          twelve, and one of you is a devil." Now, if while these thunders
          rolled over his head, and the lightningflashes pointed at his person,
          if, then, this man was not aroused, what a hell of infernal
          pertinacity and guilt must have been within his soul! Oh! but if any
          of you, if any of you shall sell Christ for the sake of keeping the
          shop open on Sunday, if you shall sell Christ for the extra wages you
          may earn for falsehood -- oh! if you shall sell Christ for the sake of
          the hundred pounds that you may lay hold of by a villanous contract --
          if you do that, you do not perish unwarned. I come into this pulpit to
          please no man among you. God knoweth if I knew more of your follies
          you should have them pointed out yet more plainly; if I knew more of
          the tricks of business, I would not flinch to speak of them! But, O
          sirs, I do conjure you by the blood of Judas, who hanged himself at
          last, turn you -- if such there be -- turn you from this evil, if
          haply your sin may be blotted out!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us for one minute notice the act itself. He sought out his own
          temptation. He did not wait for the devil to come to him; he went
          after the devil. He went to the chief priests and said, "What will ye
          give me?" One of the old Puritan divines says, "This is not the way
          people generally trade; they tell their own price." Judas says "What
          will ye give me? Anything you like. The Lord of life and glory sold at
          the buyer's own price. What will ye give me?" And another very
          prettily puts it, "What could they give him? What did the man want? He
          did not want food and raiment; he fared as well as his Master and the
          other disciples; he had enough; he had all that his needs could crave,
          and yet he said, What will ye give me? What will ye give me? What will
          ye give ne?" Alas! some people's religion is grounded on that one
          question -- "What will you give me?" Yes, they would go to church if
          there are any charities given away there, but if there were more to be
          got by not going they would do that. "What will you give me?" Some of
          these people are not even so wise as Judas. Ah! there is a man over
          yonder who would sell the Lord for a crown, much more for ten pounds,
          as Judas did! Why, there are some who will sell Christ for the
          smallest piece of silver in our currency. They are tempted to deny
          their Lord, tempted to act in an unhallowed way, though the gains are
          so paltry that a year's worth of them would not come to much. No
          subject could be more dreadful than this, if we really would but look
          at it carefully. This temptation happeneth to each of us. Do not deny
          it. We all like to gain; it is but natural that we should; the
          propensity to acquire is in every mind, and under lawful restrictions
          it is not an improper propensity; but when it comes into conflict with
          our allegiance to our Master, and in a world like this it often will,
          we must overcome it or perish. There will arise occasions with some of
          you many times in a week in which it is "God -- or gain;" "Christ, or
          the thirty pieces of silver;" and therefore I am the more urgent in
          pressing this on you. Do not, though the world should bid its highest,
          though it should heap its comforts upon one another, and add fame, and
          hononr, and respect, do not, I pray you, forsake your Master. There
          have been such cases; cases of persons who used to come here, but they
          found they did not get on, because Sunday was the best day's trade in
          the week; they had some good feelings, some good impressions once, but
          they have lost them now. We have known others who have said, "Well,
          you see, I did once think I loved the Lord, but my business went so
          badly when I came up to the house of God, that I left it; I renounced
          my profession." Ah, Judas! ah, Judas! ah, Judas! let me call thee by
          thy name, for such thou art! This is the sin of the apostate over
          again; God help thee to repent of it, and go, not to any priest, but
          to Christ and make confession, if haply thou mayest be saved. You
          perceive that in the act of selling Christ, Judas was faithful to his
          master. "Faithful to his master?" you say. Yes, his master was the
          devil, and having made an agreement with him he carried it out
          honestly. Some people are always very honest with the devil. If they
          say they will do a wrong thing they say they ought to do it because
          they said they would; as if any oath could be binding on a man if it
          be an oath to do wrong? "I will never go into that house again," some
          have said, and they have said afterwards, "Well, I wish I had not said
          it." Was it a wrong thing? What is your oath then? It was an oath
          given to the devil. What was that foolish promise but a promise to
          Satan, and will you be faithful to him? Ah! would God that you were
          faithful to Christ! Would that any of us were as true to Christ as
          Satan's servants are to their master!
        </p>
        <p>
          Judas betrayed his Master with a kiss. That is how most apostates do
          it; it is always with a kiss. Did you ever read an infidel book in
          your life which did not begin with profound respect for truth? I never
          have. Even modern ones, when bishops write them, always begin like
          that. They betray the Son of man with a kiss. Did you ever read a bank
          of bitter controversy which did not begin with such a sickly lot of
          humility, such sugar, such butter, such treacle, such everything sweet
          and soft, that you said, "Ah! there is sure to be something bad here,
          for when people begin so softly and sweetly, so humbly and so
          smoothly, depend upon it they have rank hatred in their hearts." The
          most devout looking people are often the most hypocritical in the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude with the repentance of Judas. He did repent; he did
          repent, but it was the repentance that worketh death. He did make a
          confession, but there was no respect to the deed itself, but only to
          its consequences. He was very sorry that Christ was condemned. Some
          latent love that he had once had to a kind Master, came up when he saw
          that he was condemned. He did not think, perhaps, it would come to
          that; he may have had a hope that he would escape out of their hands,
          and then he would keep his thirty pieces of silver and perhaps sell
          him over again. Perhaps he thought that he would rid himself from
          their hands by some miraculous display of power, or would proclaim the
          kingdom, and so he himself would only be hastening on that very
          blessed consummation. Friends, the man who repents of consequences
          does not repent. The ruffian repents of the gallows but not of the
          murder, and that is no repentance at all. Human law of course must
          measure sin by consequences, but God's law does not. There is a
          pointsman on a railway who neglects his duty; there is a collision on
          the line, and people are killed; well, it is manslaughter to this man
          through his carelessness. But that pointsman, perhaps, many times
          before had neglected his duty, but no accident came of it, and then he
          walked home and said, "Well, I have done no wrong." Now the wrong,
          mark you, is never to be measured by the accident, but by the thing
          itself, and if you have committed an offense and you have escaped
          undetected it is just as vile in God's eye; if you have done wrong and
          Providence has prevented the natural result of the wrong, the honor of
          that is with God, but you are as guilty as if your sin had been
          carried out to its fullest consequences, and the whole world set
          ablaze. Never measure sin by consequences, but repent of them as they
          are in themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though being sorry for consequences, since these are unalterable, this
          man was led to remorse. He sought a tree, adjusted the rope, and
          hanged himself, but in his haste he hanged himself so badly that the
          rope broke, he fell over a precipice, and there we read his bowels
          gushed out; he lay a mangled mass at the bottom of the cliff, the
          horror of every one who passed. Now you that make a gain of godliness
          -- if there be such here -- you may not come to a suicide's end, but
          take the lesson home. Mr. Keach, my venerable predecessor, gives at
          the end of one of his volumes of sermons, the death of a Mr. John
          Child. John Child had been a Dissenting minister, and for the sake of
          gain, to get a living, he joined the Episcopalians against his
          conscience; he sprinkled infants; and practiced all the other
          paraphernalia of the Church against his conscience. At last, at last,
          he was arrested with such terrors for having done what he had, that he
          renounced his living, took to a sick bed, and his dying oaths, and
          blasphemies, and curses, were something so dreadful, that his case was
          the wonder of that age. Mr. Keach wrote a full account of it, and many
          went to try what they could do to comfort the man, but he would say,
          "Get ye hence; get ye hence; it is of no use; I have sold Christ." You
          know, also, the wonderful death of Francis Spira. In all literature,
          there is nothing so awful as the death of Spira. The man had known the
          truth; he stood well among reformers; he was an hononred, and to a
          certain extent apparently a faithful man; but he went back to the
          Church of Rome; he apostatized; and then when conscience was aroused
          he did not fly to Christ, but he looked at the consequences instead of
          at the sin, and so, feeling that the consequences could not be
          altered, he forget that the sin might be pardoned, and perished in
          agonies extreme. May it never be the unhappy lot of any of us to stand
          by such a death-bed; but the Lord have mercy upon us now, and make us
          search our hearts. Those of you who say, "We do not want that sermon,"
          are probably the persons who need it most. He who shall say, "Well, we
          have no Judas amongst us," is probably a Judas himself. Oh! search
          yourselves; turn out every cranny; look in every corner of your soul,
          to see whether your religion be for Christ's sake, and for truth's
          sake, and for God's sake, or whether it be a profession which you take
          up because it is a respectable thing, a profession which you keep up
          because it keeps you up. The Lord search us and try us, and bring us
          to know our ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, in conclusion -- there is a Savior, and that Savior is
          willing to receive us now. If I am not a saint, yet I am a sinner.
          Would it not be best for all of us to go again to the fountain, and
          wash and be clean. Let each of us go anew, and say, "Master, thou
          knowest what I am; I know not myself; but, if I be wrong, make me
          right; if I be right, keep me so. My trust is in thee. Keep me now,
          for thine own sake, Jesus." Amen.<br />
