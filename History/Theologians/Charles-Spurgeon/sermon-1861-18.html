        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.404)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, August the 11th, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
          friends." -- Job 42:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE LORD turned the captivity of Job." So, then, our longest sorrows
          have a close, and there is a bottom to the profoundest depths of our
          misery. Our winters shall not frown for ever; summer shall soon smile.
          The tide shall not eternally ebb out; the floods retrace their march.
          The night shall not hang its darkness for ever over our souls; the sun
          shall yet arise with healing beneath his wings, -- "The Lord turned
          again the captivity of Job." Our sorrows shall have an end when God
          has gotten his end in them. The ends in the case of Job were these,
          that Satan might be defeated, foiled with his own weapons, blasted in
          his hopes when he had everything his own way. God, at Satan's
          challenge, had stretched forth his hand and touched Job in his bone
          and in his flesh, and yet the tempter could not prevail against him,
          but received his rebuff in those conquering words, "Though he slay me,
          yet will I trust in him." When Satan is defeated, then shall the
          battle cease. The Lord aimed also at the trial of Job's faith. Many
          weights were hung upon this palm tree, but it still grew uprightly.
          The fire had been fierce enough, the gold was undiminished, and only
          the dross was consumed. Another purpose the Lord had was his own
          glory. And God was glorified abundantly. Job had glorified God on his
          dunghill; now let him magnify his Lord again upon his royal seat in
          the gate. God had gotten unto himself eternal renown through that
          grace by which he supported his poor afflicted servant under the
          heaviest troubles which ever fell to the lot of man. God had another
          end, and that also was served. Job had been sanctified by his
          afflictions. His spirit had been mellowed. That small degree of
          tartness towards others, which may have been in Job's temper had been
          at last removed, and any self-justification which once had lurked
          within, was fairly driven out. Now God's gracious designs are
          answered, he removed the rod from his servant's back, and takes the
          melted silver from the midst of the glowing coals. God doth not
          afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men for nought, and he
          shows this by the fact that he never afflicts them longer than there
          is a need for it, and never suffers them to be one moment longer in
          the furnace than is absolutely requisite to serve the purposes of his
          wisdom and of his love. "The Lord turned again the captivity of Job."
          Beloved brother in Christ, thou hast had a long captivity in
          affliction. God hath sold thee into the hand of thine adversaries, and
          thou hast wept by the waters of Babylon, hanging thy harp upon the
          willows. Despair not! He that turned the captivity of Job can turn
          thine as the streams in the south. He shall make again thy vineyard to
          blossom, and thy field to yield her fruit. Thou shalt again come forth
          with those that make merry, and once more shall the song of gladness
          be on thy lip. Let not Despair rivet his cruel fetters about thy soul.
          Hope yet, for there is hope. Trust thou still, for there is ground of
          confidence. He shall bring thee up again rejoicing from the land of
          thy captivity, and thou shalt say of him, "He hath turned my mourning
          into dancing."
        </p>
        <p>
          The circumstance which attended Job's restoration is that to which I
          invite your particular attention. "The Lord turned again the captivity
          of Job, when he prayed for his friends." Intercessory prayer was the
          omen of his returning greatness. It was the bow in the cloud, the dove
          bearing the olive branch, the voice of the turtle announcing the
          coming summer. When his soul began to expand itself in holy and loving
          prayer for his erring brethren, then the heart of God showed itself to
          him by returning to him his prosperity without, and cheering his soul
          within. Brethren, it is not fetching a laborious compass, when from
          such a text as this I address you upon the subject of prayer for
          others. Let us learn today to imitate the example of Job, and pray for
          our friends, and peradventure if we have been in trouble, our
          captivity shall be turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four things I would speak of this morning, and yet but one thing; I
          would speak upon intercessory prayer thus -- first, by way of
          commending the exercise; secondly, by way of encouraging you to enlist
          in it; thirdly, by way of suggestion, as to the persons for whom you
          should especially pray; and fourthly, by way of exhortation to all
          believers to undertake and persevere in the exercise of intercession
          for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, BY WAY OF COMMENDING THE EXERCISE, let me remind you
          that intercessory prayer has been practiced by all the best of God's
          saints. We may not find instances of it appended to every saint's
          name, but beyond a doubt, there has never been a man eminent for piety
          personally, who has not always been pre-eminent in his anxious desires
          for the good of others, and in his prayers for that end. Take Abraham,
          the father of the faithful. How earnestly did he plead for his son
          Ishmael! "O that Ishmael might live before thee!" With what
          importunity did he approach the Lord on the plains of Mamre, when he
          wrestled with him again and again for Sodom; how frequently did he
          reduce the number, as though, to use the expression of the Puritan,
          "He were bidding and beating down the price at the market."
          "Peradventure there be fifty; peradventure there lack five of the
          fifty; peradventure there be twenty found there; peradventure there be
          ten righteous found there: wilt thou not spare the city for the sake
          of ten?" Well did he wrestle, and if we may sometimes be tempted to
          wish he had not paused when he did, yet we must commend him for
          continuing so long to plead for that doomed and depraved city.
          Remember Moses, the most royal of men, whether crowned or uncrowned;
          how often did he intercede! How frequently do you meet with such a
          record as this -- "Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before God!"
          Remember that cry of his on the top of the mount, when it was to his
          own personal disadvantage to intercede, and yet when God had said,
          "Let me alone, I will make of thee a great nation," yet how he
          continued, how he thrust himself in the way of the axe of justice, and
          cried, "Spare them, Lord, and if not," (and here he reached the very
          climax of agonizing earnestness) "blot my name out of the Book of
          Life." Never was there a mightier prophet than Moses, and never one
          more intensely earnest in intercessory prayer. Or pass on, if you
          will, to the days of Samuel. Remember his words, "God forbid that I
          should sin against the Lord, in ceasing to pray for you." Or bethink
          you of Solomon, and of his earnest intercession at the opening of the
          temple, when, with outstretched hands he prayed for the assembled
          people; or if you want another royal example, turn to Hezekiah with
          Sennacherib's letter spread out before the Lord, when he prayed not
          only for himself, but for God's people of Israel in those times of
          straits. Think ye, too, of Elias, who for Israel's sake would bring
          down the rain that the land perish not; as for himself, miracles gave
          him his bread and his water, it was for others that he prayed, and
          said to his servant, "Go again seven times." Forget not Jeremy, whose
          tears were prayers -- prayers coming too intensely from his heart to
          find expression in any utterance of the lip. He wept himself away, his
          life was one long shower, each drop a prayer, and the whole deluge a
          flood of intercession. And if you would have an example taken from the
          times of Christ and his apostles, remember how Peter prays on the top
          of the house, and Stephen amidst the falling stones. Or think you, if
          you will, of Paul, of whom even more than of others it could be said,
          that he never ceased to remember the saints in his prayers, "making
          mention of you daily in my prayers," stopping in the very midst of the
          epistle and saying, "For which cause I bow my knee unto the God and
          Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." As for the cloud of holy witnesses
          in our own time, I will hazard the assertion that there is not a
          single child of God who does not plead with God for his children, for
          his family, for the church at large, and for the poor ungodly
          perishing world. I deny his saintship if he does not pray for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, while we might commend this duty by quoting innumerable
          examples from the lives of eminent saints, it is enough for the
          disciple of Christ if we say that Christ in His holy gospel has made
          it your duty and your privilege to intercede for others. When he
          taught us to pray, he said, "Our Father," and the expressions which
          follow are not in the singular but in the plural -- "Give us this day
          our daily bread." "Forgive us our debts"; "Lead us not into
          temptation"; evidently intending to set forth that none of us are to
          pray for ourselves alone, that while we may have sometimes prayers so
          bitter that they must be personal like the Saviour's own -- "Father,
          if it be possible, let this cup pass from me"; yet, as a rule, our
          prayers should be public prayers, though offered in private; and even
          in secret we should not forget the church of the living God. By the
          mouth of Paul how frequently does the Holy Ghost exhort us to pray for
          ministers! "Brethren," says Paul, "pray for us"; and then after
          exhorting them to offer prayers and supplications for all classes and
          conditions of men, he adds, "And for us also that we may have boldness
          to speak as we ought to speak." While James, who is ever a practical
          apostle, bids us pray for one another; in that same verse, where he
          says, "Confess your sins the one to the other," he says, "and pray one
          for another," and adds the privilege "that ye may be healed," as if
          the healing would not only come to the sick person for whom we pray,
          but to us who offer the prayer; we, too, receiving some special
          blessing when our hearts are enlarged for the people of the living
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, I shall not stay to quote the texts in which the duty
          of praying for others is definitely laid down. Permit me to remind you
          of the high example of your Master; he is your pattern; follow ye his
          leadership. Was there even one who interceded as he did? Remember that
          golden prayer of his, where he cried for his own people, "Father, keep
          them, keep them from the evil!" Oh what a prayer was that! He seems to
          have thought of all their wants, of all their needs, of all their
          weaknesses, and in one long stream of intercession, he pours out his
          heart before his Father's throne. Bethink you how, even in the agonies
          of his crucifixion, he did not forget that he was still an intercessor
          for man. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Oh,
          remember, brethren, it is your Saviour's example to you today, for
          there before the throne, with outstretched hands, he prays not for
          himself, for he has attained his glory; not for himself, for he rests
          from his labours, and has received his everlasting recompense; but for
          you, for the purchase of his blood, for as many as are called by his
          grace, yea, and for those who shall believe on him through our word --
        </p>
        <p>"For all that come to God by him,</p>
        <p>Salvation he demands;</p>
        <p>Points to the wounds upon his heart,</p>
        <p>And spreads his bleeding hands."</p>
        <p>
          Come, brethren, with such an example as this, we are verily guilty if
          we forget to plead for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I will go a little further. If in the Bible there were no example
          of intercessory supplication, if Christ had not left it upon record
          that it was his will that we should pray for others, and even if we
          did not know that it was Christ's practice to intercede, yet the very
          spirit of our holy religion would constrain us to plead for others.
          Dost thou go up into thy closet, and in the face and presence of God
          think of none but thyself? Surely the love of Christ cannot be in
          thee, for the spirit of Christ is not selfish. No man liveth unto
          himself when once he has the love of Christ in him. I know there are
          some whose piety is comfortably tethered within the limits of their
          own selfish interests. It is enough for them if they hear the Word, if
          they be saved, if they get to heaven. Ah, miserable spirit, thou shalt
          not get there! It would need another heaven for thee, for the heaven
          of Christ is the heaven of the unselfish, the temple of the
          large-hearted, the bliss of living spirits, the heaven of those who,
          like Christ, are willing to become poor that others may be rich. I
          cannot believe -- it were a libel upon the cross of Christ, it were a
          scandal upon the doctrine which he taught -- if I could ever believe
          that the man whose prayers are selfish has anything of the spirit of
          Christ within him. Brethren, I commend intercessory prayer, because it
          opens man's soul, gives a healthy play to his sympathies, constrains
          him to feel that he is not everybody, and that this wide world and
          this great universe were not after all made that he might be its petty
          lord, that everything might bend to his will, and all creatures crouch
          at his feet. It does him good, I say, to make him know that the cross
          was not uplifted alone for him, for its far-reaching arms were meant
          to drop with benedictions upon millions of the human race. Thou lean
          and hungry worshipper of self, this is an exercise which would make
          another man of thee, a man more like the Son of Man, and less like
          Nabal the churl. But again; I commend the blessed privilege of
          intercession, because of its sweet brotherly nature. You and I may be
          naturally hard, and harsh, and unlovely of spirit, but praying much
          for others will remind us we have, indeed, a relationship to the
          saints, that their interests are ours, that we are jointly concerned
          with them in all the privileges of grace. I do not know anything
          which, through the grace of God, may be a better means of uniting us
          the one to the other than constant prayer for each other. You cannot
          harbour enmity in your soul against your brother after you have
          learned to pray for him. If he hath done you ill, when you have taken
          that ill to the mercy seat, and prayed over it, you must forgive.
          Surely you could not be such a hypocrite as to invoke blessings on his
          head before God and then come forth to curse him in your own soul.
          When there have been complaints brought by brother against brother, it
          is generally the best way to say, "Let us pray before we enter into
          the matter." Wherever there is a case to be decided by the pastor, he
          ought always to say to the brethren who contend, "Let us pray first,"
          and it will often happen that through prayer the differences will soon
          be forgotten. They will become so slight, so trivial, that when the
          brethren rise from their knees they will say, "They are gone; we
          cannot contend now after having been one in heart before the throne of
          God." I have heard of a man who had made complaints against his
          minister, and his minister wisely said to him, "Well, don't talk to me
          in the street; come to my house, and let us hear it all." He went, and
          the minister said, "My brother, I hope that what you have to say to me
          may be greatly blessed to me; no doubt I have my imperfections as well
          as any other man, and I hope I shall never be above being told of
          them, but in order that what you have to say to me may be blessed to
          me let us kneel down and pray together." So our quarrelsome friend
          prayed first and the minister prayed next, both briefly. When they
          rose from their knees, he said, "Now, my brother, I think we are both
          in a good state of mind; tell me what it is that you have to find
          fault with." The man blushed, and stammered, and stuttered, and said,
          he did not think there was anything at all, except in himself. "I have
          forgotten to pray for you, sir," said he, "and of course I cannot
          expect that God will feed my soul through you when I neglect to
          mention you at the throne of grace." Ah, well, brethren, if you will
          exercise yourselves much in supplication for your brethren you will
          forgive their tempers, you will overlook their rashness, you will not
          think of their harsh words; but knowing that you also may be tempted,
          and are men of like passions with them, you will cover their faults,
          and bear with their infirmities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I need to say more in commendation of intercessory prayer except
          it be this, that it seems to me that when God gives any man much
          grace, it must be with the design that he may use it for the rest of
          the family. I would compare you who have near communion with God to
          courtiers in the king's palace. What do courtiers do? Do they not
          avail themselves of their influence at court to take the petitions of
          their friends, and present them where they can be heard? This is what
          we call patronage -- a thing with which many find fault when it is
          used for political ends, but there is a kind of heavenly patronage
          which you ought to use right diligently. I ask you to use it on my
          behalf. When it is well with you, then think of me. I pray you use it
          on the behalf of the poor, the sick, the afflicted, the tempted, the
          tried, the desponding, the despairing; when thou hast the King's ear,
          speak to him for us. When thou art permitted to come very near to his
          throne, and he saith to thee, "Ask, and I will give thee what thou
          wilt"; when thy faith is strong, thine eye clear, thine access near,
          thine interest sure, and the love of God sweetly shed abroad in thy
          heart -- then take the petitions of thy poor brethren who stand
          outside at the gate and say, "My Lord, I have a poor brother, a poor
          child of thine, who has desired me to ask of thee this favour. Grant
          it unto me; it shall be a favour shown unto myself; grant it unto him,
          for he is one of thine. Do it for Jesus' sake!" Nay, to come to an end
          in this matter of commendation, it is utterly impossible that you
          should have a large measure of grace, unless it prompts you to use
          your influence for others. Soul, if thou hast grace at all, and art
          not a mighty intercessor, that grace must be but as a grain of
          mustard-seed -- a shrivelled, uncomely, puny thing. Thou hast just
          enough grace to float thy soul clear from the quicksand, but thou hast
          no deep floods of grace, or else thou wouldst carry in thy joyous bark
          a rich cargo of the wants of others up to the throne of God, and thou
          wouldst bring back for them rich blessings which but for thee they
          might not have obtained. If thou be like an angel with thy foot upon
          the golden ladder which reaches to heaven, if thou art ascending and
          descending, know that thou wilt ascend with others' prayers and
          descend with others' blessings, for it is impossible for a full-grown
          saint to live or to pray for himself alone. Thus much on commendation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We turn to our second point, and endeavour to say something BY WAY
          OF ENCOURAGEMENT, that you may cheerfully offer intercessory
          supplications.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, remember that intercessory prayer is the sweetest prayer God
          ever hears. Do not question it, for the prayer of Christ is of this
          character. In all the incense which now our Great High Priest puts
          into the censer, there is not a single grain that is for himself. His
          work is done; his reward obtained. Now you do not doubt but that
          Christ's prayer is the most acceptable of all supplications. Very
          well, my brethren, the more like your prayer is to Christ's, the more
          sweet it will be; and while petitions for yourself will be accepted,
          yet your pleadings for others, having in them more of the fruits of
          the Spirit, more love, perhaps more faith, certainly more brotherly
          kindness, they will be as the sweetest oblation that you can offer to
          God, the very fat of thy sacrifice. Remember, again, that intercessory
          prayer is exceedingly prevalent. What wonders it has wrought!
          Intercessory prayer has stayed plagues. It removed the darkness which
          rested over Egypt; it drove away the frogs which leaped upon the land;
          it scattered the lice and locusts which plagued the inhabitants of
          Zoar; it removed the murrain, and the thunder, and the lightning; it
          stayed all the ravages which God's avenging hand did upon Pharaoh and
          his people. Intercessory prayer has healed diseases; -- we know it did
          in the early church. We have evidence of it in old Mosaic times. When
          Miriam was smitten with leprosy, Moses prayed, and the leprosy was
          removed. It has restored withered limbs. When the king's arm was
          withered, he said to the prophet, "Pray for me," and his arm was
          restored as it was before. Intercessory prayer has raised the dead,
          for Elias stretched himself upon the child seven times, and the child
          sneezed, and the child's soul returned. As to how many souls
          intercessory prayer has instrumentally saved, recording angel, thou
          canst tell! Eternity, thou shalt reveal! There is nothing which
          intercessory prayer cannot do. Oh! believer, you have a mighty engine
          in your hand, use it well, use it constantly, use it now with faith,
          and thou shalt surely prevail. But perhaps you have a doubt about
          interceding for some one who has fallen far into sin. Brethren, did ye
          ever hear of men who have been thought to be dead while yet alive?
          Have ye never heard by the farmer's fire some old-fashioned story of
          one who was washed and laid out, and wrapped up in his shroud to be
          put into his coffin, and yet he was but in a trance and not dead? And
          have ye not heard old legends of men and women who have been buried
          alive? I cannot vouch for the accuracy of those tales, but I can tell
          you that spiritually there has been many a man given up for dead that
          was still within reach of grace. There has been many a soul that has
          been put into the winding sheet even by Christian people, given up to
          damnation even by the ministers of Christ, consigned to perdition even
          by their own kinsfolk. But yet into perdition they did not come, but
          God found them, and took them out of the horrible pit and out of the
          miry clay, and set their living feet upon his living rock. Oh! give up
          nobody; still pray, lay none out for spiritually dead until they are
          lain out for dead naturally. But perhaps you say, "I cannot pray for
          others, for I am so weak, so powerless." You will get strength, my
          brethren, by the exertion. But besides, the prevalence of prayer does
          not depend upon the strength of the man who prays, but upon the power
          of the argument he uses. Now, brethren, if you sow seed you may be
          very feeble, but it is not your hand that puts the seed into the
          ground which produces the harvest, -- it is the vitality in the seed.
          And so in the prayer of faith. When you can plead a promise and drop
          that prayer into the ground with hope, your weakness shall not make it
          miscarry; it shall still prevail with God and bring down blessings
          from on high. Job! thou comest from thy dunghill to intercede, and so
          may I come from my couch of weakness; -- thou comest from thy poverty
          and thy desertion to intercede for others, and so may we. Elias was a
          man of like passions -- sweet word! -- of like passions, like
          infirmities, like tendencies to sin, but he prevailed, and so shalt
          thou; only do thou see to it that thou be not negligent in these
          exercises, but that thou pray much for others even as Job prayed for
          his friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the air is very hot, and the atmosphere heavy and becalmed,
          our friends find it difficult to listen, more difficult even than the
          speaker finds it to preach. Now, that I may have your attention yet
          once again -- and a change of posture may do you all good -- will you
          stand up and put the text into use by offering an intercessory prayer
          and then I will go on again. It shall be this one:
        </p>
        <p>"Pity the nations, O our God,</p>
        <p>Constrain the earth to come;</p>
        <p>Send thy victorious word abroad,</p>
        <p>And bring the strangers home!"</p>
        <p>(The congregation here rose, and sung the verse.)</p>
        <p>
          III. The third head is A SUGGESTION AS TO THE PERSONS FOR WHOM WE
          SHOULD MORE PARTICULARLY PRAY. It shall be but a suggestion, and I
          will then turn to my last point. In the case of Job, he prayed for his
          offending friends. They had spoken exceedingly harshly of him. They
          had misconstrued all his previous life, and though there had never
          been a part of his character which deserved censure -- for the Lord
          witnessed concerning him, that he was a perfect and an upright man --
          yet they accused him of hypocrisy, and supposed that all he did was
          for the sake of gain. Now, perhaps, there is no greater offence which
          can be given to an upright and a holy man, than to his face, to
          suspect his motives, and to accuse him of self-seeking. And yet,
          shaking off everything, as the sun forgets the darkness that has
          hidden its glory, and scatters it by its own beams, Job comes to the
          mercy seat, and pleads. He is accepted himself, and he begs that his
          friends may be accepted too. Carry your offending ones to the throne
          of God; it shall be a blessed method of proving the trueness of your
          forgiveness. Do not do that, however, in a threatening way. I remember
          having to deal faithfully with a hypocrite, who told me, by way of
          threatening, he should pray for me. It was a horrid threat, for who
          would wish to have his name associated with a prayer which would be an
          abomination to the Lord. Do not do it in that sense, as though like a
          supercilious hypocrite, you would make your prayer itself a stalking
          horse for your vain glory; but do it when you are alone before God,
          and in secret; not that you may gratify your revenge by telling the
          story out again, for that were abominable indeed; but that you may
          remove from your erring brother any sin which may have stained his
          garments, by asking the Lord to forgive him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: be sure you take there your controverting friends. These
          brethren had been arguing with Job, and the controversy dragged its
          weary length along. Brethren, it is better to pray than it is to
          controvert. Sometimes you think it would be a good thing to have a
          public discussion upon a doctrine. It would be a better thing to have
          prayer over it. You say, "Let two good men, on different sides, meet
          and fight the matter out." I say, "No! let the two good men meet and
          pray the matter out." He that will not submit his doctrine to the test
          of the mercy seat, I should suspect is wrong. I can say that I am not
          afraid to offer prayer that my brethren who do not see "Believers'
          baptism" may be made to see it. If they think it is wrong, I wish that
          they would pray to God to set us right; but I have never heard them do
          that; I have never heard them pray to the Lord to convince us of the
          truth of infant sprinkling -- I wish they would, if they believe it to
          be scriptural, and I am perfectly willing to put it to the old test,
          the God that answereth by fire, let him be God, and whichever shall
          prevail, when prayer shall be the ultimate arbiter, let that stand.
          Carry your dear friends who are wrong in practice, not to the
          discussion-room, or to the debating-club, but carry them before God,
          and let this be your cry, "Oh! Thou that teachest us to our profit,
          teach me if I be wrong, and teach my friend wherein he errs, and make
          him right."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the thing we ought also to do with haughty friends. Eliphaz
          and Bildad were very high and haughty -- Oh! how they looked down upon
          poor Job! They thought he was a very great sinner, a very desperate
          hypocrite; they stayed with him, but doubtless they thought it very
          great condescension. Now, you sometimes hear complaints made by
          Christians about other people being proud. It will not make them
          humble for you to grumble about that. What if there be a Mrs.
          So-and-so who wears a very rustling dress, and never takes any notice
          of you because you cannot rustle too! What if there be a brother who
          can afford to wear creaking boots, and will not notice you in the
          street because you happen to be poor! Tell your Father about it; that
          is the best way. Why, you would not be angry, I suppose, with a man
          for having the gout, or a torpid liver, or a cataract in the eye; you
          would pity him. Why be angry with your brother because of his being
          proud? It is a disease, a very bad disease, that scarlet fever of
          pride; go and pray the Lord to cure him; your anger will not do it; it
          may puff him up and make him worse than ever he was before, but it
          will not set him right. Pray him down, brother, pray him down; have
          duel with him, and have the choice of weapons yourself, and let that
          be the weapon of all -- prayer; and if he be proud, I know this, if
          you prevail with God, God will soon take the pride out of his own
          child and make him humble as he should be. But particularly let me ask
          you to pray most for those who are disabled from praying for
          themselves. Job's three friends could not pray for themselves, because
          the Lord said he would not accept them if they did. He said he was
          angry with them, but as for Job, said he, "Him will I accept." Do not
          let me shock your feelings when I say there are some, even of God's
          people, who are not able to pray acceptably at certain seasons. When a
          man has just been committing sin, repentance is his first work, not
          prayer; he must first set matters right between God and his own soul
          before he may go and intercede for others. And there are many poor
          Christians that cannot pray; doubt has come in, sin has taken away
          their confidence, and they are standing outside the gate with their
          petitions; they dare not enter within the veil. There are many tried
          believers, too, that are so desponding that they cannot pray with
          faith, and therefore they cannot prevail. Now, my dear brethren, if
          you can pray, take their sins into court with you, and when you have
          had your own hearing, then say, "But, my Lord, inasmuch as thou hast
          honoured me, and made me to eat of thy bread, and drink from thy cup,
          hear me for thy poor people who are just now denied the light of thy
          countenance." Besides, there are millions of poor sinners who are dead
          in sin and they cannot pray, pray for them; it is a blessed thing --
          that vicarious repentance and vicarious faith; which a saint may exert
          towards a sinner. "Lord, that sinner does not feel; help me to feel
          for him because he will not feel; Lord, that sinner will not believe
          in Christ, he does not think that Christ can save him, but I know he
          can, and I will pray believingly for that sinner, and I will repent
          for him, and though my repentance and my faith will not avail him
          without his personal repentance and faith, yet it may come to pass
          that through me he may be brought to repentance and led to prayer."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, lest I should weary you, let me come to the closing part of
          my discourse. And, O God, lend us thy strength now, that this duty may
          come forcibly home to our conscience, and we may at once engage in
          this exercise! Brethren, I have to EXHORT YOU TO PRAY FOR OTHERS.
          Before I do it, I will ask you a personal question. Do you always pray
          for others? Guilty or not guilty, here? Do you think you have taken
          the case of your children, your church, your neighbourhood, and the
          ungodly world before God as you ought to have done? If you have, I
          have not. For I stand here a chief culprit before the Master to make
          confession of the sin; and while I shall exhort you to practice what
          is undoubtedly a noble privilege, I shall be most of all exhorting
          myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I begin thus, by saying, Brethren, how can you and I repay the debt we
          owe to the Church unless we pray for others? How was it that you were
          converted? It was because somebody else prayed for you. I, in tracing
          back my own conversion, cannot fail to impute it, through God's
          Spirit, to the prayers of my mother. I believe that the Lord heard her
          earnest cries when I knew not that her soul was exercised about me.
          There are many of you that were prayed for when you were asleep in
          your cradles as unconscious infants. Your mothers' liquid prayers fell
          hot upon your infant brows, and gave you what was a true christening
          while you were still but little ones. There are husbands here who owe
          their conversion to their wives' prayers; brothers who must
          acknowledge that it was a sister's pleading; children who must confess
          that their sabbath-school teachers were wont to pray for them. Now, if
          by others' prayers you and I were brought to Christ, how can we repay
          this Christian kindness, but by pleading for others? He who has not a
          man to pray for him may write himself down a hopeless character.
          During one of the revivals in America, a young man was going to see
          the minister, but he did not, because the minister had avoided him
          with considerable coldness. A remark was made to the minister upon
          what he had done, and he said, "Well, I did not want to see him; I
          knew he had only come to mock and scoff; what should I see him for;
          you do not know him as well as I do, or else you would have done the
          same." A day or two after there was a public meeting, where the
          preaching of the Word was to be carried on in the hope that the
          revival might be continued. A young man who had been lately converted
          through the prayers of another young man was riding to the worship on
          his horse, and as he was riding along he was overtaken by our young
          friend whom the minister thought so godless. He said to him, "Where
          are you going today, William?" "Well, I am going to the meeting, and I
          hear that you have been converted." "I thank God I have been brought
          to a knowledge of the truth," he answered. "Oh!" said the other, "I
          shall never be; I wish I might." His friend was surprised to hear him
          whom the minister thought to be so hard say that, and he said, "But
          why cannot you be converted?" "Why?" said the other, "you know you
          were converted through the prayers of Mr. K -- ." "Yes, so I was."
          "Ah," said the other, "there is nobody to pray for me; they have all
          given me up long ago." "Why," said his friend, "it is very singular,
          but Mr. K -- , who prayed for me, has been praying for you too; we
          were together last night, and I heard him." The other threw himself
          back in his saddle, and seemed as if he would fall from his horse with
          surprise. "Is that true?" said he. "Yes, it is." "Then blessed be God,
          there is hope for me now, and if he has prayed for me, that gives me a
          reason why I should now pray believingly for myself." And he did so,
          and that meeting witnessed him confessing his faith in Christ. Now,
          let no man of your acquaintance say that there is nobody to pray for
          him; but as you had somebody to plead for you, let poor souls of your
          acquaintance find in you a person to plead for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, permit me to say, how are you to prove your love to
          Christ or to his church if you refuse to pray for men? "We know that
          we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren." If
          we do not love the brethren, we are still dead. I will aver no man
          loves the brethren who does not pray for them. What! It is the very
          least thing you can do, and if you do not perform the least, you
          certainly will fail in the greater. You do not love the brethren
          unless you pray for them, and then it follows you are dead in
          trespasses and sins. Let me ask you again how is it that you hope to
          get your own prayers answered if you never plead for others? Will not
          the Lord say, "Selfish wretch, thou art always knocking at my door,
          but it is always to cry for thine own welfare and never for another's;
          inasmuch as thou hast never asked for a blessing for one of the least
          of these my brethren, neither will I give a blessing to thee. Thou
          lovest not the saints, thou lovest not thy fellow men, how canst thou
          love me whom thou hast not seen, and how shall I love thee and give
          thee the blessing which thou askest at my hands?" Brethren, again I
          say I would earnestly exhort you to intercede for others, for how can
          you be Christians if you do not? Christians are priests, but how
          priests if they offer no sacrifice? Christians are lights, but how
          lights unless they shine for others? Christians are sent into the
          world, even as Christ was sent into the world, but how sent unless
          they are sent to pray? Christians are meant not only to be blessed
          themselves, but in them shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,
          but how if you refuse to pray? Give up your profession, cast down, I
          pray you, the ephod of a priest if you will not burn the incense,
          renounce your Christianity if you will not carry it out, make not a
          mock and sport of solemn things. And you must do so if you still
          refuse selfishly to give to your friends a part and a lot in your
          supplications before the throne. O brethren, let us unite with one
          heart and with one soul to plead with God for this neighbourhood! Let
          us carry "London" written on our breasts just as the high priest of
          old carried the names of the tribes. Mothers, bear your children
          before God! Fathers, carry your sons and your daughters! Men and
          brethren, let us take a wicked world and the dark places thereof which
          are full of the habitations of cruelty! Let us cry aloud and keep no
          silence, and give to the Lord no rest till he establish and make his
          Church a praise in the earth. Wake, ye watchmen upon Zion's walls, and
          renew your shouts! Wake, ye favourites of heaven, and renew your
          prayers! The cloud hangs above you, it is yours to draw down its
          sacred floods in genial showers by earnest prayers. God hath put high
          up in the mountains of his promise springs of love, it is yours to
          bring them down by the divine channel of your intense supplications.
          Do it, I pray you, lest inasmuch as you have shut your bowels of
          compassion and have refused to plead with God for the conversion of
          others, he should say in his wrath, "These are not my children. They
          have not my spirit. They are not partakers of my love, neither shall
          they enter into my rest." Why, there are some of you that have not
          prayed for others for months, I am afraid, except it be at a prayer
          meeting. You know what your night prayers are. It is, "Lord, take care
          of my family." You know how some farmers pray. "Lord, send fair
          weather in this part of the country. Lord, preserve the precious
          fruits of the field all round this neighbourhood. Never mind about
          their being spoilt anywhere else, for that will send the markets up."
          And so there are some who make themselves special objects of
          supplication; and what care they for the perishing crowd. This is the
          drift of some men's wishes, "Lord, bless the Church, but don't send
          another minister into our neighbourhood lest he should take our
          congregations from us. Lord, send labourers into the vineyard, but do
          not send them into our corner lest they should take any of our glory
          from us." That is the kind of supplication. Let us have done with
          such. Let us be Christians; let us have expanded souls and minds that
          can feel for others. Let us weep with them that weep, and rejoice with
          them that rejoice; and as a Church and as private persons, we shall
          find the Lord will turn our captivity when we pray for our friends.
          God help us to plead for others! And as for you that have never prayed
          for yourselves, God help you to believe in the Lord Jesus! Amen.<br />
