        <p>IMMORTALITY AND THE COVENANT WITH DEATH</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Court not death in the error of your life;<br />Neither draw upon
          yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because God made not death: neither delighteth he when the living
          perish. For he created all things that they might have being; and the
          generative powers of the world are healthsome, and there is no poison
          of destruction in them, nor hath Hades royal dominion upon earth: for
          righteousness is immortal. But ungodly men by their hands and their
          words called death unto them; deeming him a friend they consumed away,
          and they made a covenant with him because they are worthy to be of his
          portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          For they said within themselves, reasoning not aright: "Short and
          sorrowful is our life; and there is no healing when a man cometh to
          his end, and none was ever known that gave release from Hades. Because
          by mere chance were we born, and hereafter we shall be as though we
          had never been; because the breath in our nostrils is smoke, and while
          our heart beateth reason is a spark, which being extinguished, the
          body shall be turned into ashes, and the spirit shall be dispersed as
          thin air. And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall
          remember our works; and our life shall pass away as the traces of a
          cloud, and shall be scattered as is a mist, when it is chased by the
          beams of the sun, and overcome by the heat thereof. For our allotted
          time is the passing of a shadow, and our end retreateth not; because
          it is fast sealed, and none turneth it back. Come therefore and let us
          enjoy the good things that now are; and let us use the creation with
          all our soul as youth's possession. Let us fill ourselves with costly
          wine and perfumes, and let no flower of spring pass us by; let us
          crown ourselves with rosebuds before they be withered; let none of us
          go without his share in our proud revelry; everywhere let us leave
          tokens of our mirth: because this is our portion, and our lot is this.
          Let us oppress the righteous poor: let us not spare the widow, nor
          reverence the hairs of the old man gray for length of years, but let
          our strength be to us a law of righteousness; for that which is weak
          is found to be of no service. But let us lie in wait for the righteous
          man, because he is of disservice to us, and is contrary to our works,
          and upbraideth us with sins against the law, and layeth to our charge
          sins against our discipline. He professeth to have knowledge of God,
          and nameth himself servant of the Lord. He became to us a reproof of
          our thoughts. He is grievous unto us even to behold, because his life
          is unlike other men's, and his paths are of strange fashion. We were
          accounted of him as base metal, and he abstaineth from our ways as
          from uncleannesses. The latter end of the righteous he calleth happy;
          and he vaunteth that God is his father. Let us see if his words be
          true, and let us try what shall befall in the ending of his life: for
          if the righteous man is God's son, he will uphold him, and he will
          deliver him out of the hand of his adversaries. With outrage and
          torture let us put him to the test, that we may learn his gentleness,
          and may prove his patience under wrong. Let us condemn him to a
          shameful death; for he shall be visited according to his words."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus reasoned they, and they were led astray. For their wickedness
          blinded them; and they knew not the mysteries of God, neither hoped
          they for wages of holiness, nor did they judge that there is a prize
          for blameless souls. Because God created man for incorruption, and
          made him an image of his own proper being; but by the envy of the
          devil death entered into the world, and they that are of his portion
          make trial thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment
          shall touch them. In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died;
          and their departure was accounted to be their hurt, and their
          journeying away from us to be their ruin: but they are in peace. For
          even if in the sight of men they be punished, their hope is full of
          immortality; and having borne a little chastening, they shall receive
          great good. Because God made trial of them, and found them worthy of
          himself; as gold in the furnace he proved them, and as a whole burnt
          offering he accepted them. And in the time of their visitation they
          shall shine forth, and as sparks among stubble they shall run to and
          fro. They shall judge nations, and have dominion over peoples; and the
          Lord shall reign over them for evermore. They that trust on him shall
          understand truth, and the faithful shall abide with him in love:
          because grace and mercy are to his chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the ungodly shall be requited even as they reasoned, they which
          lightly regarded the righteous man, and revolted from the Lord: for he
          that setteth at nought wisdom and discipline is miserable. And void is
          their hope and their toils unprofitable, and useless are their works.
          Their wives are foolish, and wicked are their children; accursed is
          their begetting. For good labours have fruit of great renown; and the
          root of understanding cannot fail. But children of adulterers shall
          not come to maturity, and the seed of an unlawful bed shall vanish
          away. For if they live long they shall be held in no account, and at
          the last their old age shall be without honour; and if they die
          quickly they shall have no hope, nor in the day of decision shall they
          have consolation. For the end of an unrighteous generation is alway
          grievous. Better than this is childlessness with virtue. For in the
          memory of virtue is immortality, because it is recognised both before
          God and before men; when it is present men imitate it, and they long
          after it when it is departed; and throughout all time it marcheth
          crowned in triumph, victorious in the strife for the prizes that are
          undefiled. But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall be of no
          profit, and with bastard slips they shall not strike deep root, nor
          shall they establish a sure hold. For even if these put forth boughs
          and flourish for a season, yet, standing unsure, they shall be shaken
          by the wind, and by the violence of winds they shall be rooted out.
          Their branches shall be broken off before they come to maturity; and
          their fruit shall be useless, never ripe to eat, and fit for nothing.
          For children unlawfully begotten are witnesses of wickedness against
          parents when God searcheth them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Footnote 3: Because happy is the barren that is indefiled, she who
          hath not conceived in transgression; she shall have fruit when God
          visiteth souls. And happy is the eunuch which hath wrought no lawless
          deed with his hands, nor imagined wicked things against the Lord; for
          there shall be given him for his faithfulness a peculiar favour, and a
          lot in the sanctuary of the Lord more delightsome than wife or
          children.]
        </p>
        <p>
          But a righteous man, though he die before his time, shall be at rest.
          For honourable old age is not that which standeth in length of time,
          nor is its measure given by number of years: but understanding is gray
          hairs unto men, and an unspotted life is ripe old age. Being found
          well pleasing unto God he was beloved of him, and while living among
          sinners he was translated. He was caught away lest wickedness should
          change his understanding, or guile deceive his soul; for the
          bewitching of naughtiness bedimmeth the things which are good, and the
          giddy whirl of desire perverteth an innocent mind. Being made perfect
          in a little while he fulfilled long years: for his soul was pleasing
          unto the Lord; therefore hasted he out of the midst of wickedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as for the peoples, seeing and understanding not, neither laying
          this to heart, that grace and mercy are with his chosen, and that he
          visiteth his holy ones: they shall see, and they shall despise; but
          them the Lord shall laugh to scorn. And after this they shall become a
          dishonoured carcase, and a reproach among the dead for ever. Because
          he shall dash them speechless to the ground, and shall shake them from
          the foundations, and they shall lie utterly waste, and they shall be
          in anguish, and their memory shall perish. They shall come, when their
          sins are reckoned up, with coward fear; and their lawless deeds shall
          convict them to their face. Then shall the righteous man stand in
          great boldness before the face of them that afflicted him, and them
          that make his labours of no account. When they see it, they shall be
          troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the marvel of
          God's salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Footnote 4: But a righteous man that is dead shall condemn the
          ungodly that are living, and youth that is quickly perfected the many
          years of an unrighteous man's old age; for the ungodly shall see a
          wise man's end, and shall not understand what the Lord purposed
          concerning him, and for what he safely kept him.]
        </p>
        <p>
          They shall say within themselves, repenting, and for distress of
          spirit shall they groan: "This was he whom aforetime we had in
          derision, and made a parable of reproach; we fools accounted his life
          madness and his end without honour. How was he numbered among sons of
          God? and how is his lot among saints? Verily we went astray from the
          way of truth; and the light of righteousness shined not for us, and
          the sun rose not for us. We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness
          and destruction, and we journeyed through trackless deserts; but the
          way of the Lord we knew not. What did our arrogancy profit us? and
          what good have riches and vaunting brought us? Those things all passed
          away as a shadow, and as a message that runneth by; as a ship passing
          through the billowy water, whereof, when it is gone by, there is no
          trace to be found, neither pathway of its keel in the billows; or as
          when a bird flieth through the air, no token of her passage is found,
          but the lightwind, lashed with the stroke of her pinions, and rent
          asunder with the violent rush of the moving wings, is passed through,
          and afterwards no sign of her coming is found therein; or as when an
          arrow is shot at a mark, the air disparted closeth up again
          immediately, so that men know not where it passed through: so we also,
          as soon as we were born, ceased to be; and of virtue we had no sign to
          shew, but in our wickedness we were utterly consumed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the hope of the ungodly man is as chaff carried by the wind,
          and as foam vanishing before a tempest; and is scattered as smoke is
          scattered by the wind; and passeth by as the remembrance of a guest
          that tarrieth but a day. But the righteous live for ever, and in the
          Lord is their reward, and the care for them with the Most High.
          Therefore shall they receive the crown of royal dignity and the diadem
          of beauty from the Lord's hand; because with his right hand shall he
          cover them, and with his arm shall he shield them. He shall take his
          jealousy as complete armour, and shall make the whole creation his
          weapons for vengeance on his enemies; he shall put on righteousness as
          a breastplate, and shall array himself with judgement unfeigned as
          with a helmet: he shall take holiness as an invincible shield, and he
          shall sharpen stern wrath for a sword. And the world shall go forth
          with him to fight against his insensate foes. Shafts of lightning
          shall fly with true aim, and from the clouds, as from a well-drawn
          bow, shall they leap to the mark; and as from an engine of war shall
          be hurled hailstones full of wrath; the water of the sea shall be
          angered against them, and rivers shall sternly overwhelm them; a
          mighty blast shall encounter them, and as a tempest shall it winnow
          them away. And so shall lawlessness make all the land desolate, and
          their evil-doing shall overturn the thrones of princes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear therefore, ye kings, and understand; learn, ye judges of the ends
          of the earth; give ear, ye that have dominion over much people, and
          make your boast in multitudes of nations. Because your dominion was
          given you from the Lord, and your sovereignty from the Most High, who
          shall search out your works, and shall make inquisition of your
          counsels; because being officers of his kingdom ye did not judge
          aright, neither kept ye law, nor walked after the counsel of God.
          Awfully and swiftly shall he come upon you, because a stern judgement
          befalleth them that be in high place: for the man of low estate may be
          pardoned in mercy, but mighty men shall be searched out mightily. For
          the Sovereign Lord of all will not refrain himself for any man's
          person, neither will he reverence greatness, because it is he that
          made both small and great. And alike he taketh thought for all; but
          strict is the scrutiny that cometh upon the powerful. Unto you,
          therefore, O princes, are my words, that ye may learn wisdom and fall
          not from the right way. For they that have kept holily the things that
          are holy shall themselves be hallowed; and they that have been taught
          them shall find what to answer. Set your desire therefore on my words;
          long for them, and ye shall be trained by their discipline.
