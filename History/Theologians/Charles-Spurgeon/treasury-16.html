          TITLE. <b>Michtam of David. </b>This is usually understood to mean THE
          GOLDEN PSALM, and such a title is most appropriate, for the matter is
          as the most fine gold. Ainsworth calls it "David's jewel, or notable
          song." Dr. Hawker, who is always alive to passages full of savor,
          devoutly cries, "Some have rendered it precious, others golden, and
          others, precious jewel; and as the Holy Spirit, by the apostles Peter
          and Paul, has shown us that
          <i>it is all about the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, what is here said of him
          is precious, is golden, is a jewel indeed!" We may summarize it as THE
          PSALM OF THE PRECIOUS SECRET.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT. We are not left to human interpreters for the key to this
          golden mystery, for, speaking by the Holy Spirit, Peter tells us,
          "David speaks concerning HIM." (Acts 2:25.) Further on in his
          memorable sermon he said, ""Brothers, I can tell you confidently that
          the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this
          day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath
          that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what
          was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not
          abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay." (Acts 2:29-31.)
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Nor is this our only guide, for the apostle Paul, led by the same
          infallible inspiration, quotes from this psalm, and testifies that
          David wrote of the man through whom is preached unto us the
          forgiveness of sins. (Acts 13:35-38.)
          <i
            >It has been the usual plan of commentators to apply the psalm both
            to David, to the saints, and to the Lord Jesus</i
          >, but we will venture to believe that in it "Christ is all;" since in
          the ninth and tenth verses, like the apostles on the mount, we can see
          "no man but Jesus only."

          It may suffice to note our Lord's prayer of faith, verse 1, <br />
          avowal of faith in Jehovah alone, 2, 3, 4, 5, <br />
          the contentment of his faith in the present, 6, 7, and <br />
          the joyous confidence of his faith for the future, 8, 11.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. "Preserve me,"</p></b> <i>keep</i>, or
        <i>save </i>
        me, or as Horsley thinks, "guard me," even as bodyguards surround their
        monarch, or as shepherds protect their flocks. Tempted in all points
        like as we are, the manhood of Jesus needed to be preserved from the
        power of evil; and though in itself pure, the Lord Jesus did not confide
        in that purity of nature, but as an example to his followers, looked to
        the Lord, his God, for preservation. One of the great names of God is
        "the Preserver of men," (Job 7:20,) and this gracious office the Father
        exercised towards our Mediator and Representative. It had been promised
        to the Lord Jesus in express words, that he should be preserved, Isaiah
        49:7, 8. "Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,
        to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, I will preserve
        you, and give you for a covenant of the people."
        <p align="justify">
          This promise was to the letter fulfilled, both by providential
          deliverance and sustaining power, in the case of our Lord. Being
          preserved himself, he is able to restore the preserved of Israel, for
          we are "preserved in Christ Jesus and called." As one with him, the
          elect were preserved in his preservation, and we may view this
          mediatorial supplication as the petition of the Great High Priest for
          all those who are in him. The intercession recorded in John 17 is but
          an amplification of this cry, "Holy Father, keep through your own name
          those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When he says, "preserve me," he means his members, his mystical body,
          himself, and all in him. But while we rejoice in the fact that the
          Lord Jesus used this prayer for his members, we must not forget that
          he employed it most surely for himself. He had so emptied himself, and
          so truly taken upon him the form of a servant, that as man he needed
          divine keeping even as we do, and often cried unto the strong for
          strength. Frequently on the mountain-top he breathed forth this
          desire, and on one occasion in almost the same words, he publicly
          prayed, "Father, save me from this hour." (John 12:27.) If Jesus
          looked to the Father for protection, how much more must we, his erring
          followers, do so!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"O God."</p></b> The word for God here used is EL
        (Hebrew), by which name the Lord Jesus, when under a sense of great
        weakness, as for instance when upon the cross, was accustomed to address
        the Mighty God, the Omnipotent Helper of his people. We, too, may turn
        to EL, the Omnipotent One, in all hours of peril, with the confidence
        that he who heard the strong crying and tears of our faithful High
        Priest, is both able and willing to bless us in him.
        <i
          >It is well to study the name and character of God, so that in our
          straits we may know how and by what title to address our Father who is
          in Heaven. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">"For in you do I put my trust,"</p></b>or, I
        have taken shelter in you. As chicks run beneath the hen, so do I betake
        myself to you. You are my great overshadowing Protector, and I have
        taken refuge beneath your strength. This is a potent argument in
        pleading, and our Lord knew not only how to use it with God, but how to
        yield to its power when wielded by others upon himself. "According to
        your faith, be it done unto you," is a great rule of Heaven in
        dispensing favor, and when we can sincerely declare that we exercise
        faith in the Mighty God with regard to the mercy which we seek, we may
        rest assured that our plea will prevail.
        <p align="justify">
          Faith, like the sword of Saul, never returns empty—it<i>
            overcomes Heaven when held in the hand of prayer</i

          conqueror, so shall we also through him. Let us when buffeted by
          storms right bravely cry to the Lord as he did, "in you do I put my
          trust."

            Verse 2. "O my soul, you have said unto the Lord, You are my Lord."
          </p></b
        >
        In his inmost heart the Lord Jesus bowed himself to do service to his
        Heavenly Father, and before the throne of Jehovah his soul vowed
        allegiance to the Lord for our sakes. We are like him when our soul,
        truly and constantly in the presence of the heart-searching God,
        declares her
        <i> full consent to the rule and government of the Infinite Jehovah</i>,
        saying,<b> "You are my Lord." </b>
        <p align="justify">
          To avow this with the <i>lip </i>is little, but for the <i>soul </i>to
          say it, especially in times of trial, is a gracious evidence of
          spiritual health. To profess it before men is a small matter, but to
          declare it before Jehovah himself is of far more consequence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This sentence may also be viewed as the utterance of appropriating
          faith, laying hold upon the Lord by personal covenant and enjoyment;
          in this sense may it be our daily song in the house of our pilgrimage.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"My goodness extends not to you."</p></b>The work
        of our Lord Jesus was not needful on account of any necessity in the
        Divine Being.

          >Jehovah would have been inconceivably glorious had the human race
          perished, and had no atonement been offered</i
        >. Although the life-work and death-agony of the Son did reflect
        unparalleled luster upon every attribute of God—yet the Most Blessed and
        Infinitely Happy God stood in no need of the obedience and death of his
        Son. It was for our sakes that the work of redemption was undertaken,
        and not because of any lack on the part of the Most High. How modestly
        does the Savior here estimate his own goodness! What overwhelming
        reasons have we for imitating his humility! "If you are righteous, what
        do you give unto him? or what receives he of your hand?" (Job 35:7.)

        These sanctified ones, although still upon the earth, partake of the
        results of Jesus' mediatorial work, and by his goodness are made what
        they are. The peculiar people, zealous for good works, and hallowed to
        sacred service, are arrayed in the Savior's righteousness and washed in
        his blood, and so receive of the goodness treasured up in him. These are
        the people who are profited by the work of the man Christ Jesus. But
        that work added nothing to the nature, virtue, or happiness of God, who
        is blessed for evermore. How much more forcibly is this true of us, poor
        unworthy servants not fit to be mentioned in comparison with the
        faithful Son of God! Our hope must ever be that haply some poor child of
        God may be served by us, for
        <i>the Great Father can never need our aid</i>.
        <i> <p align="justify">Poor believers are God's receivers</p></i>, and
        have a warrant from the Crown to receive the revenue of our offerings in
        the King's name. Departed saints we cannot bless; even prayer for them
        is of no service; but while they are here we should practically prove
        our love to them, even as our Master did, for they are the excellent of
        the earth. Despite their infirmities, their Lord thinks highly of them,
        and reckons them to be as nobles among men.

          no communion. He came to destroy—not to patronize or be allied with

        With what confidence and bounding joy does Jesus turn to Jehovah, whom
        his soul possessed and delighted in! Content beyond measure with his
        portion in the Lord his God, he had not a single desire with which to
        hunt after other gods; his cup was full, and his heart was full too.
        Even in his sorest sorrows he still laid hold with both his hands upon
        his Father, crying, "My God, my God!" He had not so much as a thought of
        falling down to worship the prince of this world, although tempted with
        an "all these will I give you."
        <p align="justify">
          We, too, can make our boast in the Lord; he is the food and the drink

        knew that his elect would be reserved for him, and that almighty power
        would preserve them as his lot and reward forever. Let us also be glad,

        may seem strange, but while no other man was ever so thoroughly
        acquainted with grief, it is our belief that no other man ever
        experienced so much joy and delight in service, for no other served so
        faithfully and with such great results in view as his recompense of
        reward. The joy which was set before him must have sent some of its
        beams of splendor a-down the rugged places where he endured the cross,
        despising the shame, and must have made them in some respects pleasant
        places to the generous heart of the Redeemer. At any rate, we know that
        Jesus was well content with the blood-bought portion which the lines of
        electing love marked off as his spoil with the strong and his portion
        with the great. Therein he solaced himself on earth, and delights
        himself in Heaven; and he asks no more "goodly heritage" than that his
        own beloved may be with him where he is and behold his glory.

          Mr. Greenham was bold enough to say, "They never felt God's love, or
          tasted forgiveness of sin, who are discontented." Some divines think
          that discontent was the first sin, the rock which wrecked our race in
          paradise; certainly there can be no paradise where this evil spirit
          has power, its slime will poison all the flowers of the garden.

        >Praise as well as prayer was presented to the Father by our Lord Jesus.
        We are not truly his followers unless our resolve be, "I will bless the
        Lord." Jesus is called Wonderful, Counselor, but as man he spoke not of
        himself, but as his Father had taught him. It was our Redeemer's custom
        to repair to his Father for direction, and having received it, he
        blessed him for giving him counsel.

          It would be well for us if we would follow his example of lowliness,
          cease from trusting in our own understanding, and seek to be guided by
          the Spirit of God.

        Understand here, the inner man, the affections and feelings. The
        communion of the soul with God brings to it an inner spiritual wisdom
        which in still seasons is revealed to itself. Our Redeemer spent many
        nights alone upon the mountain, and we may readily conceive that
        together with his fellowship with Heaven, he carried on a profitable
        commerce with himself; reviewing his experience, forecasting his work,
        and considering his position.
        <p align="justify">
          Great generals fight their battles in their own mind, long before the
          trumpet sounds. Just so, did our Lord win our battle on his knees
          before he gained it on the cross. It is a gracious habit after taking
          counsel from above, to take counsel within.

          in the garden of his soul. "Your ears shall hear a voice behind you,
          saying: This is the way, walk in it, when you turn to the right hand
          and when you turn to the left." The night season which the sinner
          chooses for his sins—is the hallowed hour of quiet when believers hear
          the soft still voices of Heaven, and of the heavenly life within
          themselves.

        >The fear of death at one time cast its dark shadow over the soul of the
        Redeemer, and we read that, "he was heard in that he feared." There
        appeared unto him an angel, strengthening him; perhaps the heavenly
        messenger reassured him of his glorious resurrection as his people's
        surety, and of the eternal joy into which he should admit the flock
        redeemed by blood. Then hope shone full upon our Lord's soul, and, as
        recorded in these verses, he surveyed the future with holy confidence
        because he had a continued eye to Jehovah, and enjoyed his perpetual
        presence. He felt that, thus sustained, he could never be driven from
        his life's grand design; nor was he, for he stayed not his hand until he
        could say, "It is finished."

          What an infinite mercy was this for us! In this immovableness, caused
          by simple faith in the divine help, Jesus is to be viewed as our
          exemplar. To recognize the presence of the Lord is the duty of every
          believer;<b> "I have set the Lord always before me;"</b> and to trust
          the Lord as our champion and guard is the privilege of every saint;<b>

          The apostle translates this passage, "I foresaw the Lord always before
          my face." Acts 2:25. The eye of Jesus' faith could discern beforehand
          the continuance of divine support, in such a degree that he should
          never be moved from the accomplishment of his purpose of redeeming his
          people. By the power of God at his right hand, he foresaw that he
          should smite through all who rose up against him, and on that power he
          placed the firmest reliance.

        >He clearly foresaw that he must die, for he speaks of his flesh
        resting, and of his soul in the abode of separate spirits; death was
        full before his face, or he would not have mentioned corruption; but
        such was his devout reliance upon his God, that he sang over the tomb,
        and rejoiced in vision of the sepulcher. He knew that the visit of his
        soul to Sheol, or the invisible world of disembodied spirits, would be a
        very short one, and that his body in a very brief space would leave the
        grave, uninjured by its sojourn there. All this made him say, "my heart
        is glad," and moved his tongue, the glory of his frame, to rejoice in
        God, the strength of his salvation.

          Oh, for such holy faith in the prospect of trial and of death! It is
          the work of faith, not merely to create a peace which surpasses all
          understanding, but to fill the heart full of gladness until the
          tongue, which, as the organ of an intelligent creature, is our
          glory—bursts forth in notes of harmonious praise. Faith gives us
          living joy, and bestows dying rest. "My flesh also shall rest in
          hope."

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 10.</p></b> Our Lord Jesus was not
        disappointed in his hope. He declared his Father's faithfulness in the
        words,<b> "you will not leave my soul in Hell," </b>and that
        faithfulness was proven on the resurrection morning. Among the departed
        and disembodied Jesus was not left; he had believed in the resurrection,
        and he received it on the third day, when his body rose in glorious
        life, according as he had said in joyous confidence, "<b

          Into the outer prison of the grave his body might go, but into the
          inner prison of corruption he could not enter. He who in soul and body
          was pre-eminently God's "Holy One," was loosed from the pains of
          death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.

          Trapp's note on the heavenly verse which closes the Psalm is a sweet

          our inheritance. He writes, "Here is as much said as can be, but words
          are too weak to utter it. For <i>quality</i>, there is in Heaven joy
          and pleasures. For <i>quantity</i>, a fullness, a torrent whereat they
          drink without hindrance or loathing. For <i>constancy</i>, it is at
          God's right hand, who is stronger than all, neither can any take us
          out of his hand; it is a constant happiness without intermission. For
          <i>perpetuity </i> it is for evermore. Heaven's joys are without
          measure, mixture, or end."
