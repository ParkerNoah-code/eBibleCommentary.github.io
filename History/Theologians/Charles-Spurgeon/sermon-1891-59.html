          1. If any one, however, say in reply to these things, What then? Is it
          a meaningless and accidental thing, that the positions of names, and
          the election of the apostles, and the working of the Lord, and the
          arrangement of created things, are what they are? -- we answer them:
          Certainly not; but with great wisdom and diligence, all things have
          clearly been made by God, fitted and prepared [for their special
          purposes]; and His word formed both things ancient and those belonging
          to the latest times; and men ought not to connect those things with
          the number thirty, but to harmonize them with what actually exists, or
          with right reason. Nor should they seek to prosecute inquiries
          respecting God by means of numbers, syllables, and letters. For this
          is an uncertain mode of proceeding, on account of their varied and
          diverse systems, and because every sort of hypothesis may at the
          present day be, in like manner, devised by any one; so that they can
          derive arguments against the truth from these very theories, inasmuch
          as they may be turned in many different directions. But, on the
          contrary, they ought to adapt the numbers themselves, and those things
          which have been formed, to the true theory lying before them. For
          system does not spring out of numbers, but numbers from a system; nor
          does God derive His being from things made, but things made from God.
          For all things originate from one and the same God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But since created things are various and numerous, they are indeed
          well fitted and adapted to the whole creation; yet, when viewed
          individually, are mutually opposite and inharmonious, just as the
          sound of the lyre, which consists of many and opposite notes, gives
          rise to one unbroken melody, through means of the interval which
          separates each one from the others. The lover of truth therefore ought
          not to be deceived by the interval between each note, nor should he
          imagine that one was due to one artist and author, and another to
          another, nor that one person fitted the treble, another the bass, and
          yet another the tenor strings; but he should hold that one and the
          same person [formed the whole], so as to prove the judgment, goodness,
          and skill exhibited in the whole work and [specimen of] wisdom. Those,
          too, who listen to the melody, ought to praise and extol the artist,
          to admire the tension of some notes, to attend to the softness of
          others, to catch the sound of others between both these extremes, and
          to consider the special character of others, so as to inquire at what
          each one aims, and what is the cause of their variety, never failing
          to apply our rule, neither giving up the [one ] artist, nor casting
          off faith in the one God who formed all things, nor blaspheming our
          Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, however, any one do not discover the cause of all those things
          which become objects of investigation, let him reflect that man is
          infinitely inferior to God; that he has received grace only in part,
          and is not yet equal or similar to his Maker; and, moreover, that he
          cannot have experience or form a conception of all things like God;
          but in the same proportion as he who was formed but to-day, and
          received the beginning of his creation, is inferior to Him who is
          uncreated, and who is always the same, in that proportion is he, as
          respects knowledge and the faculty of investigating the causes of all
          things, inferior to Him who made him. For thou, O man, art not an
          uncreated being, nor didst thou always co-exist with God, as did His
          own Word; but now, through His pre-eminent goodness, receiving the
          beginning of thy creation, thou dost gradually learn from the Word the
          dispensations of God who made thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Preserve therefore the proper order of thy knowledge, and do not,
          as being ignorant of things really good, seek to rise above God
          Himself, for He cannot be surpassed; nor do thou seek after any one
          above the Creator, for thou wilt not discover such. For thy Former
          cannot be contained within limits; nor, although thou shouldst measure
          all this [universe], and pass through all His creation, and consider
          it in all its depth, and height, and length, wouldst thou be able to
          conceive of any other above the Father Himself. For thou wilt not be
          able to think Him fully out, but, indulging in trains of reflection
          opposed to thy nature, thou wilt prove thyself foolish; and if thou
          persevere in such a course, thou wilt fall into utter madness, whilst
          thou deemest thyself loftier and greater than thy Creator, and
          imaginest that thou canst penetrate beyond His dominions.<br />
