        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.100</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 24, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him.
          And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and
          delivered him again to his father." -- Luke 9:42.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS child possessed with an evil spirit, is a most fitting emblem of
          every ungodly and unconverted man. Though we be not possessed with
          devils, yet by nature we are possessed with devilish vices and lusts,
          which if they do not distress and vex our bodies, will most certainly
          destroy our souls. Never creature possessed with evil spirit was in a
          worse plight than the man who is without God, without Christ, and
          without hope in the world. The casting out of the unclean spirit was
          moreover a thing that was impossible to man and only possible to God;
          and so is the conversion of an ungodly sinner a thing beyond the reach
          of human ability, and only to be accomplished by the might of the Most
          High. The dreadful bellowings, foamings, and tearings caused in this
          unhappy child by the unclean spirit, are a picture of the sins,
          iniquities, and vices into which ungodly men are continually and
          impetuously hurried; and a type of that sad and terrible suffering
          which remorse will by-and-bye bring to their conscience, and which the
          vengeance of God will soon cause to occupy their hearts. The bringing
          of this child to the Saviour by his parents teaches us a lesson, that
          those of us to whom the care of youth is entrusted, either as parents
          or teachers, should be anxious to bring our children to Jesus Christ,
          that he may graciously save them. The devout desire and compassion of
          the father for his child is but a pattern of what every parent ought
          to feel for his offspring. Like Abraham, he should pray, "O that
          Ishmael might live before thee;" and not only put up the prayer, but
          also strive in the use of the means to bring his child to the Pool of
          Siloam that haply the angel may stir the stream, and his son may step
          into the water and be made whole. The parent should place his
          offspring where the Saviour walks, that he may look upon him and heal
          him. The coming of the child to Christ is a picture of saving faith,
          for faith is coming to Christ, simply believing in the power of his
          atonement. And lastly, the casting down and tearing which is mentioned
          in my text is a picture of the comer's conflict with the enemy of
          souls. "As he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down and tare
          him." Our subject this morning will be the well known fact, that
          coming sinners, when they approach the Saviour, are often thrown down
          by Satan and torn, so that they suffer exceedingly in their minds, and
          are well nigh ready to give up in despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four points for our consideration this morning. That you may
          easily remember them I have made them alliterative: the devil's
          doings, designs, discovery, and defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE DEVIL'S DOINGS. When this child came to Christ to be
          healed, the devil threw him down and tare him. Now this is an
          illustration of what Satan does with most, if not all sinners, when
          they come to Jesus to seek light and life through him; he throws them
          down and tears them. Allow me to point out how it is that the devil
          causes those extraordinary pangs and agonies which attend conversion.
          He has a multitude of devices, for he is cunning and crafty, and he
          has divers ways of accomplishing that end.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First of all he does this by perverting the truth of God for the
          destruction of the soul's hope and comfort. The devil is very sound in
          divinity. I never suspected him of heterodoxy yet. I believe him to be
          one of the most orthodox individuals in creation. Other people may
          disbelieve the doctrines of revelation, but the devil cannot, for he
          knows the truth, and though he will belie it often, he is so crafty
          that he understand that with the soul convinced of sin his best method
          is not to contradict the truth, but to pervert it. Now I will mention
          the five great doctrines which we hold to be most prominent in
          Scripture, by the perversion of each of which the devil tries to keep
          the soul in bondage, darkness, and despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there is the great doctrine of election -- that God hath chosen
          to himself a number that no man can number, who shall be holy, since
          they are ordained to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Now
          the devil agitates the coming soul upon that doctrine. "Oh," saith he,
          "perhaps you are not elect. It is of no use your coming, and
          struggling, and striving; you may sit still and do nothing, and yet be
          saved, if you are to be saved; but if your name is written among the
          lost, all your praying, seeking, and believing cannot save you." Thus
          the devil begins preaching sovereignty in the sinner's ear, to make
          him believe that the Lord will assuredly cut him off. He asks, "How
          can you suppose that such a wretch as you can be elected? You deserve
          to be damned, and you know it. Your brother is a good moral man, but
          as for you, you are the chief of sinners; do you think God would
          choose you?" Then if the tempted one is instructed that election is
          not according to merit, but of God's free will, Satan opens another
          battery, and insinuates, "You would not feel like this if you were one
          of God's elect; you would not be allowed to come into all this
          suffering, and pray so long in vain." And again he whispers, You are
          not one of his;" and thus attempts to throw the soul down and tear it
          in pieces. I would just like to have a blow at his schemes this
          morning by reminding our friends that when they come to Christ they
          never need puzzle themselves about the doctrine of election. No one,
          in teaching a child the alphabet, makes him learn Z before he has
          learned A; so a sinner must not expect to learn election until he
          knows faith. The text with which he has to do is this: "He that
          believeth on the Lord Jesus shall be saved;" and when the Lord has
          enabled him to learn and believe that, he may go on to this: "Elect
          according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through
          sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the
          blood of Jesus." But if he cannot shake off the subject from his mind,
          he needs not do it, for he may remember that every penitent is elect,
          every believer is elect. However great the sinner, if he does but
          repent, that is a proof that he is elect; if he does but believe on
          Christ, he is as certainly elected as his faith is genuine. I cannot
          tell that I am elected before I know whether I believe in God. I
          cannot tell a thing unless I see its effects. I cannot tell whether
          there is a seed in the ground unless you enable me to stir up the
          soil, or to wait till I see the blade shooting from under the earth;
          so I cannot tell whether you name is written in the Lamb's book of
          life until I see God's love manifested in you in the stretching out of
          your hearts toward God. I cannot disembowel the deep rocks of
          obscurity to find out that hidden thing, unless evidences and effects
          furnish me with spade and mattock. There is a newspaper in Glasgow
          called the Christian News, alias, the Un-Christian News, or Christian
          Wasp, and the editor says of me, that I am not fit to preach God's
          word because I do not know (can you guess what it is?) who God's elect
          are. He writes words to this effect, -- "According to his own
          confession, the young man does not know who God's elect are until he
          has asked them questions, and knows their character." Well, if I did,
          I should be marvelously wise indeed. Who does know them apart from
          those signs, and marks, and evidences, in the heart and life which God
          always vouchsafes to his elect in due time? Shall I unlock the
          archives of heaven and read the rolls, or, with presumptuous hand
          unfold the Lamb's book of life, to know who are God's elect? No; I
          leave that for the editor of the Christian News to do, and when he
          publishes a full and correct list of the elect, no doubt it will be
          bought up tremendously, and the printer will speedily make a fortune
          by it. Let not the soul be distressed about election, for all who
          repent and believe do so, as the effect of their election.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next doctrine is that of our depravity -- that all men are fallen
          in Adam, that they are all gone aside from the truth, and that
          moreover by their practice they have become full of sin; that in them
          dwelleth no good thing, and that if any good thing shall ever come
          there, it shall be put there by God; for there is not even the seed of
          goodness in the heart, much less the flower of it. The devil torments
          the soul with that doctrine, and he says, "See what a depraved
          creature you are; you know how dreadfully you have sinned against God;
          you have gone astray ten thousand times. See," he says, "there are
          your old sins still crying after you;" and he waves his wand, and
          gives a resurrection to past iniquities, which rise up like ghosts and
          terrify the soul. "There, look at that midnight scene; remember the
          deed if ingratitude; hark! do you not hear that oath echoed back from
          the walls of the past. Look at your heart; can that ever be washed?
          Why, it is full of blackness. You know you tried to pray yesterday,
          and your mind roved to your business before you were half through your
          prayer; and since you have been seeking God you have only been half in
          earnest, knocking at the door sometimes, and then afterwards giving it
          up. It is impossible you should ever be forgiven; you have gone too
          far astray for the shepherd to find you; you are altogether become
          filthy; your heart is deceitful above all things and desperately
          wicked, and you cannot be saved." Many a poor soul has had a most
          terrible tearing with that doctrine. I have felt something of it
          myself, when I have verily thought that I must be rent in pieces by
          the dread remembrance of what I had been. The devil throws the sinner
          down and pulls him almost limb from limb, by persuading him that his
          guilt is heinous beyond parallel, and his iniquities are far beyond
          the reach of mercy, and his death-warrant is signed. Ah! poor soul,
          get up again; the devil has no right to throw you down. Your sin
          cannot be too great for God's mercy. It is not the greatness of sin
          that can cause any man to be damned, if there be not a want of faith.
          If a man has faith, notwithstanding all the sins he ever may have
          committed, he shall be saved; but if he have but one sin without
          faith, that one sin shall utterly destroy him. Faith in the blood of
          Christ destroys the sting of sin. One drop of the Saviour's precious
          blood could extinguish a thousand flaming words if God should will it,
          much more put out the burning fears of your poor heart. If thou
          believest in Christ, thou shalt say to the mountain of thy guilt, "Be
          thou removed far hence, and cast into the depths of the sea."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, there is the doctrine of effectual calling, that God calls his
          children effectually; that it is not the power of man which brings us
          to God, but that it is the work of God to bring man to grace; that he
          calls those whom he would save with an effectual and special call
          which he vouchsafes only to his children. "There now," says the evil
          one, "the minister said there must be an effectual call; depend upon
          it yours is not such a call; it never came from God; it is only a few
          heated feelings; you were excited a little under the sermon, and it
          will all be gone directly, like the morning cloud or the early dew.
          You have strong desires sometimes, but at other seasons they are not
          half so vehement; if the Lord drew you, you would be always drawn with
          the same power; it will be over soon, and you will be all the worse
          for having been inclined to go to God under these legal convictions,
          and then, afterwards, running away from him." Well, beloved, tell
          Satan that you don't know whether it is an effectual call, but you
          know this, that if you perish you will go to Christ and perish only
          there; tell him you know it is so effectual that you cannot help going
          to Christ; that whether it is to last or not you cannot say, that you
          will let him know by-and-bye; but that you are resolved (for this is
          your last defence), if you perish, to perish at the cross of Christ;
          and so by the help of God you may by such means overcome him when he
          throws you down on that doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devil will also pervert the doctrine of final perseverance.
          "Look," says Satan, "the children of God always hold on their way:
          they never leave off being holy; they persevere; their faith is like
          the path of the just, shining more and more unto the perfect day; and
          so would ours be if you were one of the Lord's. But you will never be
          able to persevere. Don't you remember -- six months ago, when you were
          lying on a sick bed you resolved to serve God, and it all broke down?
          You have vowed many times that you would be a Christian, and it has
          not lasted a fortnight. It will never do; you are too fickle; you will
          never keep fast hold on Christ; you will go with him a little while,
          but you will be sure to turn back; therefore, you cannot be one of the
          Lord's, for they never do turn back." So he tries to pull and tear the
          poor soul on that great and comforting doctrine. The same nail on
          which a sinner must hang his hope the devil tries to drive into the
          very temples of his faith, that he may die like Sisera in the tent of
          Jael. Oh, poor soul, tell Satan that thy perseverance is not thine,
          but that God is the author of it; that however weak thou art thou
          knowest thy weakness, but that if God begins a good work he will never
          leave it unfinished. And repelling him thus, thou mayest rise up from
          that throwing down and tearing which he has given to thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is the doctrine of redemption; with which the unclean
          spirit will assault the soul. "Oh," says Satan, "it is true Christ
          died, but not for you; you are a peculiar character." I remember the
          devil once made me believe that I was one alone, without a companion.
          I thought there was no one like myself. I saw that others had sinned
          as I had done, and had gone as far as I had, but I fancied what there
          was something peculiar about my sin. Thus the devil tried to set me
          apart as if I did not belong to the rest of mankind, I thought that if
          I had been anybody else I might have been saved. How often I wished I
          had been a poor swearing drunken man in the streets, and then I
          thought I might have a better chance; but as it was, I thought I was
          to die alone, like the deer in the shade of the forest. But well do I
          remember my friends singing that sweet hymn, --
        </p>
        <p>"His grace is sov'reign, rich and free,</p>
        <p>And why, my soul, why not for thee?"</p>
        <p>
          One of the hymns in Denham's selection, and it ought to have been in
          Rippon's, as well as I can remember, ends thus, --
        </p>
        <p>"He shed his blood so rich and free,</p>
        <p>And why, my soul, why not for thee?"</p>
        <p>
          That is just the question we never put to ourselves. We say, "Sure, my
          soul, why not for anybody else but thee." Up, poor soul! If Satan is
          trying to tear thee, tell him it is written, "He is able to save to
          save to the uttermost all who come unto God by him;" that "whosoever
          cometh he will in no wise cast out;" and it may be that thus God will
          deliver thee from that desperate conflict into which, as a coming
          sinner, thou hast been cast.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But Satan is not very scrupulous, and he sometimes throws the
          coming sinner down and tears him by telling horrible falsehoods. Some
          of you may not have known this, and I thank God if you do not
          understand some of the things of which I am about to speak. Many a
          time when the soul is coming to Christ, Satan violently injects
          infidel thoughts. I have never been thoroughly an unbeliever but once,
          and that was not before I knew the need of a Saviour, but after it. It
          was just when I wanted Christ and panted after him, that on a sudden
          the thought crossed my mind, which I abhorred but could not conquer,
          that there was no God, no Christ, no heaven, no hell; that all my
          prayers were but a farce, and that I might as well have whistled to
          the winds or spoken to the howling waves. Ah! I remember how my ship
          drifted along through that sea of fire, loosened from the anchor of my
          faith which I had received from my fathers. I doubted everything,
          until at last the devil defeated himself by making me doubt my own
          existence, and I thought I was an idea floating in the nothingness of
          acuity; then startled with that thought, and feeling that I was
          substantial flesh and blood after all, I saw that God was, and Christ
          was, and heaven was, and hell was, and that all these things were very
          truths. I should not be astonished if many here have been upon the
          very verge of infidelity, and have doubted almost everything. It is
          when Satan finds the heart tender that he tries to stamp his own
          impress of infidelity upon the soul; but, blessed be God, he never
          accomplishes it in the truly coming sinner. He labours also to inject
          blasphemous thoughts, and then tells us they are ours. Has he not
          sometimes poured in most vehement torrents of blasphemy and evil
          imaginations into our hearts, which we ignorantly thought must be our
          own? Yet not one of them perhaps belonged to us. I remember I had once
          been alone musing on God, when on a sudden it seemed as if the
          floodgates of hell had been loosened; my head became a very
          pandemonium; ten thousand evil spirits seemed to be holding carnival
          within my brain; and I held my mouth lest I should give utterance to
          the words of blasphemy that were poured into my ears. Things I had
          never heard or thought of before came rushing impetuously into my
          mind, and I could scarce withstand their influence. It was the devil
          throwing me down and tearing me. Ah! poor soul, thou wilt have that
          perhaps; but remember it is only one of the tricks of the arch-enemy.
          he drives his unclean beasts into your field and then calls them
          yours. Now, in old time, when tramps and vagrants troubled a parish,
          they whipped them and then sent them on to the next parish. So when
          you get these evil thoughts, give them a sound whipping and send them
          away; they do not belong to you if you do not indulge them. But if you
          fear that these thoughts are your own, you may say, "I will go to
          Christ, and even if these blasphemies are mine I will confess them to
          the great High Priest, for I know that all manner of sin and blasphemy
          shall be forgiven unto men."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Then if the devil cannot overcome you there, he tries another
          method; he takes all the threatening passages out of God's Word, and
          says they all apply to you. He reads you this passage, "There is a sin
          unto death; I do not say that ye should pray for it." "There," says
          the devil, "the apostle did not say he could even pray for the man who
          had committed certain sins." Then he reads, that "sin against the Holy
          Ghost shall never be forgiven." "There," he says, "is your character:
          you have committed sin against the Holy Ghost, and you will never be
          pardoned." Then he brings another passage: "Let him alone; Ephraim is
          joined unto idols." "There," says Satan, "you have had no liberty in
          prayer lately; God has let you alone; you are given unto idols; you
          are entirely destroyed;" and the cruel fiend is to be lost. But do not
          believe him my dear friends. No man has committed the sin against the
          Holy Ghost as long as he has grace to repent; it is certain that no
          man can have committed that sin if he flies to Christ and believes on
          him. No believing soul can commit it; no penitent sinner ever has
          committed it. If a man be careless and thoughtless -- if he can hear a
          terrible sermon and laughed it off, and put away his convictions -- if
          he never feels ay strivings of conscience, there is a fear that he may
          have committed that sin. But as long as you have any desires for
          Christ, you have no more committed that sin than you have flown up to
          the stars and swept cobwebs from the skies. As long as you have any
          sense of your guilt, any desire to be redeemed, you cannot have fallen
          into that sin; as a penitent you may still be saved, but if you had
          committed it, you could not be penitent.

          II. Let me dwell for a moment or two upon the second point -- the
          DEVIL'S DESIGN. Why does he throw the coming soul down and tear it?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because he does not like to lose it. "No king will willingly
          lose his subjects," said Apollyon to Christian when he stretched
          himself across the road, "and I swear thou shalt go no farther; here
          will I spill thy soul." There he stood vowing vengeance at him because
          he had escaped from his dominion. Do you suppose that Satan would lose
          his subjects one by one, and not be wroth? Assuredly not. As soon as
          he sees a soul hurrying off to the wicket gate, with his eyes fixed on
          the light, away go all hell's dogs after him. "There is another of my
          subjects going; my empire is being thinned; my family is being
          diminished:" and he tries with his might and main to bring the poor
          soul back again. Ah! soul, don't be deceived by him; his design is to
          throw you down; he does not tell thee these things to do thee good, or
          to humble thee, but in order to keep thee from coming to Christ, and
          decoy thee into his net, where he may utterly destroy thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, I believe, he has the vile design of inducing poor souls to
          make away with themselves before they have faith in Christ. This is an
          extreme case, but I have met with not a few who have been thus tempted
          to take away their lives, and rush before their Maker with their hands
          red with their own blood; for Satan knows full well that no murderer
          has eternal life abiding in him. But he never accomplished his design
          in the soul of one elect sinner yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Satan has another motive. When the soul is coming to Christ he
          tries, out of spite, to worry that soul. Satan's heart is made up of
          that which is just the opposite of benevolence -- malevolence; he
          hates everything, and loves nothing; he hates to see any creature
          happy, any soul glad; and when he sees a soul coming to Christ, he
          says, "Ah! I have nearly lost him; I shall never have an opportunity
          of bringing thundering condemnation into his ears, and dragging him
          about in the flames of hell as I thought; and now before he is gone I
          will do something; the last grip shall be a hard one; the last blow
          shall be dealt with all my power;" and down he comes upon the poor
          soul, who falls wallowing upon the earth in despair and doubt; then he
          tears him, and will not leave him until he has worked as much of his
          way with him as the Lord will let him. Don't be afraid, child of God.
          "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you;" and even though he may
          cast you to the ground, remember that the righteous falleth many
          times, but he riseth up again; and so shalt thou, and the designs of
          the enemy shall be frustrated, as it is written, "Thine enemies shall
          be found liars unto thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, there is the DEVIL'S DISCOVERY. I do not
          think the devil would be able to throw one poor sinner to the ground
          if he came as the devil; but it is seldom he does that. He presents
          himself as an angel of light, or even as the Holy Spirit. He knows
          that the Holy Spirit does all the work of salvation, and therefore he
          tries to counterfeit the operations of the Holy Ghost. He knows it is
          the Holy Spirit's work to take away pride from man, and to humble the
          soul. Well, Satan counterfeits that blessed work, and takes away hope
          from man as well as pride. Under the pretence of humbling the poor
          sinner, and telling him that he ought to lie lower in the dust, he not
          only humbles the poor soul, but puts it down so low that he dishonors
          God too in the sinner's estimation, by telling him that God himself
          cannot save him. Satan will try, if he can, to mar God's work, while
          it is yet upon the potter's wheel, by putting on his own instrument
          while the clay is whirling round upon the wheel, that it may not
          assume the Holy Ghost's shape, but that there may be some marks of the
          devil's workmanship in the article. Sometimes you ask God that you may
          be able to agonize in prayer. "That is right," says Satan, "agonize in
          prayer; but remember you must now receive the mercy, or you are lost."
          So he glides in and adds a little piece to the truth, making you
          believe it is an impulse of the Holy Spirit, while it is, after all, a
          deception of the Father of Lies. The Holy Ghost tells you that you are
          a lost sinner, and undone; "Ah!" says the devil, "you are, and you
          cannot be saved;" and thus again under the very garb of the Spirit's
          operations he deceives the soul. It is my firm belief that very much
          of the experience of a Christian is not Christian experience. Many
          Christians experience things that have nothing to do with
          Christianity, but more to do with demonology. When you read the
          convictions of John Bunyan, you may think that all that terror was the
          fruit of the Holy Spirit; but be assured it was the fruit of Satanic
          influence. You may think it is God's Holy Spirit that drives sinners
          to despair and keeps them shut up in the iron cage so long. Not at
          all. There was God's Holy Spirit, and then Satan came in to mar the
          work if he could.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I will give the poor sinner a means of detecting Satan, so that he
          may know whether his convictions are from the Holy Spirit, or merely
          the bellowing of hell in his ears. In the first, place, you may be
          always sure that that which comes from the devil will make you look at
          yourselves and not at Christ. The Holy Spirit's work is to turn our
          eyes from ourselves to Jesus Christ, but the enemy's work is the very
          opposite. Nine out of ten of the insinuations of the devil have to do
          with ourselves. "You are guilty," says the devil -- that is self. "You
          have not faith" -- that is self. "You do not repent enough" -- that is
          self. "You have got such a wavering hold of Christ" -- that is self.
          "You have none of the joy of the spirit, and therefore cannot be one
          of his" -- that is self. Thus the devil begins picking holes in us;
          whereas the Holy Spirit takes self entirely away, and tells us that we
          are "nothing at all," but that
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ is all in all."</p>
        <p>
          Satan brings the carcass of self and pulls it about, and because that
          is corrupt, tells us that most assuredly we cannot be saved. But
          remember, sinner, it is not thy hold of Christ that saves thee -- it
          is Christ; it is not thy joy in Christ that saves thee -- it is
          Christ; it is not even faith in Christ, though that is the instrument
          -- it is Christ's blood and merits; therefore, look not so much to thy
          hand with which thou art grasping Christ, as to Christ; look not to
          thy hope, but to Christ, the source of thy hope; look not to thy
          faith, but to Christ, the author and finisher of thy faith; and if
          thou dost that, ten thousand devils cannot throw thee down, but as
          long as thou lookest at thyself, the meanest of those evil spirits may
          tread thee beneath his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may discern the devil's insinuations in another way, they
          generally reflect upon some attribute of God. Sometimes they reflect
          upon his love, and tell you that God will not save you; sometimes upon
          his long suffering, and they tell you you are too old, and that God
          won't save you; sometimes upon his sovereignty, and they tell you that
          God does not choose as he wills, but that he has respect to
          characters, and takes men according to their merits; sometimes they
          reflect upon God's truth, and they tell you that he will not keep his
          promise; ay, and sometimes they reflect upon the very being of God,
          and tell you that there is not such a one. But O poor trembling soul,
          Satan shall not get an advantage over thee; but take care -- detect
          him; and when thou hast found out the devil, thou hast frustrated his
          aims as far as thou art thyself concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, in the last place, we have to consider the DEVIL'S DEFEAT.
          How was he defeated? Jesus rebuked him. Beloved, there is no other way
          for us to be saved from the castings down of Satan but the rebuke of
          Jesus. "Oh," says one poor soul, "many months and years have I been
          distressed for fear I should not be saved; I have gone from place to
          place in hopes that some minister might say something which should
          rebuke the evil spirit." Sister, or beloved brother, have you not been
          doing wrong? Is it not Jesus who rebukes the evil spirit? Or perhaps
          you have been trying to rebuke the evil spirit yourself; you have
          tried to argue and dispute with him; you have said that you are not so
          vile as he described you to be. Beloved, have you not been doing
          wrong. It is not your business to rebuke Satan "The Lord rebuke thee,"
          that is what thou shouldst say. Oh! if you had looked to Jesus and
          said, "Lord, rebuke him," he had only need say, "Hush!" and the demon
          would have been still in a moment, for he knows how omnipotent Jesus
          is, since he feels his power. But you get striving to pacify your own
          heart when you are under these temptations, instead of remembering
          that it is Jesus only who can remove the affliction. If I had one here
          who suffered the most from this ailment -- the possession of Satan, I
          would say to him, beloved, sit down; remember Jesus; go to Gethsemane,
          and depend upon it the devil will never stay there with you; think on
          the agonies of your Saviour covered with his blood; the devil cannot
          bear Christ's blood -- he goes howling away at the very thought of it.
          Go to the pavement where Christ endured the accursed flagellation; the
          devil will not stay long there with you; and if you sit at the foot of
          his cross and say --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh! how sweet to view the flowing,</p>
        <p>Of his ever precious blood,"</p>
        <p>
          you will not long find the devil vexing you. It is no use to get
          praying simply. Prayer is good in itself, but that is not the way to
          get rid of Satan -- it is thinking of Christ. We get saying, "Oh, that
          I had stronger faith! Oh, that I had love to Jesus!" It is good for a
          Christian to say that, but it is not enough, the way to overcome
          Satan, and to have peace with God is through Christ, "I am the way;"
          if thou wouldst know the way, come to Christ. "I am the truth:" if
          thou wouldst refute the devil's lies come to the truth. "I am the
          life:" if thou wouldst be spared from Satan's killing, come to Jesus.
          There is one thing which we all of us too much becloud in our
          preaching, though I believe we do it very unintentionally -- namely,
          the great truth that it is not prayer, it is not faith, it is not our
          doings, it is not our feelings upon which we must rest, but upon
          Christ, and on Christ alone. We are apt to think that we are not in a
          right state, that we do not feel enough, instead of remembering that
          our business is not with self, but Christ. Our business is only with
          Christ. O soul, if thou couldst fix thy soul on Jesus, and neglect
          everything else -- if thou couldst but despise good works, and aught
          else, so far as they relate to thy salvation, and look wholly, simply
          on Christ, I tell thee Satan would soon give up throwing thee down, he
          would find it would not answer his purpose, for thou wouldst fall on
          Christ, and like the giant who fell upon his mother, the earth, thou
          wouldst rise up each time stronger than before. Have I then within
          hearing one poor tried, tempted, devil-dragged soul? Has Satan been
          pulling you through the thorns, and briers, and thickets, until you
          are scarred and bruised? Come now, I have tried to preach a rough
          sermon to you because I knew I had rough work to do with roughly used
          souls. Is there nothing here, poor sinner, that thou canst lay hold
          upon? Art thou so locked up that not one ray of light comes through
          the iron bars? What! art thou so chained that thou canst not move hand
          or foot? Why, man, I have brought thee a pitcher and a piece of bread
          to-day even in thy dungeon. Though thou art cast down, there is a
          little here to comfort thee in what I have said: but oh! if my Master
          would come he would bring more than that, for he would rebuke the
          unclean spirit, and it would immediately depart from thee. Let me
          beseech thee, look only to Christ; never expect deliverance from self,
          from Satan, from ministers, or from means of any kind apart from
          Christ; keep thine eye simply on him; let his death, his agonies, his
          groans, his sufferings, his merits, his glories, his intercession, be
          fresh upon thy mind; when thou wakest in the morning look for him;
          when thou liest down at night look for him. Oh! let not thy hopes or
          fears come between thee and Christ; seek only Christ; let the hymn we
          sang be thy hymn and thy prayer, --
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, deny me what thou wilt,</p>
        <p>Only ease me of my guilt,</p>
        <p>Prostrate at thy feet I lie,</p>
        <p>Give me Christ, or else I die."</p>
        <p>
          And then, even though the devil throw thee down and tear thee, it were
          better he should do so now than that he should tear thee for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some here, however, who will laugh at what I have been
          preaching this morning. Ah! sirs, you may do so; but bitter though my
          text may be, I wish you had it in your mouths. Though sad be the
          experience of being torn when coming to Christ, I had rather see you
          so than see you whole, away from Christ. It is better to be rent in
          pieces coming to the Saviour, than to have a sound, whole heart away
          from him. Tremble, sinner, tremble, for if thou comest not to Christ,
          he shall rend thee at last; his eye shall not pity, neither shall his
          hand spare thee. He hath said, "Beware ye that forget God, lest I tear
          you in pieces and there be none to deliver." Sirs, within another
          hour, and some of you may know this; certainly, before long there are
          some who will be torn in pieces by the wrath of God. Why will ye die?
          Why will ye die? You cannot answer the question, I think; but let it
          rest upon your hearts. What profit will you have in your own blood?
          What will you profit if you gain the whole world and lose your own
          soul? Remember, Jesus Christ can save even you. Believe on his name,
          ye convinced sinners, believe on Christ. The Lord bless you, for
          Jesus' sake! Amen.
