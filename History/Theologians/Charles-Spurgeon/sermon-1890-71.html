          "Blessed is he who believes in me without having seen me! For it is
          written of me: Those who see me will not believe in me, and those who
          do not see me will believe and live.' As to what thou hast written
          asking me to come to thee, I must accomplish here all that for which I
          have been sent; and, when I shall have accomplished it all, I shall
          ascend to Him who sent me; and when I shall go away I will send one of
          my disciples, who will cure thy diseases, and give life to thee and to
          all those who are with thee." Anan, Abgar's courier, brought him this
          letter, as well as the portrait of the Saviour, a picture which is
          still to be found at this day in the city of Edessa.
