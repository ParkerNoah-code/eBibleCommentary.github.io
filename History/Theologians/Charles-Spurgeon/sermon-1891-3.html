          1. They maintain, then, that in the invisible and ineffable heights
          above there exists a certain perfect, pre-existent Æon, whom they call
          Proarche, Propator, and Bythus, and describe as being invisible and
          incomprehensible. Eternal and unbegotten, he remained throughout
          innumerable cycles of ages in profound serenity and quiescence. There
          existed along with him Ennoea, whom they also call Charis and Sige. At
          last this Bythus determined to send forth from himself the beginning
          of all things, and deposited this production (which he had resolved to
          bring forth) in his contemporary Sige, even as seed is deposited in
          the womb. She then, having received this seed, and becoming pregnant,
          gave birth to Nous, who was both similar and equal to him who had
          produced him, and was alone capable of comprehending his father's
          greatness. This Nous they call also Monogenes, and Father, and the
          Beginning of all Things. Along with him was also produced Aletheia;
          and these four constituted the first and first-begotten Pythagorean
          Tetrad, which they also denominate the root of all things. For there
          are first Bythus and Sige, and then Nous and Aletheia. And Monogenes,
          perceiving for what purpose he had been produced, also himself sent
          forth Logos and Zoe, being the father of all those who were to come
          after him, and the beginning and fashioning of the entire Pleroma. By
          the conjunction of Logos and Zoe were brought forth Anthropos and
          Ecclesia; and thus was formed the first-begotten Ogdoad, the root and
          substance of all things, called among them by four names, viz.,
          Bythus, and Nous, and Logos, and Anthropos. For each of these is
          masculo-feminine, as follows: Propator was united by a conjunction
          with his Ennoea; then Monogenes, that is Nous, with Aletheia; Logos
          with Zoe, and Anthropos with Ecclesia.

          2. These Æons having been produced for the glory of the Father, and
          wishing, by their own efforts, to effect this object, sent forth
          emanations by means of conjunction. Logos and Zoe, after producing
          Anthropos and Ecclesia, sent forth other ten Æons, whose names are the
          following: Bythius and Mixis, Ageratos and Henosis, Autophyes and
          Hedone, Acinetos and Syncrasis, Monogenes and Macaria. These are the
          ten Æons whom they declare to have been produced by Logos and Zoe.
          They then add that Anthropos himself, along with Ecclesia, produced
          twelve Æons, to whom they give the following names: Paracletus and
          Pistis, Patricos and Elpis, Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis,
          Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes, Theletos and Sophia.

          3. Such are the thirty Æons in the erroneous system of these men; and
          they are described as being wrapped up, so to speak, in silence, and
          known to none [except these professing teachers]. Moreover, they
          declare that this invisible and spiritual Pleroma of theirs is
          tripartite, being divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad. And
          for this reason they affirm it was that the "Saviour" -- for they do
          not please to call Him "Lord" -- did no work in public during the
          space of thirty years, thus setting forth the mystery of these Æons.
          They maintain also, that these thirty Æons are most plainly indicated
          in the parable of the labourers sent into the vineyard. For some are
          sent about the first hour, others about the third hour, others about
          the sixth hour, others about the ninth hour, and others about the
          eleventh hour. Now, if we add up the numbers of the hours here
          mentioned, the sum total will be thirty: for one, three, six, nine,
          and eleven, when added together, form thirty. And by the hours, they
          hold that the Æons were pointed out; while they maintain that these
          are great, and wonderful, and hitherto unspeakable mysteries which it
          is their special function to develop; and so they proceed when they
          find anything in the multitude of things contained in the Scriptures
          which they can adopt and accommodate to their baseless speculations.
