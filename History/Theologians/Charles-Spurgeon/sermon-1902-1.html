          "And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." --
          Luke 7:50.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE appear to have been four stages in Christ's dealing with this
          woman. I know not what had preceded the narrative as we have it
          recorded in this chapter; I need not enter into that question now.
          There had, doubtless, been a work of the Spirit of God upon that
          woman's heart, turning her from her sin to her Saviour; but when she
          stood at our Master's feet, raining tears of penitence upon them,
          wiping them with the hairs of her head, giving to them kisses of love,
          and anointing them with the ointment from the alabaster box, there
          were four stages m his gracious dealings with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first was, when he silently accepted her manifestations of love.
          When the copious tears from her eyes fell upon his feet, he did not
          withdraw them. When those feet were wiped with the luxuriant tresses
          of her hair, still he did not withdraw them; and when she ventured
          upon a yet closer familiarity, and not only kissed his feet, but did
          not cease to kiss them, he still did not withdraw them, but quietly
          accepted all that she did. And when the precious ointment was poured
          in lavish abundance upon those precious feet of his, he did not
          upbraid her, he did not refuse her gifts, but tacitly accepted them,
          though without a word of acknowledgment just then. And I think it is a
          very blessed thing for any one of you to be accepted before God, even
          though no word has come from his lips assuring you that it is so. When
          your tears, and cries, and secret love, and earnest seeking, -- when
          your confession of sin, your struggle after faith, and the dawnings of
          your faith are just accepted by the Lord, though as yet he has not
          said to you, "Thy sins are forgiven thee," it is a very blessed stage
          for you to have reached, for the Lord does not begin to accept anyone,
          even by a silence which means consent, and then draw back. He accepted
          this woman's love and gifts, though, for a time, he gave her no
          assurance of that acceptance, and that fact must have greatly cheered
          her. Manoah's wife said to him, "If the Lord were pleased to kill us,
          he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our
          hands;" and I feel sure that, if the Lord had not meant to bestow his
          mercy upon this woman, he would not have submitted to her washing of
          his feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hairs of her head,
          and the subsequent continual kissing of them, and anointing of them
          with the precious ointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord's favourable inclination towards this woman was still more
          marked in the second stage of his dealings with her, when he began to
          defend her against her accuser. When Simon's evil thoughts had
          condemned her, and her Lord also, Jesus spoke that wonderful parable
          which set forth the greatness of this woman's love, and justified the
          extraordinary way in which she manifested it. Christ did not speak to
          her, but he spoke up for her; and such action as that should be quite
          sufficient to stay the soul of a believer in him. What though my Lord
          has not revealed himself to me? He has revealed himself to the Father
          for me. What if he has not spoken to me? Yet, if he has spoken to God
          on my behalf, -- if he has Spoken in the Scriptures in defence of poor
          sinners, and advocated their cause in the High Court of Heaven, then
          how thankful I may be, and how thankful they may be!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third stage, our Lord did still more for this woman, for he
          spoke to her these gracious words, "Thy sins are forgiven." Oh, how
          they must have dropped like dew into her poor soul! How she must have
          been refreshed by them! She, who was a sinner, -- a great sinner, a
          public sinner, -- ay, a professional sinner, hears her Saviour say to
          her, "Thy sins are forgiven." The absolution pronounced by the man who
          calls himself a priest is utterly worthless; but it would be worth
          while to give a thousand worlds, if we had them, for absolution from
          our great High Priest! Yes, he who knew all about the woman's sin, he
          who had power on earth to forgive sins, had said to her, "Thy sins are
          forgiven." Was not that enough for her? Would not that short sentence
          set all the bells of her heart ringing as long as ever she lived?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ay, but there was still more to follow, for the Lord spoke to her a
          second time, and said, "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." So
          she was not only delivered from the guilt of sin, but she was also
          delivered from the power of sin. Her faith had saved her; she was a
          saved woman, so she might go in peace. Now she is enjoying the
          sunlight of full assurance, the bright clear noontide of acknowledged
          acceptance: "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." Some of us have
          this great blessing, and we rejoice in it; but if others of you have
          not come quite so far on the heavenly road, do not begin murmuring, or
          doubting. Bless the Lord Jesus Christ for any favour that he has shown
          to you, a poor unworthy sinner; and if you have even the faintest ray
          of light, pray him to make your path like that of the just, which
          "shineth more and more unto the perfect day." If you have received any
          token for good from your Lord, be thankful for it, and expect ere long
          to hear in your soul the sweet music of this gracious word, "Thy faith
          hath saved thee; go in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have come to our text, in which two things are, very clearly
          revealed. The first is, an assurance: "Thy faith hath saved thee and
          the second is, a dismission: "Go in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, here is AN ASSURANCE: "Thy faith hath saved thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          That assurance teaches us, first, that salvation is a present thing:
          "Thy faith hath saved thee." This is something that is already
          accomplished. You are saved; not, you shall be saved; but you are even
          now in possession of the priceless boon of salvation: "Thy faith hath
          saved thee." All through the Scriptures, and especially in the New
          Testament, it is plainly asserted that believers in Christ are already
          in possession of salvation. I will not stay to prove that it is so,
          but will rather explain it. If anyone says to me, "In what respect are
          believers saved?" I answer, that they are saved in the price, in the
          promise, in the principles, and in the pledge of salvation. The
          alliteration will help you to remember these four points.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they are saved in the price of salvation. All that was
          necessary to save them from the result of sin has been endured by the
          Lord Jesus Christ. He has ransomed them by his death upon the cross.
          He has stood in their stead, and borne their sin in his own body on
          the tree, and suffered the full penalty for it. He has finished the
          transgression, and made an end of sin, and made reconciliation for
          iniquity, and brought in for them everlasting righteousness; so that
          they are saved. The great work of their salvation was completed by
          Christ upon the cross when he laid down his life for them, and now
          they are "bought with a price," even "the precious blood of Christ, as
          of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, they are saved in the promise of salvation. Our Lord Jesus
          Christ, who cannot lie, hath declared "that whosoever believeth in him
          should not perish, but have everlasting life." God's promise is
          certain of fulfilment, so that every believer in Jesus may be
          absolutely sure of salvation. We often take the cheque of a man who is
          known to be in a good financial position, and we consider his cheque
          to be as good as if it were hard cash; and, in like manner, we accept
          God's promise of salvation as being just as sure as the salvation
          itself. Paul tells us that God's promise has been confirmed by an
          oath, "that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
          God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for
          refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, thirdly, we have salvation in the principles of it; that is to
          say, all those graces, which constitute the essentials of a perfect
          character, are in every true child of God. There is given to us, when
          we are regenerated, the very same life which we are to live for ever
          in heaven. We have now the root, the bulb, the seed, out of which
          immortality and perfection will most surely grow; we may not yet be
          perfect, but we have that which will come to perfection. We have
          within us a new nature, which cannot sin, because it is born of God;
          and this will gradually overcome the old nature, as the Israelites
          drove out the Canaanites, and we shall be perfect before the throne of
          the Most High. A man may have, in a very small room, a whole field of
          wheat lying in embryo, in the seed which is to be sown in the
          springtime, and reaped in the autumn; and we have, in the gift of
          God's grace, all heaven in embryo, in the seeds of faith and love, and
          the work of the Holy Spirit within our souls. Thus, we have salvation
          in the principles of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, once more, we have salvation in the pledge of it; for, when the
          Holy Spirit enters our heart, his coming there is the pledge and the
          earnest of heaven. There is a difference between a pledge and an
          earnest, and what I really mean is rather an earnest than a pledge. A
          pledge is taken back again, but an earnest is retained. A man, who has
          his wages to take at the end of the week, may get some earnest money
          in the middle of the week; and, if his master is what he should be,
          that will be a pledge that he will get the rest. So, the Holy Spirit
          is the Divine Person who virtually puts heaven into us, and makes us
          fit to be in the heaven which Christ has gone to prepare for us. What
          a mercy it is to have the witness of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God our Heavenly Father, to have
          aspirations after holiness which we never had in our unregenerate
          state! All this is the pledge of heaven; and in having the pledge, we
          have practically the salvation itself. The Holy Spirit would not have
          come into our hearts, and given us all these blessings, if he had not
          meant to "perfect that which concerneth us," and to save us in the
          Lord with an everlasting salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation, then, is a present thing, in price, in promise, in
          principles, and in pledge; but the important question for each of you
          to answer is, -- Have you obtained that salvation? If you have not,
          you are in a truly terrible condition, for you are "condemned already"
          because you have "not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of
          God." But if you have obtained this salvation, then you are indeed
          rich to all eternity. Perhaps you live in one poor room, and have to
          work very hard for a livelihood, yet you are much richer than those
          emperors and kings, who have much earthly pomp and state, hut who are
          not the subjects of God's grace, for you are saved; the Lord has given
          you that salvation which can never be taken away from you. So, rejoice
          in this salvation; and, if you have little else to cover you, let this
          salvation be your royal apparel; let this salvation load your table
          with heavenly dainties; let this salvation smooth your path, however
          rough it may be, and cheer your heart, however great your trials may
          be.
        </p>
        <p>So, this assurance means that salvation is a present thing.</p>
        <p>
          Next, it teaches us that salvation is obtained by faith: "Thy faith
          hath saved thee." "But," says someone, "was it not the Lord Jesus
          Christ who saved her?" Yes, certainly it was; but do you see what
          Christ does? He is so fond of faith that he takes the crown from his
          own head, and puts it on the head of faith, as he says to the woman,
          "Thy faith hath saved thee." Is that a safe thing for Christ to do?
          Oh, yes! because faith at once removes the crown from her own head,
          and puts it back upon Christ's, saying, "Not unto me, not unto me, but
          unto thy name be all the glory." Christ loves to crown faith because
          faith loves to crown Christ. As for boasting, -- faith cannot tolerate
          that for a moment; she hurls it out of the window, and will have
          nothing further to do with it. Our Saviour speaks thus, "Thy faith
          hath saved thee," because he knows that it will be understood that
          faith is only the connecting link with himself, -- that he really
          works the salvation, but that the faith of the believer is the means
          of obtaining it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four things concerning this faith, which I want you to
          notice, and I will put them under the same letter that I used before,
          so that it may be the easier for you to remember them. First, this
          woman's faith was a personal faith: "Thy faith hath saved thee." O
          dear friends, I implore you to give up all idea, of being saved by
          anybody else's faith! Thou must believe in Jesus for thyself, or thou
          wilt be a lost man for ever. What a dreadful falsehood it is when men
          stand up, as sponsors for a child, and promise and vow various things,
          none of which are within their power to perform! As to anything that
          anybody ever promised with regard to your soul, what can another
          person do for you in such a matter as that? The most earnest faith in
          your parents can never bring you to heaven, unless you also have faith
          in Jesus. There is a great blessing which may come to us through the
          faith of others, if they exercise it in prayer on our behalf; but,
          still, salvation can never come to us apart from our own personal
          faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He said to the woman, "Thy faith hath
          saved thee;" -- not Peter's faith, nor James's faith, nor John's
          faith, but her own; and thou also must have faith for thyself, or thou
          wilt assuredly be lost. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
          shalt be saved;" but if thou dost not personally believe on him, thou
          canst not be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, next, that this woman's faith was a practical faith. She was
          saved by faith, and not by works; but, she was not saved by a faith
          which did not produce works. Think of her works, -- she washes the
          Master's feet with her tears, and wipes them with the hairs of her
          head; she kisses them repeatedly, and anoints them with her precious
          ointment. I may truly say of her, "She hath done what she could." All
          that her affection prompted, her devotion performed; for she had the
          faith which works by love; and if you, dear friends, have a faith that
          never works for Christ, I beg you to get rid of it at once, for it
          will turn out to be a bastard faith. The faith that never kisses his
          feet is a faith that he will tread under his feet. The faith that
          never anoints him is a faith that will have no fragrance in his
          esteem, and he will not accept it. We are not saved by works and faith
          combined, much less by works alone; but, nevertheless, the faith which
          saves is not a barren faith; it produces the good fruit of love and
          service for Christ,
        </p>
        <p>
          So this woman's faith was personal and practical. It was also a
          penitent faith. While she stood at Christ's feet, behind him, her eyes
          showered tears upon them as she wept over her sin. I am always
          doubtful of the genuineness of a dry-eyed faith. The longer I live,
          the more I am afraid of those people who profess to leap into faith
          without any repentance; and there seem to be some, in these days, who
          do not believe in the old-fashioned sorrow for sin. I would rather see
          some men less confident than they are if they were more humbled on
          account of their past transgressions. This woman manifested a truly
          penitent faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, once more, it was a pure faith; -- I use that word pure to help
          your memory, and I mean that her faith was perfectly simple. She wept,
          but she did not trust in her weeping. She anointed Christ's feet with
          the ointment, but she did not rely upon her self-sacrifice. She kissed
          his feet, but she did not depend upon her kisses. Where was her trust
          all placed? Why, upon Christ, and-upon him alone. I do not know that
          she had ever read the Old Testament; certainly, she could not have
          read the New Testament, for it was not written then. She may not have
          known much about the Bible, but she knew him who is the very sum and
          substance of the Bible. I have heard people talk about a Body of
          Divinity; but there never was but one in the highest sense of the
          term, and Jesus Christ is that Body of Divinity. He is, in the truest
          sense, "the Word of God." This woman had seen him, she had learned to
          know him, he had forgiven her sin, and she had come into that house
          full of love to him, and full of trust in him, and now from his own
          lips she receives this gracious assurance, "Thy faith hath saved
          thee." It was faith in him, and in nothing else. There was not, and
          there could not, have been, in her case, anything to trust to but
          Christ. She was, in a very emphatic sense, a sinner; she had not set
          herself up as being a person of good character; there were, no doubt,
          scores of people in the city who could have borne lamentable evidence
          of her sinfulness. But she trusted herself absolutely to Jesus Christ,
          the sinners' Saviour, and she trusted him alone, and so her faith was
          proved to he of that pure kind that saves all who exercise it. Let
          yours be like that, dear friend, -- personal, practical, penitential,
          and pure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, upon this first point, note that salvation may be a matter of
          assurance. This woman had the assurance from Christ's own lips, "Thy
          faith hath saved thee." Those of you who were at the prayer-meeting
          here, last Monday night, will remember that one of our brethren, when
          he was giving an address, made you smile when he said, "He that
          believeth On the Son hath everlasting life," and then added, "h-a-t-h,
          -- that spells 'got it.'" That is a queer mode of spelling, which is
          not taught at the Board School; yet it is a heavenly way of spelling,
          and it is perfectly correct. "H-a-t-h; -- that spells 'got it.'" If
          you have the blessing of salvation, there is a possibility of knowing
          that you have it. "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting
          life;" he has got it; he has got it now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I should believe it," says one, "if Jesus Christ spoke to me, and
          said so." My dear friend, he has said it in his Word. Is that Word a
          lie, or is it true? If it is true, then what more do you want? Christ
          has written it in his Word; and I like a thing that is written even
          better than that which is spoken. You know how a man says, when he
          wants a guarantee about a bargain, "Give it to me in writing; for some
          people will swear that they never said what we ourselves heard them
          say, so give it me in black and white." Well, here it is in black and
          white: "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life;" and
          again, "There is therefore now" -- "now," mark, -- "no condemnation to
          them which are in Christ Jesus;" and yet again, "Therefore being
          justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
          Christ." Now, cannot you also say, "got it"?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, but!" says someone, "I want evidence that it is so." Very well,
          you shall have evidence; you shall have the witness of the Spirit who
          has renewed you; you shall have the witness of your changed life; you
          shall have the witness of your new character; but, first of all, is
          not Christ's Word sufficient for you? Is not Christ's written Word
          enough? Is not this Book, which you believe to have been inspired by
          the Holy Ghost, and which reveals the Word of the Lord, enough for
          you? It is enough for me. If all the men in the world were to come,
          one after another, after I had read something in the Bible, and were
          all to say, in their different languages, "That is a lie," I should
          not believe it an atom the less; and suppose they were all to stand
          up, and say, "It is true," I should reply, "Of course it is, but I do
          not need your word to confirm what Christ has said." I am perfectly
          satisfied if he has said it; and there it stands, and all the powers
          of hell cannot prevail to overthrow it. Here is the solid rock for a
          soul to rest upon. Christ says, at this moment, to everyone who
          believes in him, and trusts in his blood and righteousness, "Thy faith
          hath saved thee; go in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. So we come to the latter part of our text, which is, A DISMISSION:
          "Go in peace." What did Our Lord mean by saying this?
        </p>
        <p>
          I think he meant, first, "Quit this place of controversy, and go in
          peace." Do you notice that it was when those, who sat at meat with
          him, began to say within themselves, "Who is this that forgiveth sins
          also?" that he said to the woman, "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
          peace"? See the black looks of those Jews, those Pharisees, round
          about Simon's table. Why, they are as sour as vinegar, and full of all
          kinds of scepticism, so the Saviour says to the woman, "Go home good
          soul, away from all of them." So, dear friends, whenever you meet with
          a book that is full of scepticism and unbelief, -- especially you who
          have lately found the Saviour, -- you had better throw it away. "Thy
          faith hath saved thee; go in peace." Unbelief will be no help to thee;
          thy faith hath already saved thee; then, what more dost thou want?
          Thou hast the assurance within thine own soul that thou art saved; do
          not go anywhere, or do anything to damage that assurance. I do not
          think it is worth while to go through a horse pond, and get covered
          with filth, just for the pleasure of being afterwards washed. It may
          be that some strong man, like another Samson, may have to go in among
          the Philistines, and pull their temple down about their ears; but poor
          Hannah could not do that, and those who are like her -- the women of a
          sorrowful spirit, -- had better go home, and get out of the way of
          that set of wranglers. They may even be wrangling professors,
          squabbling about this doctrine and that, and perhaps not understanding
          any of them properly; so the Saviour says to you, "You have the
          assurance of salvation; do not let anybody worry you out of that. Go
          in peace." This is what the apostle means when he says, "Him that is
          weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, next, I think our Saviour meant his words to the woman, "Thy
          faith hath saved thee; go in peace;" to be a kind of dismission of her
          case from the Court. Here is Simon in thought accusing her, and
          thinking that she ought not to be permitted to come and touch the
          Master's feet, and here is the Lord Jesus Christ not only becoming a
          pleader for her, but deciding the case in her favour as he says to
          her, "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." This was in effect
          saying, "Your case is dismissed; there is nothing against you. The
          Court clears you; go home, good soul." What a mercy it is when the
          Lord speaks thus to anyone! "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
          God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It
          is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at
          the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us." Christ
          has given us our dismission from the Court of Justice, so let us "go
          in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          May not our Lord also have meant something more than we see upon the
          surface of these words? May he not have meant, "Go home in peace to
          thy daily avocations"? Ah! she had done a deal of mischief in that
          home of hers by her sin; for there never was a fallen woman who
          brought a blessing to her family while she lived in sin. And now that
          the Saviour has given to her the assurance of salvation, he says to
          her, "Go home, and attend to your ordinary household duties. Go and
          act as a woman should. Fulfil your part as a mother, or a daughter, or
          a servant, or whatever your calling may be. Go in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not also think that this dismissory word would last her as long
          as ever she lived, -- and that, all her life through, she would seem
          to hear the Saviour saying to her, "Go in peace"? Perhaps she was to
          go upstairs, and lie there ill; but she was to "go in peace."
          Possibly, she was to come down, and to confront opposition and
          persecution; if so, she was still to hear this message, "Go in peace."
          I think that word would come to her every morning as soon as ever she
          woke; and when she was about to close her eyes, and go to sleep, she
          would still hear it. With such a gracious message as that, she could
          even go through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and "fear no evil."
          It may be that is just what the Lord meant it for, -- that, when she
          came to die, -- and she may have died a martyr's death, we cannot
          tell, -- at any rate, whenever she came to die, this message was
          ringing in her ears, "Go in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          The practical point that I want to bring home to you Christian people,
          to you who are saved, is this. Beloved friends, as you go to your
          families, as you go through life, as you go into eternity, I pray you
          to "go in peace." It is heaven begun below to possess "the peace Of
          God, which passeth all understanding." Peace should be the continual
          portion of all believers. This is what the angels sang when our Lord
          Jesus appeared on earth, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
          peace, goodwill to-ward men." And as it was at tho beginning Of Our
          Saviour's life, so it was at the end, for this was our Lord's legacy
          to all his disciples, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
          you." That which gives one of his titles even to God himself-for he is
          called "the God of peace," -- should be very precious to your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peace is the fit result of what the Saviour has done for you. Has he
          forgiven you? Then you have peace. Has he saved you? Oh, then, feel an
          inward peace which none can take from you! Did he die for you? Then
          you can never die, in the full meaning of the word, so be at rest
          about that matter. Has he risen for you? Then, because he lives, you
          shall live also; so, let not your heart be troubled, but be at peace.
          Will he come again to receive you unto himself? Oh, then, let your
          peace be like a river flowing from the very throne of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          This peace within your heart is the blessed fruit of the Spirit of
          peace. Where the Spirit of God is, there must be peace, for he is the
          Sacred Dove. The fruit of the Spirit within us should be "quietness
          and assurance for ever." Do not despise this priceless boon of peace;
          but, as saved souls, covet more and more of it. Do you know what I
          mean by talking thus to you? Suppose you are thinking to yourself,
          "Alas! I am going home to an ungodly husband;" never mind, dear wife,
          "go in peace." "Oh, but! to-morrow, I have to go out among ungodly
          men." Never mind; "go in peace." Do not go among them disturbed and
          fluttered, but sing to yourself softly, --
        </p>
        <p>"My heart is resting, O my God!"</p>
        <p>
          "Go in peace." Perhaps you are going to the sick-bed of one of your
          dearest friends. Possibly, there is one at home, who is so depressed
          in spirit as to depress you too. Never mind; "go in peace." It will
          strengthen you to have your own heart at peace. I remember once seeing
          an accident on a hill. I feared that a man had broken his leg, and I
          know that someone ran to fetch a doctor, and when he came, to my
          surprise, he walked coolly up to where the man was. If I had been sent
          for, I should have ran myself out of breath to get to the poor man;
          and when I reached him, I should have been all of a tremble, and
          should not have been able to do anything properly. But when the doctor
          heard that there was a man with his leg broken, he walked quietly to
          the spot, and the result was that he was able to do his work properly.
          Our Lord Jesus Christ was never in a hurry. It is marvellous to
          contemplate the leisure of the greatest Worker who ever lived. He
          always moved along with a holy calm and quiet dignity, and he
          therefore did everything well. Do you likewise; "go in peace," for it
          shall be your strength. Sometimes, your strength is to sit still; and,
          always, the joy of the Lord shall be your strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the way in which you are to glorify God in your life, -- by
          going in peace. When this woman went back to her home, -- that same
          woman who had been such a poor, trembling, broken, bruised reed,
          because of her sin, -- those who knew her enquired, "What has come to
          Mary?" -- if that was her name; I do not know; -- "What has come to
          her? Why, she looks so placid, so calm, she is not like the same woman
          that she used to be." I have no doubt that she was rather
          quick-tempered, for most very loving spirits are like that. "But now,"
          say her friends, "she takes things so differently; she is so still,
          and quiet, and restful." Just so; and then they took knowledge of her,
          that she had been with Jesus, and had learned of him, for that was his
          style and his manner also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, dear hearts! if Christ has saved you, you have the best reason in
          all the world for being the quietest, happiest people who ever lived.
          One said, one day, to a person who had spoken of his salvation in
          tones of assurance, "You ought to be the happiest man that lives;" and
          he answered, "So I am." It was well known that he was very poor, that
          he did not know where he would get a second coat to his back; but,
          then, he thought that he did not want a second coat till he had worn
          out the first one. They said that he did not know where he would get
          his next breakfast; but he had had his supper, so he was quite content
          to wait till God should give him his breakfast. He had such simple
          faith in God that, though he was so very poor, yet he said he was the
          happiest man in all the world. Go in for that, beloved, for surely you
          have a right to it if you are a believer in Jesus. Your greatest
          sorrows are over, your heaviest burdens Christ has carried; the most
          terrible disaster that could ever happen to you has been averted by
          him; the most fearful calamity that you once had cause to dread can
          never come to you. You are an heir of God, and a joint heir with Jesus
          Christ. You shall have all you really need in this life, and you shall
          have the heaven of God in the life to come. The supreme act of God, by
          which he blesses eternally, has been performed upon you already. The
          Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, have all united to bless you; and
          the covenant of peace is signed, and sealed, and ratified, and you
          must and shall conquer at the last. So, "Let not Your heart be
          troubled; neither lot it be afraid;" but say to yourself, --
        </p>
        <p>"All that remains for me</p>
        <p>Is but to love and sing,</p>
        <p>And wait until the angels come</p>
        <p>To bear me to the King."</p>
        <p>God bless you, for Christ's sake! Amen.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 2.</p>
        <p>Verse 1. And you hath he quickened, --</p>
        <p>
          You, who were by nature dead, are now made alive unto God by the Holy
          Spirit. If you had nothing else to think of, all day long, but just
          these five words, they might suffice to lift you up to the very
          heights of grateful adoration of your quickening Lord: "And you hath
          he quickened," --
        </p>
        <p>1. Who were dead in trespasses and sins;</p>
        <p>
          These were your grave-clothes, or the charnel-house in which you would
          have continued to lie if the quickening power of God the Holy Spirit
          had not brought you out into newness of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
          that now worketh the children of disobedience:
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what happened to us all in our unregenerate state, we were
          carried along by the world, loving what it loved, judging from its
          views, and acting according to its maxims. Nay, worse than that, the
          devil himself had dominion over us, as he had over the rest of the
          world -- "the prince of the power of the air" was the spirit that
          worked in us as well as in the rest of "the children of disobedience."
          What a glorious deliverance it was to be saved from the power of
          death, and the dominion of Satan, and to be made partakers of
          everlasting life!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the
          lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the
          mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the highest point to which human nature can attain; left to
          itself, it makes us "children of wrath." Even those who are now most
          assuredly the children of God were once the children of wrath; there
          was no difference, in that respect, between them and the rest of
          mankind. It is only the marvellous mercy and grace of God which have
          made us to differ from our fellow-creatures who are still "dead in
          trespasses and sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          4, 5. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
          loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
          with Christ, --
        </p>
        <p>
          Again let us praise the Lord with all our hearts for what he has done
          for us. It is truly wonderful that he should have loved us when we
          were "dead in trespasses and sins," -- with no feeling, no holy
          desire, no repentance; while indifference, heartlessness,
          powerlessness covered everything. We were dead in sin, yet he loved
          us, and therefore it was that he "quickened us together with Christ,"
          --
        </p>
        <p>5. (By grace ye are saved;)</p>
        <p>
          Not by human merit, not by the energy of our own will; but, "by grace
          ye are saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
          heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not only alive, you see, but we are elevated into the highest
          position of the new life, -- made to live with Christ, and in Christ,
          -- made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          7, 8. That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
          his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace
          are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift
          of God:
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the salvation and the faith that makes it ours are the gift of
          God. Twice over, the apostle tells us that we are saved by grace, yet
          men will not believe it. They will somehow or other, get away from
          this humbling but true and precious doctrine. They will contrive, by
          some method or other, to squeeze in their own works, and their own
          will, and so rob Christ, if not of his crown, yet of some of its
          brightest jewels.
        </p>
        <p>
          9, 10. Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his
          workmanship, --
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have good works, as I trust we have, yet even they are the
          production of God's grace; praise and glory for them belong to him,
          and not to us: "For we are his workmanship, --
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before
          ordained that we should walk in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the great object of our election; we are elected that we may
          be holy, and ordained that we may walk in good works; -- who can
          rightly quarrel with such a divine purpose as this?
        </p>
        <p>
          11, 12. Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
          flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the
          Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; that at that time ye were
          without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
          strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without
          God in the world:
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the condition of every unbeliever at this time: "having no
          hope, and without God in the world." Mr. Hume once made the remark
          that he knew many Christians who were afraid to die, but he was not.
          The Christian man, to whom he said this, pointed to an ox grazing in
          the meadow, and said, "You have reached about as high as that bullock
          has, for he also is not afraid to die; but pray, Mr. Hume," enquired
          the good man, "have you any hope after death?" At that question, the
          philosopher shook his head, for he knew nothing of such a hope as
          that; the utmost point he could reach was, by indifference, to raise
          himself above fear. "Having no hope," is a true description of every
          man who has no faith in our crucified and risen Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far of are made nigh
          by the blood of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the great attracting power, which draws us from our natural
          distance, and brings us into nearness to God. How we ought to prize
          that precious blood which does so much for us! It cleanses us from
          sin; it pleads us before the throne; and here, you see, having made a
          way of access for us, it also conducts us along that way, and brings
          us nigh to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
          the middle wall of partition between us;

          There are no privileges now for the Jew from which the Christian is
          shut out, for Christ "hath made both one." There is neither
          circumcision nor uncircumcision now, for all believers are one in
          Christ Jesus.

          15-22. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
          commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
          one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto
          God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and
          came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that
          were nigh. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
          Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
          fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are
          built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
          himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly
          framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye
          also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

          May we realize that the Holy Spirit is inhabiting his own Church at
          this moment; and, especially, may all of us, who believe in our Lord
          Jesus Christ, realize our own position in that spiritual temple which
          is the "habitation of God through the Spirit," for Christ's sake.
          Amen.
