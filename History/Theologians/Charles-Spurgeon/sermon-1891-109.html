          1. For the tradition of the elders themselves, which they pretended to
          observe from the law, was contrary to the law given by Moses.
          Wherefore also Esaias declares: "Thy dealers mix the wine with water,"
          showing that the elders were in the habit of mingling a watered
          tradition with the simple command of God; that is, they set up a
          spurious law, and one contrary to the [true] law; as also the Lord
          made plain, when He said to them, "Why do ye transgress the
          commandment of God, for the sake of your tradition?" For not only by
          actual transgression did they set the law of God at nought, mingling
          the wine with water; but they also set up their own law in opposition
          to it, which is termed, even to the present day, the pharisaical. In
          this [law] they suppress certain things, add others, and interpret
          others, again, as they think proper, which their teachers use, each
          one in particular; and desiring to uphold these traditions, they were
          unwilling to be subject to the law of God, which prepares them for the
          coming of Christ. But they did even blame the Lord for healing on the
          Sabbath-days, which, as I have already observed, the law did not
          prohibit. For they did themselves, in one sense, perform acts of
          healing upon the Sabbath-day, when they circumcised a man [on that
          day]; but they did not blame themselves for transgressing the command
          of God through tradition and the aforesaid pharisaical law, and for
          not keeping the commandment of the law, which is the love of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But that this is the first and greatest commandment, and that the
          next [has respect to love] towards our neighbour, the Lord has taught,
          when He says that the entire law and the prophets hang upon these two
          commandments. Moreover, He did not Himself bring down [from heaven]
          any other commandment greater than this one, but renewed this very
          same one to His disciples, when He enjoined them to love God with all
          their heart, and others as themselves. But if He had descended from
          another Father, He never would have made use of the first and greatest
          commandment of the law; but He would undoubtedly have endeavoured by
          all means to bring down a greater one than this from the perfect
          Father, so as not to make use of that which had been given by the God
          of the law. And Paul in like manner declares, "Love is the fulfilling
          of the law:" and [he declares] that when all other things have been
          destroyed, there shall remain "faith, hope, and love; but the greatest
          of all is love;" and that apart from the love of God, neither
          knowledge avails anything, nor the understanding of mysteries, nor
          faith, nor prophecy, but that without love all are hollow and vain;
          moreover, that love makes man perfect; and that he who loves God is
          perfect, both in this world and in that which is to come. For we do
          never cease from loving God; but in proportion as we continue to
          contemplate Him, so much the more do we love Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As in the law, therefore, and in the Gospel [likewise], the first
          and greatest commandment is, to love the Lord God with the whole
          heart, and then there follows a commandment like to it, to love one's
          neighbour as one's self; the author of the law and the Gospel is shown
          to be one and the same. For the precepts of an absolutely perfect
          life, since they are the same in each Testament, have pointed out [to
          us] the same God, who certainly has promulgated particular laws
          adapted for each; but the more prominent and the greatest
          [commandments], without which salvation cannot [be attained], He has
          exhorted [us to observe] the same in both.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Lord, too, does not do away with this [God], when He shows that
          the law was not derived from another God, expressing Himself as
          follows to those who were being instructed by Him, to the multitude
          and to His disciples: "The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
          All, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;
          but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they
          bind heavy burdens, and lay them upon men's shoulders; but they
          themselves will not so much as move them with a finger." He therefore
          did not throw blame upon that law which was given by Moses, when He
          exhorted it to be observed, Jerusalem being as yet in safety; but He
          did throw blame upon those persons, because they repeated indeed the
          words of the law, yet were without love. And for this reason were they
          held as being unrighteous as respects God, and as respects their
          neighbours. As also Isaiah says: "This people honoureth Me with their
          lips, but their heart is far from Me: howbeit in vain do they worship
          Me, teaching the doctrines and the commandments of men." He does not
          call the law given by Moses commandments of men, but the traditions of
          the elders themselves which they had invented, and in upholding which
          they made the law of God of none effect, and were on this account also
          not subject to His Word. For this is what Paul says concerning these
          men: "For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about
          to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to
          the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for
          righteousness to every one that believeth." And how is Christ the end
          of the law, if He be not also the final cause of it? For He who has
          brought in the end has Himself also wrought the beginning; and it is
          He who does Himself say to Moses, "I have surely seen the affliction
          of my people which is in Egypt, and I have come down to deliver them;"
          it being customary from the beginning with the Word of God to ascend
          and descend for the purpose of saving those who were in affliction.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Now, that the law did beforehand teach mankind the necessity of
          following Christ, He does Himself make manifest, when He replied as
          follows to him who asked Him what he should do that he might inherit
          eternal life: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."
          But upon the other asking "Which?" again the Lord replies: "Do not
          commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
          honour father and mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as
          thyself," -- setting as an ascending series (velut gradus) before
          those who wished to follow Him, the precepts of the law, as the
          entrance into life; and what He then said to one He said to all. But
          when the former said, "All these have I done" (and most likely he had
          not kept them, for in that case the Lord would not have said to him,
          "Keep the commandments"), the Lord, exposing his covetousness, said to
          him, "If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and
          distribute to the poor; and come, follow me;" promising to those who
          would act thus, the portion belonging to the apostles (apostolorum
          partem). And He did not preach to His followers another God the
          Father, besides Him who was proclaimed by the law from the beginning;
          nor another Son; nor the Mother, the enthymesis of the Æon, who
          existed in suffering and apostasy; nor the Pleroma of the thirty Æons,
          which has been proved vain, and incapable of being believed in; nor
          that fable invented by the other heretics. But He taught that they
          should obey the commandments which God enjoined from the beginning,
          and do away with their former covetousness by good works, and follow
          after Christ. But that possessions distributed to the poor do annul
          former covetousness, Zaccheus made evident, when he said, "Behold, the
          half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one,
          I restore fourfold." <br />
