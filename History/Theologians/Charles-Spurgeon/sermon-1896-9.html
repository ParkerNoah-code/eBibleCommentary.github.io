          16. Who will rise up for me against my adversaries? who will stand up
          for me against the workers of iniquity? 17. Unless Jehovah had been my
          help, my soul had well nigh dwelt in silence. 18. If I said, My foot
          has fallen, thy kindness, O Jehovah! has held me up. 19. In the
          multitude of my thoughts, thy comforts within me delight my soul.

          16. Who will rise up for me against my adversaries? Here the Psalmist
          points out, in a lively and graphic manner, how destitute he was of
          all human aid. As if at the moment in danger, he cries out -- Who will
          stand up for me? Who will oppose himself to my enemies? And
          immediately afterwards he replies, that had not God helped him, he
          must have despaired of safety. In declaring that he had been thus
          miraculously rescued from death, when deserted by all the world, he
          commends the more God's kindness and grace. When men aid us, they are
          only instruments by which the grace of God works; but we are apt not
          to recognize God's hand when we see any subordinate agency in the
          deliverance. He speaks of his life dwelling in silence, (verse 17) for
          the dead lie in the grave without feeling or strength. Thus the
          Psalmist owns that there was no means by which his life could have
          been preserved, had not God interposed without delay.

          18. If I said, My foot has fallen What is said in this verse confirms
          the preceding statement. The more to commend God's kindness and power,
          he declares that it was no common danger from which he had been
          rescued, but in a manner from present death. The import of the
          language is, that death stared him so full in view, that he despaired
          of himself; as Paul speaks of having had the message of death in
          himself, when his condition was desperate, and he had given up hope of
          life, (2 Corinthians 1:9.) The fact of the Psalmist having been
          delivered after he had considered death certain, made the Divine
          interposition the more conspicuous. If we understand him as speaking
          of temporal death only in the expression, My foot has fallen -- there
          is nothing unaccountable in the circumstance of his having despaired,
          as God often prolongs the life of his people in the world, when they
          had lost hope, and were preparing for their departure. Possibly,
          however, the Psalmist only means that this was the language of sense;
          and this is the more probable, because we have already seen that he
          never ceased praying to God -- a proof that he had still some hope.
          The next verse affords still further proof, for there he tells us that
          his afflictions were always mixed with some comfort. By thoughts, he
          means anxious and perplexing cares, which would have overwhelmed him
          had not consolation been communicated to him from above. We learn this
          truth from the passage, That God interposes in behalf of his people,
          with a due regard to the magnitude of their trials and distresses, and
          at the very moment which is necessary, enlarging them in their
          straits, as we find stated in other places. The heavier our calamities
          grow, we should hope that Divine grace will only be the more
          powerfully manifested in comforting us under them, (Psalm 4:1; 118:5,)
          But should we through weakness of the flesh be vexed and tormented by
          anxious cares, we must be satisfied with the remedy which the Psalmist
          here speaks of in such high terms. Believers are conscious of two very
          different states of mind. On the one hand, they are afflicted and
          distressed with various fears and anxieties; on the other, there is a
          secret joy communicated to them from above, and this in accommodation
          to their necessity, so as to preserve them from being swallowed up by
          any complication or force of calamity which may assail them.<br />
