          [a.d.170.] Eusebius is almost diffuse in what he tells us of this
          Dionysius, "who was appointed over the church at Corinth, and imparted
          freely, not only to his own people, but to others, and those abroad
          also, the blessings of his divine labours." He wrote "Catholic
          Epistles;" he addressed an epistle to the Spartans and the Athenians;
          and, as Eusebius says, Dionysius the Areopagite, the convert of St.
          Paul, was the first bishop of Athens. He wrote to the Nicomedians,
          refuting Marcion, and closely adhering to "the rule of faith." In an
          epistle to the Gortynians and others in Crete, he praises Philip for
          his courageous ministry, and warns them against the heretics. He seems
          to recognise Palmas as bishop of Amastris and Pontus, and adds
          expositions of Scripture, and rules regarding marriage, its purity and
          sanctity. He also inculcates tenderness to penitent lapsers and
          backsliders. With Pinytus, bishop of the Gnossians, he corresponds on
          similar subjects; but Pinytus, while he thanks him and commends his
          clemency, evidently regards him as too much inclined to furnish "food
          for babes," and counsels him to add "strong meat for those of full
          age." He also writes to Chrysophora, his most faithful sister,
          imparting spiritual instruction.

        <p>Fragments from a Letter to the Roman Church.</p>
        <p>I.</p>
        <p>
          For this has been your custom from the beginning, to do good to all
          the brethren in various ways, and to send resources to many churches
          which are in every city, thus refreshing the poverty of the needy, and
          granting subsidies to the brethren who are in the mines. Through the
          resources which ye have sent from the beginning, ye Romans, keep up
          the custom of the Romans handed down by the fathers, which your
          blessed Bishop Soter has not only preserved, but added to, sending a
          splendid gift to the saints, and exhorting with blessed words those
          brethren who go up to Rome, as an affectionate father his children.
        </p>
        <p>II.</p>
        <p>From the Same Epistle.</p>
        <p>
          We passed this holy Lord's day, in which we read your letter, from the
          constant reading of which we shall be able to draw admonition, even as
          from the reading of the former one you sent us written through
          Clement.
        </p>
        <p>III.</p>
        <p>From the Same.</p>
        <p>
          Therefore you also have by such admonition joined in close union the
          churches that were planted by Peter and Paul, that of the Romans and
          that of the Corinthians: for both of them went to our Corinth, and
          taught us in the same way as they taught you when they went to Italy;
          and having taught you, they suffered martyrdom at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>IV.</p>
        <p>From the Same.</p>
        <p>
          For I wrote letters when the brethren requested me to write. And these
          letters the apostles of the devil have filled with tares, taking away
          some things and adding others, for whom a woe is in store. It is not
          wonderful, then, if some have attempted to adulterate the Lord's
          writings, when they have formed designs against those which are not
          such.
