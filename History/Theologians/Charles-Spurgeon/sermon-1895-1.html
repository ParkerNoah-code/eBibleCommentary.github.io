        <p>I. -- Comments On the First Epistle of Peter.</p>
        <p>
          Chap. i.3. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
          who by His great mercy hath regenerated us." For if God generated us
          of matter, He afterwards, by progress in life, regenerated us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Father of our Lord, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:" who,
          according to your faith, rises again in us; as, on the other hand, He
          dies in us, through the operation of our unbelief. For He said again,
          that the soul never returns a second time to the body in this life;
          and that which has become angelic does not become unrighteous or evil,
          so as not to have the opportunity of again sinning by the assumption
          of flesh; but that in the resurrection the soul returns to the body,
          and both are joined to one another according to their peculiar nature,
          adapting themselves, through the composition of each, by a kind of
          congruity like a building of stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, Peter says, "Ye also, as living stones, are built up a
          spiritual house;" meaning the place of the angelic abode, guarded in
          heaven . "For you," he says, "who are kept by the power of God, by
          faith and contemplation, to receive the end of your faith, the
          salvation of your souls."
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it appears that the soul is not naturally immortal; but is made
          immortal by the grace of God, through faith and righteousness, and by
          knowledge. "Of which salvation," he says, "the prophets have inquired
          and searched diligently," and what follows. It is declared by this
          that the prophets spake with wisdom, and that the Spirit of Christ was
          in them, according to the possession of Christ, and in subjection to
          Christ. For God works through archangels and kindred angels, who are
          called spirits of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Which are now," he says, "reported unto you by them that have
          preached the Gospel unto you." The old things which were done by the
          prophets and escape the observation of most, are now revealed to you
          by the evangelists. "For to you," he says, "they are manifested by the
          Holy Ghost, who was sent;" that is the Paraclete, of whom the Lord
          said, "If I go not away, He will not come." "Unto whom," it is said,
          "the angels desire to look;" not the apostate angels, as most suspect,
          but, what is a divine truth, angels who desire to obtain the advantage
          of that perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          "By precious blood," he says, "as of a lamb without blemish and
          without spot." Here he touches on the ancient Levitical and sacerdotal
          celebrations; but means a soul pure through righteousness which is
          offered to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Verily foreknown before the foundation of the world." Inasmuch as He
          was foreknown before every creature, because He was Christ. "But
          manifested in the last times" by the generation of a body. "Being born
          again, not of corruptible seed." The soul, then, which is produced
          along with the body is corruptible, as some think.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But the word of the Lord," he says, "endureth for ever:" as well
          prophecy as divine doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood." That we are a
          chosen race by the election of God is abundantly clear. He says royal,
          because we are called to sovereignty and belong to Christ; and
          priesthood on account of the oblation which is made by prayers and
          instructions, by which are gained the souls which are offered to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who, when He was reviled," he says, "reviled not; when He suffered,
          threatened not." The Lord acted so in His goodness and patience. "But
          committed Himself to him that judged Him unrighteously:" whether
          Himself, so that, regarding Himself in this way, there is a
          transposition. He indeed gave Himself up to those who judged according
          to an unjust law; because He was unserviceable to them, inasmuch as He
          was righteous: or, He committed to God those who judged unrighteously,
          and without cause insisted on His death, so that they might be
          instructed by suffering punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For he that will love life, and see good days;" that is, who wishes
          to become eternal and immortal. And He calls the Lord life, and the
          days good, that is holy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the eyes of the Lord," he says, "are upon the righteous, and His
          ears on their prayers:" he means the manifold inspection of the Holy
          Spirit. "The face of the Lord is on them that do evil;" that is,
          whether judgment, or vengeance, or manifestation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But sanctify the Lord Christ," he says, "in your hearts." For so you
          have in the Lord's prayer, "Hallowed be Thy name."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For Christ," he says, "hath once suffered for our sins, the just for
          the unjust, that he might present us to God; being put to death in the
          flesh, but quickened in the spirit." He says these things, reducing
          them to their faith. That is, He became alive in our spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Coming," he says, "He preached to those who were once unbelieving."
          They saw not His form, but they heard His voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When the long-suffering of God" holds out. God is so good, as to work
          the result by the teaching of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "By the resurrection," it is said, "of Jesus Christ:" that, namely,
          which is effected in us by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Angels being subjected to Him," which are the first order; and
          "principalities" being subject, who are of the second order; and
          "powers" being also subject, which are said to belong to the third
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who shall give account," he says, "to Him who is ready to judge the
          quick and the dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          These are trained through previous judgments. Therefore he adds, "For
          this cause was the Gospel preached also to the dead" -- to us, namely,
          who were at one time unbelievers. "That they might be judged according
          to men," he says, "in the flesh, but live according to God in the
          spirit." Because, that is, they have fallen away from faith; whilst
          they are still in the flesh they are judged according to preceding
          judgments, that they might repent. Accordingly, he also adds, saying,
          "That they might live according to God in the spirit." So Paul also;
          for he, too, states something of this nature when he says, "Whom I
          have delivered to Satan, that he might live in the spirit;" that is,
          "as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." Similarly also Paul
          says, "Variously, and in many ways, God of old spake to our fathers."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Rejoice," it is said, "that ye are partakers in the sufferings of
          Christ:" that is, if ye are righteous, ye suffer for righteousness'
          sake, as Christ suffered for righteousness. "Happy are ye, for the
          Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of His glory and virtue, resteth on
          you." This possessive "His" signifies also an an angelic spirit:
          inasmuch as the glory of God those are, through whom, according to
          faith and righteousness, He is glorified, to honourable glory,
          according to the advancement of the saints who are brought in. "The
          Spirit of God on us," may be thus understood; that is, who through
          faith comes on the soul, like a gracefulness of mind and beauty of
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Since," it is said, "it is time for judgment beginning at the house
          of God." For judgment will overtake these in the appointed
          persecutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But the God of all grace," he says. "Of all grace," he says, because
          He is good, and the giver of all good things.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Marcus, my son, saluteth you." Mark, the follower of Peter, while
          Peter publicly preached the Gospel at Rome before some of CÃ¦sar's
          equites, and adduced many testimonies to Christ, in order that thereby
          they might be able to commit to memory what was spoken, of what was
          spoken by Peter, wrote entirely what is called the Gospel according to
          Mark. As Luke also may be recognised by the style, both to have
          composed the Acts of the Apostles, and to have translated Paul's
          Epistle to the Hebrews.
        </p>
        <p>II. -- Comments on the Epistle of Jude.</p>
        <p>
          Jude, who wrote the Catholic Epistle, the brother of the sons of
          Joseph, and very religious, whilst knowing the near relationship of
          the Lord, yet did not say that he himself was His brother. But what
          said he? "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ," -- of Him as Lord; but
          "the brother of James." For this is true; he was His brother, (the
          son) of Joseph. "For certain men have entered unawares, ungodly men,
          who had been of old ordained and predestined to the judgment of our
          God;" not that they might become impious, but that, being now impious,
          they were ordained to judgment. "For the Lord God," he says, "who once
          delivered a people out of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that
          believed not;" that is, that He might train them through punishment.
          For they were indeed punished, and they perished on account of those
          that are saved, until they turn to the Lord. "But the angels," he
          says, "that kept not their own pre-eminence," that, namely, which they
          received through advancement, "but left their own habitation,"
          meaning, that is, the heaven and the stars, became, and are called
          apostates. "He hath reserved these to the judgment of the great day,
          in chains, under darkness." He means the place near the earth, that
          is, the dark air. Now he called "chains" the loss of the honour in
          which they had stood, and the lust of feeble things; since, bound by
          their own lust, they cannot be converted. "As Sodom and Gomorrha," he
          says. ... By which the Lord signifies that pardon had been granted;
          and that on being disciplined they had repented. "Similarly to the
          same," he says, "also those dreamers," -- that is, who dream in their
          imagination lusts and wicked desires, regarding as good not that which
          is truly good, and superior to all good, -- "defile the flesh, despise
          dominion, and speak evil of majesty," that is, the only Lord, who is
          truly our Lord, Jesus Christ, and alone worthy of praise. They "speak
          evil of majesty," that is, of the angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When Michael, the archangel, disputing with the devil, debated about
          the body of Moses." Here he confirms the assumption of Moses. He is
          here called Michael, who through an angel near to us debated with the
          devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But these," he says, "speak evil of those things which they know not;
          but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in these things they
          corrupt themselves." He means that they eat, and drink, and indulge in
          uncleanness, and says that they do other things that are common to
          them with animals, devoid of reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Woe unto them!" he says, "for they have gone in the way of Cain." For
          so also we lie under Adam's sin through similarity of sin. "Clouds,"
          he says, "without water; who do not possess in themselves the divine
          and fruitful word." Wherefore, he says, "men of this kind are carried
          about both by winds and violent blasts." "Trees," he says, "of autumn,
          without fruit," -- unbelievers, that is, who bear no fruit of
          fidelity. "Twice dead," he says: once, namely, when they sinned by
          transgressing, and a second time when delivered up to punishment,
          according to the predestined judgments of God; inasmuch as it is to be
          reckoned death, even when each one does not forthwith deserve the
          inheritance. "Waves," he says, "of a raging sea." By these words he
          signifies the life of the Gentiles, whose end is abominable ambition.
          "Wandering stars," -- that is, he means those who err and are
          apostates are of that kind of stars which fell from the seats of the
          angels -- "to whom," for their apostasy, "the blackness of darkness is
          reserved for ever. Enoch also, the seventh from Adam," he says,
          "prophesied of these." In these words he verities the prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Those," he says, "separating" the faithful from the unfaithful, be
          convicted according to their own unbelief. And again those separating
          from the flesh. He says, "Animal not having the spirit;" that is, the
          spirit which is by faith, which supervenes through the practice of
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But ye, beloved," he says, "building up yourselves on your most holy
          faith, in the Holy Spirit." "But some," he says, "save, plucking them
          from the fire;" "but of some have compassion in fear," that is, teach
          those who fall into the fire to free themselves. "Hating," he says,
          "that spotted garment, which is carnal:" that of the soul, namely; the
          spotted garment is a spirit polluternal lusts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now to Him," he says, "who is able to keep you without stumbling, and
          present you faultless before the presence of His glory in joy." In the
          presence of His glory: he means in the presence of the angels, to be
          presented faultless, having become angels. When Daniel speaks of the
          people and comes into the presence of the Lord, he does not say this,
          because he saw God: for it is impossible that any one whose heart is
          not pure should see God; but he says this, that everything that the
          people did was in the sight of God, and was manifest to Him; that is,
          that nothing is hid from the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in the Gospel according to Mark, the Lord being interrogated by
          the chief of the priests if He was the Christ, the Son of the blessed
          God, answering, said, "I am; and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
          at the right hand of power." But powers mean the holy angels. Further,
          when He says "at the right hand of God," He means the self-same
          [beings], by reason of the equality and likeness of the angelic and
          holy powers, which are called by the name of God. He says, therefore,
          that He sits at the right hand; that is, that He rests in pre-eminent
          honour. In the other Gospels, however, He is said not to have replied
          to the high priest, on his asking if He was the Son of God. But what
          said He? "You say." Answering sufficiently well. For had He said, It
          is as you understand, he would have said what was not true, not
          confessing Himself to be the Son of God; [for] they did not entertain
          this opinion of Him; but by saying "You say," He spake truly. For what
          they had no knowledge of, but expressed in words, that he confessed to
          be true.
        </p>
        <p>III. -- Comments on the First Epistle of John.</p>
        <p>
          Chap. i.1. "That which was from the beginning; which we have seen with
          our eyes; which we have heard."
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the Gospel according to John, and in accordance with it,
          this Epistle also contains the spiritual principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          What therefore he says, "from the beginning," the Presbyter explained
          to this effect, that the beginning of generation is not separated from
          the beginning of the Creator. For when he says, "That which was from
          the beginning," he touches upon the generation without beginning of
          the Son, who is co-existent with the Father. There was; then, a Word
          importing an unbeginning eternity; as also the Word itself, that is,
          the Son of God, who being, by equality of substance, one with the
          Father, is eternal and uncreate. That He was always the Word, is
          signified by saying, "In the beginning was the Word." But by the
          expression, "we have seen with our eyes," he signifies the Lord's
          presence in the flesh, "and our hands have handled," he says, "of the
          Word of life." He means not only His flesh, but the virtues of the
          Son, like the sunbeam which penetrates to the lowest places, -- this
          sunbeam coming in the flesh became palpable to the disciples. It is
          accordingly related in traditions, that John, touching the outward
          body itself, sent his hand deep down into it, and that the solidity of
          the flesh offered no obstacle, but gave way to the hand of the
          disciple.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And our hands have handled of the Word of life;" that is, He who came
          in the flesh became capable of being touched. As also,
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.2. "The life was manifested." For in the Gospel he thus speaks:
          "And what was made, in Him was life, and the life was the light of
          men."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And we show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father,
          and was manifested unto you."
        </p>
        <p>
          He signifies by the appellation of Father, that the Son also existed
          always, without beginning.
        </p>
        <p>Ver.5. "For God," he says, "is light."</p>
        <p>
          He does not express the divine essence, but wishing to declare the
          majesty of God, he has applied to the Divinity what is best and most
          excellent in the view of men. Thus also Paul, when he speaks of "light
          inaccessible." But John himself also in this same Epistle says, "God
          is love:" pointing out the excellences of God, that He is kind and
          merciful; and because He is light, makes men righteous, according to
          the advancement of the soul, through charity. God, then, who is
          ineffable in respect of His substance, is light.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And in Him is no darkness at all," -- that is, no passion, no keeping
          up of evil respecting any one, [He] destroys no one, but gives
          salvation to all. Light moreover signifies, either the precepts of the
          Law, or faith, or doctrine. Darkness is the opposite of these things.
          Not as if there were another way; since there is only one way
          according to the divine precepts. For the work of God is unity.
          Duality and all else that exists, except unity, arises from perversity
          of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.7. "And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son," he says, "cleanses
          us." For the doctrine of the Lord, which is very powerful, is called
          His blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.10. "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and
          His word is not in us." His doctrine, that is, or word is truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. ii.1. "And if any man sin," he says, "we have an advocate with
          the Father, Jesus Christ." For so the Lord is an advocate with the
          Father for us. So also is there, an advocate, whom, after His
          assumption, He vouchsafed to send. For these primitive and
          first-created virtues are unchangeable as to substance, and along with
          subordinate angels and archangels, whose names they share, effect
          divine operations. Thus also Moses names the virtue of the angel
          Michael, by an angel near to himself and of lowest grade. The like
          also we find in the holy prophets; but to Moses an angel appeared near
          and at hand. Moses heard him and spoke to him manifestly, face to
          face. On the other prophets, through the agency of angels, an
          impression was made, as of beings hearing and seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this account also, they alone heard, and they alone saw; as also is
          seen in the case of Samuel. ElisÃ¦us also alone heard the voice by
          which he was called. If the voice had been open and common, it would
          have been heard by all. In this instance it was heard by him alone in
          whom the impression made by the angel worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.2. "And not only for our sins," -- that is for those of the
          faithful, -- is the Lord the propitiator, does he say, "but also for
          the whole world." He, indeed, saves all; but some [He saves],
          converting them by punishments; others, however, who follow
          voluntarily [He saves] with dignity of honour; so "that every knee
          should bow to Him, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and
          things under the earth;" that is, angels, men, and souls that before
          His advent have departed from this temporal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.3. "And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His
          commandments." For the Gnostic [he who knows] also does the Works
          which pertain to the province of virtue. But he who performs the works
          is not necessarily also a Gnostic. For a man may be a doer of right
          works, and yet not a knower of the mysteries of science. Finally,
          knowing that some works are performed from fear of punishment, and
          some on account of the promise of reward, he shows the perfection of
          the man gifted with knowledge, who fulfils his works by love. Further,
          he adds, and says: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.5. "But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God
          perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him," -- by faith and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.7. "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment,
          which ye had from the beginning," -- through the Law, that is, and the
          prophets; where it is said, God is one. Accordingly, also, he infers,
          "For the old commandment is the word which ye have heard."
        </p>
        <p>Again, however, he says: --</p>
        <p>
          Ver.8. "This is the commandment; for the darkness" of perversion, that
          is, "has passed away, and, lo, the true light hath already shone," --
          that is, through faith, through knowledge, through the Covenant
          working in men, through prepared judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.9. "He that saith he is in the light," -- in the light, he means
          in the truth, -- "and hateth," he says, "his brother." By his brother,
          he means not only his neighbour, but also the Lord. For unbelievers
          hate Him and do not keep His commandments. Therefore also he infers:
          --
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.10. "He that loveth his brother abideth in the light; and there is
          none occasion of stumbling in him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Vers.12-14. He then indicates the stages of advancement and progress
          of souls that are still located in the flesh; and calls those whose
          sins have been forgiven, for the Lord's name's sake, "little
          children," for many believe on account of the name only. He styles
          "fathers" the perfect, "who have known what was from the beginning,"
          and received with understanding, -- the Son, that is, of whom he said
          above, "that which was from the beginning."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I write," says he, "to you, young men, because ye have overcome the
          wicked one." Young man strong in despising pleasures. "The wicked one"
          points out the eminence of the devil. "The children," moreover, know
          the Father; having fled from idols and gathered together to the one
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.15. "For the world," he says, "is in the wicked one." Is not the
          world, and all that is in the world, called God's creation and very
          good? Yes. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.16. "The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the ambition
          of the world," which arise from the perversion of life, "are not of
          the Father, but of the world," and of you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.17. "Therefore also the world shall pass away, and the lust
          thereof; but he that doeth the will of God" and His commandments
          "abideth for ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.19. "They went out from us; but they were not of us" -- neither
          the apostate angels, nor men falling away; -- "but that they may be
          manifested that they are not of us." With sufficient clearness he
          distinguishes the class of the elect and that of the lost, and that
          which remaining in faith "has an unction from the Holy One," which
          comes through faith. He that abideth not in faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.22. "A liar" and "an antichrist, who denieth that Jesus is the
          Christ." For Jesus, Saviour and Redeemer, is also Christ the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.23. "He who denies the Son," by ignoring Him, "has not the Father,
          nor does he know Him." But he who knoweth the Son and the Father,
          knows according to knowledge, and when the Lord shall be manifested at
          His second advent, shall have confidence and not be confounded. Which
          confusion is heavy punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.29. "Every one," he says, "who doeth righteousness is born of
          God;" being regenerated, that is, according to faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. iii.1. "For the world knoweth us not, as it knew Him not." He
          means by the world those who live a worldly life in pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.2. "Beloved," says he, "now are we the sons of God," not by
          natural affection, but because we have God as our Father. For it is
          the greater love that, seeing we have no relationship to God, He
          nevertheless loves us and calls us His sons. "And it hath not yet
          appeared what we shall be;" that is, to what kind of glory we shall
          attain. "For if He shall be manifested," -- that is, if we are made
          perfect, -- "we shall be like Him," as reposing and justified, pure in
          virtue, "so that we may see Him" (His countenance) "as He is," by
          comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.8. "He that doeth unrighteousness is of the devil," that is, of
          the devil as his father, following and choosing the same things. "The
          devil sinneth from the beginning," he says. From the beginning from
          which he began to sin, incorrigibly persevering in sinning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.9. He says, "Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for His
          seed remaineth in him;" that is, His word in him who is born again
          through faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.10. "Thus we know the children of God, as likewise the children of
          the devil," who choose things like the devil; for so also they are
          said to be of the wicked one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.15. "Every one who hateth his brother is a murderer." For in him
          through unbelief Christ dies. Rightly, therefore, he continues, "And
          ye know that no murderer and unbeliever hath eternal life abiding in
          him." For the living Christ abides in the believing soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.16. "For He Himself laid down His life for us;" that is, for those
          who believe; that is, for the apostles. If then He laid down His life
          for the apostles, he means His apostles themselves: us if he said, We,
          I say, the apostles, for whom He laid down His life, "ought to lay
          down our lives for the brethren;" for the salvation of their
          neighbours was the glory of the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.20. He says, "For God is greater than our heart;" that is, the
          virtue of God [is greater] than conscience, which will follow the
          soul. Wherefore he continues, and says, "and knoweth all things."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.21. "Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, it will have confidence
          before God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.24. "And hereby we know that He dwelleth in us by His Spirit,
          which He hath given us;" that is, by superintendence and foresight of
          future events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. iv.18. He says, "Perfect love casteth out fear." For the
          perfection of a believing man is love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. v.6. He says, "This is He who came by water and blood;" and
          again, --
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.8. "For there are three that bear witness, the spirit," which is
          life, "and the water," which is regeneration and faith, "and the
          blood," which is knowledge; "and these three are one." For in the
          Saviour are those saving virtues, and life itself exists in His own
          Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.14. "And this is the confidence which we have towards Him, that if
          we ask anything according to His will, He will hear us." He does not
          say absolutely what we shall ask, but what we ought to ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.19. "And the whole word lieth in the wicked one;" not the
          creation, but worldly men, and those who live according to their
          lusts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.20. "And the Son of God hath come and given us understanding,"
          which comes to us, that is, by faith, and is also called the Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>IV. -- Comments on the Second Epistle of John.</p>
        <p>
          The second Epistle of John, which is written to Virgins, is very
          simple. It was written to a Babylonian lady, by name Electa, and
          indicates the election of the holy Church. He establishes in this
          Epistle that the following out of the faith is not without charity,
          and so that no one divide Jesus Christ; but only to believe that Jesus
          Christ has come in the flesh. For he who has the Son by apprehension
          in his intellect knows also the Father, and grasps with his mind
          intelligibly the greatness of His power working without beginning of
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ver.10. He says, "If any come unto you and bring not this doctrine,
          receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed; for he
          that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds." He forbids
          us to salute such, and to receive them to our hospitality. For this is
          not harsh in the case of a man of this sort. But he admonishes them
          neither to confer nor dispute with such as are not able to handle
          divine things with intelligence, lest through them they be seduced
          from the doctrine of truth, influenced by plausible reasons. Now, I
          think that we are not even to pray with such, because in the prayer
          which is made at home, after rising from prayer, the salutation of joy
          is also the token of peace.
        </p>
        <p>II. -- Nicetas Bishop of Heraclea.</p>
        <p>From His Catena.</p>
        <p>I. -- Job i.21.</p>
        <p>
          But Job's words may be more elegantly understood of evil and sin thus:
          "Naked" was formed from the earth at the beginning, as if from a
          "mother's womb: naked to the earth shall I also depart;" naked, not of
          possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing, but of evil and
          sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have led bad
          lives. Obviously, all of us human beings are born naked, and again are
          buried naked, swathed only in grave-clothes. For God hath provided for
          us another life, and made the present life the way for the course
          which leads to it; appointing the supplies derived from what we
          possess merely as provisions for the way; and on our quitting this
          way, the wealth, consisting of the things which we possessed, journeys
          no farther with us. For not a single thing that we possess is properly
          our own: of one possession alone, that is godliness, are we properly
          owners. Of this, death, when it overtakes us, will not rob us; but
          from all else it will eject us, though against our will. For it is for
          the support of life that we all have received what we possess; and
          after enjoying merely the use of it, each one departs, obtaining from
          life a brief remembrance. For this is the end of all prosperity; this
          is the conclusion of the good things of this life. Well, then, does
          the infant, on opening its eyes, after issuing from the womb,
          immediately begin with crying, not with laughter. For it weeps, as if
          bewailing life, at whose hands from the outset it tastes of deadly
          gifts. For immediately on being born its hands and feet are swaddled;
          and swathed in bonds it takes the breast. O introduction to life,
          precursor of death! The child has but just entered on life, and
          straightway there is put upon it the raiment of the dead: for nature
          reminds those that are born of their end. Wherefore also the child, on
          being born, wails, as if crying plaintively to its mother. Why, O
          mother, didst thou bring me forth to this life, in which prolongation
          of life is progress to death? Why hast thou brought me into this
          troubled world, in which, on being born, swaddling bands are my first
          experience? Why hast thou delivered me to such a life as this, in
          which both a pitiable youth wastes away before old age, and old age is
          shunned as under the doom of death? Dreadful, O mother, is the course
          of life, which has death as the goal of the runner. Bitter is the road
          of life we travel, with the grave as the wayfarer's inn. Perilous the
          sea of life we sail; for it has Hades as a pirate to attack us. Man
          alone is born in all respects naked, without a weapon or clothing born
          with him; not as being inferior to the other animals, but that
          nakedness and your bringing nothing with you may produce thought; and
          that thought may bring out dexterity, expel sloth, introduce the arts
          for the supply of our needs, and beget variety of contrivances. For,
          naked, man is full of contrivances, being pricked on by his necessity,
          as by a goad, how to escape rains, how to elude cold, how to fence off
          blows, how to till the earth, how to terrify wild beasts, how to
          subdue the more powerful of them. Wetted with rain, he contrived a
          roof; having suffered from cold, he invented clothing; being struck,
          he constructed a breastplate; bleeding his hands with the thorns in
          tilling the ground, he availed himself of the help of tools; in his
          naked state liable to become a prey to wild beasts, he discovered from
          his fear an art which frightened what frightened him. Nakedness begat
          one accomplishment after another; so that even his nakedness was a
          gift and a master-favour. Accordingly, Job also being made naked of
          wealth, possessions, of the blessing of children, of a numerous
          offspring, and having lost everything in a short time, uttered this
          grateful exclamation: "Naked came I out of the womb, naked also shall
          I depart thither;" -- to God, that is, and to that blessed lot and
          rest.
        </p>
        <p>II. -- From the Same.</p>
        <p>
          Job v.7. Calmness is a thing which, of all other things, is most to be
          prized. As an example of this, the word proposes to us the blessed
          Job. For it is said of him, "What man is like Job, who drinketh up
          scorning like water?" For truly enviable, and, in my judgment, worthy
          of all admiration, a man is, if he has attained to such a degree of
          long-suffering as to be able with ease to grapple with the pain, truly
          keen, and not easily conquered by everybody, which arises from being
          wronged.
        </p>
        <p>III. -- From Nicetas' Catena on Matthew.</p>
        <p>
          Matt. v.42. Alms are to be given, but with judgment, and to the
          deserving, that we may obtain a recompense from the Most High. But woe
          to those who have and who take under false pretences, or who are able
          to help themselves and want to take from others. For he who has, and,
          to carry out false pretences or out of laziness, takes, shall be
          condemned.
        </p>
        <p>IV. -- From the Same.</p>
        <p>
          Matt. xiii.31. The word which proclaims the kingdom of heaven is sharp
          and pungent as mustard, and represses bile, that is, anger, and checks
          inflammation, that is, pride; and from this word the soul's true
          health and eternal soundness flow. To such increased size did the
          growth of the word come, that the tree which sprang from it (that is
          the Church of Christ established over the whole earth) filled the
          world, so that the fowls of the air -- that is, divine angels and
          lofty souls -- dwelt in its branches.
        </p>
        <p>V. -- From the Same.</p>
        <p>
          Matt. xiii.46. A pearl, and that pellucid and of purest ray, is Jesus,
          whom of the lightning flash of Divinity the Virgin bore. For as the
          pearl, produced in flesh and the oyster-shell and moisture, appears to
          be a body moist and transparent, full of light and spirit; so also God
          the Word, incarnate, is intellectual light, sending His rays, through
          a body luminous and moist.
        </p>
        <p>III. -- From the Catena on Luke, Edited by Corderius.</p>
        <p>
          Luke iii.22. God here assumed the "likeness" not of a man, but "of a
          dove," because He wished, by a new apparition of the Spirit in the
          likeness of a dove, to declare His simplicity and majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke xvi.17. Perhaps by the iota and tittle His righteousness cries,
          "If ye come right unto Me, I will also come right to you; but if
          crooked, I also will come crooked, saith the Lord of hosts;"
          intimating that the ways of sinners are intricate and crooked. For the
          way right and agreeable to nature which is intimated by the iota of
          Jesus, is His goodness, which constantly directs those who believe
          from hearing. "There shall not, therefore, pass from the law one iota
          or one tittle," neither from the right and good the mutual promises,
          nor from the crooked and unjust the punishment assigned to them. "For
          the Lord doeth good to the good, but those who turn aside into crooked

        <p>IV. -- From the Books of the Hypotyposes.</p>
        <p>OEcumenius from Book III. On 1 Cor. xi.10.</p>
        <p>
          "Because of the angels." By the angels he means righteous and virtuous
          men. Let her be veiled then, that she may not lead them to stumble
          into fornication. For the real angels in heaven see her though veiled.
        </p>
        <p>The Same, Book IV. On 2 Cor. v.16.</p>
        <p>
          "And if we have known Christ after the flesh." As "after the flesh" in
          our case is being in the midst of sins, and being out of them is "not
          after the flesh;" so also "after the flesh" in the case of Christ was
          His subjection to natural affections, and His not being subject to
          them is to be "not after the flesh." But, he says, as He was released,
          so also are we.
        </p>
        <p>The Same, Book IV. On 2 Cor. vi.11.</p>
        <p>
          "Our heart is enlarged," to teach you all things. But ye are
          straitened in your own bowels, that is, in love to God, in which ye
          ought to love me.
        </p>
        <p>The Same, Book V. On Gal. v.24.</p>
        <p>
          "And they that are Christ's [have crucified] the flesh." And why
          mention one aspect of virtue after another? For there are some who
          have crucified themselves as far as the passions are concerned, and
          the passions as far as respects themselves. According to this
          interpretation the "and" is not superfluous. "And they that are
          Christ's" -- that is, striving after Him -- "have crucified their own
          flesh."

        <p>
          Yes, truly, the apostles were baptised, as Clement the Stromatist
          relates in the fifth book of the Hypotyposes. For, in explaining the
          apostolic statement, "I thank God that I baptised none of you," he
          says, Christ is said to have baptised Peter alone, and Peter Andrew,
          and Andrew John, and they James and the rest.
        </p>
        <p>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, Book VI. II.1.</p>
        <p>
          Now Clement, writing in the sixth book of the Hypotyposes, makes this
          statement. For he says that Peter and James and John, after the
          Saviour's ascension, though pre-eminently honoured by the Lord, did
          not contend for glory, but made James the Just, bishop of Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, II.15.</p>
        <p>
          So, then, through the visit of the divine word to them, the power of
          Simon was extinguished, and immediately was destroyed along with the
          man himself. And such a ray of godliness shone forth on the minds of
          Peter's hearers, that they were not satisfied with the once hearing or
          with the unwritten teaching of the divine proclamation, but with all
          manner of entreaties importuned Mark, to whom the Gospel is ascribed,
          he being the companion of Peter, that he would leave in writing a
          record of the teaching which had been delivered to them verbally; and
          did not let the man alone till they prevailed upon him; and so to them
          we owe the Scripture called the "Gospel by Mark." On learning what had
          been done, through the revelation of the Spirit, it is said that the
          apostle was delighted with the enthusiasm of the men, and sanctioned
          the composition for reading in the Churches. Clemens gives the
          narrative in the sixth book of the Hypotyposes.
        </p>
        <p>Eusebius: Ibid.</p>
        <p>
          Then, also, as the divine Scripture says, Herod, on the execution of
          James, seeing that what was done pleased the Jews, laid hands also on
          Peter; and having put him in chains, would have presently put him to
          death, had not an angel in a divine vision appeared to him by night,
          and wondrously releasing him from his bonds, sent him away to the
          ministry of preaching.
        </p>
        <p>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, VI.14.</p>
        <p>
          And in the Hypotyposes, in a word, he has made abbreviated narratives
          of the whole testamentary Scripture; and has not passed over the
          disputed books, -- I mean Jude and the rest of the Catholic Epistles
          and Barnabas, and what is called the Revelation of Peter. And he says
          that the Epistle to the Hebrews is Paul's, and was written to the
          Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that Luke, having carefully
          translated it, gave it to the Greeks, and hence the same colouring in
          the expression is discoverable in this Epistle and the Acts; and that
          the name "Paul an Apostle" was very properly not prefixed, for, he
          says, that writing to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced against him and
          suspected, he with great wisdom did not repel them in the beginning by
          putting down his name.

          imparted knowledge (ten gnosin.) These imparted it to the rest of the

          Barnabas was one.

        <p>
          And of this James, Clement also relates an anecdote worthy of
          remembrance in the seventh book of the Hypotyposes, from a tradition
          of his predecessors. He says that the man who brought him to trial, on
          seeing him bear his testimony, was moved, and confessed that he was a
          Christian himself. Accordingly, he says, they were both led away
          together, and on the way the other asked James to forgive him. And he,
          considering a little, said, "Peace be to thee" and kissed him. And so
          both were beheaded together.

        <p>Eusebius: the Same, VI.14.</p>
        <p>
          And now, as the blessed Presbyter used to say, since the Lord, as the
          Apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the Hebrews, Paul, as having been
          sent to the Gentiles, did not subscribe himself apostle of the
          Hebrews, out of modesty and reverence for the Lord, and because, being
          the herald and apostle of the Gentiles, his writing to the Hebrews was
          something over and above [his assigned function.]
        </p>
        <p>Eusebius: the Same.</p>
        <p>
          Again, in the same books Clement has set down a tradition which he had
          received from the elders before him, in regard to the order of the
          Gospels, to the following effect. He says that the Gospels containing
          the genealogies were written first, and that the Gospel according to
          Mark was composed in the following circumstances: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter having preached the word publicly at Rome, and by the Spirit
          proclaimed the Gospel, those who were present, who were numerous,
          entreated Mark, inasmuch as he had attended him from an early period,
          and remembered what had been said, to write down what had been spoken.
          On his composing the Gospel, he handed it to those who had made the
          request to him; which coming to Peter's knowledge, he neither hindered
          nor encouraged. But John, the last of all, seeing that what was
          corporeal was set forth in the Gospels, on the entreaty of his
          intimate friends, and inspired by the Spirit, composed a spiritual
          Gospel.

        <p>
          Being is in God. God is divine being, eternal and without beginning,
          incorporeal and illimitable, and the cause of what exists. Being is
          that which wholly subsists. Nature is the truth of things, or the
          inner reality of them. According to others, it is the production of
          what has come to existence; and according to others, again, it is the
          providence of God, causing the being, and the manner of being, in the
          things which are produced.
        </p>
        <p>S. Maximus: in the Same, p.152.</p>
        <p>
          Willing is a natural power, which desires what is in accordance with
          nature. Willing is a natural appetency, corresponding with the nature
          of the rational creature. Willing is a natural spontaneous movement of
          the self-determining mind, or the mind voluntarily moved about
          anything. Spontaneity is the mind moved naturally, or an intellectual
          self-determining movement of the soul.

          Souls that breathe free of all things, possess life, and though
          separated from the body, and found possessed of a longing for it, are

          Never be afraid of the slanderer who addresses you. But rather say,
          Stop, brother; I daily commit more grievous errors, and how can I
          judge him? For you will gain two things, healing with one plaster both
          yourself and your neighbour. He shows what is really evil. Whence, by
          these arguments, God has contrived to make each one's disposition
          manifest.

        <p>
          Repentance then becomes capable of wiping out every sin, when on the
          occurrence of the soul's fault it admits no delay, and does not let
          the impulse pass on to a long space of time. For it is in this way
          that evil will be unable to leave a trace in us, being plucked away at
          the moment of its assault like a newly planted plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the creatures called crabs are easy to catch, from their going
          sometimes forward and sometimes backward; so also the soul, which at
          one time is laughing, at another weeping, and at another giving way to
          luxury, can do no good.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who is sometimes grieving, and is sometimes enjoying himself and
          laughing, is like a man pelting the dog of voluptuousness with bread,

          wickedness from compulsion, but those that abstain from choice, that
          God crowns. It is impossible for a man to be steadily good except by
          his own choice. For he that is made good by compulsion of another is
          not good; for he is not what he is by his own choice. For it is the
          freedom of each one that makes true goodness and reveals real
          wickedness. Whence through these dispositions God contrived to make
          His own disposition manifest.

        <p>XI. -- Fragments Found in Greek Only in the Oxford Edition.</p>
        <p>
          From the Last Work on the Passover. (Quoted in the Paschal Chronicle.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, in the years gone by, Jesus went to eat the passover
          sacrificed by the Jews, keeping the feast. But when he had preached He
          who was the Passover, the Lamb of God, led as a sheep to the
          slaughter, presently taught His disciples the mystery of the type on
          the thirteenth day, on which also they inquired, "Where wilt Thou that
          we prepare for Thee to eat the passover?" It was on this day, then,
          that both the consecration of the unleavened bread and the preparation
          for the feast took place. Whence John naturally describes the
          disciples as already previously prepared to have their feet washed by
          the Lord. And on the following day our Saviour suffered, He who was
          the Passover, propitiously sacrificed by the Jews.
        </p>
        <p>The Same.</p>
        <p>
          Suitably, therefore, to the fourteenth day, on which He also suffered,
          in the morning, the chief priests and the scribes, who brought Him to
          Pilate, did not enter the PrÃ¦torium, that they might not be defiled,
          but might freely eat the passover in the evening. With this precise
          determination of the days both the whole Scriptures agree, and the
          Gospels harmonize. The resurrection also attests it. He certainly rose
          on the third day, which fell on the first day of the weeks of harvest,
          on which the law prescribed that the priest should offer up the sheaf.

          1. What choral dance and high festival is held in heaven, if there is
          one that has become an exile and a fugitive from the life led under
          the Father, knowing not that those who put themselves far from Him
          shall perish; if he has squandered the gift, and substance, and
          inheritance of the Father; if there is one whose faith has failed, and
          whose hope is spent, by rushing along with the Gentiles into the same
          profligacy of debauchery; and then, famished and destitute, and not
          even filled with what the swine eat, has arisen and come to his
          Father!
        </p>
        <p>
          But the kind Father waits not till the son comes to Him. For perchance
          he would never be able or venture to approach, did he not find Him
          gracious. Wherefore, when he merely wishing, when he straightway made
          a beginning, when he took the first step, while he was yet a great way
          off, He [the Father] was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon
          his neck and kissed him. And then the son, taking courage, confessed
          what he had done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore the Father bestows on him the glory and honour that was due
          and meet, putting on him the best robe, the robe of immortality; and a
          ring, a royal signet and divine seal, -- impress of consecration,
          signature of glory, pledge of testimony (for it is said, "He hath set
          to his seal that God is true,") and shoes, not those perishable ones
          which he hath set his foot on holy ground is bidden take off, nor such
          as he who is sent to preach the kingdom of heaven is forbidden to put
          on, but such as wear not, and are suited for the journey to heaven,
          becoming and adorning the heavenly path, such as unwashed feet never
          put on, but those which are washed by our Teacher and Lord.

          Many, truly, are the shoes of the sinful soul, by which it is bound
          and cramped. For each man is cramped by the cords of his own sins.
          Accordingly, Abraham swears to the king of Sodom, "I will not take of
          all that is thine, from a thread to a shoe-latchet." On account of
          these being defiled and polluted on the earth, every kind of wrong and
          selfishness engrosses life. As the Lord reproves Israel by Amos,
          saying, "For three iniquities of Israel, yea, for four, I will not
          turn him back; because they have given away the righteous for silver,
          and the needy for a pair of shoes, which tread upon the dust of the
          ground."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Now the shoes which the Father bids the servant give to the
          repentant son who has betaken himself to Him, do not impede or drag to
          the earth (for the earthly tabernacle weighs down the anxious mind);
          but they are buoyant, and ascending, and waft to heaven, and serve as
          such a ladder and chariot as he requires who has turned his mind
          towards the Father. For, beautiful after being first beautifully
          adorned with all these things without, he enters into the gladness
          within. For "Bring out" was said by Him who had first said, "While he
          was yet a great way off, he ran and fell upon his neck." For it is
          here that all the preparation for entrance to the marriage to which we
          are invited must be accomplished. He, then, who has been made ready to
          enter will say, "This my joy is fulfilled." But the unlovely and
          unsightly man will hear, "Friend, how camest thou in here, without
          having a wedding garment?" And the fat and unctuous food, -- the
          delicacies abundant and sufficing of the blessed, -- the fatted calf
          is killed; which is also again spoken of as a lamb (not literally);
          that no one may suppose it small; but it is the great and greatest.
          For not small is "the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the
          world," who "was led as a sheep to the slaughter," the sacrifice full
          of marrow, all whose fat, according to the sacred law, was the Lord's.
          For He was wholly devoted and consecrated to the Lord; so well grown,
          and to such excessive size, as to reach and extend over all, and to
          fill those who eat Him and feed upon Him. For He is both flesh and
          bread, and has given Himself as both to us to be eaten.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the sons, then, who come to Him, the Father gives the calf, and it
          is slain and eaten. But those who do not come to Him He pursues and
          disinherits, and is found to be a most powerful bull. Here, by reason
          of His size and prowess, it is said of Him, "His glory is as that of
          an unicorn." And the prophet Habakkuk sees Him bearing horns, and
          celebrates His defensive attitude -- "horns in His hands." Wherefore
          the sign shows His power and authority, -- horns that pierce on both
          sides, or rather, on all sides, and through everything. And those who
          eat are so strengthened, and retain such strength from the life-giving
          food in them, that they themselves are stronger than their enemies,
          and are all but armed with the horns of a bull; as it is said, "In
          thee shall we butt our enemies."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Gladness there is, and music, and dances; although the elder son,
          who had ever been with and ever obedient to the Father, takes it ill,
          when he who never had himself been dissipated or profligate sees the
          guilty one made happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly the Father calls him, saying, "Son, thou art ever with
          me." And what greater joy and feast and festivity can be than being
          continually with God, standing by His side and serving Him? "And all
          that is mine is thine." And blessed is the heir of God, for whom the
          Father holds possession, -- the faithful, to whom the whole world of
          possessions belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was meet that we should be glad, and rejoice; for thy brother was
          dead, and is alive again." Kind Father, who givest all things life,
          and raisest the dead. "And was lost, and is found." And "blessed is
          the man whom Thou hast chosen and accepted," and whom having sought,
          Thou dost find. "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven,
          whose sins are covered." It is for man to repent of sins; but let this
          be accompanied with a change that will not be checked. For he who does
          not act so shall be put to shame, because he has acted not with his
          whole heart, but in haste.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is ours to flee to God. And let us endeavour after this
          ceaselessly and energetically. For He says, "Come unto Me, all ye that
          labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." And prayer and
          confession with humility are voluntary acts. Wherefore it is enjoined,
          "First tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified." What afterwards
          we shall obtain, and what we shall be, it is not for us to judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Such is the strict meaning of the parable. The repentant son came
          to the pitying Father, never hoping for these things, -- the best
          robe, and the ring, and the shoes, -- or to taste the fatted calf, or
          to share in gladness, or enjoy music and dances; but he would have
          been contented with obtaining what in his own estimation he deemed
          himself worth. "Make me," he had made up his mind to say, "as one of
          thy hired servants." But when he saw the Father's welcome meeting him,
          he did not say this, but said what he had in his mind to say first,
          "Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before thee." And so both
          his humility and his accusation became the cause of justification and
          glory. For the righteous man condemns himself in his first words. So
          also the publican departed justified rather than the Pharisee. The
          son, then, knew not either what he was to obtain, or how to take or
          use or put on himself the things given him; since he did not take the
          robe himself, and put it on. But it is said, "Put it on him." He did
          not himself put the ring on his finger, but those who were bidden "Put
          a ring on his hand." Nor did he put the shoes on himself, but it was
          they who heard, "and shoes on his feet."
        </p>
        <p>
          And these things were perhaps incredible to him and to others, and
          unexpected before they took place; but gladly received and praised
          were the gifts with which he was presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The parable exhibits this thought, that the exercise of the faculty
          of reason has been accorded to each man. Wherefore the prodigal is
          introduced, demanding from his father his portion, that is, of the
          state of mind, endowed by reason. For the possession of reason is
          granted to all, in order to the pursuit of what is good, and the
          avoidance of what is bad. But many who are furnished by God with this
          make a bad use of the knowledge that has been given them, and land in
          the profligacy of evil practices, and wickedly waste the substance of
          reason, -- the eye on disgraceful sights, the tongue on blasphemous
          words, the smell on foetid licentious excesses of pleasures, the mouth
          on swinish gluttony, the hands on thefts, the feet on running into
          plots, the thoughts on impious counsels, the inclinations on
          indulgence on the love of ease, the mind on brutish pastime. They
          preserve nothing of the substance of reason unsquandered. Such an one,
          therefore, Christ represents in the parable, -- as a rational
          creature, with his reason darkened, and asking from the Divine Being
          what is suitable to reason; then as obtaining from God, and making a
          wicked use of what had been given, and especially of the benefits of
          baptism, which had been vouchsafed to him; whence also He calls him a
          prodigal; and then, after the dissipation of what had been given him,
          and again his restoration by repentance, [He represents] the love of
          God shown to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. For He says, "Bring hither the fatted calf, kill it, and let us eat
          and be merry; for this my son" -- a name of nearest relationship, and
          significative of what is given to the faithful -- "was dead and lost,"
          -- an expression of extremest alienation; for what is more alien to
          the living than the lost and dead? For neither can be possessed any
          more. But having from the nearest relationship fallen to extremest
          alienation, again by repentance he returned to near relationship. For
          it is said, "Put on him the best robe," which was his the moment he
          obtained baptism. I mean the glory of baptism, the remission of sins,
          and the communication of the other blessings, which he obtained
          immediately he had touched the font.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And put a ring on his hand." Here is the mystery of the Trinity;
          which is the seal impressed on those who believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And put shoes on his feet," for "the preparation of the Gospel of
          peace," and the whole course that leads to good actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But whom Christ finds lost, after sin committed since baptism,
          those Novatus, enemy of God, resigns to destruction. Do not let us
          then reckon any fault if we repent; guarding against falling, let us,
          if we have fallen, retrace our steps. And while dreading to offend,
          let us, after offending, avoid despair, and be eager to be confirmed;
          and on sinking, let us haste to rise up again. Let us obey the Lord,
          who calls to us, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and I will give
          you rest." Let us employ the gift of reason for actions of prudence.
          Let us learn now abstinence from what is wicked, that we may not be
          forced to learn in the future. Let us employ life as a training school
          for what is good; and let us be roused to the hatred of sin. Let us
          bear about a deep love for the Creator; let us cleave to Him with our
          whole heart; let us not wickedly waste the substance of reason, like
          the prodigal. Let us obtain the joy laid up, in which Paul exulting,
          exclaimed, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" To Him
          belongs glory and honour, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world
          without end. Amen.

          Therefore God does not here take the semblance of man, but of a dove,
          because He wished to show the simplicity and gentleness of the new
          manifestation of the Spirit by the likeness of the dove. For the law
          was stern, and punished with the sword; but grace is joyous, and
          trains by the word of meekness. Hence the Lord also says to the
          apostles, who said that He should punish with fire those who would not
          receive Him, after the manner of Elias: "Ye know not what manner of
          spirit ye are of."

        <p>
          Possibly by the "iota and the tittle" His righteousness exclaims, "If
          ye come right to me, I also will come right to you; if ye walk
          crooked, I also will walk crooked, saith the Lord of hosts," alluding
          to the offences of sinners under the name of crooked ways. For the
          straight way, and that according to nature, which is pointed out by
          the iota of Jesus, is His goodness, which is immoveable towards those
          who have obediently believed. There shall not then pass away from the
          law neither the iota nor the tittle; that is, neither the promise that
          applies to the straight in the way, nor the punishment threatened
          against those that diverge. For the Lord is good to the straight in
          the way; but "those that turn aside after their crooked ways He shall
          lead forth with those that work iniquity." "And with the innocent He
          is innocent, and with the froward He is froward;" and to the crooked
          He sends crooked ways.

          His own luminous image God impressed as with a seal, even the
          greatest, -- on man made in His likeness, that he might be ruler and
          lord over all things, and that all things might serve him. Wherefore
          God judges man to be wholly His, and His own image. He is invisible;
          but His image, man, is visible. Whatever one, then, does to man,
          whether good or bad, is referred to Himself. Wherefore from Him
          judgment shall proceed, appointing to all according to desert; for He
          will avenge His own image.

          As it is possible even now for man to form men, according to the
          original formation of Adam, He no longer now creates, on account of
          His having granted once for all to man the power of generating men,
          saying to our nature, "Increase, and multiply, and replenish the
          earth." So also, by His omnipotent and omniscient power, He arranged
          that the dissolution and death of our bodies should be effected by a
          natural sequence and order, through the change of their elements, in
          accordance with His divine knowledge and comprehension.

          Solomon the son of David, in the books styled "The Reigns of the
          Kings," comprehending not only that the structure of the true temple
          was celestial and spiritual, but had also a reference to the flesh,
          which He who was both the son and Lord of David was to build up, both
          for His own presence, where, as a living image, He resolved to make
          His shrine, and for the church that was to rise up through the union
          of faith, says expressly, "Will God in very deed dwell with men on the
          earth?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He dwells on the earth clothed in flesh, and His abode with men is
          effected by the conjunction and harmony which obtains among the
          righteous, and which build and rear a new temple. For the righteous
          are the earth, being still encompassed with the earth; and earth, too,
          in comparison with the greatness of the Lord. Thus also the blessed
          Peter hesitates not to say, "Ye also, as living stones, are built up,
          a spiritual house, a holy temple, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
          acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."

          Jews therefore said, In forty-six years was this temple built, and
          wilt thou raise it up in three days? But He spake of the temple of His
          body."

          What is God? "God," as the Lord saith, "is a Spirit." Now spirit is

          not according to breadth, length, and depth. And that is

          And so far, he says, no one any longer lives after the flesh. For that
          is not life, but death. For Christ also, that He might show this,
          ceased to live after the flesh. How? Not by putting off the body! Far
          be it! For with it as His own He shall come, the Judge of all. But by
          divesting Himself of physical affections, such as hunger, and thirst,
          and sleep, and weariness. For now He has a body incapable of suffering
          and of injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          As "after the flesh" in our case is being in the midst of sins, and
          being out of them is to be "not after the flesh;" so also after the
          flesh, in the case of Christ, was His subjection to natural
          affections, and not to be subject to them was not to be "after the
          flesh." "But," he says, "as He was released, so also are we." Let
          there be no longer, he says, subjection to the influences of the
          flesh. Thus Clement, the fourth book of the Hypotyposes.

        <p>14. From the Same, p.391.</p>
        <p>On 2 Cor. vi.11. "Our heart is enlarged."</p>
        <p>
          For as heat is wont to expand, so also love. For love is a thing of
          warmth. As if he would say, I love you not only with mouth, but with
          heart, and have you all within. Wherefore he says: "ye are not
          straitened in us, since desire itself expands the soul." "Our heart is
          enlarged" to teach you all things; "but ye are straitened in your own
          bowels," that is, in love to God, in which you ought to love me.
        </p>
        <p>Thus Clement, in the fourth book of the Hypotyposes.</p>
        <p>15. From Vol. III. V.286.</p>
        <p>Heb. i.1. "At sundry times and divers manners."</p>
        <p>
          Since the Lord, being the Apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the
          Hebrews, it was out of modesty that Paul did not subscribe himself
          apostle of the Hebrews, from reverence for the Lord, and because he
          was the herald and apostle of the Gentiles, and wrote the Epistle to
          the Hebrews in addition [to his proper work].
        </p>
        <p>16. From the Same.</p>
        <p>
          The same work contains a passage from The Instructor, book i. chap.
          vi. The passage is that beginning, "For the blood is found to be,"
          down to "potent charms of affection." Portions, however, are omitted.
          There are a good many various readings; but although the passage in
          question, as found in Cramer's work, is printed in full in Migne's
          edition, on the alleged ground of the considerable variation from the
          text of Clement, the variation is not such as to make a translation of
          the passage as found in Cramer of any special interest or value.

          [Le Nourry decides that the Adumbrations were not translated from the
          Hypotyposes, but Kaye (p.473) thinks on insufficient grounds. See,
          also (p.5), Kaye's learned note.]
