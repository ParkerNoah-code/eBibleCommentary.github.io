          Let us further inquire, as if we were in very deed inquisitors of
          divine sentences, whether they be lawfully (thus condemned). Even
          among the nations, do not all the strictest lords and most tenacious
          of discipline interdict their own slaves from marrying out of their
          own house? -- in order, of course, that they may not run into
          lascivious excess, desert their duties, purvey their lords' goods to
          strangers. Yet, further, have not (the nations) decided that such
          women as have, after their lords' formal warning, persisted in
          intercourse with other men's slaves, may be claimed as slaves? Shall
          earthly disciplines be held more strict than heavenly prescripts; so
          that Gentile women, if united to strangers, lose their liberty; ours
          conjoin to themselves the devil's slaves, and continue in their
          (former) position? Forsooth, they will deny that any formal warning
          has been given them by the Lord through His own apostle!

          What am I to fasten on as the cause of this madness, except the
          weakness of faith, ever prone to the concupiscences of worldly joys?
          -- which, indeed, is chiefly found among the wealthier; for the more
          any is rich, and inflated with the name of "matron," the more
          capacious house does she require for her burdens, as it were a field
          wherein ambition may run its course. To such the churches look paltry.
          A rich man is a difficult thing (to find) in the house of God; and if
          such an one is (found there), difficult (is it to find such)
          unmarried. What, then, are they to do? Whence but from the devil are
          they to seek a husband apt for maintaining their sedan, and their
          mules, and their hair-curlers of outlandish stature? A Christian, even
          although rich, would perhaps not afford (all) these. Set before
          yourself, I beg of you, the examples of Gentiles. Most Gentile women,
          noble in extraction and wealthy in property, unite themselves
          indiscriminately with the ignoble and the mean, sought out for
          themselves for luxurious, or mutilated for licentious, purposes. Some
          take up with their own freedmen and slaves, despising public opinion,
          provided they may but have (husbands) from whom to fear no impediment
          to their own liberty. To a Christian believer it is irksome to wed a
          believer inferior to herself in estate, destined as she will be to
          have her wealth augmented in the person of a poor husband! For if it
          is "the poor," not the rich, "whose are the kingdoms of the heavens,"
          the rich will find more in the poor (than she brings him, or than she
          would in the rich). She will be dowered with an ampler dowry from the
          goods of him who is rich in God. Let her be on an equality with him on
          earth, who in the heavens will perhaps not be so. Is there need for
          doubt, and inquiry, and repeated deliberation, whether he whom God has
          entrusted with His own property is fit for dotal endowments? Whence
          are we to find (words) enough fully to tell the happiness of that
          marriage which the Church cements, and the oblation confirms, and the
          benediction signs and seals; (which) angels carry back the news of (to
          heaven), (which) the Father holds for ratified? For even on earth
          children do not rightly and lawfully wed without their fathers'
          consent. What kind of yoke is that of two believers, (partakers) of
          one hope, one desire, one discipline, one and the same service? Both
          (are) brethren, both fellow servants, no difference of spirit or of
          flesh; nay, (they are) truly "two in one flesh." Where the flesh is
          one, one is the spirit too. Together they pray, together prostrate
          themselves, together perform their fasts; mutually teaching, mutually
          exhorting, mutually sustaining. Equally (are they) both (found) in the
          Church of God; equally at the banquet of God; equally in straits, in
          persecutions, in refreshments. Neither hides (ought) from the other;
          neither shuns the other; neither is troublesome to the other. The sick
          is visited, the indigent relieved, with freedom. Alms (are given)
          without (danger of ensuing) torment; sacrifices (attended) without
          scruple; daily diligence (discharged) without impediment: (there is)
          no stealthy signing, no trembling greeting, no mute benediction.
          Between the two echo psalms and hymns; and they mutually challenge
          each other which shall better chant to their Lord. Such things when
          Christ sees and hears, He joys. To these He sends His own peace. Where
          two (are), there withal (is) He Himself. Where He (is), there the Evil
          One is not.

          These are the things which that utterance of the apostle has, beneath
          its brevity, left to be understood by us. These things, if need shall
          be, suggest to your own mind. By these turn yourself away from the
          examples of some. To marry otherwise is, to believers, not "lawful;"
          is not "expedient." <br />
