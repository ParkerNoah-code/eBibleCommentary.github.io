        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.401)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, July the 21st, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord in
          this place; and I knew it not." -- Genesis 28:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          THROUGH his own foolish wisdom Jacob had been compelled to leave his
          father's house. Perhaps we are scarcely able to judge of the sorrowful
          feelings which this banishment would beget in his soul. Here we go
          from one Christian home to another. If we leave the parental roof we
          may hope still to sojourn where there is an altar to the Most High
          God, and where we can still unite with worshippers who fear his name.
          Not so in Jacob's case. The family of which he was a member, was the
          only household in the land that worshipped God; or if there were some
          few others, probably they were unknown to one another, and as far as
          Jacob's knowledge would go, he was fully assured that all the way from
          the place where he left his father until he arrived at Padan-Aram, he
          would not meet with a single person who feared the God of heaven. He
          was passing from one oasis to another across a burning sand. We may
          compare him to a swallow, which for the first time leaves our shore to
          find no rest until it has passed with weary wing the long leagues of
          purple sea. You must know too that the prevalent notion of the
          heathens among whom Jacob dwelt was that their gods had only local
          authority; that for instance, the god of Gaza was not the god of
          Askelon; the god of Beersheba would not be the God of Bethel. Their
          deities were gods of the hills and not of the valleys, and it may be
          but just possible that from great connection with the heathen, Jacob
          may have failed clearly to recognize the fact that his father's God
          was not like their gods; so in leaving his father's house there may
          have been this troublous thought rising in his mind, that he was also
          leaving his father's God; that now his prayers would scarcely be
          heard; that he should be an alien from Jehovah's land, and cut off
          from the congregation of the blessed. Jacob was not at this time a
          full-grown believer, he was but a babe in grace; his ready yielding to
          his mother's craft proves his want of advanced piety; and it is no
          trifling thing for a weakling to be taken from the nurture of home and
          cast alone upon a world unfriendly and ungenial. Happy was it for the
          fugitive that his Lord's compassion tracked his way even when he knew
          not that God was there. Blessed was the dream which assured him that
          Jehovah's wing had covered his stony bed as really as it guarded his
          softer couch in Isaac's tent. The truth seemed to surprise him, but O
          how sweetly it must have yielded consolation! "Surely," said he, and
          he opened his eyes to new light as though he knew that the night of
          distress had passed, and that a day of confidence had begun -- "Surely
          God is in this place, and I knew it not."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would address you this morning upon a topic which may perhaps be as
          useful to us as to Jacob, if God the Holy Ghost shall but enable me to
          preach, and you to hear. Oh thou that art everywhere, be speedily now;
          be thou in this place, and may we know it, and tremble in thy
          presence. I shall speak on three points; first, the omnipresence of
          God -- the doctrine of it; secondly, a recognition of that
          omnipresence, or the spirit which is necessary in order to discover
          the presence of God; and thirdly, the results of a recognition of this
          omnipresence, or the practice which is sure to spring out of the
          conviction that God is everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE DOCTRINE OF GOD'S OMNIPRESENCE. He is everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early Christian Church, there was a wicked heresy, which for a
          long while caused great disturbance, and exceeding much controversy.
          There were some who taught that Satan, the representative of evil, was
          of co-equal power with God, the representative of good. These men
          found it necessary to impugn the doctrine of God's universal power.
          Their doctrine denied the all-pervading presence of God in the present
          world, and they seemed to imagine that we should of necessity have to
          get out of the world of nature altogether, before we could be in the
          presence of God. Their preachers seemed to teach that there was a
          great distance between God and his great universe; they always
          preached of him as the King who dwelt in the land that was very far
          off; nay, they almost seemed to go as far as though they had said,
          "Between us and him there is a great gulf fixed, so that neither can
          our prayers reach him, nor can the thoughts of his mercy come down to
          us." Blessed be God that error has long ago been exploded, and we as
          Christian men, without exception, believe that God is as much in the
          lowest hell as in the highest heaven, and as truly among the sinful
          hosts of mortals, as among the blissful choir of immaculate immortals,
          who day without night praise his name. We believe that he filleth
          heaven and earth, and hell; that he is in the very space which his
          creation seems to claim, for creatures do not displease God; and even
          the space which is occupied by his handiworks is still filled with
          himself. The rocky bowels of the unsearched-out depths are full of
          God; where the sea roars, or where the solid granite leaves no
          interstice or vacuum, even there is God; not only in the open place,
          and in the chasm, but penetrating all matter, and abounding everywhere
          in all, and filling all things with himself. "In him we live and move,
          and have our being, and in him are all things, and by him all things
          consist." Yet, while we receive the doctrine, it is well sometimes to
          enlarge upon it, not so much for sake of argument, as to make the
          truth stand out the more clearly to our minds' eye. Let us remember,
          then, that in the three kingdoms God is everywhere; in the kingdoms of
          nature, of providence, and of grace, we may say of each spot, "Surely
          God is in this place."
        </p>
        <p>
          He is everywhere in the fields of nature. Go if you please to secluded
          parts; walk through the forest-glades where the virgin moss presents a
          delicate carpet for human foot; where the deer starts up affrighted by
          the intrusion of an unexpected visitor; where the wild bird scarcely
          flies from you because as yet it is not familiar with the cruel face
          of man. As you walk among the intertwisted boughs, the natural arches
          of God's own temple which He Himself hath builded, without toil of
          hewer of stone or dauber of clay, if you be a true Christian you will
          be compelled to say --
        </p>
        <p>"The calm retreat, the silent shade,</p>
        <p>With prayer and praise agree;</p>
        <p>And seem by thy sweet bounty made</p>
        <p>For those who follow thee."</p>
        <p>
          You will solemnly exclaim, "Surely God is in this place." Nor will you
          be alone in your thought, for every waving flower-bell will bear
          witness to the fact, and the insect humming in the breeze, and the
          glossy beetle creeping among the sere leaves that lie beneath your
          feet, relics of many a winter's slaughter among the verdant groves,
          and the birds that are warbling among the trees will every one of them
          bear witness that surely God is there. In fact, if there be one spot
          more than another where the consciousness of God's presence will
          strike the heart of the awakened man, it will be where other men are
          not but where he himself is alone the only worshipper of God, save as
          a creation joins his strain. But you must remember too that if you go
          to the haunt of men, where they crowd and congregate together, that
          God is there. Go to one of the abutments of London Bridge and stand a
          moment gazing at the throng as it harries by, thousands and tens of
          thousands in an hour, on, on they sweep -- the riches of Nations
          grinding the roadway, and multitudes of men, women, and children
          wearing away the granite pavement. God is there, though forgotten by
          most of them who are thinking only of the world and of its toils,
          forgetting that there is one above them who looks on all, and one
          within them who inhabiteth all space. Let not you and I forget, but
          let us say, "God is there; in every drop of blood that is circulating
          through the veins of the passengers; in every flush that is on the
          cheek; in every pulse that throbs or breath that heaves." The very
          fact that they are fed and clothed and are in existence will bear you
          witness that surely God is in that place; and thoughts of awe may soon
          come crowding o'er your mind, and you may find yourself as much alone
          with God in crowded Cheapside, or in the thronging Borough or noisy
          Whitechapel, as though you were far away alone on the wild prairie, or
          in some desert of Africa where foot-print of man could not be
          perceived. Verily God is in this place. Then fly with the white sail
          across the deep, and as you skim the foaming billows, if your soul be
          right within you, you will say, "Surely God is in this place." And
          when the storm comes on and the thunder rolls like drums in the march
          of the God of armies, and the skies seem to be wounded with the
          flashing of his glittering spear in the tremendous lightning, you may
          say in the midst of the storm as your bark reels and rocks, and is
          tossed like a sea-bird upon the billow -- "Surely he holdeth the
          waters in the hollow of his hand, and God is here." And when you have
          landed, and calm comes on, and the fair white clouds sail slowly
          through the air, sailing gallantly in the abated breath of the wind,
          when everything comes out all fresh and green from the last shower,
          and there is a clear shining after the rain and the storm, and
          profound peace after the noisy hurricane, you may say then with
          refreshed enjoyment -- "Surely God is in this place." But I need not
          continue in such a strain as this. Ye shall go where ye will; ye shall
          look to the most magnificent of God's works, and ye shall say -- "God
          is here, upon thine awful summit, O hoary Alp! in thy dark bosom, O
          tempest-cloud! and in thy angry breath, O devastating hurricane!" "He
          makes the clouds his chariot and rides upon the wings of the wind."
          God is here. And so in the most minute -- in the blossom of the apple,
          in the bloom of the tiny field-flower, in the sea-shell which has been
          washed up from its mother-deep, in the sparkling of the mineral
          brought up from darkest mines, in the highest star, or in yon comet
          that startles the nations and in its fiery chariot soon drives afar
          from mortal ken, -- great God, thou art here, thou art everywhere.
          From the minute to the magnificent, in the beautiful and in the
          terrible, in the fleeting and in the lasting, thou art here, though
          sometimes we know it not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us enter now the kingdom of Providence, again to rejoice that God
          is there. My brethren, let us walk the centuries, and at one stride of
          thought let us traverse the earliest times when man first came out of
          Eden, driven from it by the fall. Then this earth had no human
          population, and the wild tribes of animals roamed it at their will. We
          know not what this island was then, save that we may suspect it to
          have been covered with dense forests, and perhaps inhabited by
          ferocious beasts; but God was here, as much here as he is to-day; as
          truly was he here then, when no ear heard his foot fall as he walked
          in the cool of the day in this great garden, -- as truly here as when
          to-day the stings of ten thousand rise up to heaven, blessing and
          magnifying his name. And then when our history began -- turn over its
          pages and you will read of cruel invasions and wars which stained the
          soil with blood, and crimsoned it a foot-deep with clotted gore; you
          will read of civil wars and intestine strifes between brother and
          brother, and you will say -- "How is this? How was this permitted?
          "But if you read on and see how by tumult and bloody strife Liberty
          was served, and the best interest of man, you will say, "Verily, God
          was here." History will conduct you to awful battle-fields; she will
          bid you behold the garment rolled in blood; she will cover you with
          the thick darkness of her fire and vapor of smoke; and as you hear the
          clash of arms, and see the bodies of your fellow men, you say, "The
          devil is here;" but truth will say, "No, though evil be here, yet
          surely God was in this place though we knew it not; all this was
          needful after all -- these calamities are but revolutions of the
          mighty wheels of Providence, which are too high to be understood, but
          are as sure in their action as though we could predict their results."
          Turn if you will to what is perhaps a worse feature in history still,
          and more dreary far -- I mean the story of persecutions. Read how the
          men of God were stoned and were sawn asunder; let your imaginations
          revive the burnings of Smithfield, and the old dungeons of the
          Lollards' Tower; think how with fire and sword, and instruments of
          torture, the fiends of hell seemed determined to extirpate the chosen
          seed. But remember as you read the bloodiest tragedy, as your very
          soul grows sick at some awful picture of poor tortured human flesh,
          that verily God was in that place, scattering with rough hands, it may
          be, the eternal seed, bidding persecution be as the blast which
          carries seed away from some fruit-bearing tree that it may take root
          in distant islets which it had never reached unless it had been
          carried on the wings of the storm. Thou art, O God, even where man is
          most in his sin and blasphemy; thou art reigning over rebels
          themselves, and over those who seem to defy and to overturn thy will.
          Remember, always, that in history, however dreadful may seem the
          circumstances of the narrative, surely God is in that place. You may
          say that yon nation depended for its welfare upon a woman's will, or
          that its destiny hinged upon a child's life; that this dynasty rose
          and fell at the will of some far-famed adventurer; that another nation
          was rocked to its very center by the fanaticism of a foolish
          pretender. We will grant you all this, for who denies the second cause
          when he vindicates the first? -- but let me say, more present is God
          than even man himself; more truly is he King, than the kings of the
          earth; more certainly is the Lord a man of war than even warriors
          themselves. In everything in the page of history, from the moment of
          its first unrolling till the last of the seven seals shall be loosed,
          and the book shall be read out before men and angels, you will have to
          say, "God was in it all." But you will please to recollect that while
          this is true of history in the mass, it is also true of it in the
          detail, and with reference to yourself and your own lot -- God is
          there. You had a fire by which you lost your all, but God was there.
          By some fortunate circumstances, as you call it, you rose in life --
          God was there -- but by a reverse, as you name it, you soon fell back
          again -- God was there. There has nothing happened to you but what has
          been under his knowledge, his superintendence, and his ordination. Do
          not, I pray you, forget yourself while you are thinking of nations and
          of kingdoms, for it is as true of a gnat that God supports it in life
          as it is of an angel, and God is as certainly in the creeping of the
          aphis upon a rosebud as in the tumble of an avalanche from the
          mountain. He is in all things. He is in you; he is in your
          circumstances to-day. Take the thought home, and may God grant that it
          may have its due effect upon your minds. In Providence, then, we may
          say, "Surely God is in this place."
        </p>
        <p>
          But we now come to the third great kingdom of which the truth holds
          good in a yet more evident manner -- the kingdom of grace. In yonder
          province of conviction, where hard-hearted ones are weeping
          penitential tears, where proud ones who said they would never have
          this man to reign over them are bowing their knees to kiss the Son
          lest he be angry; where rocky, adamantine consciences, have at last
          begun to feel; where obdurate, determined, incorrigible sinners, have
          at last turned from the error of their ways -- God is there, for were
          he not there, none of these holy feelings would ever have arisen, and
          the cry would never have been heard -- "I will arise and go unto my
          Father." And in yonder province which shines under a brighter sun,
          where penitents with joy look to a bleeding Saviour, where sinners
          leap to lose their chains, and oppressed ones sing because their
          burdens have rolled away; where they who were just now sitting in
          darkness and in the valley of the shadow of death have seen the great
          light -- God is in that place, or faith had never come and hope had
          never arisen. And there in yonder province, brighter still, where
          Christians lay their bodies upon the altar as living sacrifices, where
          men with self-denying zeal think themselves to be nothing and Christ
          to be all in all; where the missionary leaves his kindred that he may
          die among the swarthy heathen; where the young man renounces brilliant
          prospects that he may be the humble servant of Jesus; where yonder
          work-girl toils night and day to earn her bread rather than sell her
          soul; where yonder toiling laborer stands up for the rights of
          conscience against the demands of the mighty; where yonder struggling
          believer still holds to God in all his troubles, saying -- "Though he
          slay me yet will I trust in him" -- God is in that place, and he that
          has eyes to see will soon perceive his presence there. Where the sigh
          is heaving, where the tear is falling, where the song is rising, where
          the desire is mounting, where love is burning, hope anticipating,
          faith abiding, joy o'erflowing, patience suffering, and zeal
          abounding, God is surely present. In the temple of the human heart,
          consecrating it unto himself. In all these three kingdoms then, my
          brethren, let us never forget that "God is in this place."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall turn from this point when I have just made the remark that we
          are still so apt to think that God is not here. You remember that
          splendid picture which God himself gives -- "Heaven is my throne, and
          earth is my footstool." You have seen, perhaps, the drawings of those
          wonderful statues which amid the ruined temples of Egypt, lift their
          heads into the very clouds. They sit upon their awful thrones
          continually, men of common stature reach no higher than the pedestals
          of their feet, while these gigantic ones tower upwards into the very
          sky. Now consider these to be but a minute representation, and let the
          colossal figure of Deity rise before your mind. Heaven is his throne,
          and there he sits; earth is his footstool, and here are his feet;
          while higher than angels fly is the head of the All-glorious One. We
          cannot comprehend the Lord at all, but we may think of him as he
          represents himself to us; he does it, you know, under human
          representations -- let us then get the human representation into our
          mind. He is greater than the greatest thought -- his head higher than
          heaven; his feet lower than the deepest hell; earth his footstool;
          heaven his throne. Do not let us think that he is ever absent here,
          for if his face be seen in heaven, the skirts of his garments are
          trailing over the whole earth. We are never at a distance from him; he
          is here, there, and everywhere; with you and with me, very present at
          every time and in every circumstances. I cannot bring out the truth
          more clearly than that; I therefore leave it to pass on to the second
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. BUT HOW ARE WE TO RECOGNISE THIS PRESENCE OF GOD? "What is the
          Spirit which shall enable us constantly to feel it? The presence of
          electricity is very soon discovered by those bodies which are
          susceptible of its action. The presence, for instance, of iron in a
          vessel is very soon detected and discovered by the magnetic needle.
          There is an affinity between them. That carnal men should not discover
          God here I do not wonder at: that they should even say, "There is no
          God," is no marvel, because there is nothing in their nature akin to
          him, and therefore they do not perceive him. They lack all the
          affinity that can discover his presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To commence, then. If you would feel God's presence, you must have an
          affinity to his nature. Your soul must have the spirit of adoption,
          and it will soon find out its Father. Your spirit must have a desire
          after holiness, and it will soon discover the presence of Him who is
          holiness itself. Your mind must be heavenly, and you will soon detect
          that the God of Heaven is here. The more nearly we become like God,
          the more sure shall we be that God is where we are. To a man who has
          reached the highest stage of sanctification the presence of God
          becomes a more sure fact than the presence of anything else beside. In
          fact, he may even get to such a state that he will look upon the
          fields, streets, inhabitants and events of the world as a dream, a
          passing background, while the only real thing to him will be the
          unseen God which his new nature so clearly manifests to him, that his
          faith becomes the evidence of things not seen, the substance of things
          which sense cannot perceive. Likeness to God is first necessary for
          the clear perception of his presence. Next, there must be a calmness
          of spirit. God was in the place when Jacob came there that night, but
          he did not know it, for he was alarmed about his brother Esau; he was
          troubled, and vexed, and disturbed. He fell asleep, and his dream
          calmed him; he awoke refreshed; the noise of his troubled thoughts was
          gone and heard the voice of God.
        </p>
        <p>"In solemn silence of the mind,</p>
        <p>My heaven and there my God I find."</p>
        <p>
          More quiet we want, more quiet, more calm retirement, before we shall
          well be able, even with spiritual minds, to discover the sensible
          presence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, next Jacob had in addition to this calm of mind -- a
          revelation of Christ. That ladder, as I have said in the exposition,
          was a picture of Christ, the way of access between man and God. You
          will never perceive God in nature, until you have learned to see God
          in grace. We have heard a great deal about going up from nature to
          nature's God. Impossible! A man might as well attempt to go from the
          top of the Alps to heaven. There is still a long gulf between nature
          and God to the natural mind. You must first of all perceive God
          incarnate in the flesh of Christ, before you will perceive God in the
          creation which he has made. We have heard a great deal about men
          worshipping in the forest glades, who never frequent the sanctuary of
          the saints. You have heard much, but there was little truth in it.
          There is often great sound where there is much emptiness, and you will
          frequently find that those men who talk most of this natural worship
          are those who do not worship God at all. God's works are too gross a
          medium to allow the light, and the road to him is a rugged one if we
          go the way of the creatures. But when I see Christ, I see God's new
          and living way, between my soul and my God, most clear and pleasant. I
          come to my God at once, and finding him in Christ, I find him
          everywhere else besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than this, no man will perceive God, wherever he may be, unless
          he knows that God has made a promise to be with him and is able by
          faith to look to the fulfillment of it. In Jacob's case God said, "I
          will be with thee whithersoever thou goest, and I will not leave
          thee." Christian, have you heard the same? Is the twenty-third Psalm
          the song of your faith? "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
          shadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." Have you
          consciously perceived that though men forsook you, God stood with you?
          Could you join the song of one who said,
        </p>
        <p>"When trouble like a gloomy cloud</p>
        <p>Has gathered thick and thunder'd loud,</p>
        <p>He near my side hath always stood,</p>
        <p>His loving-kindness O how good!"</p>
        <p>
          Then to you it will not be difficult to perceive the presence of God.
          You will in fact look upon it as so real that when you open your eyes
          in the morning, you will look for him with praise, and when you close
          them at night, it will only be that you may repose under the shadow of
          his wings. I wish we could get back to the spirit of the old Puritans,
          they believed in a present God always. We speculate about the laws of
          nature, we are always talking about organic matter and so on, but with
          them it was God and God alone. We look to the barometer about the
          rain, and very properly in some sense, they looked to God, and they
          prayed God either to stay the bottles of heaven, or to pour down the
          refreshing floods upon the thirsty earth. We are talking about
          attraction, finding out the laws by which the worlds are governed, the
          Puritans looked to the Lawgiver rather than to the law, and to the
          present power of God manifest in his present hand, rather than to any
          power which some dream may exist in matter itself, or in the laws of
          matter. Oh to feel God everywhere, in the little as well as in the
          great, in our risings up and in our sittings down, in our goings forth
          and in our comings in! I can conceive of no life more blessed, and of
          no Spirit more akin to the spirit of the glorified, than the mind and
          heart of the man who lives in God, and knows and feels that God is
          ever present with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings me, very briefly, to one or two concluding remarks
          upon the PRACTICAL RESULTS OF A FULL RECOGNITION IN THE SOUL OF THIS
          DOCTRINE OF GOD'S OMNIPRESENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first things would be to check our inordinate levity.
          Cheerfulness is a virtue: levity a vice. How much foolish talking, how
          much jesting which is not convenient, would at once end if we said,
          "Surely God is in this place." The next time you have been indulging
          in mirth -- I mean not innocent mirth, but that which is connected
          with uncleanness, or with any sort of ill -- think you see a finger
          lifted up, and you hear a voice saying, "Surely God is in this place."
          Let your recreation be free from sin; let your amusements be such that
          you can enjoy them while God looks on. If, too, we felt that God was
          in this place, how much oftener should we talk of him and of Christ.
          This afternoon what will many of you talk of? Sunday afternoon talk is
          generally a great difficulty to some professors. They do not like to
          go right down into what they think worldly conversation, so they
          generally talk about ministers. They consider that to be a spiritual
          subject; and generally, this talk about ministers is more wicked than
          talk about the devil himself, for I had rather you should speak
          religiously concerning Satan, than irreligiously concerning even the
          angels of the Churches. There is one tale retailed about this minister
          and another tale about the other, and the conversation ministers no
          edification. If they heard an angel say, "God is in this place," the
          afternoon of the day of rest would be spent in much more profitable
          conversation. But suppose that I have some here, to-day, who have been
          lately exposed to personal danger and peril; brethren, do you not
          think if in the midst of the storm, or in time of disease, you had
          heard a voice saying, "Surely God is in this place," you would have
          been perfectly at rest? The noxious air grows pure if he be there. The
          lightning cannot scathe, or if they scathe tis bliss; the storm cannot
          devour, nor can the hungry deep engulf; or, if they do, tis bliss if
          God be there: what need have you at any time to fear? What is your
          nervousness but wickedness, when the Eternal God is your certain
          refuge? A Christian in alarm at in the hand of his God, surely he
          distrusts his Father, and doubts the heart of infinite love! "God is
          in this place though I knew it not." I speak to some, too, who are in
          great poverty. You will go home to-day, and there are bare walls.
          Perhaps the seat you sit upon hath many of the rushes torn away and
          the table will be but very scantily furnished, and very homely at the
          best. "Well," but you will say, "surely God is in this place." What
          comfort for you! You may remember the old Christian's exclamation as
          you sit down for a blessing, "What, all this, and my God present with
          me!" Better this, and feel his presence, than be possessed of the best
          of the world's dainties and not know that he is here. Perhaps you have
          today some sore trouble at home. There is a Christian wife who has to
          go home to an ungodly husband, or sons and daughters who have to go
          home to a household which is anything but what it should be. Do not be
          afraid to go home, and as you cross the threshold, say, "Surely God is
          in this place." I think as John Bunyan passed over the threshold of
          the dungeon of Ledford Jail, if he could have known that he should be
          twelve years there, but that in those twelve years he would write the
          "Pilgrim's Progress," he would have said. "Surely God is in this
          place." And you, if you are called to enter a den such as Bunyan
          called his dungeon, can say, "Surely God is in this place," and you
          make it a palace at once. Some of you, too, are in very deep
          affliction. You are driven to such straits that you do not know where
          things will end, and you are in great despondency to-day. Surely God
          is in that place. As certain as there was one like unto the Son of God
          in the midst of the fiery furnace with Shadrach, Meshach, and
          Abednego, so surely on the glowing coals of your affliction the
          heavenly foot-prints may be seen, for surely God is in this place. You
          are called to-day to some extraordinary duty, and you do not feel
          strong enough for it. Go to it, for "Surely God is in this place." You
          have to address an assembly this afternoon for the first time. Surely
          God is in that place. He will help you. The arm will not be far off on
          which you have to lean, the divine strength not be remote to which you
          have to look. "Surely God is in this place."
        </p>
        <p>
          But were I to multiply pictures, I might not describe the condition of
          one-tenth of my hearers. Let me rather leave it to you or to the
          blessed Spirit of God to make an application to your own lot, and you
          shall find this to be a very well of comfort springing up with clear
          transparent water of life, "Surely God is in this place."
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, if we always remembered that God was where we are, what
          reverence would it inspire when we are in his house, in the place
          particularly and specially set apart for his service! I do not think
          we always feel in the assembly of the saints as we should do. It is
          not the place that is holy; -- holiness cannot attach itself to
          anything but moral virtues and to intelligent beings. There cannot be
          holy bricks and holy stones, -- the thing is absolutely impossible;
          but where two or three are met together in Christ's name, there is He
          in the midst of them. He is here, and yet how many come out of form
          and fashion. Some few think rather more of the dress they come in than
          they do of what they shall hear, or of what Spirit they shall come in.
          Oh! be dressed, stay not for another pin, but stay for another prayer
          it thou wilt, that thy soul may be dressed, for often thou comest with
          thy body decked out, but with thy soul naked before God for want of
          preparation in coming up to his house. And when we sit here, what
          thoughts come in! What buyers and sellers transact business here! How
          have some of you been looking to the cares of housewives, and some of
          you been busy with your shops! At home you do not take the shutters
          down on the Sunday, but you keep them up; I wish you would keep them
          up in your souls. You do not go into the field and look after the
          crops, but some men bring the crops into the house of God and look at
          them there. You would not take down the ledger and cast up your
          accounts to-day, (though some do that) but at the same time you have a
          ledger in your brains, and are busy with that when you ought to be
          thinking of your God. And I have noticed this, too, that in so large a
          house as this, where so many have to be occupied in showing persons to
          their seats, keeping the pews and arranging the services, there is
          such a tendency in the minds of such to have their minds dissipated
          from the solemn occupation in which they are engaged. I think there
          ought never to be employed in churches and chapels pew-openers who are
          not converted, for they will not be converted afterwards. I suppose
          the case of a pew-opener being converted after taking the office was
          never known. Those persons who have to do with the externals of the
          House are just those persons who seldom know anything of the internal.
          They are occupied with the shell; they can not think of the kernel. As
          with the grave digger and with undertaker's men, the least thoughtful
          of all, the most careless of all men, so is it with them who are most
          in the sanctuary, they are often furthest from God. Oh, may we
          remember "Surely God is in this place," and it will give us awe when
          we come into his immediate presence!
        </p>
        <p>
          But once more, what a restraint from sin would this thought be if it
          could be painted upon our very soul! A man once took his child with
          him while he went out to steal from a neighbour's stack, and he said
          to the boy, "Look about you for fear anybody should see your father."
          The boy had read the Sculptures, so, having looked all round, his
          father said, "Have you looked all ways? "He said, "No, father, there
          is somebody looking." "Who is it?" "Father, you have not looked up,
          and there is God looking down upon you." The man's conscience was
          pricked. Sinner, you look round you, there is no one in the chamber,
          you perpetrate the crime. Look up! The father with murderous thoughts
          in his mind gets his son into an unfrequented lane, no eye he thinks
          beholds him, but the divine watcher looks on and finds helpmates on
          earth to keep watch too. Man, there are eyes in every wall. Nature is
          God's great photographer, photographing every act you do, nay, every
          thought that you feel as it prints itself upon your brain and upon
          your brow. You shall find at the last great day the picture of
          everything that you have done preserved, for he shall speak to the
          beam out of the sun and it shall tell what you said, and he shall
          speak to the sun itself and it shall reveal the picture of the
          uplifted hand and of the dark deed. You are always seen. Eyes watch
          you: through the thick darkness he beholdeth. The spirits which he
          sendeth abroad to and fro are ever at your elbow, and he himself is
          there. Now go and sin in the presence of God if thou darest. Curse him
          to the face if thou darest; go home to day to break his Sabbath if
          thou darest while he looks on. Surely men would not offend in the very
          presence of the Judge! They would not break the laws with the Lawgiver
          himself before their very eyes. Let him then abide in your thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>"Nor let your weaker passions dare</p>
        <p>Consent to sin, for God is there."<br /></p>
