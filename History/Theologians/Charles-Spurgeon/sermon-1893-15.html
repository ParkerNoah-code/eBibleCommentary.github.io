          If these things may happen to those women also who, having attained
          the faith while in (the state of) Gentile matrimony, continue in that
          state, still they are excused, as having been "apprehended by God" in
          these very circumstances; and they are bidden to persevere in their
          married state, and are sanctified, and have hope of "making a gain"
          held out to them. "If, then, a marriage of this kind (contracted
          before conversion) stands ratified before God, why should not (one
          contracted after conversion) too go prosperously forward, so as not to
          be thus harassed by pressures, and straits, and hindrances, and
          defilements, having already (as it has) the partial sanction of divine
          grace? "Because, on the one hand, the wife in the former case, called
          from among the Gentiles to the exercise of some eminent heavenly
          virtue, is, by the visible proofs of some marked (divine) regard, a
          terror to her Gentile husband, so as to make him less ready to annoy
          her, less active in laying snares for her, less diligent in playing
          the spy over her. He has felt "mighty works;" he has seen experimental
          evidences; he knows her changed for the better: thus even he himself
          is, by his fear, a candidate for God. Thus men of this kind, with
          regard to whom the grace of God has established a familiar intimacy,
          are more easily "gained." But, on the other hand, to descend into
          forbidden ground unsolicited and spontaneously, is (quite) another
          thing. Things which are not pleasing to the Lord, of course offend the
          Lord, are of course introduced by the Evil One. A sign hereof is this
          fact, that it is wooers only who find the Christian name pleasing;
          and, accordingly, some heathen men are found not to shrink in horror
          from Christian women, just in order to exterminate them, to wrest them
          away, to exclude them from the faith. So long as marriage of this kind
          is procured by the Evil One, but condemned by God, you have a reason
          why you need not doubt that it can in no case be carried to a
          prosperous end.<br />
