          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician.</b> He had need be a man of great
          skill, worthily to sing such a Psalm as this—the best music in the
          world would be honored by marriage with such expressions.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">A Song or Psalm</p></b>, or a Song and Psalm. It
        may be either said or sung. It is a marvelous poem if it be but read;
        but set to suitable music, it must have been one of the noblest strains
        ever heard by the Jewish people. We do not know who is its author, but
        we see no reason to doubt that David wrote it. It is in the Davidic
        style, and has nothing in it unsuited to his times. It is true the
        "house" of God is mentioned, but the tabernacle was entitled to that
        designation as well as the temple.
        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT AND DIVISION. Praise is the topic, and the subjects for song
          are the Lord's great works, his gracious benefits, his faithful
          deliverances, and all his dealings with his people, brought to a close
          by a personal testimony to special kindness received by the prophet
          bard himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Verses 1-4 are a kind of introductory hymn, calling upon all nations
          to praise God, and dictating to them the words of a suitable song.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Verses 5-7 invite the beholder to "Come and see" the works of the
          Lord, pointing attention to the Red Sea, and perhaps the passage of
          Jordan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This suggests the similar position of the afflicted people which is
          described, and its joyful outcome predicted, Verses 8-12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The singer then becomes personal, and confesses his own obligations to
          the Lord (Verses 13-15).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And, bursting forth with a vehement "Come and hear," declares with
          thanksgiving the special favor of the Lord to himself, Verses
          16-20.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Make a joyful noise unto God.</p></b>"In
        Zion," where the more instructed saints were accustomed to profound
        meditation, the song was silent unto God, and was accepted of him. But
        in the great popular assemblies a joyful noise was more appropriate and
        natural, and it would be equally acceptable.
        <p align="justify">
          If praise is to be wide spread, it must be vocal; exulting sounds stir
          the soul and cause a sacred contagion of thanksgiving. Composers of
          tunes for the congregation should see to it that their airs are
          cheerful; we need not so much noise, as <i>joyful </i>noise.
          <i
            >God is to be praised with the voice, and the heart should go
            therewith in holy exultation.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          All praise from all nations should be rendered unto the Lord. Happy
          the day when no shouts shall be presented to Juggernaut or Buddha, but
          all the earth shall adore the Creator thereof.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">All you lands.</p></b>You heathen nations, you
        who have not known Jehovah hitherto, with one consent let the whole
        earth rejoice before God. The languages of the lands are many, but their
        praises should be one, addressed to one only God.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 2. Sing forth the honor of his name.</p></b
        >
        The noise is to be modulated with tune and time, and fashioned into
        singing, for we adore the God of order and harmony.
        <i
          >The honor of God should be our subject, and to honor him our object
          when we sing. </i
        >To give glory to God is but to restore to him his own. It is our glory
        to be able to give God glory; and all our true glory should be ascribed
        unto God, for it is his glory. "All worship be to God only," should be
        the motto of all true believers.
        <p align="justify">
          The name, nature, and person of God are worthy of the highest honor.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Make his praise glorious.</p></b> Let not his
        praise be mean and groveling—let it arise with grandeur and solemnity
        before him. The pomp of the ancient festivals is not to be imitated by
        us, under this dispensation of the Spirit, but we are to throw so much
        of heart and holy reverence into all our worship that it shall be the
        best we can render. Heart worship and spiritual joy render praise more
        glorious than vestments, incense, and music could do.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. Say unto God.</p></b>Turn all your
        praises to him. Devotion, unless it be resolutely directed to the Lord,
        is no better than whistling to the wind. How terrible are you in your
        works. The mind is usually first arrested by those attributes which
        cause fear and trembling; and, even when the heart has come to love God,
        and rest in him, there is an increase of worship when the soul is awed
        by an extraordinary display of the more dreadful of the divine
        characteristics.
        <p align="justify">
          Looking upon the convulsions which have shaken continents, the
          <i>hurricanes </i>which have devastated nations, the
          <i> plagues </i>which have desolated cities, and other great and
          amazing displays of divine working, men may well say: How terrible are
          you in your works.<i>
            Until we see God in Christ, the terrible predominates in all our
            apprehensions of him.</i
          >
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Through the greatness of your power shall your enemies submit
            themselves unto you
          </p></b
        >; but, as the Hebrew clearly intimates, it will be a forced and false
        submission<i
          >. Power brings a man to his knee, but love alone wins his heart. </i
        >Pharaoh said he would let Israel go, but he lied unto God; he submitted
        in word but not in deed. Tens of thousands, both in earth and Hell, are
        rendering this constrained homage to the Almighty; they only submit
        because they cannot do otherwise; it is not their loyalty, but his
        power, which keeps them subjects of his boundless dominion.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 4. All the earth shall worship you, and shall sing unto you.
          </p></b
        >
        All men must even now prostrate themselves before you, but a time will
        come when they shall do this cheerfully; to the worship of fear, shall
        be added the singing of love.
        <i
          >What a change shall have taken place when singing shall displace
          sighing, and music shall thrust out misery! </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">They shall sing to your name.</p></b>The nature
        and works of God will be the theme of earth's universal song, and he
        himself shall be the object of the joyful adoration of our emancipated
        race. Acceptable worship not only praises God as the mysterious Lord,
        but it is rendered fragrant by some measure of knowledge of his name or
        character. God would not be worshiped as an unknown God, nor have it
        said of his people, "You worship you know not what." May the knowledge
        of the Lord soon cover the earth, that so the universality of
        intelligent worship may be possible: such a consummation was evidently
        expected by the writer of this Psalm; and, indeed, throughout all Old
        Testament writings, there are intimations of the future general spread
        of the worship of God.
        <p align="justify">
          It was an instance of willful ignorance and bigotry when the Jews
          raged against the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles. Perverted
          Judaism may be exclusive, but the religion of Moses, and David, and
          Isaiah was not so.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> A little pause for holy
        expectation is well inserted after so great a prophecy, and the
        uplifting of the heart is also a seasonable direction. No meditation can
        be more joyous that excited by the prospect of a world reconciled to its
        Creator.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 5. Come and see the works of God.</p></b
        >Such glorious events, as the cleaving of the Red Sea and the overthrow
        of Pharaoh, are standing wonders, and throughout all time a voice sounds
        forth concerning them, "Come and see."
        <p align="justify">
          Even until the close of all things, the marvelous works of God at the
          Red Sea will be the subject of meditation and praise; for, standing on
          the sea of glass mingled with fire, the triumphal armies of Heaven
          sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.
          It has always been the favorite subject of the inspired bards, and
          their choice was most natural.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
          </p></b
        >
        For the defense of his church and the overthrow of her foes, he deals
        terrific blows, and strikes the mighty with fear. O you enemy, why do
        you vaunt yourself? Speak no more so exceeding proudly, but remember the
        plagues which bowed the will of Pharaoh, the drowning of Egypt's
        chariots in the Red Sea, the overthrow of Og and Sihon, the scattering
        of the Canaanites before the tribes. This same God still lives, and is
        to be worshiped with trembling reverence.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 6. He turned the sea into dry land.</p></b>
        It was no slight miracle to divide a pathway through such a sea, and to
        make it fit for the traffic of a whole nation. He who did this can do
        anything, and must be God, the worthy object of adoration. The
        Christian's inference is that no obstacle in his journey heavenward need
        hinder him, for the sea could not hinder Israel, and even death itself
        shall be as life; the sea shall be dry land when God's presence is felt.
        <b> <p align="justify">They went through the flood on foot.</p></b>
        Through the river the tribes passed dry shod, Jordan was afraid because
        of them. <b> <p align="justify">There did we rejoice in him.</p></b> We
        participate this day in that ancient joy. The scene is so vividly before
        us that it seems as if we were there personally, singing unto the Lord
        because he has triumphed gloriously. Faith casts herself bodily into the
        past joys of the saints, and realizes them for herself in much the same
        fashion in which she projects herself into the bliss of the future, and
        becomes the substance of things hoped for. It is to be remarked that
        Israel's joy was in her God, and there let ours be.

        "He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,
        and I will exalt him."
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 7. He rules by his power forever.</p></b>He
        has not deceased, nor abdicated, nor suffered defeat. The prowess
        displayed at the Red Sea is undiminished: the divine dominion endures
        throughout eternity.

        <b> <p align="justify">His eyes behold the nations.</p></b>Even as he
        looked out of the cloud upon the Egyptians and discomfited them, so does
        he spy out his enemies, and mark their conspiracies. His hand rules and
        his eye observes, his hand has not waxed weak, nor his eye dim. As so
        many grasshoppers he sees the people and tribes, at one glance he takes
        in all their ways. He oversees all and overlooks none.
        <b> <p align="justify">Let not the rebellious exalt themselves.</p></b
        >The proudest have no cause to be proud.
        <i
          >Could they see themselves as God sees them, they would shrivel into
          nothing</i
        >. Where rebellion reaches to a great head, and hopes most confidently
        for success, it is a sufficient reason for abating our fears, that the
        Omnipotent ruler is also an Omniscient observer.

        <p align="justify">
          O proud rebels, remember that the Lord aims his arrows at the high
          soaring eagles and brings them down from their nest among the stars.
          "He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low
          degree."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          After a survey of the Red Sea and Jordan, rebels, if they were in
          their senses, would have no more stomach for the fight, but would
          humble themselves at the Conqueror's feet.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> Pause again, and take time to bow
        low before the throne of the Eternal.

        chosen seed, peculiarly beloved, it is yours to bless your covenant God
        as other nations cannot. You should lead the strain, for he is
        peculiarly <i>your God</i>. First visited by his love, you should be
        foremost in his praise.

        Heaven itself, to echo with your joyful shouts.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 9. Which holds our soul in life.</p></b> At
        any time the preservation of life, and especially the soul's life, is a
        great reason for gratitude but much more when we are called to undergo
        extreme trials, which of themselves would crush our being.
        <p align="justify">
          Blessed be God, who, having put our souls into possession of life, has
          been pleased to preserve that Heaven given life from the destroying

        Living and standing is the saint's condition through divine grace.
        Immortal and immoveable are those whom God preserves. Satan is put to
        shame, for instead of being able to slay the saints, as he hoped, he is
        not even able to trip them up. God is able to make the weakest to stand
        fast, and he will do so.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 10. For you, O God, have proved us.</p></b

          common to all the family, and from which so much benefit has flowed to
          them? The Lord himself proves us, who then shall raise a question as
          to the wisdom and the love which are displayed in the operation?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The day may come when, as in this case, we shall make hymns out of our
          griefs, and sing all the more sweetly because our mouths have been
          purified with bitter draughts.

        <b> <p align="justify">You have tried us, as silver is tried.</p></b>

        >The people of God in the olden time were often enclosed by the power of
        their enemies, like fish or birds entangled in a net; there seemed no
        way of escape for them. The only comfort was that God himself had
        brought them there, but even this was not readily available, since they
        knew that he had led them there in anger as a punishment for their
        transgressions; Israel in Egypt was much like a bird in the fowler's
        net.
        <b> <p align="justify">You laid affliction upon our loins.</p></b>They
        were pressed even to anguish by their burdens and pains.<b> </b>Not on
        their backs alone was the load, but their loins were pressed and
        squeezed with the straits and weights of adversity.
        <i>God's people and affliction are intimate companions. </i>As in Egypt
        every Israelite was a burden-bearer, so is every believer while he is in
        this foreign land. As Israel cried to God by reason of their sore
        bondage, so also do the saints.
        <p align="justify">
          We too often forget that God lays our afflictions upon us; if we
          remembered this fact, we would more patiently submit to the pressure
          which now pains us. The time will come when, for every ounce of
          present burden, we shall receive a far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory.

        They stormed, and hectored, and treated us like the mire of the street.
        Riding the high horse, in their arrogance, they, who were in themselves
        base men, treated the Lord's people as if they were the meanest of
        mankind. They even turned their captives into beasts of burden, and rode
        upon their heads, as some read the Hebrew. Nothing is too bad for the
        servants of God when they fall into the hands of proud persecutors.
        <b> <p align="justify">We went through fire and through water.</p></b>
        Trials many and varied were endured by Israel in Egypt, and are still
        the portion of the saints. The fires of the brick kiln and the waters of
        the Nile did their worst to destroy the chosen race; hard labor and
        child murder were both tried by the tyrant, but Israel went through both
        ordeals unharmed, and even thus the church of God has outlived, and will
        outlive, all the artifices and cruelties of man.
        <p align="justify">
          Fire and water are pitiless and devouring, but a divine fiat stays
          their fury, and forbids these or any other agents from utterly
          destroying the chosen seed. Many an heir of Heaven has had a dire
          experience of tribulation; the fire through which he has passed has
          been more terrible than that which chars the bones, for it has fed
          upon the marrow of his spirit, and burned into the core of his heart;
          while the water-floods of affliction have been even more to be feared
          than the remorseless sea, for they have gone in even unto the soul,
          and carried the inner nature down into deeps horrible, and not to be
          imagined without trembling.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet each saint has been more than conqueror hitherto, and, as it has
          been, so it shall be. The fire is not kindled which can burn the
          woman's seed, neither does the dragon know how to vomit a flood which
          shall suffice to drown it.

        A blessed outcome to a mournful story. Canaan was indeed a broad and
        royal domain for the once enslaved tribes. God, who took them into
        Egypt, also brought them into the land which flowed with milk and honey,
        and Egypt was in his purposes en route to Canaan.

          How wealthy is the place of every believer, and how doubly does he
          feel it to be so in contrast with his former slavery. What songs shall
          suffice to set forth our joy and gratitude for such a glorious
          deliverance and such a bountiful heritage. More awaits us.
          <i
            >The depth of our griefs, bears no proportion to the height of our
            bliss</i

          shall rise from the prison to the palace. Like Mordecai we shall
          escape the gallows prepared by malignity, and ride the white horse and
          wear the royal robe appointed by benignity. Instead of the net,
          liberty. Instead of a burden on the loins, a crown on our heads.
          Instead of men riding over us, we shall rule over the nations: fire
          shall no more try us, for we shall stand in glory on the sea of glass
          mingled with fire; and water shall not harm us, for there shall be no
          more sea. O the splendor of this brilliant conclusion to a gloomy
          history. Glory be unto him who saw in the apparent evil the true way
          to the real good. With patience we will endure the present gloom, for
          the morning comes. Over the hills faith sees the daybreak, in whose
          light we shall enter into the wealthy place.

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 13. I will.</p></b> The child of God is so
        sensible of his own personal indebtedness to grace, that he feels that
        he must utter a song of his own. He joins in the common thanksgiving,
        but since the best public form must fail to meet each individual case,
        he makes sure that the special mercies received by him shall not be
        forgotten, for he records them with his own pen, and sings of theme with
        his own lips.

        come to God without a victim of grateful praise; of this as well as of

        thereof."

        appear before the Lord empty, but at the same time he would not boast of
        what he offered, seeing it was all due on account of former vows. After
        all, our largest gifts are but payments; when we have given all, we must
        confess, "O Lord, of your own have we given unto you."<i>
          We should be slow in making vows, but prompt in discharging them. </i
        >When we are released from trouble, and can once more go up to the house
        of the Lord, we should take immediate occasion to fulfill our promises.
        How can we hope for help another time, if we prove faithless to
        covenants voluntarily entered upon in hours of need.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 14. Which my lips have uttered</p></b>, or
        vehemently declared; blurted out, as we say in common speech. His vows
        had been wrung from him; extreme distress burst open the doors of his
        lips, and out rushed the vow like a long pent up torrent, which had at
        last found a vent. What we were so eager to vow, we should be equally
        earnest to perform; but alas! many a vow runs so fast in words, that it
        lames itself for deeds.
        <b> <p align="justify">And my mouth has spoken.</p></b> He had made the
        promise public, and had no desire to go back;
        <i>an honest man is always ready to acknowledge a debt. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">When I was in trouble.</p></b>Distress suggested
        the vow; God in answer to the vow removed the distress, and now the
        votary desires to make good his promise. It is well for each man to
        remember that he was in trouble: proud spirits are apt to speak as if
        the road had always been smooth for them, as if no dog dare bark at
        their nobility, and scarce a drop of rain would venture to besprinkle
        their splendor. Yet these very upstarts were probably once so low in
        spirits and condition that they would have been glad enough of the help
        of those they now despise.

        Both bad and good have been known to resort to vowing, but the one is a

            Verse 15. I will offer unto you burnt sacrifices of fatlings.

        ><i>The godly man will give his best things to God. </i>No starveling
        goat upon the hills will he present at the altar, but the well fed
        bullocks of the luxuriant pastures shall ascend in smoke from the sacred
        fire. <i>He who is miserly with God is a wretch indeed. </i>Few devise
        liberal things, but those few find a rich reward in so doing.
        <b> <p align="justify">With the incense of rams.</p></b> The smoke of
        burning rams should also rise from the altar; he would offer the
        strength and prime of his flocks as well as his herds. Of all we have we
        should give the Lord his portion, and that should be the choicest we can
        select.
        <p align="justify">
          It was no waste to burn the fat upon Jehovah's altar, nor to pour the
          precious ointment upon Jesus' head; neither are large gifts and
          bountiful offerings to the church of God any diminution to a man's
          estate: such money is put to good interest and placed where it cannot
          be stolen by thieves nor corroded by rust.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">I will offer bullocks with goats.</p></b> A
        perfect sacrifice, completing the circle of offerings, should show forth
        the intense love of his heart. We should magnify the Lord with the great
        and the little. None of his ordinances should be disregarded; we must
        not omit either the bullocks or the goats. In these three verses we have
        gratitude in action, not content with words, but proving its own
        sincerity by deeds of obedient sacrifice.
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> It is most fit that we should
        suspend the song while the smoke of the victims ascends the heavens; let
        the burnt offerings stand for praises while we meditate upon the
        infinitely greater sacrifice of Calvary.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 16. Come and hear.</p></b>Before, they were
        bidden to come and <i>see</i>. <i>Hearing is faith's seeing. </i>Mercy
        comes to us by way of ear gate. "Hear, and your soul shall live." They
        <i>saw </i>how terrible God was, but they <i>heard </i>how gracious he
        was. <b> <p align="justify">All you that fear God.</p></b> These are a
        fit audience when a godly man is about to relate his experience; and it
        is well to select our hearers when inward soul matters are our theme. It
        is forbidden us to throw pearls before swine. We do not want to furnish
        wanton minds with subjects for their comedies, and therefore it is wise
        to speak of personal spiritual matters where they can be understood, and
        not where they will be burlesqued. All God fearing men may hear us, but
        far hence you profane.

        I will count and recount the mercies of God to me, to my soul, my best
        part, my most real self. Testimonies ought to be borne by all
        experienced Christians, in order that the younger and feebler sort may
        be encouraged by the recital to put their trust in the Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          To declare <i>man's </i>doings is needless; they are too trivial, and,
          besides, there are trumpeters enough of man's trumpery deeds; but
          <i
            >to declare the gracious acts of God is instructive, consoling,
            inspiriting, and beneficial in many respects</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let each man speak for himself, for a personal witness is the surest
          and most forcible; second hand experience lacks the flavor of first
          hand interest. Let no mock modesty restrain the grateful believer from
          speaking of himself, or rather of<i> God's dealings to himself</i>,
          for it is justly due to God; neither let him shun the individual use
          of the first person, which is most correct in detailing the Lord's
          ways of love. We must not be egotists, but we must be egotists when we
          bear witness for the Lord.

        >It is well when prayer and praise go together, like the horses in

        <p align="justify">
          Since the Lord's answers so frequently follow close at the heels of
          our petitions, and even overtake them, it becomes us to let our
          grateful praises keep pace with our humble prayers. Observe that the
          psalmist did both cry and speak;
          <i
            >the Lord has cast the dumb devil out of his children, and those of
            them who are least fluent with their tongues are often the most

        If, having seen it to be there, I continue to gaze upon it without
        aversion; if I cherish it, have a side glance of love toward it, excuse
        it, and palliate it.
        <b> <p align="justify">The Lord will not hear me.</p></b>How can he? Can
        I desire him to connive at my sin, and accept me while I willfully cling
        to any evil way? Nothing hinders prayer like iniquity harbored in the
        heart; as with Cain, so with us, sin lies at the door, and blocks the
        passage. If you listen to the devil, God will not listen to you. If you
        refuse to hear God's commands, he will surely refuse to hear your
        prayers.
        <p align="justify">
          An imperfect petition God will hear for Christ's sake, but not one
          which is willfully miswritten by a traitor's hand.
          <i
            >For God to accept our devotions, while we are delighting in sin,
            would be to make himself the God of hypocrites, which is a fitter
            name for Satan than for the Holy One of Israel.</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 19. But truly God has heard me.</p></b>
        This is a sure sign this that the petitioner was no secret lover of sin.
        The answer to his prayer was a fresh assurance that his heart was
        sincere before the Lord. See how sure the psalmist is that he has been
        heard; it is with him no hope, surmise, or imagination, but he seals it
        with a truly. Facts are blessed things when they reveal both God's heart
        as loving, and our own heart as sincere.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">He has attended to the voice of my prayer.</p></b
        >
        He gave his mind to consider my cries, interpreted them, accepted them,
        and replied to them; and therein proved his grace and also my
        uprightness of heart. Love of sin is a plague spot, a condemning mark, a
        killing sign, but those prayers, which evidently live and prevail with
        God, most clearly arise from
        <i>a heart which is free from dalliance with evil</i>. Let the reader
        see to it, that his inmost soul be rid of all alliance with iniquity,
        all toleration of secret lust, or hidden wrong.

        be honored and loved. Which has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy
        from me. He has neither withdrawn his love nor my liberty to pray.
