        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.362)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Evening, February 17th, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At New Park Street, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"He that believeth on him is not condemned" -- John 3:18</p>
        <p>
          IN the morning sermon, our time was mainly taken up with the
          description of Faith -- what it is. We had only a few minutes left at
          its close to describe what it leads to -- the privilege of
          justification, which is a gift to the soul as the result of Faith. Let
          this high privilege, then, occupy our attention to-night. The text
          says, "He that believeth on him -- [that is on Christ Jesus] -- is not
          condemned."
        </p>
        <p>
          To take up the subject in order, we shall notice first, the
          satisfactory declaration here made; then, secondly, we shall endeavour
          to correct certain misapprehensions respecting it, by reason of which
          the Christian is often cast down; and we shall close with some
          reflections, positive and negative, as to what this text includes, and
          what it excludes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, then, WHAT A SATISFACTORY DECLARATION! -- "He that
          believeth on him is not condemned."
        </p>
        <p>
          You are aware that in our courts of law, a verdict of "not guilty,"
          amounts to an acquittal, and the prisoner is immediately discharged.
          So is it in the language of the gospel; a sentence of "not condemned,"
          implies the justification of the sinner. It means that the believer in
          Christ receives now a present justification. Faith does not produce
          its fruits by-and-by, but now. So far as justification is the result
          of faith, it is given to the soul in the moment when it closes with
          Christ, and accepts him as its all in all. Are they who stand before
          the throne of God justified to-night? -- so are we, as truly and as
          clearly justified as they who walk in white and sing his praises
          above. The thief upon the cross was justified the moment that he
          turned the eye of faith to Jesus, who was just then, hanging by his
          side: and Paul, the aged, after years of service, was not more
          justified than was the thief with no service at all. We are to-day
          accepted in the Beloved, to-day absolved from sin, to-day innocent in
          the sight of God. Oh, ravishing, soul-transporting thought! There are
          some clusters of this vine which we shall not be able to gather till
          we go to heaven; but this is one of the first ripe clusters and may be
          plucked and eaten here. This is not as the corn of the land, which we
          can never eat till we cross the Jordan; but this is part of the manna
          in the wilderness, and part too of our daily raiment, with which God
          supplies us in our journeying to and fro. We are now -- even now
          pardoned; even now are our sins put away; even now we stand in the
          sight of God as though we had never been guilty; innocent as father
          Adam when he stood in integrity, ere he had eaten of the fruit of the
          forbidden tree; pure as though we had never received the taint of
          depravity in our veins. "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to
          them which are in Christ Jesus." There is not a sin in the Book of
          God, even now, against one of his people. There is nothing laid to
          their charge. There is neither speck, nor spot, nor wrinkle, nor any
          such thing remaining upon any one believer in the matter of
          justification in the sight of the Judge of all the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to pass on, the text evidently means not simply present, but
          continual justification. In the moment when you and I believed, it was
          said of us, "He is not condemned." Many days have passed since then,
          many changes we have seen; but it is as true of us to-night, "He is
          not condemned." The Lord alone knows how long our appointed day shall
          be -- how long ere we shall fulfill the hireling's time, and like a
          shadow flee away. But this we know, since every word of God is
          assured, and the gifts of God are without repentance, though we should
          live another fifty years, yet would it still be written here, "He that
          believeth on him is not condemned." Nay, if by some mysterious dealing
          in providence our lives should be lengthened out to ten times the
          usual limit of man, and we should come to the eight or nine hundred
          years of Methuselah, still would it stand the same -- "He that
          believeth on him is not condemned." "I give unto my sheep eternal
          life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of
          my hand." "The just shall live by faith." "He that believeth on him
          shall never be confounded." All these promises go to show that the
          justification which Christ gives to our faith is a continual one,
          which will last as long as we shall live. And, remember, it will last
          in eternity as well as in time. We shall not in heaven wear any other
          dress but that which we wear here. To-day the righteous stand clothed
          in the righteousness of Christ. They shall wear this same wedding
          dress at the great wedding feast. But what if it should wear out? What
          if that righteousness should lose its virtue in the eternity to come?
          Oh beloved! we entertain no fear about that. Heaven and earth shall
          pass away, but this righteousness shall never wax old. No moth shall
          fret it; no thief shall steal it; no weeping hand of lamentation shall
          rend it in twain. It is, it must be eternal, even as Christ himself,
          Jehovah our righteousness. Because he is our righteousness, the
          self-existent, the everlasting, the immutable Jehovah, of whose years
          there is no end, and whose strength faileth not, therefore of our
          righteousness there is no end; and of its perfection, and of its
          beauty there shall never be any termination. The text, I think, very
          clearly teaches us, that he who believeth on Christ has received for
          ever a continual justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, think for a moment; the justification which is spoken of here
          is complete. "He that believeth on him is not condemned," -- that is
          to say, not in any measure or in any degree. I know some think it is
          possible for us to be in such a state as to be half-condemned and
          half-accepted. So far as we are sinners so far condemned; and so far
          as we are righteous so far accepted. Oh beloved, there is nothing like
          that in Scripture. It is altogether apart from the doctrine of the
          gospel. If it be of works, it is no more of grace; and if it be of
          grace, it is no more of works. Works and grace cannot mix and mingle
          any more than fire and water; it is either one or the other, it cannot
          be both; the two can never be allied. There can be no admixture of the
          two, no dilution of one with the other. He that believeth is free from
          all iniquity, from all guilt, from all blame; and though the devil
          bring an accusation, yet it is a false one, for we are free even from
          accusation, since it is boldly challenged, "Who shall lay anything to
          the charge of God's elect?" It does not say, "Who shall prove it?" but
          "Who shall lay it to their charge?" They are so completely freed from
          condemnation, that not the shadow of a spot upon their soul is found;
          not even the slightest passing by of iniquity to cast its black shadow
          on them. They stand before God not only as half-innocent, but as
          perfectly so; not only as half-washed, but as whiter than snow. Their
          sins are not simply erased, they are blotted out; not simply put out
          of sight, but cast into the depths of the sea; not merely gone, and
          gone as far as the east is from the west, but gone for ever, once for
          all. You know, beloved, that the Jew in his ceremonial purification,
          never had his conscience free from sin. After one sacrifice he needed
          still another, for these offerings could never make the comers
          thereunto perfect. The next day's sins needed a new lamb, and the next
          year's iniquity needed a new victim for an atonement. "But this man,
          after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down at the
          right hand of God." No more burnt-offerings are needed, no more
          washing, no more blood, no more atonement, no more sacrifice. "It is
          finished!" hear the dying Saviour cry. Your sins have sustained their
          death-blow, the robe of your righteousness has received its last
          thread; it is done, complete, perfect. It needs no addition; it can
          never suffer any diminution. Oh, Christian, do lay hold of this
          precious thought; I may not be able to state it except in weak terms,
          but let not my weakness prevent your apprehending its glory and its
          preciousness. It is enough to make a man leap, though his legs were
          loaded with irons, and to make him sing though his mouth were gagged,
          to think that we are perfectly accepted in Christ, that our
          justification is not partial, it does not go to a limited extent, but
          goes the whole way. Our unrighteousness is covered; from condemnation
          we are entirely and irrevocably free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more. The non-condemnation is effectual. The royal privilege of
          justification shall never miscarry. It shall be brought home to every
          believer. In the reign of King George the Third, the son of a member
          of this church lay under sentence of death for forgery. My
          predecessor, Dr. Rippon, after incredible exertions, obtained a
          promise that his sentence should be remitted. By a singular occurrence
          the present senior deacon -- then a young man -- learned from the
          governor of the gaol that the reprieve had not been received; and the
          unhappy prisoner would have been executed the next morning, had not
          Dr. Rippon gone post-haste to Windsor, obtained an interview with the
          king in his bed-chamber, and received from the monarch's own hand a
          copy of that reprieve which had been negligently put aside by a
          thoughtless officer. "I charge you, Doctor," said his majesty, "to
          make good speed." "Trust me, Sire, for that," responded your old
          pastor, and he returned to London in time, just in time, and only just
          in time, for the prisoner was being marched with many others on to the
          scaffold. Ay, that pardon might have been given, and yet the man might
          have been executed if it had not been effectually carried out. But
          blessed be God our non-condemnation is an effectual thing. It is not a
          matter of letter, it is a matter of fact. Ah, poor souls, you know
          that condemnation is a matter of fact. When you and I suffered in our
          souls, and were brought under the heavy hand of the law, we felt that
          its curses were no mock thunders like the wrath of the Vatican, but
          they were real; we felt that the anger of God was indeed a thing to
          tremble at; a real substantial fact. Now, just as real as the
          condemnation which Justice brings, just so real is the justification
          which mercy bestows. You are not only nominally guiltless, but you are
          really so, if you believe in Christ; you are not only nominally put
          into the place of the innocent, but you are really put there the
          moment you believe in Jesus. Not only is it said that your sins are
          gone, but they are gone. Not only does God look on you as though you
          were accepted; you are accepted. It is a matter of fact to you, as
          much a matter of fact as that you sinned. You do not doubt that you
          have sinned, you cannot doubt that; do not doubt then that when you
          believe your sins are put away. For as certain as ever the black spot
          fell on you when you sinned, so certainly and so surely was it all
          washed out when you were bathed in that fountain filled with blood,
          which was drawn from Emmanuel's veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, my soul, think thou of this. Thou art actually and effectually
          cleared from guilt. Thou art led out of thy prison. Thou art no more
          in fetters as a bond-slave. Thou art delivered now from the bondage of
          the Law. Thou art freed from sin and thou canst walk at large as a
          freeman. Thy Saviour's blood has procured thy full discharge. Come, my
          soul, -- thou hast a right now to come to thy Father's feet. No flames
          of vengeance are there to scare thee now; no fiery sword; justice
          cannot smite the innocent. Come, my soul, thy disabilities are taken
          away. Thou wast unable once to see thy Father's face; thou canst see
          it now. Thou couldst not speak with him, nor he with thee; but now
          thou hast access with boldness to this grace wherein we stand. Once
          there was a fear of hell upon thee; there is no hell for thee now. How
          can there be punishment for the guiltless? He that believeth is
          guiltless, is not condemned, and cannot be punished. No frowns of an
          avenging God now. If God be viewed as a judge, how should he frown
          upon the guiltless? How should the Judge frown upon the absolved one?
          More than all the privileges thou mightest have enjoyed if thou hadst
          never sinned, are thine now that thou art justified. All the blessings
          which thou couldst have had if thou hadst kept the law and more, are
          thine to-night because Christ has kept it for thee. All the love and
          the acceptance which a perfectly obedient being could have obtained of
          God, belong to thee, because Christ was perfectly obedient on thy
          behalf, and hath imputed all his merits to thy account that thou
          mightest be exceeding rich, through him who for thy sake became
          exceeding poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh that the Holy Spirit would but enlarge our hearts, that we might
          suck sweetness out of these thoughts! There is no condemnation.
          Moreover, there never shall be any condemnation. The forgiveness is
          not partial, but perfect; it is so effectual that it delivers us from
          all the penalties of the Law, gives to us all the privileges of
          obedience, and puts us actually high above where we should have been
          had we never sinned. It fixes our standing more secure than it was
          before we fell. We are not now where Adam was, for Adam might fall and
          perish. We are rather, where Adam would have been if we could suppose
          God had put him into the garden for seven years, and said, "If you are
          obedient for seven years, your time of probation shall be over, and I
          will reward you." The children of God in one sense may be said to be
          in a state of probation; in another sense there is no probation. There
          is no probation as to whether the child of God should be saved. He is
          saved already; his sins are washed away; his righteousness is
          complete: and if that righteousness could endure a million years'
          probation, it would never be defiled. In fact, it always stands the
          same in the sight of God, and must do so for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let me now endeavour to CORRECT SOME MISAPPREHENSIONS, BY REASON
          OF WHICH CHRISTIANS ARE OFTEN CAST DOWN.
        </p>
        <p>
          What simpletons we are! Whatever our natural age, how childish we are
          in spiritual things! What great simpletons we are when we first
          believe in Christ! We think that our being pardoned involves a great
          many things which we afterwards find have nothing whatever to do with
          our pardon. For instance, we think we shall never sin again; we fancy
          that the battle is all fought; that we have got into a fair field,
          with no more war to wage; that in fact we have got the victory, and
          have only just to stand up and wave the palm branch; that all is over,
          that God has only got to call us up to himself and we shall enter into
          heaven without having to fight any enemies upon earth. Now, all these
          are obvious mistakes. Though the text has a great meaning, it does not
          mean anything of this kind. Observe that although it does assert "He
          that believeth is not condemned"; yet it does not say that he that
          believeth shall not have his faith exercised. Your faith will be
          exercised. An untried faith will be no faith at all. God never gave
          men faith without intending to try it. Faith is received for the very
          purpose of endurance. Just as our Rifle Corps friends put up the
          target with the intention of shooting at it; so does God give faith
          with the intention of letting trials and troubles, and sin and Satan
          aim all their darts at it. When thou hast faith in Christ it is a
          great privilege; but recollect that it involves a great trial. You
          asked for great faith the other night; did you consider that you asked
          for great troubles too? You cannot have great faith to lay up and
          rust. Mr. Greatheart in John Bunyan's Pilgrim was a very strong man,
          but then what strong work he had to do. He had to go with all those
          women and children many scores of times up to the celestial city and
          back again; he had to fight all the giants, and drive back all the
          lions; to slay the giant Slaygood, and knock down the Castle of
          Despair. If you have a great measure of faith, you will have need to
          use it all. You will never have a single scrap to spare, you will be
          like the virgins in our Lord's parable, even though you be a wise
          virgin, you will have to say to others who might borrow of you, "Not
          so, lest there be not enough for us and for you." But when your faith
          is exercised with trials, do not think you are brought into judgment
          for your sins. Oh no, believer, there is plenty of exercise, but that
          is not condemnation; there are many trials, but still we are
          justified; we may often be buffeted, but we are never accursed; we may
          ofttimes be cast down, but the sword of the Lord never can and never
          will smite us to the heart. Yea, more; not only may our faith be
          exercised, but our faith may come to a very low ebb, and still we may
          not be condemned. When thy faith gets so small that thou canst not see
          it, even then still thou art not condemned. If thou hast ever believed
          in Jesus, thy faith may be like the sea when it goes out a very long
          way from the shore, and leaves a vast track of mud, and some might say
          the sea was gone or dried up. But you are not condemned when your
          faith is most dried up. Ay! and I dare to say it, -- when your faith
          is at the flood-tide, you are not more accepted then, than when your
          faith is at the lowest ebb; for your acceptance does not depend upon
          the quantity of your faith, it only depends upon its reality. If you
          are really resting in Christ, though your faith may be but as a spark,
          and a thousand devils may try to quench that one spark, yet you are
          not condemned -- you shall stand accepted in Christ. Though your
          comforts will necessarily decay as your faith declines, yet your
          acceptance does not decay. Though faith does rise and fall like the
          thermometer, though faith is like the mercury in the bulb, all
          weathers change it, -- yet God's love is not affected by the weather
          of earth, or the changes of time. Until the perfect righteousness of
          Christ can be a mutable thing -- a football to be kicked about by the
          feet of fiends -- your acceptance with God can never change. You are,
          you must be, perfectly accepted in the Beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another thing which often tries the child of God. He at times
          loses the light of his Father's countenance. Now, remember, the text
          does not say, "He that believeth shall not lose the light of God's
          countenance"; he may do so, but he shall not be condemned for all
          that. You may walk, not only for days but for months in such a state
          that you have little fellowship with Christ, very little communion
          with God of a joyous sort. The promises may seem broken to you, the
          Bible may afford you but little comfort; and when you turn your eye to
          heaven you may only have to feel the more the smarting that is caused
          by your Father's rod; you may have vexed and grieved his Spirit, and
          he may have turned away his face from you. But you are not condemned
          for all that. Mark the testimony, "He that believeth is not
          condemned." Even when your Father smites you and leaves a wale at
          every stroke, and brings the blood at every blow, there is not a
          particle of condemnation in any one stroke. Not in his anger, but in
          his dear covenant love he smites you. There is as unmixed and
          unalloyed affection in every love-stroke of chastisement from your
          Father's hand as there is in the kisses of Jesus Christ's lips. Oh!
          believe this; it will tend to lift up thy heart, it will cheer thee
          when neither sun nor moon appear. It will honour thy God, it will show
          thee where thy acceptance really lies. When his face is turned away,
          believe him still, and say, "He abideth faithful though he hide his
          face from me." I will go a little further still. The child of God may
          be so assaulted by Satan, that he may be well nigh given up to
          despair, and yet he is not condemned. The devils may beat the great
          hell-drum in his ear, till he thinks himself to be on the very brink
          of perdition. He may read the Bible, and think that every threatening
          is against him, and that every promise shuts its mouth and will not
          cheer him; and he may at last despond, and despond, and despond, till
          he is ready to break the harp that has so long been hanging on the
          willow. He may say, "The Lord hath forsaken me quite, my God will be
          gracious no more"; but it is not true. Yea, he may be ready to swear a
          thousand times that God's mercy is clean gone for ever, and that his
          faithfulness will fail for evermore; but it is not true, it is not
          true. A thousand liars swearing to a falsehood could not make it true,
          and our doubts and fears are all of them liars. And if there were ten
          thousand of them, and they all professed the same, it is a falsehood
          that God ever did forsake his people, or that he ever cast from him an
          innocent man; and you are innocent, remember, when you believe in
          Jesus. "But," say you, "I am full of sin." "Ay," say I, "but that sin
          has been laid on Christ." "Oh," say you, "but I sin daily." "Ay," say
          I, "but that sin was laid on him before you committed it, years ago.
          It is not yours; Christ has taken it away once for all. You are a
          righteous man by faith, and God will not forsake the righteous, nor
          will he cast away the innocent." I say, then, the child of God may
          have his faith at a low ebb; he may lose the light of his Father's
          countenance, and he may even get into thorough despair; but yet all
          these cannot disprove my text -- "He that believeth is not condemned."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But what," say you, "if the child of God should sin?" It is a deep
          and tender subject, yet must we touch it and be bold here. I would not
          mince God's truth lest any should make a bad use of it. I know there
          are some, not the people of God, who will say, "Let us sin, that grace
          may abound." Their condemnation is just. I cannot help the perversion
          of truth. There be always men who will take the best of food as though
          it were poison, and make the best of truth into a lie, and so be
          damning their own souls. You ask, "What if a child of God should fall
          into sin?" I answer, the child of God does fall into sin; every day he
          mourns and groans because when he would do good, evil is present with
          him. But though he falls into sins, he is not condemned for all that
          -- not by one of them, or by all of them put together, because his
          acceptance does not depend upon himself, but upon the perfect
          righteousness of Christ; and that perfect righteousness is not
          invalidated by any sins of his. He is perfect in Christ; and until
          Christ is imperfect, the imperfections of the creature do not mar the
          justification of the believer in the sight of God. But oh! if he fall
          into some glaring sin, -- O God, keep us from it! -- if he fall into
          some glaring sin, he shall go with broken bones, but he shall reach
          heaven for all that. Though, in order to try him and let him see his
          vileness, he be suffered to go far astray, yet he that bought him will
          not lose him; he that chose him will not cast him away; he will say
          unto him, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for
          mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins." David may go never so
          far away, but David is not lost. He comes back and he cries, "Have
          mercy upon me, O God!" And so shall it be with every believing soul --
          Christ shall bring him back. Though he slip, he shall be kept, and all
          the chosen seed shall meet around the throne. If it were not for this
          last truth -- though some may stick at it -- what would become of some
          of God's people? They would be given up to despair. If I have been
          speaking to a backslider, I pray he will not make a bad use of what I
          have said. Let me say to him, "Poor backslider! thy Father's bowels
          yearn over thee; he has not erased thy name out of the registry. Come
          back, come back now to him and say, Receive me graciously, and love me
          freely'; and he will say, I will put you among the children.' He will
          pass by your backsliding and will heal your iniquities; and you shall
          yet stand once more in his favour, and know yourself to be still
          accepted in the Redeemer's righteousness and saved by his blood." This
          text does not mean that the child of God shall not be tried, or that
          he shall not even sometimes fall under the trial; but it does mean
          this, once for all: He that believeth on Christ is not condemned. At
          no time, by no means, is he under the sentence of condemnation, but is
          evermore justified in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now dear brethren, but little time remains for the closing
          points, therefore, in a hurried manner, let me notice WHAT THIS TEXT
          EVIDENTLY INCLUDES; and may God grant that these few words may
          nevertheless do good to our souls!
        </p>
        <p>
          "He that believeth on him is not condemned." If we are not condemned,
          then at no time does God ever look upon his children, when they
          believe in Christ, as being guilty. Are you surprised that I should
          put it so? I put it so again; from the moment when you believe in
          Christ, God ceases to look upon you as being guilty; for he never
          looks upon you apart from Christ. You often look upon yourself as
          guilty, and you fall upon your knees as you should do, and you weep
          and lament; but even then, while you are weeping over inbred and
          actual sin, he is still saying out of heaven, "So far as your
          justification is concerned, thou art all fair and lovely." You are
          black as the tents of Kedar -- that is yourself by nature; you are
          fair as the curtains of Solomon -- that is yourself in Christ. You are
          black -- that is yourself in Adam; but comely, that is yourself in the
          second Adam. Oh, think of that! -- that you are always in God's sight
          comely, always in God's sight lovely, always in God's sight as though
          you were perfect. For ye are complete in Christ Jesus, and perfect in
          Christ Jesus, as the apostle puts it in another place. Always do you
          stand completely washed and fully clothed in Christ. Remember this;
          for it is certainly included in my text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another great thought included in my text is this; you are never
          liable as a believer to punishment for your sins. You will be
          chastised on account of them, as a father chastises his child; that is
          a part of the Gospel dispensation; but you will not be smitten for
          your sins as the lawgiver smites the criminal. Your Father may often
          punish you as he punisheth the wicked. But, never for the same reason.
          The ungodly stand on the ground of their own demerits; their
          sufferings are awarded as their due deserts. But your sorrows do not
          come to you as a matter of desert; they come to you as a matter of
          love. God knows that in one sense your sorrows are such a privilege
          that you may account of them as a boon you do not deserve. I have
          often thought of that when I have had a sore trouble. I know some
          people say, "You deserved the trouble." Yes, my dear brethren, but
          there is not enough merit in all the Christians put together, to
          deserve such a good thing as the loving rebuke of our heavenly Father.
          Perhaps you cannot see that; you cannot think that a trouble can come
          to you as a real blessing in the covenant. But I know that the rod of
          the covenant is as much the gift of grace as the blood of the
          covenant. It is not a matter of desert or merit; it is given to us
          because we need it. But I question whether we were ever so good as to
          deserve it. We were never able to get up to so high a standard as to
          deserve so rich, so gracious a providence as this covenant blessing --
          the rod of our chastening God. Never at any time in your life has a
          law-stroke fallen upon you. Since you believed in Christ you are out
          of the law's jurisdiction. The law of England cannot touch a Frenchman
          while he lives under the protection of his own Emperor. You are not
          under the law, but you are under grace. The law of Sinai cannot touch
          you, for you are out of its jurisdiction. You are not in Sinai or in
          Arabia. You are not the son of Hagar or the son of a handmaid, you are
          the son of Sarah, and are come to Jerusalem and are free. You are out
          of Arabia, and are come to God's own happy land. You are not under
          Hagar, but under Sarah; under God's covenant of grace. You are a child
          of promise, and you shall have God's own inheritance. Believe this,
          that never shall a law-stroke fall on you; never shall God's anger in
          a judicial sense drop on you. He may give you a chastising stroke, not
          as the result of sin, but rather as the result of his own rich grace,
          that would get the sin out of you, that you may be perfected in
          sanctification, even as you are now perfect and complete before him in
          the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ.

          IV. I was about to go into a list of things which this text includes,
          but the time fails me; therefore I must spend the last minute or two
          in saying WHAT THIS TEXT EXCLUDES.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it exclude! Well, I am sure it excludes boasting. "He that
          believeth is not condemned." Ah! if it said, "He that worketh is not
          condemned," then you and I might boast in any quantity. But when it
          says, "He that believeth," -- why, there is no room for us to say half
          a word for old self. No, Lord, if I am not condemned, it is thy free
          grace, for I have deserved to be condemned a thousand times since I
          have been in this pulpit to-night. When I am on my knees, and I am not
          condemned, I am sure it must be sovereign grace, for even when I am
          praying I deserve to be condemned. Even when we are repenting we are
          sinning, and adding to our sins while we are repenting of them. Every
          act we do, as the result of the flesh, is to sin again, and our best
          performances are so stained with sin, that it is hard to know whether
          they are good works or bad works. So far as they are our own, they are
          bad, and so far as they are the works of the Spirit they are good. But
          then the goodness is not ours, it is the Spirit's, and only the evil
          remains to us. Ah, then, we cannot boast! Begone, pride! begone! The
          Christian must be a humble man. If he lift up his head to say
          something, then he is nothing indeed. He does not know where he is, or
          where he stands, when he once begins to boast, as though his own right
          hand had gotten him the victory. Leave off boasting, Christian. Live
          humbly before thy God, and never let a word of self-congratulation
          escape thy lips. Sacrifice self, and let thy song be before the throne
          -- "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be glory forever."
        </p>
        <p>
          What next does the text exclude? Methinks it ought to exclude -- now I
          am about to smite myself -- it ought to exclude doubts and fears. "He
          that believeth is not condemned." How dare you and I draw such long
          faces, and go about as we do sometimes as though we had a world of
          cares upon our backs? What would I have given ten or eleven years ago
          if I could have known this text was sure to me, that I was not
          condemned. Why, I thought if I could feel I was once forgiven, and had
          to live on bread and water, and be locked up in a dungeon, and every
          day be flogged with a cat-o'-nine tails, I would gladly have accepted
          it, if I could have once felt my sins forgiven. Now you are a forgiven
          man, and yet you are cast down! Oh! shame on you. No condemnation! and
          yet miserable? Fie, Christian! Get thee up and wipe the tears from
          your eyes. Oh! if there be a person lying in gaol now, to be executed
          next week, if you could go to him and say, "You are pardoned," would
          he not spring up with delight from his seat; and although he might
          have lost his goods, and though it would be possible for him, after
          pardon, to have to suffer many things, yet, so long as life was
          spared, what would all this be to him? He would feel that it was less
          than nothing. Now, Christian, you are pardoned, your sins are all
          forgiven. Christ has said to you, "Thy sins, which are many, are all
          forgiven thee" -- and art thou yet miserable? Well, if we must be so
          sometimes, let us make it as short as we can. If we must be sometimes
          cast down, let us ask the Lord to lift us up again. I am afraid some
          of us get into bad habits, and come to make it a matter of practice to
          be downcast. Mind, Christian, mind, it will grow upon you -- that
          peevish spirit -- if you do not come to God to turn these doubts and
          fears out of you, they will soon swarm upon you like flies in Egypt.
          When you are able to kill the first great doubt, you will perhaps kill
          a hundred; for one great doubt will breed a thousand, and to kill the
          mother is to kill the whole brood. Therefore, look with all thy eyes
          against the first doubt, lest thou shouldest become confirmed in thy
          despondency, and grow into sad despair. "He that believeth on him is
          not condemned." If this excludes boasting, it ought to exclude doubts
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more. "He that believeth on him is not condemned." This excludes
          sinning any more. My Lord, have I sinned against thee so many times,
          and yet hast thou freely forgiven me all? What stronger motive could I
          have for keeping me from sinning again? Ah, there are some who are
          saying this is licentious doctrine. A thousand devils rolled into one,
          must the man be who can find any licentiousness here. What! go and sin
          because I am forgiven? Go and live in iniquity because Jesus Christ
          took my guilt and suffered in my room and stead? Human nature is bad
          enough, but methinks this is the very worst state of human nature,
          when it tries to draw an argument for sin from the free grace of God.
          It is far harder to sin against the blood of Christ, and against a
          sense of pardon, than it is against the terrors of the law and the
          fear of hell itself. I know that when my soul is most alarmed by a
          dread of the wrath of God, I can sin with comfort compared with what I
          could when I have a sense of his love shed abroad in my heart. What
          more monstrous! to read your title clear, and sin? Oh, vile reprobate!
          you are on the borders of the deepest hell. But I am sure if you are a
          child of God, you will say when you have read your title clear, and
          feel yourself justified in Christ Jesus,
        </p>
        <p>"Now, for the love I bear his name,</p>
        <p>What was my gain, I count my loss;</p>
        <p>My former pride I call my shame,</p>
        <p>And nail my glory to his cross."</p>
        <p>
          Yes, and I must, and will esteem all things but loss for Jesus' sake.
          O may my soul be found in him, perfect in his righteousness! This will
          make you live near to him: this will make you like unto him. Do not
          think that this doctrine by dwelling on it will make you think lightly
          of sin. It will make you think of it as a hard and stern executioner
          to put Christ to death; as an awful load that could never be lifted
          from you except by the eternal arm of God; and then you will come to
          hate it with all your soul, because it is rebellion against a loving
          and gracious God, and you shall by this means, far better than by any
          Arminian doubts or any legal quibbles, be led to walk in the footsteps
          of your Lord Jesus, and to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this whole sermon, though I have been preaching to the
          children of God, is meant for sinners too. Sinner, I would that thou
          didst say so. If you know this, that he that believeth is not
          condemned, then, sinner if thou believest, thou wilt not be condemned;
          and may all I have said to-night help you to this belief in thy soul.
          Oh, but sayest thou, "May I trust Christ?" As I said this morning, it
          is not a question of whether you may or may not, you are commanded.
          The Scripture commands the gospel to be preached to every creature,
          and the gospel is -- "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
          be saved." I know you will be too proud to do it, unless God by his
          grace should humble you. But if ye feel to-night that you are nothing
          and have nothing of your own, I think you will be right glad to take
          Christ to be your all-in-all. If you can say with poor Jack the
          Huckster, --
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner and nothing at all,"</p>
        <p>You may go on and say with him, this night,</p>
        <p>"But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>God grant that it may be so, for his name's sake. Amen.</p>
