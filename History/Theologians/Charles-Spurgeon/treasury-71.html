          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician upon the lilies. </b>Thus for the
          second time we have a Psalm entitled "upon the lilies." In the
          forty-first they were golden lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh,
          and blooming in the fair gardens which skirt the ivory palaces. In
          this psalm this we have
          <i
            >the lily among thorns, the lily of the valley, fair and beautiful,
            blooming in the garden of Gethsemane.
          </i>
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">A Psalm of David.</p></b> If any inquire, "of
        whom speaks the psalmist? of himself, or of some other man?" we would
        reply, "of himself, and of some other man." Who that other is, we need
        not be long in discovering; it is the Crucified alone who can say, "in
        my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." His footprints all through
        this sorrowful song have been pointed out by the Holy Spirit in the New
        Testament, and therefore we believe, and are sure, that the Son of Man
        is here.
        <p align="justify">
          Yet is seems to be the intention of the Spirit, while he gives us
          personal types, and so shows the likeness to the firstborn which
          exists in the heirs of salvation, to set forth the disparities between
          the best of the sons of men, and the Son of God, for there are verses
          here which we dare not apply to our Lord; we almost shudder when we
          see our brethren attempting to do so, as for instance verse 5.
          Especially do we note the difference between David and the Son of
          David in the imprecations of the one against his enemies, and the
          prayers of the other for them. We commence our exposition of this
          Psalm with much trembling, for we feel that we are entering with our
          Great High Priest into the most holy place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. This Psalm consists of two portions of 18 verses each. These
          again may each be sub divided into three parts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Under the first head, from verses 1-4, the sufferer spreads his
          complaint before God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Then he pleads that his zeal for God is the cause of his sufferings,
          in verses 5-12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This encourages him to plead for help and deliverance, from verses
          13-18.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the second half of the Psalm he details the injurious conduct of
          his adversaries, from verses 19-21;
        </p>
        <p align="justify">calls for their punishment, verses 22-28,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          and then returns to prayer, and to a joyful anticipation of divine
          interposition and its results, verses 29-36.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Save me, O God.</p></b>"He saved others,
        himself he cannot save." With strong cries and tears he offered up
        prayers and supplications unto him who was able to save him from death,
        and was heard in that he feared (Heb 5:7). Thus David had prayed, and
        here his Son and Lord utters the same cry.
        <p align="justify">
          This is the second Psalm which begins with a "Save me, O God," and the
          former (Psalm 54) is but a short summary of this more lengthened
          complaint. It is remarkable that such a scene of woe should be
          presented to us immediately after the jubilant ascension hymn of the
          last Psalm, but this only shows
          <i
            >how interwoven are the glories and the sorrows of our ever blessed
            Redeemer</i
          >. The head which now is crowned with glory is the same which wore the
          thorns. He to whom we pray, "Save us, O God," is the selfsame person
          who cried, "Save me, O God."
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For the waters are come in unto my soul.</p></b>
        Sorrows, deep, abounding, deadly, had penetrated his inner nature.
        Bodily anguish is not his first complaint; he begins not with the gall
        which embittered his lips, but with the mighty griefs which broke into
        his heart.
        <p align="justify">
          All the sea outside a vessel is less to be feared than that which
          finds its way into the hold. A wounded spirit who can bear. Our Lord
          in this verse is seen before us as a Jonah, crying, "The waters
          compassed me about, even to the soul." He was doing business for us on
          the great waters, at his Father's command; the stormy wind was lifting
          up the waves thereof, and he went down to the depths until his soul
          was melted because of trouble. In all this he has sympathy with us,
          and is able to support us when we, like Peter, beginning to sink, cry
          to him, "Lord, save, or we perish!"
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. I sink in deep mire.</p></b> In water
        one might swim, but in mud and mire all struggling is hopeless; the mire
        sucks down its victim.
        <b> <p align="justify">Where there is no standing.</p></b>Everything
        gave way under the Sufferer; he could not get foothold for support—this
        is a worse fate than drowning. Here our Lord pictures the close,
        clinging nature of his heart's woes. "He began to be sorrowful, and very
        heavy." <i>Sin is as mire for its filthiness</i>, and the holy soul of
        the Savior must have loathed even that connection with it which was
        necessary for its expiation. His pure and sensitive nature seemed to
        sink in it, for it was not his element,<i>
          he was not like us born and acclimated to this great dismal swamp</i
        >.
        <p align="justify">
          Here our Redeemer became another Jeremiah, of whom it is recorded
          (Jeremiah 38:6) that his enemies cast him into a dungeon wherein "was
          no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let our hearts feel the emotions, both of contrition and gratitude, as
          we see in this simile the deep humiliation of our Lord.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
          </p></b
        >
        The sorrow gathers even greater force; he is as one cast into the sea,
        the waters go over his head. His sorrows were first within, then around,
        and now above him. Our Lord was no fainthearted sentimentalist; his were
        real woes, and though he bore them heroically—yet were they terrible
        even to him. His sufferings were unlike all others in degree, the
        <i>waters </i>were such as soaked into the soul; the <i>mire </i>was the
        mire of the abyss itself, and the <i>floods </i>were deep and
        overflowing.
        <p align="justify">
          To us the promise is, "the rivers shall not overflow you," but no such
          word of consolation was given to him. My soul, your Well beloved
          endured all this for you. Many waters could not quench his love,
          neither could the floods drown it; and, because of this, you have the
          rich benefit of that covenant assurance, "as I have sworn that the
          waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that
          I would not be wroth with you, nor rebuke you."<i>
            He stemmed the torrent of almighty wrath, that we might forever rest
            in Jehovah's love!</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. I am weary of my crying.</p></b>Not of
        it, but by it, with it. He had prayed until he sweat great drops of
        blood, and well might physical weariness intervene.
        <b> <p align="justify">My throat is dried</p></b>, parched, and
        inflamed. Long pleading with awful fervor had scorched his throat as
        with flames of fire. Few, very few, of his saints follow their Lord in
        prayer so far as this. We are, it is to be feared, more likely to be
        hoarse with talking frivolities to men, than by pleading with God; yet
        our sinful nature demands more prayer than his perfect humanity might
        seem to need. His prayers should shame us into fervor. Our Lord's
        supplications were salted with fire, they were hot with agony; and hence
        they weakened his system, and made him "a weary man and full of woes."
        <b> <p align="justify">My eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p></b> He
        wanted in his direst distress nothing more than his God; that would be
        all in all to him. Many of us know what watching and waiting mean; and
        we know something of the failing eye when hope is long deferred: but in
        all this Jesus bears the palm; no eyes ever failed as his did or for so
        deep a cause.
        <p align="justify">
          No painter can ever depict those eyes; their pencils fail in every
          feature of his all but fair but all marred countenance, but most of
          all do they come short when they venture to portray those eyes which
          were fountains of tears. He knew both how to pray and to watch, and he
          would have us learn the like.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            There are times when we should pray until the throat is dry, and
            watch until the eyes grow dim.
          </p></i
        >
        Only thus can we have fellowship with him in his sufferings. What! can
        we not watch with him one hour? Does the flesh shrink back? O cruel
        flesh to be so tender of yourself, and so ungenerous to your Lord!
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. Those who hate me.</p></b> Surprising
        sin that men should hate the altogether lovely one, truly is it added,
        without a cause, for reason there was none for this senseless enmity. He
        neither blasphemed God, nor injured man. As Samuel said: "Whose ox have
        I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? Whom
        have I oppressed?" Even so might Jesus inquire. Besides,
        <i
          >he had not only done us no evil, but he had bestowed countless and
          priceless benefits. </i
        >Well might he demand, "For which of these works do you stone me?" Yet
        from his cradle to his cross, beginning with Herod and not ending with
        Judas, he had foes without number; and he justly said, they are more
        than the hairs of my head. Both the civilians and the military, laics
        and clerics, doctors and drunkards, princes and people, set themselves
        against the Lord's anointed. "This is the heir, let us kill him that the
        inheritance may be ours," was the unanimous resolve of all the keepers
        of the Jewish vineyard; while the Gentiles outside the walls of the
        garden furnished the instruments for his murder, and actually did the
        deed. The hosts of earth and Hell, banded together, made up vast legions
        of antagonists, none of whom had any just ground for hating him.
        <p align="justify">
          They that would destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.
          It was bad that they were <i>many</i>, but worse that they were
          <i>mighty</i>. All the ecclesiastical and military powers of his
          country were arrayed against him. The might of the Sanhedrin, the mob,
          and the Roman legions were combined in one for his utter destruction:
          "Away with such a fellow from this earth; it is not fit that he should
          live!" was the shout of his ferocious foes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David's adversaries were on the throne when he was hiding in caverns,
          and our Lord's enemies were the great ones of the earth; while he, of
          whom the world was not worthy, was reproached of men and despised of
          the people.

        >Though innocent, he was treated as guilty. Though David had no share in
        plots against Saul—yet he was held accountable for them. In reference to
        our Lord, it may be truly said that he restores what he took not away;
        for he gives back to the injured honor of God a recompense, and to man
        his lost happiness, though the insult of the one and the fall of the
        other were neither of them, in any sense, his doings.
        <i
          >Usually, when the ruler sins the people suffer. But here the proverb
          is reversed—the sheep go astray, and their wanderings are laid at the

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 5. O God, you know my foolishness.</p></b
        >David might well say this, but not David's Lord; unless it be
        understood as an appeal to God as to his freedom from the folly which
        men imputed to him when they said he was mad.
        <p align="justify">
          That which was foolishness to men was superlative wisdom before God.
          How often might we use these words in their natural sense, and if we
          were not such fools as to be blind to our own folly, this confession
          would be frequently on our lips. When we feel that we have been
          foolish we are not, therefore, to cease from prayer, but rather to be
          more eager and fervent in it.
          <i>Fools had good need consult with the infinitely wise. </i>
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And my sins are not hid from you.</p></b>They
        cannot be hid with any fig leaves of mine; only the covering which you
        will bring me can conceal their nakedness and mine. It ought to render
        confession easy, when we are assured that all is known already. That
        prayer which has no confession in it may please a Pharisee's pride, but
        will never bring down justification.

        blaspheme—such is the spirit of this verse.

        He appealed to the Lord Almighty by his power to help him, and now to
        the God of Israel by his covenant faithfulness to come to the rescue. If
        the captain of the host fails, how will it fare with the rank and file?
        If David flees, what will his followers do? If the king of believers
        shall find his faith unrewarded, how will the feeble ones hold on their
        way?
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord's behavior during his sharpest agonies is no cause of shame
          to us;
          <i
            >he wept, for he was man, but he murmured not, for he was sinless
            man</i
          >. He cried, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
          me;" for he was human, but he added, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but
          as you will," for his humanity was without taint of rebellion. In the
          depths of tribulation no repining word escaped him, for there was no
          repining in his heart. The Lord of martyrs witnessed a good
          confession. He was strengthened in the hour of peril, and came off
          more than a conqueror, as we also shall do, if we hold fast our
          confidence even to the end.

        Because he undertook to do the Father's will, and teach his truth, the

        to hatch up a lying accusation before they could commence their sham
        trial of him. The bottom of the quarrel was, that God was with him, and
        he with God, while the Scribes and Pharisees sought only their own
        honor.

        to die frequently had their faces covered as they were dragged away from
        the judge's seat, as was the case with the wicked Haman in Esther 7:8:
        after this fashion they first covered our Lord with a veil of
        opprobrious accusation, and then hurried him away to be crucified.
        <p align="justify">
          Moreover, they passed him through the trial of cruel mockings,
          besmeared his face with spittle, and covered it with bruises, so that
