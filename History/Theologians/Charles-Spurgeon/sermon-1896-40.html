          12. And thou, O Jehovah! shalt dwell for ever; and the memorial of
          thee from generation to generation.13. Thou shalt arise, and have
          mercy upon Zion; for the time to pity her, for the appointed time, is
          come.14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and will have
          compassion upon her dust.

          12. And thou, O Jehovah! shalt dwell for ever When the prophet, for
          his own encouragement, sets before himself the eternity of God, it
          seems, at first sight, to be a far-fetched consolation; for what
          benefit will accrue to us from the fact that God sits immutable on his
          heavenly throne, when, at the same time, our frail and perishing
          condition does not permit us to continue unmoved for a single moment?
          And, what is more, this knowledge of the blessed repose enjoyed by God
          enables us the better to perceive that our life is a mere illusion.
          But the inspired writer, calling to remembrance the promises by which
          God had declared that he would make the Church the object of his
          special care, and particularly that remarkable article of the
          covenant, "I will dwell in the midst of you," (Exodus 25:8) and,
          trusting to that sacred and indissoluble bond, has no hesitation in
          representing all the godly languishing, though they were in a state of
          suffering and wretchedness, as partakers of this celestial glory in
          which God dwells. The word memorial is also to be viewed in the same
          light. What advantage would we derive from this eternity and
          immutability of God's being, unless we had in our hearts the knowledge
          of him, which, produced by his gracious covenant, begets in us the
          confidence arising from a mutual relationship between him and us? The
          meaning then is, "We are like withered grass, we are decaying every
          moment, we are not far from death, yea rather, we are, as it were,
          already dwelling in the grave; but since thou, O God! hast made a
          covenant with us, by which thou hast promised to protect and defend
          thine own people, and hast brought thyself into a gracious relation to
          us, giving us the fullest assurance that thou wilt always dwell in the
          midst of us, instead of desponding, we must be of good courage; and
          although we may see only ground for despair if we depend upon
          ourselves, we ought nevertheless to lift up our minds to the heavenly
          throne, from which thou wilt at length stretch forth thy hand to help
          us." Whoever is in a moderate degree acquainted with the sacred
          writings, will readily acknowledge that whenever we are besieged with
          death, in a variety of forms, we should reason thus: As God continues
          unchangeably the same -- "without variableness or shadow of turning"
          -- nothing can hinder him from aiding us; and this he will do, because
          we have his word, by which he has laid himself under obligation to us,
          and because he has deposited with us his own memorial, which contains
          in it a sacred and indissoluble bond of fellowship.

          13. Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion. We have here the
          conclusion drawn from the truth stated in the preceding verse -- God
          is eternal, and therefore he will have compassion upon Zion. God's
          eternity is to be considered as impressed upon the memorial, or word,
          by which he has brought himself under obligation to maintain our
          welfare. Besides, as he is not destitute of the power, and as it is
          impossible for him to deny himself, we ought not to entertain any
          apprehension of his failing to accomplish, in his own time, what he
          has promised. We have observed, in another place, that, the verb to
          arise refers to what is made apparent to the eye of sense; for
          although he continues always immutable, yet, in putting forth his
          power, he manifests his majesty by the external act, as it is termed.

          When the prophet treats of the restoration of the Church, he sets
          forth the divine mercy as its cause. He represents this mercy under a
          twofold aspect, and therefore employs different words. In the first
          place, as in the matter under consideration, the good deserts of men
          are entirely out of the question, and as God cannot be led from any
          cause external to himself to build up his Church, the prophet traces
          the cause of it solely to the free goodness of God. In the second
          place, he contemplates this mercy as connected with the Divine
          promises. Thou shalt have mercy upon Zion, for the time appointed,
          according to thy good pleasure, is come Meanwhile, it is to be
          observed that, in magnifying the Divine mercy, his design was to teach
          true believers that their safety depended on it alone. But we must now
          attend to what time is alluded to. The word mvd, moed, signifies all
          kind of fixed or appointed days. There is, then, beyond all doubt, a
          reference to the prophecy of Jeremiah, recorded in Jeremiah 29:10, and
          repeated in the last chapter of the Second Book of Chronicles, at the
          21st verse. That the faithful might not sink into despondency, through
          the long continuance of their calamities, they needed to be supported
          by the hope that an end to their captivity had been appointed by God,
          and that it would not extend beyond seventy years. Daniel was employed
          in meditating on this very topic, when "he set his face unto the Lord
          God, to seek, by prayer and supplications," the re-establishment of
          the Church, (Daniel 9:2) In like manner, the object now aimed at by
          the prophet was to encourage both himself and others to confidence in
          prayer, putting God in mind of this remarkable prophecy, as an
          argument to induce him to bring to a termination their melancholy
          captivity. And surely if, in our prayers, we do not continually
          remember the Divine promises, we only cast forth our desires into the
          air like smoke. It is, however, to be observed, that although the time
          of the promised deliverance was approaching, or had already arrived,
          yet the prophet does not cease from the exercise of prayer, to which
          God stirs us up by means of his word. And although the time was fixed,
          yet he calls upon God, for the performance of his covenant, in such a
          manner, as that he is still betaking himself to his free goodness
          alone; for the promises by which God brings himself under obligation
          to us do not, in any degree, obscure his grace.

          14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones To restrict this to
          Cyrus and Darius is altogether unsuitable. It is not at all wonderful
          to find the Jewish doctors hunting, with excessive eagerness, after
          foolish subtilties; but I am surprised that some of our modern
          commentators subscribe to such a poor and cold interpretation. I am
          aware that, in some places, the unbelieving and the wicked are called
          the servants of God, as in Jeremiah 25:9, because God makes use of
          them as instruments for executing his judgments. Nay, I admit that
          Cyrus is called by name God's chosen servant, (Isaiah 44:28) but the
          Holy Spirit would not have bestowed so honorable a title, either on
          him or Darius, without some qualification. Besides, it is probable
          that this psalm was composed before the edict was published, which
          granted the people liberty to return to their native country. It
          therefore follows, that God's people alone are included in the
          catalogue of his servants, because it is their purpose, during the
          whole of their life, to obey his will in all things. The prophet, I
          have no doubt, speaks in general of the whole Church, intimating that
          this was not the wish entertained merely by one man, but was shared by
          the whole body of the Church. The more effectually to induce God to
          listen to his prayer, he calls upon all the godly, who were then in
          the world, to join with him in the same request. It, unquestionably,
          very much contributes to increase the confidence of success, when
          supplications are made by all the people of God together, as if in the
          person of one man, according to what the Apostle Paul declares,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ye also, helping together by prayer for us, that, for the gift
          bestowed upon us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by
          many on our behalf." (2 Corinthians 1:11)
        </p>
        <p>
          Farther, when the deformed materials which remained of the ruins of
          the temple and city are emphatically termed the stones of Zion, this
          is designed to intimate, not only that the faithful in time past were
          affected with the outward splendor of the temple, when, besides
          attracting the eyes of men, it had power to ravish with admiration all
          their senses, but also, that although the temple was destroyed, and
          nothing was to be seen where it stood but hideous desolation, yet
          their attachment to it continued unalterable, and they acknowledged
          the glory of God, in its crumbling stones and decayed rubbish. As the
          temple was built by the appointment of God, and as he had promised its
          restoration, it was, doubtless, proper and becoming that the godly
          should not withdraw their affections from its ruins. Meanwhile, as an
          antidote against the discouraging influence of the taunting mockery of
          the heathen, they required to look into the Divine word for something
          else than what presented itself to their bodily eyes. Knowing that the
          very site of the temple was consecrated to God, and that that sacred
          edifice was to be rebuilt on the same spot, they did not cease to
          regard it with reverence, although its stones lay in disorder,
          mutilated and broken, and heaps of useless rubbish were to be seen
          scattered here and there. The sadder the desolation is to which the
          Church has been brought, the less ought our affections to be alienated
          from her. Yea, rather, this compassion which the faithful then
          exercised, ought to draw from us sighs and groans; and would to God
          that the melancholy description in this passage were not so applicable
          to our own time as it is! He, no doubt, has his churches erected in
          some places, where he is purely worshipped; but, if we cast our eyes
          upon the whole world, we behold his word every where trampled under
          foot, and his worship defiled by countless abominations. Such being
          the case, his holy temple is assuredly every where demolished, and in
          a state of wretched desolation; yea, even those small churches in
          which he dwells are torn and scattered. What are these humble
          erections, when compared with that splendid edifice described by
          Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah? But no desolation ought to prevent us
          from loving the very stones and dust of the Church. Let us leave the
          Papists to be proud of their altars, their huge buildings, and their
          other exhibitions of pomp and splendor; for all that heathenish
          magnificence is nothing else but an abomination in the sight of God
          and his angels, whereas the ruins of the true temple are sacred.
