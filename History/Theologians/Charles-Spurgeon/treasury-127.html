          TITLE AND SUBJECT. This brief but spirited Psalm is entitled "A Song
          of Degrees of David", and thus we are informed as go its author, and
          the occasion for which it was designed: David wrote it for the people
          to sing at the time of their goings up to the holy feasts at
          Jerusalem. It comes third in the series, and appears to be suitable to
          be sung when the people had entered the gates, and their feet stood
          within the city. It was most natural that they should sing of
          Jerusalem itself, and invoke peace and prosperity upon the Holy City,
          for it was the center of their worship, and the place where the Lord
          revealed himself above the mercy seat. Possibly the city was not all
          built in David's day, but he wrote under the spirit of prophecy, and
          spoke of it as it would be in the age of Solomon; a poet has license
          to speak of things, not only as they are, but as they will be when
          they come to their perfection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Jerusalem, or the Habitation of Peace, is used as the key word of this
          Psalm, wherein we have in the original many happy allusions to the
          <i>salem</i>, or peace, which they implored upon Jerusalem. When they
          stood within the triple walls, all things around the pilgrims helped
          to explain the words which they sang within her ramparts of strength.
          One voice led the Psalm with its personal "I," but ten thousand
          brethren and companions united with the first musician and swelled the
          chorus of the strain.<br />

        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 1. I was glad when they said unto me: Let us go into the house
            of the LORD.
          </p></b
        >
        Good children are pleased to go home, and glad to hear their brothers
        and sisters call them thither. David's heart was in the worship of God,
        and he was delighted when he found others inviting him to go where his
        desires had already gone: it helps the ardor of the most ardent to hear
        others inviting them to a holy duty. The word was not "go, "but "let us
        go"; hence the ear of the Psalmist found a double joy in it. He was glad
        for the sake of others: glad that they wished to go themselves, glad
        that they had the courage and liberality to invite others. He knew that
        it would do them good; nothing better can happen to men and their
        friends than to love the place where God's honor dwells.
        <p align="justify">
          What a glorious day shall that be when many people shall go and say,
          "Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of
          the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk
          in his paths."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But David was glad for his own sake: he loved the invitation to the
          holy place, he delighted in being called to go to worship in company,
          and, moreover, he rejoiced that godly people thought enough of him to
          extend their invitation to him. Some men would have been offended, and
          would have said, "Mind your own business. Let my religion alone;" but
          not so King David, though he had mote dignity than any of us, and less
          need to be reminded of his duty. He was not <i>teased </i>but
          <i>pleased </i>by being pressed to attend holy services. He was glad
          to go into the house of the Lord, glad to go in holy company, glad to
          find godly men and women willing to have him in their society.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He may have been sad before, but this happy suggestion cheered him up:
          he pricked up his ears, as the proverb puts it, at the very mention of
          his Father's house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is it so with us? Are we glad when others invite us to public worship,
          or to church fellowship? Then we shall be glad when the spirits above
          shall call us to the house of the Lord not made with hands, eternal in
          the heavens.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we are glad to be called by others to our Father's house, how much
          more glad shall we be actually to go there. We love our Lord, and
          therefore we love his house, and pangs of strong desire are upon us
          that we may soon reach the eternal abode of his glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An aged saint: when dying, cheered herself with this evidence of
          grace, for she cried, "I have loved the habitation of your house, and
          the place where your honor dwells," and therefore she begged that she
          might join the holy congregation of those who forever behold the King
          in his beauty. Our gladness at the bare thought of being in God's
          house is detective as to our character, and prophetic of our being one
          day happy in the Father's house on high.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a sweet Sabbath Psalm is this! In prospect of the Lord's day, and
          all its hallowed associations, our soul rejoices. How well, also, may
          it refer to the, church! We are happy when we see numerous bands ready
          to unite themselves with the people of God. The pastor is specially
          glad when many come forward and ask of him assistance in entering into
          fellowship with the church. No language is more cheering to him than
          the humble request, "Let us go into the house of the Lord."
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem
          </p></b
        >; or, better, "our feet are standing." The words imply present and
        joyous standing within the walls of the city of peace; or perhaps the
        pilgrims felt so sure of getting there that they antedated the joy, and
        spoke as if they were already there, though they were as yet only on the
        road.
        <p align="justify">
          If we are within the church we may well triumph in the fact. While our
          feet are standing in Jerusalem our lips may well be singing. Outside
          the gates all is danger, and one day all will be destruction; but
          within the gates all is safely, seclusion, serenity, salvation, and
          glory. The gates are opened that we may pass in, and they are only
          shut that our enemies may not follow us. The Lord loves the gates of
          Zion, and so do we when we are enclosed within them. What a choice
          favor, to be a citizen of the New Jerusalem! Why are we so greatly
          favored? Many feet are running the downward road, or kicking against
          the pricks, or held by snares, or sliding to an awful fall; but our
          feet, through grace divine, are "standing"—an honorable posture,
          "within your gates, O Jerusalem"—an honorable position, and there
          shall they stand forever—an honorable future.

            Verse 3. Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together.
          </p></b
        >David saw in vision the city built; no more a waste, or a mere
        collection of tents, or a city upon paper, commenced but not completed.
        God's mercy to the Israelitish nation allowed of peace and plenty,
        sufficient for the uprise and perfecting of its capital: that City
        flourished in happy times, even as the church is only built up when all
        the people of God are prospering. Thanks be to God, Jerusalem is built:
        the Lord by his glorious appearing has built up Zion. Furthermore, it is
        not erected as a set of booths, or a conglomeration of hovels, but as a
        city, substantial, architectural, designed, arranged, and defended.
        <p align="justify">
          The church is a permanent and important institution, founded on a
          rock, built with art, and arranged with wisdom. The city of God had
          this peculiarity about it, that it was not a long, straggling street,
          or a city of magnificent distances (as some mere skeleton places have
          been styled), but the allotted space was filled, the buildings were a
          solid block, a massive unity: this struck the dwellers in villages,
          and conveyed to them the idea of close neighborhood, sure standing,
          and strong defense. No quarter could be surprised and sacked while
          other portions of the town were unaware of the assault: the ramparts
          surrounded every part of the metropolis, which was singularly one and
          indivisible. There was no flaw in this diamond of the world, this
          pearl of cities.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In a church one of the most delightful conditions is the compactness
          of unity: "one Lord, one faith, one baptism." A church should be one
          in creed and one in heart, one in testimony and one in service, one in
          aspiration and one in sympathy. They greatly injure our Jerusalem who
          would build dividing walls within her; she needs compacting, not
          dividing. There is no joy in going up to a church which is rent with
          internal dissension: the gladness of holy men is aroused by the
          adhesiveness of love, the unity of life; it would be their sadness if
          they saw the church to be a house divided against itself. Some bodies
          of Christians appear to be periodically blown to fragments, and no
          gracious man is glad to be in the way when the explosions take place:
          thither the tribes do not go up, for strife and contention are not
          attractive forces.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 4. Where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD.
          </p></b
        >
        When there is unity within there will be gatherings from without: the
        tribes go up to a compact center. Note that Israel was one people, but
        yet it was in a sense divided by the mere surface distinction of tribes;
        and this may be a lesson to us that
        <i
          >all Christendom is essentially one, though from various causes we are
          divided into tribes</i
        >. Let us as much as possible sink the tribal individuality in the
        national unity, so that the church may be many waves, but one sea; many
        branches, but one tree; many members, but one body.
        <p align="justify">
          Observe that the tribes were all of them the Lord's; whether Judah or
          Benjamin, Manasseh or Ephraim, they were all the Lord's. Oh that all
          the regiments of the Christian army may be all and equally the Lord's
          own, alike chosen, redeemed, accepted, and upheld by Jehovah.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Unto the testimony of Israel.</p></b>They went up
        to the holy city to hear and to bear testimony. Everything in the temple
        was a testimony unto the Lord, and the annual journeys of the tribes to
        the hallowed shrine partook of the same testifying character, for these
        journeys were Israel's open avowal that Jehovah was their God, and that
        he was the one only living and true God. When we assemble on the Sabbath
        a large part of our business is giving out and receiving testimony: we
        are God's witnesses; all the tribes of the one church of Jesus Christ
        bear witness unto the Lord.
        <b> <p align="justify">To give thanks unto the name of the LORD.</p></b
        >Another part of our delightful duty is to praise the Lord. Sacred
        praise is a chief design of the assembling of ourselves together. All
        Israel had been fed by the fruit of the field, and they went up to give
        thanks unto the name of their great Gardener. We, too, have countless
        mercies, and it becomes us unitedly in our solemn gatherings to magnify
        the name of our loving Lord. Testimony should be mingled with thanks,
        and thanks with testimony, for in combination they bless both God and
        man, and tend to spread themselves over the hearts of our companions;
        who, seeing our joyful gratitude, are the more inclined to hearken to
        our witness bearing.
        <p align="justify">
          Here, then, was part of the cause of the gladness of the pious
          Israelite when he had an invitation to join the caravan which was
          going to Zion: he would there meet with representatives of all the
          clans of his nation, and aid them in the double object of their holy
          assemblies, namely, testimony and thanksgiving. The very anticipation
          of such delightful engagements filled him to overflowing with sacred
          gladness.

            Verse 5. For there are set thrones of judgment.
          </p></b
        >
        If discontented with the petty judgments of their village lords, the
        people could bring their hard matters to the royal seat, and the beloved
        King would be sure to decide aright; for the judgment thrones were
        <b>The thrones of the house of David</b>. We who come to the church and
        its public worship are charmed to come to the throne of God, and to the
        throne of the reigning Savior.
        <p align="justify">
          "He reigns! You saints, exalt your strains:<br />
          Your God is King, your Father reigns:<br />
          And he is at the Father's side,<br />
          The Man of love, the Crucified."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To a true saint the throne is never more amiable than in its judicial
          capacity; righteous men love judgment, and are glad that right will be
          rewarded and iniquity will be punished. To see God reigning in the Son
          of David and evermore avenging the just cause is a thing which is good
          for weeping eyes, and cheering for disconsolate hearts. They sang of
          old as they went towards the throne, and so do we.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice." The throne of judgment is
          not removed, but firmly "set, "and there it shall remain until the
          work of justice is accomplished, and truth and right are set on the
          throne with their King. Happy people to be under so glorious a rule.

        >Peace was her name, pray that her condition may verify her title. Abode
        of Peace, peace be to you. Here was a most sufficient reason for
        rejoicing at the thought of going up to the house of the Lord, since
        that sacred shrine stood in the center of an area of peace: well might
        Israel pray that such peace should be continued.
        <p align="justify">
          In a church peace is to be desired, expected, promoted, and enjoyed.
          If we may not say "Peace at any price," yet we may certainly cry
          "Peace at the highest price." Those who are daily fluttered by crude
          alarms are charmed to reach their nest in a holy fellowship, and abide
          in it. In a church one of the main ingredients of success is internal
          peace: strife, suspicion, party spirit, division—these are deadly
          things. Those who break the peace of the church deserve to suffer, and
          those who sustain it win a great blessing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Peace in the church should be our daily prayer, and in so praying we
          shall bring down peace upon ourselves; for the Psalmist goes on to
          say, <b>They shall prosper that love you</b>, or, perhaps we may read
          it as a prayer, "May they have peace that love you." Whether the
          passage be regarded as a promise or as a prayer matters not, for
          prayer pleads the promise, and the promise is the ground of prayer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prosperity of soul is already enjoyed by those who take a deep
          interest in the church and cause of God: they are men of peace, and
          find peace in their holy endeavors. God's people pray for them, and
          God himself delights in them. Prosperity of worldly condition often
          comes to the lovers of the church if they are able to bear it: many a
          time the house of Obed-Edom is blessed because of the ark of the Lord.
          Because the Egyptian midwives feared the Lord, therefore the Lord made
          them houses. No man shall ever be a permanent loser by the house of
          the Lord: in peace of heart alone. If in nothing else, we find
          recompense enough for all that we can do in promoting the interests of
          Zion.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 7. Peace be within your walls.</p></b> See
        how the poet personifies the church, and speaks to it: his heart is with
        Zion, and therefore his conversation runs in that direction. A second
        time is the sweet favor of peace earnestly sought after: "There is none
        like it, give it to me." Walls were needed to keep out the foe, but it
        was asked of the Lord that those walls might prove sufficient for her
        security. May the munitions of rock so securely defend the city of God
        that no intruder may ever enter within her enclosure. May her ramparts
        repose in safety. Three walls environed her, and thus she had a trinity
        of security.
        <b> <p align="justify">And prosperity within your palaces</p></b>, or
        "Repose within your palaces." Peace is prosperity; there can be no
        prosperity which is not based on peace, nor can there long be peace if
        prosperity be gone, for <i> decline of grace breeds decay of love</i>.
        We wish for the church rest from internal dissension and external
        assault: war is not her element, but we read of old, "Then had the
        churches rest; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort
        of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied."
        <p align="justify">
          Observe that our Jerusalem is a city of palaces: kings dwell within
          her walls, and God himself is there. The smallest Church is worthy of
          higher honor than the greatest confederacies of nobles. The order of
          the New Jerusalem is of more repute in Heaven than the knights of the
          Golden Fleece. For the sake of all the saintly spirits which inhabit
          the city of God we may well entreat for her the blessings of lasting
          peace and abounding prosperity.

          It is for the good of every Christian, yes, of every man, that there

          our common philanthropy assist our religious prayer. By a flourishing
          church our children, our neighbors, our fellow countrymen are likely
          to be blessed. Moreover, we cannot but pray for a cause with which our
          dearest relatives and choicest friends are associated: if they labor
          for it, we must and will pray for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here peace is mentioned for the third time. Are not these frequent
          threes some hint of the Trinity? It would be hard to believe that the
          triple form of so many parts of the Old Testament is merely
          accidental. At least, the repetition of the desire displays the
          writer's high valuation of the blessing mentioned; he would not again
          and again have invoked peace had he not perceived its extreme
          desirableness.

        place wherein he reveals his glory. Well may we seek her good within
        whose walls there dwells God who alone is good. We are to live for God's
        cause, and to be ready to die for it. First we love it (Psalm 122:6) and
        then we labor for it, as in this passage: we see its good, and then seek
        its good.

          If we can do nothing else we can intercede for it. Our covenant
          relation to Jehovah as our God binds us to pray for his people—they
          are "the house of the Lord our God." If we honor our God we desire the
          prosperity of the church which he has chosen for his indwelling.

          Lord's service. He goes with them and rejoices, and then he turns his
          delight into devotion, and intercedes for the city of the great King.
          O church of the living God, we hail your assemblies, and on bended
          knee we pray that you may have peace and felicity. May our Jehovah so
          send it. Amen.
