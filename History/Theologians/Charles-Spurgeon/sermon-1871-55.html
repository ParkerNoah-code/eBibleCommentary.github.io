        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1022)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Let us not sleep, as do others." -- 1 Thessalonians 5:6.</p>
        <p>
          WE DO NOT usually sleep towards the things of this world. We rise up
          early, and sit up late, and eat the bread of carefulness, for Mammon's
          sake. In this age of competition, most men are wide enough awake for
          their temporal interests; but, so is it, partly through our being in
          this body, and partly through our dwelling in a sinful world, that we
          are all of us very apt to sleep concerning the interests of our souls.
          We drive like Jehu for this present world, but loiter for the world to
          come. Nothing so much concerns us as eternity, and yet nothing so
          little affects us. We work for the present world, and we play with the
          world to come. Quaint old Quarles long ago likened us to roebucks as
          to earth, and snails as to hearer; and then he oddly enough rebuked
          this fault in rugged verse: --
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, when we leave the world and come to thee,</p>
        <p>How dull, how slur, are we!</p>
        <p>How backward! How prepost'rous is the motion</p>
        <p>Of our ungain devotion!</p>
        <p>Our thoughts are millstones, and our souls are lead,</p>
        <p>And our desires are dead:</p>
        <p>Our vows are fairly promis'd, faintly paid,</p>
        <p>Or broken, or not made.</p>
        <p>* * * * * * *</p>
        <p>Is the road fair, we loiter; clogged with mire,</p>
        <p>We stick or else retire;</p>
        <p>A lamb appeals a lion, and we fear</p>
        <p>Each bush we see's a bear.</p>
        <p>When our dull souls direct our thoughts to thee,</p>
        <p>As slow as snails are we;</p>
        <p>But at the earth we dart our winged desire,</p>
        <p>We burn -- we burn like fire!"</p>
        <p>
          A piece of news about a fire in another continent makes a sensation in
          all our homes, but the fire that never shall be quenched is heard of
          almost without emotion. The discovery of a gold-field will affect half
          the markets in the world, and send a thrill through the public pulse;
          but when we speak of that blessed city where the streets are of gold,
          how coolly men take it all, regarding it as though it were a pretty
          fiction, and as it only the things which are seen were worthy of their
          notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sleep when heavenly things and eternal things are before us. Alas!
          that it should be so. Even those choice spirits which have been
          awakened by the Holy Ghost, and not only awakened into life, but
          aroused into ardor, have to complain that their fervor very frequently
          is chilled. I was recommended to try a pillow of hops to obtain sleep
          during my late illness, but I find now that I want a waking pillow
          rather than a sleeping pillow; and I am of the same mired as that
          ancient saint who preferred a roaring devil to a sleepy devil. How
          earnest, how diligent, how watchful, how heavenly ought he to be, but
          how much are we the reverse of all this. When in this respect we would
          do good, evil is present with us. We would have our hearts like a
          furnace for Christ, and, behold, the coals refuse to burn. We would be
          living pillars of light and fire, but we rather resemble smoke and
          mist. Alas! alas! alas! that when we would mount highest, our wings
          are clipped, and when we would serve God best, the evil heart of
          unbelief mars the labor. I knew it would be seasonable -- I hoped it
          might be profitable if I spake a little to you to-night, and to myself
          in so doing, concerning the need that there is, that we shake
          ourselves from slumber, and leave the sluggard's couch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend to take the text in reference first to those who are born
          again from the dead, and secondly, in reference to those who are still
          in the terrors slumber of their sin; and I shall gather my
          illustrations to-night from no remote region, but from the self-same
          Word of God, from which I take the text. The text says, "Let Us not
          sleep, as do others." We will mention some "others," whose histories
          are recorded in Scripture, who have slept to their own injury, and I
          pray you let them be warnings to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, to those of you who are THE PEOPLE OF GOD, let me say, "Let
          us not sleep, as do others."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, let us not sleep as those disciples did who went with their
          Lord to the garden, and fell a slumbering while he was agonizing. Let
          us not be as the eight who slept at a distance, nor as the
          highly-favored three, who were admitted into the more secret chamber
          of our Lord's woes, and were allowed to tread the precincts of the
          most holy place where he poured out his soul, and sweat as it were
          great drops of blood. He found them sleeping, and though he awakened
          them, they slept again and again. "What, could ye not watch with me
          one hour?" was his gentle expostulation. They were slumbering for
          sorrow. Though our Lord might in our case make an excuse for us as he
          did for them -- "The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak,"
          -- let us endeavor by his grace not to need such an apology, by
          avoiding their fault. "Let us not sleep, as do others." But, beloved
          fellow Christians, are not the most of us sleeping as the apostles
          did? Behold our Master's zeal for the salvation of the sons of men!
          Throughout all his life, he seemed to have no rest. From the moment
          when his ministry began he was ever toiling, laboring, denying
          himself. It was his meat and his drink to do the will of him that sent
          him. Truly he might have taken for his life's motto, -- "Wist ye not
          that I must be about my Father's business?" So intent was he on saving
          souls, that he counted not his life dear unto him. He would lay it
          down, and that amidst circumstances of the greatest pain and ignominy;
          anything and everything would he do to seek and to save that which was
          lost. Zeal for his chosen church, which was God's house, had eaten him
          up: for his people's sakes he could bear all the reproaches of them
          that reproached God, and though that reproach broke his heart, yet
          still he persevered and ceased not till salvation's work was done. He
          was incessant in toil and suffering, but, what are we?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is our Lord, our great Exemplar, before us now. Behold him in
          Gethsemane! imagination readily sees him amid the olives. I might say,
          that his whole life was pictured in that agony in the garden, for in a
          certain sense it was all an agony. It was all a sweating, not such as
          distils from those who purchase the staff of life by the sweat of
          their face, but such as he must feel who purchased life itself with
          the agony of his heart. The Saviour, as I see him throughout the whole
          of his ministry, appears to me on his knees pleading, and before his
          God agonising -- laying out his life for the sons of men. But,
          brethren, do I speak harshly when I say that the disciples asleep are
          a fit emblem of our usual life? As compared or rather contrasted with
          our Master, I fear it is so. Where is our zeal for God? Where is our
          compassion for men? Do we ever feel the weight of souls as we ought to
          feel it? Do are ever melt in the presence of the terrors of God which
          we know to be coming upon others? Have we realised the passing away of
          an immortal spirit to the judgment bar of God? Have we felt pangs and
          throes of sympathy when we have remembered that multitudes of our
          fellow creatures have received, as their eternal sentence, the words
          -- "Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire in hell, prepared for the
          devil and his angels?" Why, if these thoughts really possessed us, we
          should scarce sleep; if they became as real to us as they were to him,
          we should wrestle with God for souls as he did, and become willing to
          lay down our lives, if by any means we might save some. I see by the
          we of faith, at this moment, Jesus pleading at the mercy-seat. "For
          Zion's sake," he saith, "I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
          sake I will not rest;" and yet, we around him lie asleep, without
          self-denying activity, and almost without prayer, missing
          opportunities, or, when opportunities for doing good have been seized,
          using them with but a slothful hand, and doing the work of the Lord,
          if not deceitfully, yet most sluggishly. Brethren, "let us not sleep,
          as do others." If it be true that the Christian Church is to a great
          extent asleep, the more reason why we should be awake; and, if it be
          true, as I fear it is, that we have ourselves slumbered and slept, the
          more reason now that we should arise and trim our lamps, and go forth
          to meet the Bridegroom. Let us from this moment begin to serve our
          Master and his church more nearly after the example which he himself
          has set us in his consecrated life and blessed death. Let us not sleep
          then, as did the disciples at Gethsemane.
        </p>
        <p>"O thou, who in the garden's shade,</p>
        <p>Didst wake thy weary ones again,</p>
        <p>Who slumbered at that fearful hour,</p>
        <p>Forgetful of thy pain;</p>
        <p>Bend o'er us now, as over them</p>
        <p>And set our sleep-bound spirits free;</p>
        <p>Nor leave us slumbering in the watch</p>
        <p>Our souls should keep with thee!"</p>
        <p>
          2. A second picture we select from that portion of the inspired page
          which tells us of Samson. Let us not sleep, as that ancient Hebrew
          hero did, who, while he slept, lost his locks, lost his strength,
          by-and-by lost his liberty, lost his eyes, and ultimately lost his
          life. I have spoken under the first head of our slumbering in respect
          to others; but, here, I come to ourselves. In our slumbering with
          respect to ourselves, Samson is the sad picture of many professors. We
          are about to sketch a portrait of one whom we knew in years gone by.
          He was "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might." Years ago,
          the man we picture -- and it is no fancy portrait, for we have seen
          many such -- when the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, did mighty
          things, and we looked on and wondered, yea, we envied him, and we
          said, "Would God we had an hour of such strength as has fallen upon
          him." He was the leader among the weak, and often infused courage into
          faint hearts; but where is he now? All our Israel knew him, for his
          name was a tower of strength; and our enemies knew him too, for he was
          a valiant man in battle. Where is this hero now? We hear little of him
          now in the fields of service where once he glorified his God and smote
          the enemies of Israel; we do not meet him now at the prayermeeting, or
          in the Sunday-school, or at the evangelist station. We hear nothing of
          his seeking for souls. Surely, he has gone to sleep. He thinks that he
          has much spiritual goods laid up for many years, and he is now taking
          his rest. He has had his share, he says, of labor, and the time has
          come now for him to take a little ease. It is our loss and his peril
          that he has allowed himself to fall into such a drowsy condition. O
          that we could bestir him!
        </p>
        <p>"Break his bonds of sleep asunder --</p>
        <p>Rouse him with a peal of thunder."</p>
        <p>
          Alas! carnal security is a Delilah always. It gives us many a dainty
          kiss, and lulls us into tranquil slumbers which we imagine to be God's
          own peace, whereas the peace of fascination and of satanic enchantment
          is upon us. Yes, we have seen the good man: we could not doubt that he
          had been both good and great: yet we have seen him lying asleep. And,
          perhaps, some of us who have never been so distinguished or done so
          much, though, nevertheless, in our own small way we have done
          something for God, and yet we too lie in Delilah's lap. Blessed be his
          name who has not suffered us to lead quite a useless life; but
          possibly we are degenerating and getting now to take things more
          easily than we did. In our fancied wisdom, we half rebuke what we call
          our "juvenile zeal." We are prudent now and wise; would God we were
          not prudent and not wise, and were as foolish as we used to be when we
          loved our God with zeal so great, that nothing was hard and nothing
          was difficult, if we were called upon to do it for his name's sake.
          Now, what do I see in Samson while he lies asleep in Delilah's lap. I
          see peril of the deadliest sort. The Philistines are not asleep. When
          the good man slumbers and ceases to watch, Satan does not slumber, and
          temptations do not cease to waylay him. There are the Philistines
          looking on, while you see the razor softly stealing over the
          champion's head. Those locks, bushy end black as a raven, fall thickly
          on the ground; one by one the razor shears them all away till the
          Nazarite has lost the hair of his consecration. I am terribly fearful
          lest this should happen to ourselves. Our strength lies in our faith.
          That is our Samsonian lock. Take that away, and we are as weak as
          other men, ay, and weaker still; for Samson was weaker than the
          weakest when his hair was gone, though aforetime stronger than the
          strongest. By degrees, it may be, Satan is stealing away all our
          spiritual strength. Oh! if it be my case, I shall come up into this
          pulpit and I shall preach to you, and shake myself, as I have done
          aforetime, and perhaps expect to see sinners saved, but there will be
          none. And, possibly, some of you also, when you awake a little, will
          go forth to preach in the streets or to seek after men's souls as you
          have done before, but, alas, you will find the Philistines will bind
          you, and that your strength has passed away while you slept; your
          glory has gone -- gone amidst the deluding dreams which lulled you --
          gone not to come back except with bitterest grief, with eyes, perhaps,
          put out for ever. Many backsliders will die thanking God, if ever
          their strength returns to them, and perhaps it never may till their
          dying hour. Oh, brethren! warned by what has happened, not to Samson
          only, but to many of the Lord's greatest champions, "Let us not sleep,
          as do others."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now we change the picture again. It is the same subject under other
          forms. You remember our Saviour's parable concerning the tares and the
          wheat. There was an enclosure which was reserved for wheat only, but,
          while men slept, the enemy came and sowed tares among the good corn.
          Now, you who are members of the Church of Christ need not that I
          should enter into a full explanation of the parable; neither is this
          the time, but it will suffice to say that when false doctrines and
          unholy practices have crept into a church, the secret cause of the
          mischief has usually been that the church itself was asleep. Those who
          ought to have been watchmen, and to have guarded the field, slept, and
          so the enemy had ample time to enter and scatter tares among the
          wheat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my last illustration spoke to you of your own dangers, this ought
          to appeal to you with equal force, because it concerns dangers
          incident to that which is dearest to you, I hope, of anything upon
          earth, namely, the church of the living God. An unwatchful church will
          soon become an unholy church. A church which does not carefully guard
          the truth as it is in Jesus, will become an unsound church, and,
          consequently, a degenerate church. It will grieve the Holier Spirit,
          and cause him to remove his power from the ministry and his presence
          from the ordinances. It will open the door for Satan, and he is quite
          sure to avail himself of every opportunity of doing mischief. I
          believe that the only way after all in any church, to purge out heresy
          in it, is by having more of the inner life; by this fire in Zion shall
          the chaff be burned up. When the constitution of a man is thoroughly
          sound, it throws out many of those diseases which otherwise would have
          lingered in his system; and good physicians sometimes do not attempt
          to touch the local disease but they do their best to strengthen the
          general constitution' and when that is right, then the cure is
          wrought. So, here and there, there may be a defalcation in the one
          point -- that of doctrine, or in the other -- as to an affair of
          practice; and so it may be necessary to deal with the disordered limb
          of doctrine, or you may have to cut out the cancer of an evil custom;
          but, as a rule, the main cure of a church comes by strengthening its
          inner life. When we live near to Jesus, when we drink from the
          fountain-head of eternal truth and purity, when we become personally
          true and pure, then our watchfulness is, under God, our safeguard, and
          heresy, false doctrine, and unclean profession are kept far away.
          Sleeping guards invite the enemy. He who leaves his door unlocked asks
          the thief to enter. Watchfulness is always profitable, and
          slothfulness is always dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Members of this church, I speak to you in particular, and forget for
          the moment that any others are present. We have enjoyed these many
          years the abiding dew of God's Spirit, shall we lose it? God has been
          in our midst, and thousands of souls, By, tens of thousands of souls
          have been brought to Jesus, and God has never taken away his hand, but
          it has been stretched out still; shall we by sinful slumber sin away
          this blessing? I am jealous over you with a holy jealousy. Trembling
          has taken hold on me, lest ye lose your first love. "Hold fast," O
          church, "that which thou hast received, that no man take thy crown."
          Our sins will grieve the Spirit; our sleepiness will vex the Holy One
          of Israel. Unless we wake up to more earnest prayerfulness and to
          closer fellowship with Christ, it may be we shall hear the sound such
          as Joseph us tells us was observed at the destruction of Jerusalem,
          when there was heard the rustling of wings and the voice that said
          "Let Us go hence." O Lord, though our sins deserve that thou shouldst
          forsake us, yet turn not away from us, for thy mercy sake! Tarry,
          Jehovah, for the sake of the precious blood! Tarry with us still!
          Depart not from us. We deserve that thou shouldst withdraw, but, oh!
          forsake not the people whom thou hast chosen! By all the love thou
          hast manifested towards us, continue thy lovingkindness to thine
          unworthy servants still. Is not that your prayer, you that love the
          Church of God? I know it is, not for this church only, but for all
          others where the power and presence of God have been felt. Pray
          continually for the church, but remember this is the practical
          exhortation arising out of it all -- "Let us not sleep, as do others,"
          lest in our case too, the enemy come and mar the harvest of our Master
          by sowing, tares among the wheat.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Only one other picture, and a very solemn one, still addressing
          myself to God's people. We are told that while the bridegroom tarried,
          the virgins who had gone out to meet him slumbered and slept. O virgin
          hearts! "Let us not sleep, as do others." When the cry was heard --
          "Behold, the bridegroom cometh," they were all slumbering, wise and
          foolish alike, O ye wise virgins who have oil in your vessels your
          lamps, "sleep not, as do others," lest the midnight cry come upon you
          unawares. The Lord Jesus may come in the night. He may come in the
          heavens with exceeding great power and glory, before the rising of
          another sun; or, he may tarry awhile, and yet though it should seem to
          us to be long, he will come quickly, for one day is with the Lord as a
          thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. Suppose, however, he
          were to come to-night; if now, instead of going along to your homes
          and seeing once more the streets busy with traffic, the sign of the
          Son of Man should be revealed in the air, because the king had come in
          his glory, and his holy angels with him, would you be ready? I press
          home the question. The Lord may suddenly come; are you ready? Are you
          ready? You who profess to be his saints -- are your loins girt up, and
          your lamps trimmed? Could you go in with him to the supper, as guests
          who have long expected him, and say, "Welcome, Welcome Son of God?"
          Have you not much to set in order? are there not still many things
          undone? Would you not be afraid to hear the midnight cry? Happy are
          those souls who live habitually with Jesus, who have given themselves
          up completely to the power of his indwelling Spirit -- who follow the
          Lamb whithersoever he goeth. "They shall walk with him in white for
          they are worthy." Wise are they who live habitually beneath the
          influence of the Second Advent, looking for and hasting unto the
          coming of the Son of God. We would have our window opened towards
          Jerusalem; we would sit as upon our watch-tower whole nights; we would
          be ready girt to go out of this Egypt at a moment's warning. We would
          be of that host of God who shall go out harnessed, in the time
          appointed, when the signal is given. God grant us grace to be found in
          that number in the day of his appearing; but, "Let us not sleep, as do
          others." I might say, let us not sleep as we have done ourselves. God
          forgive us and arouse us from this good hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel as if I did not want to go on to the second part of my subject
          at all, but were quite content to stand here and speak to you who love
          the Lord. Brethren and sisters, we must have an awakening among us. I
          feel within my soul that I must be awakened myself, and my oven
          necessities are, I believe, a very accurate gauge of what is wanted by
          the most of you. Shall our season of triumph, our march of victory,
          come to an end? Will you turn back after all that God has done for
          you? Will you limit the Holy One of Israel? Will you cease from the
          importunities of prayer? Will you pause in the labors of zeal? Will
          you bring dishonor upon Christ and upon his cross? By the living God
          who sleepeth not, neither is weary in his deeds of love, I beseech
          you, slumber not, and be not weary nor faint in your mind. "Be ye
          steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But I must pass on to the second part of our subject. I have now
          to speak TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT CONVERTED; and if I felt as I
          ought to feel, it would be sorrowful work even to remember that any of
          you are yet unsaved. I like to see these little children here. I pray
          God they may grow up to fear and love him, and that their young hearts
          may be given to our dear Lord and Master while they are yet boys and
          girls. But I overlook them just now, and speak to some of you who have
          had many years of intelligent hearing of the word, and are still
          unsaved. Pitiable objects! You do not think so; but I repeat the word,
          Pitiable objects! The tears which flood my eyes almost prevent my
          seeing you. You fancy you are very merry and happy, but you are to be
          pitied, for "the wrath of God abideth on you." "He that believeth not
          is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the Son of God."
          You will soon be where no pity can help you, and where the Lord
          himself will not help you. May God give you ears to hear the words of
          affectionate warning which I address to you now! "Let us not sleep, as
          do others."
        </p>
        <p>
          I beg you not to sleep, as did Jonah. He was in the vessel, you
          remember, when it was tossed with the tempest, and all the rest in the
          vessel were praying, but Jonah was asleep. Every man called upon his
          God except the man who had caused the storm. He was the most in
          danger, but he was the most careless. The ship-master and mate, and
          crew, all prayed, every man to his god, but Jonah carelessly slept on.
          Now, do you not some of you here live in houses where they all pray
          but you? You have a godly mother, but are yourself godless. John, you
          have a Christian father, and brothers and sisters, too, whom Christ
          has looked upon in love, and they pray for you continually. But the
          strange thing is, that your soul is the only one in the house which
          remains unblest, and yet you are the only one who feels no anxiety or
          fear about the matter. There are many of us in this house who can
          honestly say that we would give anything we have, if we could save
          your souls we do not know what we would not do, but we know we would
          do all in our power, if we could but reach your consciences and your
          hearts. I stand often in this pulpit almost wishing that I had never
          been born, because of the burden and distress it brings upon my soul
          to think of some of you who will die and be lost for ever. Lost,
          though you love to listen to the preacher! Lost, though you sometimes
          resolve to be saved! We are praying for you daily, but you, -- you are
          asleep! What do you, while we are preaching but criticise our words,
          as if we discoursed to you as a piece of display, and did not mean to
          plead as for life and death with you, that you would escape from the
          wrath to come. Observations will be made by the frivolous among you
          during the most solemn words, about some-one's dress or personal
          appearance. Vain minds will be gadding upon the mountains of folly,
          while those, who are not, by far, so immediately concerned, are
          troubled and have deep searchings of heart about those very souls. I
          believe God is going to send a revival into this place; I have that
          conviction growing upon me, but it may be that though the gracious
          wave may sweep over the congregation, it will miss you. It has missed
          you up to this hour. Around you all the door is wet, but you, like
          Gideon's fleece, are dry, and you sleep though the blessing comes not
          upon you, -- sleep though sleep involves a certain and approaching
          curse. O slumbering Jonah, in the name of the Host High, I would say
          to thee, "Awake thou that steepest, and call upon thy God.
          Peradventure, he shall deliver thee, and this great tempest shall yet
          be stayed." Yea, I would put it above a peradventure, for they that
          seek the Lord shall find him, if they seek him with full purpose of
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us change the illustration now, and take another. You remember
          Solomon's sluggard. What did he? It was morning, and the sun was up;
          ay, the dawning of the day had passed some hours, and he had not yet
          gone forth to labor. There was a knock at his door, and he opened his
          eyes a little; he listened and he said, "Leave me alone." "But will
          you never get up?" "Yes, I will be up soon; but I want a little more
          sleep -- only a little." Then came another knock, for his master would
          have him in the field at work; but he turned over again, and he
          grumbled within himself, and said, "A little more slumber." He slept
          hour after hour. Yes, but he did not mean to sleep hours; all he
          intended was to sleep five minutes; but minutes fly rapidly to men who
          dream. If at the first onset he had known that if he fell asleep he
          would slumber till noon, he would have been shocked at such abominable
          laziness. But what harm could it be just to turn over once more? Who
          would deny him another wink or two? Surely there can be no fault found
          with one more delicious doze? Now, there are in this congregation
          persons who have said to themselves many times, "That appeal is right.
          My conscience gives assent to that gospel demand, it shall be attended
          to very soon. I must, however, enjoy a little pleasure first -- not
          much. I do not mean to risk my soul another twelve months, but we will
          stay till next Sunday; then I shall have got over certain engagements
          which now stand in my way." Well, sirs, you know, some of you, that it
          has been Sabbath after Sabbath, and then it has grown to be year after
          year; and still you are saying a little more sleep and a little more
          slumber. I met one the other day: I do not see him here to-night, but
          I generally see him on the Sabbath. I think he heard the first sermon
          I preached in London; that is many years alto now. And that man loves
          me: I know he does; and I can say I love him; but if he dies as he is,
          he is a lost man. He knows it. He has told me so, and he has said,
          "Pray for me." But, oh! what is the benefit of my praying for him if
          he never prays for himself! It is grievous to know that many of you
          are in the same dreadful way of procrastinating and putting off. You
          would do anything to help the church, too; and if you knew that I
          needed anything you would be among the first to do it for me, such is
          your kindness. You are kind to your minister, but you are cruel to
          your souls. You have held your soul over hell's mouth for these twenty
          years by your continual delays and indecisions. Yet you never meant
          it. No, you thought long ago that you would have given your hearts to
          Christ. One of these days I shall have to bury you, and it will be
          with no hope of your future happiness, for it has always been, "A
          little more sleep, and a little more slumber, and a little more
          folding of the hands," till your "poverty shall come upon you as one
          that travelleth, and your want like an armed man." Alas! it shall be
          eternal poverty, and the armed man shall be the arch-destroyer from
          whom none can escape! O young man and young woman, do not
          procrastinate. Delay is the devil's great net, and it is filled wish
          exceeding great fishes; yet doth not the net break. Oh that you could
          break through it. May God help you to do it, for to you I would say,
          "Let us not," in this respect, "sleep, as do others."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the picture changes. Do you remember the story in the Acts of
          the Apostles of the young man who sat in the third loft while Paul was
          preaching? It could not have been a dull sermon, I should think; but
          Paul preached till midnight. That was rather long. You do not allow me
          such liberal time. And when Paul preached on, Eutychus went to sleep,
          until he fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead. It is true
          that Paul prayed, and he was restored to life by miracle; but I have
          known many a Eutychus fall dead under the word, but he was never known
          to live again. I do not mean that I have known many go to sleep in the
          house of God, and fall from the third loft; but this, that they have
          heard the word, and heard the word, till they have been preached into
          sleep of the deepest kind, and at last preached into hell. If we by
          our preaching do not wake you, we rock your cradles, and make you more
          insensible every time we warn you. The most startling preaching in a
          certain time ceases to arouse the hearers. You know the great boiler
          factories over here in Southwark. I am told that when a man goes
          inside the boiler to hold the hammer, when they are fixing rivets, the
          sound of the copper deafens him so that he cannot bear it, it is so
          horrible; but, after he has been a certain number of months in that
          employment, he hardly notices the hammering: he does not care about
          it. It is just so under the word. People go to sleep under that which
          once was like a thunderbolt to them. As the blacksmith's dog will lie
          under the anvil, where the sparks fly into his face, and yet go to
          sleep, so will many sinners sleep while the sparks of damnation fly
          into their faces. Horrible that it should be so. It would need an
          earthquake and a hurricane to move some of you stolid ones. I wish
          they would come if they would stir you; but even such terrors would be
          of no avail, only the trumpet which will arouse the dead will ever
          awaken you. Oh, dear hearers, remember that to perish under the gospel
          ministry is to perish with a vengeance. If I must be lost, let it be
          as a Zulu Kaffir, or as a Red Indian, who has never listened to the
          truth; but it is dreadful to go down to the pit with this as an
          aggravation: "You knew your duty, but you did it not; you heard the
          warning, but you would not receive it; the medicine was put to your
          lip, but you preferred to be diseased; the bread was placed before
          you, and the living water, but you would not take them. Your blood be
          on your own heads." Oh, may this never be said of any of us! May we
          never sleep under the word as do others, lest we die in our sins; and,
          as I told you the other Sunday night, I think that is one of the most
          dreadful words in the Bible where Christ said twice, one time after
          another -- "If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your
          sins." To die on a dunghill, or in a ditch, or on the rack, or on the
          gallows, is nothing compared with this -- to die in your sins! to die
          in your sins! And yet this will be your lot if you continue much
          longer to sleep, as do others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another picture; not to detain you too long. Do you remember in
          David's life when he went with one of his mighty men at night into
          Saul's camp, and found the king and his guards all asleep? There were
          certain men of war who ought to have watched at Saul's bed head to
          take care of their master who lay in the trench, but no one was awake
          at all; end David and his friend went all among the sleepers, treading
          gently end softly lest they should wake one of them; till, by-and-by,
          they came to the center of the circle where lay the king, with a cruse
          of water at his bolster, and his spear stuck in the ground. Little did
          he know as he slept so calmly there that Abishai was saying to David:
          "Let me strike him; it shall be but this once." How easily that strong
          hand with that sharp javelin would have pinned the king to the ground.
          One only stroke, and it would be done, and David's enemy would pursue
          him no more for ever. Methinks I see you, O ye sleeping sinners, lying
          in the same imminent peril. At this moment the evil one is saying:
          "Let me smite him; I will smite him but this once; let me prevent his
          hearing the gospel this night; let me thrust the javelin of unbelief
          into his soul but this once; and then the harvest will be past, the
          summer will be ended, and he will not be saved." Slumbering sinner, I
          would fain shout as the thunder of God, if thereby I could arouse you.
          Man, the knife is at your throat, and can you sleep? The spear is
          ready to smite you, and will you still doat and dream? I think I see
          the angel of justice who has long been pursuing the sinner who is
          rejecting Christ, and he cries: "Let me smite him! he has had time
          enough; let me smite him!" Or, as Christ puts it in the parable, there
          has come one into the vineyard who has looked at you, the barren tree,
          and seen no fruit; and he has come these three years, and now he is
          saying: "Cut it down! why cumbereth it the ground?" O mercy, stay the
          axe! O God, bid the enemy put by the spear, and let the sleeper wake,
          not in hell, but still on mercy's plains, where there is a Christ to
          forgive him and a Spirit to sanctify him! Imploringly, I, your
          brother, beseech you tonight to turn unto the living God. Even now in
          this your day, attend to the things which make for your peace: --
        </p>
        <p>"To-day, a pardoning God</p>
        <p>Will hear the suppliant pray</p>
        <p>To-day, a Saviour's cleansing blood</p>
        <p>Will wash thy guilt away.</p>
        <p>But, grace so dearly bought</p>
        <p>If yet thou wilt despise,</p>
        <p>Thy fearful doom with vengeance fraught,</p>
        <p>Will fill thee with surprise."</p>
        <p>
          The last picture is this (may it never be seen in you) -- there Vent
          once into a tent, which he thought to be friendly, a mighty man who
          had fought a battle and lost the day. Hot of foot and full of fear,
          Sisera came into the tent of Jael to ask for water, and she gave him
          milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. He drank, and then,
          all weary, he threw himself along in the tent. He is a photograph of
          many ungodly men who have gone where they thought they had friends;
          for sinners think sinners their friends, and think sin their friend,
          and they have asked for pleasure, and they have had it; and, now,
          after having had their fill, and eaten butter in a lordly dish, they
          are tonight in contentment, sleeping in supposed security. They have
          gone into the house of the evil one to find pleasure, and they are
          going there again to-night, and they will continue there, and try to
          find rest in the house of their enemies. Sometimes it is the house of
          the strange woman, often the settle of the drunkard, or the chair of
          the scorner, where men think to rest in peace, Oh, hark thee, man, and
          beware! Fly the ways of the destroyer: fly the haunt of the strange
          woman, as for thy very life every den of sin; for, lo! she cometh
          stealthily, the tent pin is in her left hand, and in her right hand
          the workman's hammer. Many mighty has she slain aforetime, for she
          hunts for the precious life, and her chambers lead down to death. If
          thou sleepest on but another night, or even another hour, the
          destroyer may have done the deed, and thou mayst be fastened to the
          earth for ever, the victim of thine own delusions. I may be in error,
          but I think I spear; to some man to-night who must now immediately
          change his ways, or else the jaws of hell will close upon him. I do
          not desire to speak my own words, or my own thoughts, but to speak as
          the divine wind blows through my soul; and I think I am warning some
          one to-night of whom, if he turn not, it will soon be written, as of
          another in the Book of Proverbs, "He goeth after her straightway, as
          an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the
          stocks; till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
          snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life." In the name of the
          Ever Blessed and Most Merciful, "turn thee! sinner, turn thee! Why
          wilt thou die?" Thy course is destruction, and is near its end. Awake!
          Why sleepest thou? Sleep to others is dangerous; to thee it is
          damnable. Awake, arise, or be for ever ruined. May God's grace bestir
          thee! Some of you to-night are like Lot and his daughters in the
          burning city. You must flee; you must flee at once out of Sodom, or
          you will perish in it. Behold, we would put our hand upon you
          to-night, and press you to flee, the Lord being merciful unto you. His
          servants and his Spirit constrain you to make haste. Linger not; look
          not back; hesitate not. To your knees! to your knees! "Seek ye the
          Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near." To the
          cross! to the cross! There is your shelter, the mountain where the
          only refuge can be found from the vengeance of God. Behold the wounds
          of Jesus, God's beloved Son given for the guilty, slaughtered for the
          sinful --
        </p>
        <p>"There is life in a look at the crucified One;</p>
        <p>There is life at this moment for thee!" --</p>
        <p>
          and for all who look. But it may be that if this night ye look not to
          Jesus, his cross may never appear before your eyes again, for they
          will be sealed in death. Ere long, Jael's tent-pin shall have passed
          through Sisera's skull; the sin shall have destroyed the sinner: the
          sin that is unto death shall have shut up the spirit in despair. Oh,
          may God, who is mighty to save, turn you to himself at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sound the trumpet in Zion: sound an alarm in my holy mountain," seems
          to ring in my ears; and I would fain sound that alarm to God's saints,
          and to sinners too. May he call many by his grace, and awaken us all;
          and his shall be the glory for ever and ever! Amen.
