          THE most plausible objection to the genuineness of these writings is
          thus expressed by Dupin: "Eusebius and Jerome wrote an accurate
          catalogue of each author known to them -- with a few obscure
          exceptions, -- and yet never mention the writings of the Areopagite."
          Great is the rejoicing in the House of the Anti-Areopagites over this
          PROOF; -- but what are the facts? Eusebius acknowledges that
          innumerable works have not come to him -- Jerome disclaims either to
          know or to give an accurate catalogue either of authors or works. The
          Library of Caesarea contained three hundred thousand volumes,
          according to the modest computation of Doublet, according to
          Schneider, many more -- Jerome says there are some writings, so
          illustrious in themselves, that they will not suffer from not being
          mentioned by him; Jerome fallows Dionysius on the Heavenly Hierarchy;
          Jerome's Catalogue of Illustrious Men contains one hundred and
          thirty-five names.
        </p>
        <p>
          Josephus is mentioned for his testimony to Christ -- Seneca, for his
          correspondence with St, Paul -- Philo, for his description of the
          Therapeutse of Alexandria. Yet Dupin would have the unwary infer that
          Jerome gives a full catalogue of each Author known to him, with a few
          obscure exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Ecclesiastical History" of Eusebius treats of the nature of
          Christ, the companions of the Apostles, the Martyrdoms -- the
          succession of Bishops -- the persecutions -- the folk-lore of the
          Church to the fourth Century. The Book would fill about 125 pages, yet
          Dupin would have us believe that he gives a complete catalogue; He
          does not give the writings of Hymenseus and Narcissus, of Athenagoras,
          and Pantaenus, nor a complete list of Clement, Origen, and Dionysius
          of Alexandria. His silence, in my opinion, is owing to "odium
          theologicum." According to Eusebius, Jesus is dittos; according to
          Dionysius, Jesus is haplous; both true when properly understood, but
          when misunderstood -- "Hinc lachrymae illae" -- Dupin formed his
          premise for his conclusion, not from facts .
        </p>
        <p>FALLACY OF NAMES.</p>
        <p>
          Pearson, Daillé, Blundellum, Erasmus, Valla, Westcott, Lupton,
          pronounce against the genuineness. Who are you? But Pearson demolishes
          Daillé; Vossius pulverises Blundellum; Erasmus repudiates Valla. Dr.
          Westcott, following Dupin, assumes the non-genuineness, but his
          literary instinct places his Article on Dionysius before that on
          Origen. Dean Colet bumps the scale against Mr. Lupton.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pearson, in the xth Chapter of Ignatii Vindiciae, gives the shortest
          and best summary in favour of the genuineness. Speaking of the
          scholars of his own day, he says, "No one is so ignorant as not to
          know that these writings were recognised as genuine by the best judges
          in the sixth, fifth, fourth, and third centuries." Unhappily, he also
          said, Every "erudite" person regarded them in his day as written in
          the fourth century, and he assumed the date of Eusebius' death, as the
          date of the works, to account for his silence. Hence every inerudite
          person, who wished to pass for erudite, maintained that opinion for
          his own reputation. But when Pearson had re-surveyed the evidence, he
          confessed, with shame, that though he had given, what seemed to him a
          true opinion, he left the decision of the whole matter to the judgment
          of a more learned person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Erasmus, in his "Institutio" of a Christian Prince, writes thus: --
          "Divus ille Dionysius qui fecit tres Hierarchias." In his prime work,
          "ratio verae religionis," Erasmus not only enumerates the "Divine
          Names," the "Mystic and Symbolic Theology," but calls them, not Stoic,
          not Platonic, not Aristotelian, but "celestial" philosophy. He so
          moulds Dionysius into his book, that it becomes Dionysius writing
          elegant Latin. The only reason which outweighed with him all external
          testimony, was, that Erasmus could not imagine that any man, living in
          apostolic times, and so far removed from the age of Erasmus, could
          possibly have penned such a mirror of apostolic doctrine. How could
          the Areopagite, though disciple of Paul, and familiar friend of John
          Theologus, possibly be so learned as the author of these writings?
          Such is the testimony of the two Theologians who have been permitted
          to be doubtful of the genuineness.
        </p>
        <p>GREGORY OF TOURS .</p>
        <p>
          Gregory is the great authority of those who think that the St. Denis
          of France is not identical with Dionysius the Areopagite. The
          authority is worthy of their critical acumen. Gregory collects the
          more obscure martyrdoms, in Gaul, under Nero, and subsequent Emperors.
          He gives several martyrdoms under Nero, and thus proves the Apostolic
          Evangelisation of Gaul. Gregory quotes, and misquotes, and
          misunderstands the ancient document , "Concerning seven men sent by
          St. Peter into Gaul, -- in Gallias -- to preach." "Under Claudius --
          sub CLDIO -- Peter the Apostle sent certain disciples into Gaul to
          preach, -- they were, Trophimus, Paulus, Martial, Austremonius,
          Gatianus, Saturninus, Valerius, and many companions." -- These men
          were sent A.D.42-43. Gregory omits Valerius, and inserts Dionysius --
          who was not converted to the Christian Faith till A.D.44 or 49. Then
          Gregory misreads "Claudio "for "consulibus Decio," and adds, "Grato"
          as the fellow-consul. Thus a disciple of the Apostles, sent by
          Clement, successor of Peter, arrives in Gaul A.D.250, and the
          identical names of his companions recur miraculously in the third
          century. At the very time that Trophimus is thus supposed to have
          arrived at Aries, we have a letter from Cyprian, A.D.254, urging Pope
          Stephen to depose Marcion, 15th or 18th Bishop of Aries from
          Trophimus. Such is the basis upon which our critical friends build
          their house upon the sand.
        </p>
        <p>THE PÈRES BOLANDISTES.</p>
        <p>
          The Pères Bolandistes are a wonder in Christendom. They are critical,
          and yet follow the gross blunder of Gregory of Tours. They belong to
          the papal obedience, and yet prefer Gregory of Tours when wrong, to
          Gregory XIII., when right. They pronounce the solemn declaration of
          Pope John XIXth, "that Martial of Limoges was an apostolic man ," as
          of no historic value. They think that St. John Damascene did not
          possess the same critical apparatus for proving the authenticity of
          the writings of Dionysius, that we possess in the xixth Century. Their
          "actes authentiques " of Dionysius acknowledge that he was sent to
          Gaul by Clement, successor of Peter; and yet they affirm that he
          arrived in Gaul, A.D, 250. After Clement I., who succeeded Peter and
          Paul, there was not another Clement, Bishop of Rome, for a thousand
          years . Happily, Les petits Bolandistes are more rational and critical
          than their Pères.
        </p>
        <p>GENERAL OBJECTION.</p>
        <p>
          "The style, the theological learning, the language and allusions,
          prove the writings written after the apostolic age."
        </p>
        <p>
          Is the Epistolary style the proof? St. Paul, St. John, St. Peter, St.
          Luke, and nearly the whole of the New Testament is written under the
          form of Epistles. The Epistle of St. James, -- the first written in
          the Canon of the New Testament, -- will bear comparison with the book
          of Job for ornate diction. Consult the marginal references to the
          Epistle of St. Peter, to see the scriptural knowledge of the Apostles.
          Men use the testimony of the High Priests, that the Apostles were
          unlearned and ignorant men, but omit their testimony that they took
          knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus; and the further
          testimony, that Jesus opened their understanding, that they should
          understand the testimony of the Scriptures, respecting Himself; and
          further, that the Holy Spirit should recall to them whatever He had
          said to them. Those who would rather assume twenty miracles, than
          acknowledge one natural fact, surmise, that a Syrian, in the ivth
          century, may have written Greek permeated with technical expressions
          of Plato and Aristotle. There is not a single allusion to persons or
          events after the first century, unless it be supposed that the Epistle
          of Ignatius, A.D.108, is quoted. The works abound in names recorded in
          the New Testament. The Apostolic Epistles allude to the leaven of
          heresy already working. The Antwerp edition gives about five hundred
          references to Holy Scripture in the Writings of Dionysius. He quotes
          every book in the Bible, except the two last particular Epistles of
          St. John, or John Presbyter. Dionysius writes four letters to Gaius,
          to whom St. John wrote his third Epistle. We have, therefore, in the
          writings of this Apostolic man, a proof that the Canonical Scriptures
          were quoted as the Oracles of God, in the first century, and a
          triumphant testimony that
        </p>
        <p>Faith is more trustworthy than criticism.</p>
