          TITLE. A Psalm, Of David. Yes, David under suspicion, half afraid to
          speak lest he should speak unadvisedly while trying to clear himself;
          David slandered and beset by enemies; David censured even by saints,
          and taking it kindly; David deploring the condition of the godly party
          of whom he was the acknowledged head; David waiting upon God with
          confident expectation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalm is one of a group of four, and it bears a striking likeness
          to the other three. Its meaning lies so deep as to be in places
          exceedingly obscure—yet even upon its surface it has dust of gold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In its commencement the psalm is lighted up with the evening glow as
          the incense rises to Heaven; then comes a night of language whose
          meaning we cannot see; and this gives place to morning light in which
          our eyes are unto the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. The Psalmist cries for acceptance in prayer (Psalm 141:1-2);
          Then he begs to be kept as to his speech, preserved in heart and deed,
          and delivered from every sort of fellowship with the ungodly. He
          prefers to be rebuked by the gracious rather than to be flattered by
          the wicked, and consoles himself with the confident assurance that he
          will one day be understood by the godly party, and made to be a
          comfort to them (Psalm 141:3-6). In the last verses the slandered
          saint represents the condition of the persecuted church, looks away to
          God and pleads for rescue from his cruel enemies, and for the
          punishment of his oppressors.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Lord, I cry unto you.</p></b> This is my
        last resort—prayer never fails me. My prayer is painful and feeble, and
        worthy only to be called a cry; but it is a cry unto Jehovah, and this
        ennobles it.

        <p align="justify">
          I have cried unto you, I still cry to you, and I always mean to cry to
          you. To whom else could I go? What else can I do? Others trust to
          themselves, but I cry unto you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The weapon of <i>all-prayer </i>is one which the believer may always
          carry with him, and use in every time of need.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Make haste unto me.</p></b> His case was urgent,
        and he pleaded that urgency. God's time is the best time, but when we
        are sorely pressed we may with holy importunity quicken the movements of
        mercy. In many cases, if help should come late, it would come too late;
        and we are permitted to pray against such a calamity.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto you.</p></b
        >
        See how a second time he talks of crying: prayer had become his
        frequent, yes, his constant exercise. Twice in a few words he says, "I
        cry; I cry." How he longs to be heard, and to be heard at once!
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            There is a voice to the great Father in every cry, and groan, and

          </p></i
        >
        It troubles the spirit of the saints when they fear that no favorable
        ear is turned to their doleful cries: they cannot rest unless their
        "unto you" is answered by an "unto me."

        As incense is carefully prepared, kindled with holy fire, and devoutly
        presented unto God, so let my prayer be. We are not to look upon prayer
        as easy work requiring no thought. It needs to be "set forth"; what is
        more, it must be set forth "before the Lord," by a sense of his presence
        and a holy reverence for his name. Neither may we regard all
        supplication as certain of divine acceptance, it needs to be set forth
        before the Lord "as incense, "concerning the offering of which there
        were rules to be observed, otherwise it would be rejected of God.

          </p></b
        >
        Whatever form his prayer might take, his one desire was that it might be
        accepted of God. Prayer is sometimes presented without words by the very
        motions of our bodies: bent knees and lifted hands are the tokens of
        earnest, expectant prayer.
        <p align="justify">
          Certainly <i>work</i>, or the lifting up of the hands in labor, is
          prayer if it be done in dependence upon God and for his glory. There
          is a hand prayer as well as a heart prayer, and our desire is that
          this may be sweet unto the Lord as the sacrifice of eventide. Holy
          hope, the lifting up of hands that hang down, is also a kind of
          worship: may it ever be acceptable with God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist makes a bold request: he would have his humble cries and
          prayers to be as much regarded of the Lord as the appointed morning
          and evening sacrifices of the holy place. Yet the prayer is by no
          means too bold, for, after all, the spiritual is in the Lord's esteem
          higher than the ceremonial, and the calves of the lips are a truer
          sacrifice than the calves of the stall. So far we have a prayer about
          prayer: we have a distinct supplication in the two following verses.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth.
          </p></b
        ><i>
          That mouth had been used in prayer, it would be a pity it should ever
          be defiled with untruth, or pride, or wrath</i
        >; yet so it will become unless carefully watched, for these intruders
        are ever lurking about the door. David feels that with all his own
        watchfulness he may be surprised into sin, and so he begs the Lord
        himself to keep him. When Jehovah sets the watch the city is well
        guarded: when the Lord becomes the guard of our mouth the whole man is
        well garrisoned.
        <b> <p align="justify">Keep the door of my lips.</p></b> God has made
        our lips the door of the mouth, but we cannot keep that door of
        ourselves, therefore do we entreat the Lord to take the rule of it. O
        that the Lord would both open and shut our lips, for we can do neither
        the one nor the other aright if left to ourselves.
        <p align="justify">
          In times of persecution by ungodly men we are peculiarly liable to
          speak hastily, or evasively, and therefore we should be specially
          anxious to be preserved in that direction from every form of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How condescending is the Lord! We are ennobled by being door keepers
          for him, and yet he deigns to be a door keeper for us.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Incline not my heart to any evil thing.</p></b>
        It is equivalent to the petition, "Lead us not into temptation." O that
        nothing may arise in providence which would excite our desires in a
        sinful direction. The Psalmist is here careful of his heart. He who
        holds the heart, is lord of the man: but if the tongue and the heart are
        under God's care, all is safe. Let us pray that he may never leave us to
        our own inclinations, or we shall soon decline from the right.

          Godly men are horrified at the thought of sinning as others do; the
          fear of it drives them to their knees. Iniquity, which, being

        binding us to their service by the means of our palates. The trap is
        baited with delicious meats that we may be captured and become meat for
        their malice. If we would not sin with men, we had better not sit with
        them; and if we would not share their wickedness, we must not share

        where they chose, but David kept to his God. In him he trusted always,
        only, confidently, and unreservedly.
        <b> <p align="justify">Leave not my soul destitute</p></b>; as it would
        be if the Lord did not remember and fulfill his promise. To be destitute
        in circumstances is bad, but to be destitute in soul is far worse. To be
        left of friends is a calamity, but to be left of God would be
        destruction. Destitute of God is destitution with a vengeance. The
        comfort is that God has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."

        He had before asked, in verse 3, that the door of his
        <i>mouth </i> might be kept; but his prayer now grows into "Keep
        <i>me." </i>He<i> </i>
        seems more in trouble about covert temptation, than concerning open
        attacks.

          Brave men do not dread battle, but they hate secret plots. We cannot
          endure to be entrapped like unsuspecting animals; therefore we cry to
          the God of wisdom for protection.

        <b> <p align="justify">And the traps of the workers of iniquity.</p></b>
        These evil workers sought to catch David in his speech or acts. This was
        in itself a piece of in equity, and so in accord with the rest of their
        conduct. They were bad themselves, and they wished either to make him
        like themselves, or to cause him to seem so. If they could not catch the
        godly man in one way, they would try another. Snares and traps would be
        multiplied, for they were determined to work his ruin.
        <p align="justify">
          Nobody could preserve David but the Omniscient and Omnipotent One—he
          also will preserve us.

        <p align="justify">
          It is hard to keep out of snares which you cannot see, and to escape
          traps which you cannot discover. Well might the much hunted Psalmist
          cry, "Keep me!"

        It may not be a Christian prayer, but it is a very just one, and it
        takes a great deal of grace to refrain from crying <i>Amen </i>
        to it. In fact, grace does not work towards making us wish otherwise
        concerning the enemies of holy men. Do we not all wish the innocent to
        be delivered, and the guilty to reap the result of their own malice? Of
        course we do, if we are just men. There can be no wrong in desiring that
        to happen in our own case, which we wish for all godly men. Yet is there
        a more excellent way.
