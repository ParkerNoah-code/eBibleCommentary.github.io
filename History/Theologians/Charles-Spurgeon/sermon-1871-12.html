          "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
          everyone that loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten
          of him." -- 1 John 5:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          FOR THE PREACHER of the gospel to make full proof of his ministry will
          be a task requiring much divine teaching. Besides much care in the
          manner and spirit, he will need guidance as to his matter. One point
          of difficulty will be to preach the whole truth in fair proportion,
          never exaggerating one doctrine, never enforcing one point, at the
          expense of another, never keeping back any part, nor yet allowing it
          undue prominence. For practical result will much depend upon an equal
          balance, and a right dividing of the word. In one case this matter
          assumes immense importance because it affects vital truths, and may
          lead to very serious results unless rightly attended to; I refer to
          the elementary facts involved in the work of Christ for us, and the
          operations of the Holy Spirit in us. Justification by faith is a
          matter about which there must be no obscurity much less equivocation;
          and at the same time we must distinctly and determinately insist upon
          it that regeneration is necessary to every soul that shall enter
          heaven. "Ye must be born again" is as much a truth as that clear
          gospel statement, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."
          It is to be feared that some zealous brethren have preached the
          doctrine of justification by faith not only so boldly and so plainly,
          but also so baldly and so out of all connection with other truth, that
          they have led men into presumptuous confidences, and have appeared to
          lend their countenance to a species of Antinomianism very much to be
          dreaded. From a dead, fruitless, inoperative faith we may earnestly
          pray, "Good Lord, deliver us," yet may we be unconsciously, fostering
          it. Moreover to stand up and cry, "Believe, believe, believe," without
          explaining what is to be believed, to lay the whole stress of
          salvation upon faith without explaining what salvation is, and showing
          that it means deliverance from the power as well as from the guilt of
          sin, may seem to a fervent revivalist to be the proper thing for the
          occasion, but those who have watched the result of such teaching have
          had grave cause to question whether as much hurt may not be done by it
          as good. On the other hand, it is our sincere conviction that there is
          equal danger in the other extreme. We are most certain that a man must
          be made a new creature in Christ Jesus, or he is not saved; but some
          have seen so clearly the importance of this truth that they are for
          ever and always dwelling upon the great change of conversion, and its
          fruits, and its consequences, and they hardly appear to remember the
          glad tidings that whosoever believeth on Christ Jesus hath everlasting
          life. Such teachers are apt to set up so high a standard of
          experience, and to be so exacting as to the marks and signs of a true
          born child of God, that they greatly discourage sincere seekers, and
          fall into a species of legality from which we may again say, "Good
          Lord, deliver us." Never let us fail most plainly to testify to the
          undoubted truth that true faith in Jesus Christ saves the soul, for if
          we do not we shall hold in legal bondage many who ought long ago to
          have enjoyed peace, and to have entered into the liberty of the
          children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may not be easy to keep these two things in there proper position,
          but we must aim at it if we would be wise builders. John did so in his
          teaching. If you turn to the third chapter of his gospel it is very
          significant that while he records at length our Saviour's exposition
          of the new birth to Nicodemus, yet in that very same chapter he gives
          us what is perhaps the plainest piece of gospel in all the Scriptures:
          "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
          the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should
          not perish, but have everlasting life." So, too, in the chapter before
          us he insists upon a man's being born of God; he brings that up again
          and again, but evermore does he ascribe wondrous efficacy to faith; he
          mentions faith as the index of our being born again, faith as
          overcoming the world, faith as possessing the inward witness, faith as
          having eternal life -- indeed, he seems as if he could not heap honour
          enough upon believing, while at the same time he insists upon the
          grave importance of the inward experience connected with the new
          birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if such difficulty occurs to the preacher, we need not wonder
          that it also arises with the hearer, and causes him questioning. We
          have known many who, by hearing continually the most precious doctrine
          that belief in Jesus Christ is saving, have forgotten other truths,
          and have concluded that they were saved when they were not, have
          fancied they believed when as yet they were total strangers to the
          experience which always attends true faith. They have imagined faith
          to be the same thing as a presumptuous confidence of safety in Christ,
          not grounded upon the divine word when rightly understood, nor proved
          by any facts in their own souls. Whenever self-examination has been
          proposed to them they have avoided it as an assault upon their
          assurance, and when they have been urged to try themselves by gospel
          tests, they have defended their false peace by the notion that to
          raise a question about their certain salvation would be unbelief.
          Thus, I fear, the conceit of supposed faith in Christ has placed them
          in an almost hopeless position, since the warnings and admonitions of
          the gospel have been set aside by their fatal persuasion that it is
          needless to attend to them, and only necessary to cling tenaciously to
          the belief that all has been done long ago for us by Christ Jesus, and
          that godly fear and careful walking are superfluities, if not actually
          an offence against the gospel. On the other hand, we have known others
          who have received the doctrine of justification by faith as a part of
          their creed, and yet have not accepted it as a practical fact that the
          believer is saved. They so much feel that they must be renewed in the
          spirit of their minds, that they are always looking within themselves
          for evidences, and are the subjects of perpetual doubts. Their natural
          and frequent song is --
        </p>
        <p>"Tis a point I long to know,</p>
        <p>Oft it causes anxious thought;</p>
        <p>Do I love the Lord, or no?</p>
        <p>Am I his, or am I not?"</p>
        <p>
          These are a class of people to be much more pitied than condemned.
          Though I would be the very last to spread unbelief, I would be the
          very first to inculcate holy anxiety. It is one thing for a person to
          be careful to know that he is really in Christ, and quite another
          thing for him to doubt the promises of Christ, supposing that they are
          really made to him. There is a tendency in some hearts to look too
          much within, and spend more time studying their outward evidences and
          their inward feelings, than in learning the fullness, freeness, and
          all sufficiency of the grace of God in Christ Jesus. They too much
          obscure the grand evangelical truth that the believer's acceptance
          with God is not in himself, but in Christ Jesus, that we are cleansed
          through the blood of Jesus, that we are clothed in the righteousness
          of Jesus, and are, in a word, "accepted in the Beloved." I earnestly
          long that these two doctrines may be well balanced in your souls. Only
          the Holy Spirit can teach you this. This is a narrow path which the
          eagle's eye has not seen, and the lions whelp has not trodden. He whom
          the Holy Ghost shall instruct will not give way to presumption and
          despise the Spirit's work within, neither will he forget that
          salvation is of the Lord Jesus Christ, "who of God is made unto us
          wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." The
          text appears to me to blend these two truths in a very delightful
          harmony, and we will will try to speak of them, God helping us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." We shall
          consider this morning, first of all, the believing which is here
          intended; and then, secondly, how it is a sure proof of regeneration;
          and then, thirdly, dwelling for awhile upon the closing part of the
          verse we shall show how it becomes an argument for Christian love:
          "Every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten
          of him."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. WHAT IS THE BELIEVING INTENDED IN THE TEXT? We are persuaded, first
          of all, that the believing here intended is that which our Lord and
          his apostles exhorted men to exercise, and to which the promise of
          salvation is always appended in the word of God; as for instance that
          faith which Peter inculcated when he said to Cornelius, "To him give
          all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in
          him shall receive the remission of sins;" and which our Lord commanded
          when he came into Galilee, saying to men, "Repent ye, and believe the
          gospel" (Mark i.15). Certain persons have been obliged to admit that
          the apostles commanded, and exhorted, and besought men to believe, but
          they tell us the kind of believing which the apostles bade men
          exercise was not saving faith. Now, God forbid we should ever in our
          zeal to defend a favorite position, be driven to an assertion so
          monstrous. Can we imagine for a moment apostles with burning zeal and
          ardor, inspired by the Spirit of God within them, going about the
          world exhorting men to exercise a faith which after all would not save
          them? To what purpose did they run on so fruitless an errand, so
          tantalizing to human need, so barren of results? When our Lord bade
          his disciples go into all the world and preach the gospel to every
          creature, and added, "he that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved," the faith which was to be preached was evidently none other
          than a saving faith, and it is frivolous to say otherwise. I must
          confess that I felt shocked the other day to read in a certain sermon
          the remark that the words of Paul to the jailor "were spoken in a
          conversation held at midnight under peculiar circumstances, and the
          evangelist who wrote them was not present at the interview." Why, had
          it been at high noon, and had the whole world been present, the
          apostle could have given no fitter answer to the question, "What must
          I do to be saved?" than the one he did give, "Believe in the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." It is, I repeat, a mere
          frivolity or worse, to say that the faith enjoined by the apostles was
          a mere human faith which does not save, and that there is no certainty
          that such faith saves the soul. That cause must be desperate that
          calls for such a defence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the faith here intended is the duty of all men. Read the
          text again: "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of
          God." It can never be less than man's duty to believe the truth; that
          Jesus is the Christ is the truth, and it is the duty of every man to
          believe it. I understand her by "believing," confidence in Christ, and
          it is surely the duty of men to confide in that which is worthy of
          confidence, and that Jesus Christ is worthy of the confidence of all
          men is certain, it is therefore the duty of men to confide in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inasmuch as the gospel command, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
          thou shalt be saved," is addressed by divine authority to every
          creature, it is the duty of every man so to do. What saith John: "This
          is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son
          Jesus Christ," and our Lord himself assures us, "He that believeth on
          him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already,
          because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of
          God." I know there are some who will deny this, and deny it upon the
          ground that man has not the spiritual ability to believe in Jesus, to
          which I reply that it is altogether an error to imagine that the
          measure of the sinners moral ability is the measure of his duty. There
          are many things which men ought to do which they have now lost the
          moral and spiritual, though not the physical, power to do. A man ought
          to be chaste, but if he has been so long immoral that he cannot
          restrain his passions, he is not thereby free from the obligation. It
          is the duty of a debtor to pay his debts, but if he has been such a
          spendthrift that he has brought himself into hopeless poverty, he is
          not exonerated from his debts thereby. Every man ought to believe that
          which is true, but if his mind has become so depraved that he loves a
          lie and will not receive the truth, is he thereby excused? If the law
          of God is to be lowered according to the moral condition of sinners,
          you would have a law graduated upon a sliding- scale to suit the
          degrees of human sinfulness; in fact, the worst man would be under the
          least law, and become consequently the least guilty. God's
          requirements would be a variable quantity, and, in truth, we should be
          under no rule at all. The command of Christ stands good however bad
          men may be, and when he commands all men everywhere to repent, they
          are bound to repent, whether their sinfulness renders it impossible
          for them to be willing to so or not. In every case it is man's duty to
          do what God bids him.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, this faith, wherever it exists, is in every case,
          without exception, the gift of God and the work of the Holy Spirit.
          Never yet did a man believe in Jesus with the faith here intended,
          except the Holy Spirit led him to do so. He has wrought all our works
          in us, and our faith too. Faith is too celestial a grace to spring up
          in human nature till it is renewed: faith is in every believer "the
          gift of God." You will say to me, "Are these two things consistent?" I
          reply, "Certainly, for they are both true." "How consistent?" say you.
          "How inconsistent?" say I, and you shall have as much difficulty to
          prove them inconsistent as I to prove them consistent. Experience
          makes them consistent, if theory does not. Men are convinced by the
          Holy Spirit of sin -- "of sin," saith Christ, "because they believe
          not on me;" here is one of the truths; but the selfsame hearts are
          taught the same Spirit that faith is of the operation of God. (Col.
          ii.2) Brethren be willing to see both sides of the shield of truth.
          Rise above the babyhood which cannot believe two doctrines until it
          sees the connecting link. Have you not two eyes, man? Must you needs
          put one of them out in order to see clearly? Is it impossible to you
          to use a spiritual stereoscope, and look at two views of truth until
          they melt into one, and that one becomes more real and actual because
          it is made up of two? Man men refuse to see more than one side of a
          doctrine, and persistently fight against anything which is not on its
          very surface consistent with their own idea. In the present case I do
          not find it difficult to believe faith to be at the same time the duty
          of man and the gift of God; and if others cannot accept the two
          truths, I am not responsible for their rejection of them; my duty is
          performed when I have honestly borne witness to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitherto we have only been clearing the way. Let us advance. The faith
          intended in the text evidently rests upon a person -- upon Jesus.
          "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." It is
          not belief about a doctrine, nor an opinion, nor a formula, but belief
          concerning a person. Translate the words, "Whosoever believeth that
          Jesus is the Christ," and they stand thus: "Whosoever believeth that
          the Saviour is the Anointed is born of God." By which is assuredly not
          meant, whosoever professes to believe that he is so, for many do that
          whose lives prove that they are not regenerate; but, whosoever
          believes it to be the fact, as truly and in very deed to receive Jesus
          as God has set him forth and anointed him, is a regenerate man. What
          is meant by "Jesus is the Christ," or, Jesus is the Anointed? First,
          that he is the Prophet; secondly, that he is the Priest; thirdly, that
          he is the King of the church, for in all these three senses he is the
          Anointed. Now, I may ask myself this question: Do I this day believe
          that Jesus is the great Prophet anointed of God to reveal to me the
          way of salvation? Do I accept him as my teacher and admit that he has
          the words of eternal life? If I so believe, I shall obey his gospel
          and possess eternal life. Do I accept him to be henceforth the
          revealer of God to my soul, the messenger of the covenant, the
          anointed prophet of the Most High? But he is also a priest. Now, a
          priest is ordained among men to offer sacrifices; do I firmly believe
          that Jesus was ordained to offer his one sacrifice for the sins of
          mankind, by the offering of which sacrifice once for all he has
          finished the atonement and made complete expiation? Do I accept his
          atonement as an atonement for me, and receive his death as an
          expiation upon which I rest my hope for forgiveness of all my
          transgressions? Do I in fact believe Jesus to be the one sole, only
          propitiating Priest, and accept him to act as priest for me? If so,
          then I have in part believed that Jesus is the Anointed. But he is
          also King, and if I desire to know whether I possess the right faith,
          I further must ask myself, "Is Jesus, who is now exalted in heaven,
          who once bled on the cross, is he King to me? Is his law my law? Do I
          desire to submit myself entirely to his government? Do I hate what he
          hates, and love what he loves? Do I live to praise him? Do I, as a
          loyal subject, desire to see his kingdom come and his will be done on
          earth as it is in heaven?" My dear friend, if thou canst heartily and
          earnestly say, "I accept Jesus Christ of Nazareth to be Prophet,
          Priest, and King to me, because God has anointed him to exercise those
          three offices; and in each of these three characters I unfeignedly
          trust him," then, dear friend, you have the faith of God's elect, for
          it is written, "He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we go a little further. True faith is reliance. Look at any Greek
          lexicon you like, and you will find that the word pisteuein does not
          merely mean to believe, but to trust, to confide in, to commit to,
          entrust with, and so forth; and the marrow of the meaning of faith is
          confidence in, reliance upon. Let me ask, then, every professor her
          who professes to have faith, is your faith the faith of reliance? You
          give credit to certain statements, do you also place trust in the one
          who glorious person who alone can redeem? Have you confidence as well
          as credence? A creed will not save you, but reliance upon the Anointed
          Saviour is the way of salvation. Remember, I beseech you, that if you
          could be taught an orthodoxy unadulterated with error, and could learn
          a creed written by the pen of the Eternal God himself, yet a mere
          notional faith, such as men exercise when they believe in the
          existence of men in the moon, or nebulae in space, could not save your
          soul. Of this we are sure, because we see around us many who have such
          a faith, and yet evidently are not the children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, true faith is not a flattering presumption, by which a man
          says, "I believe I am saved, for I have such delightful feelings, I
          have had a marvelous dream, I have felt very wonderful sensations;"
          for all such confidence may be nothing but mere assumption.
          Presumption, instead of being faith, is the reverse of faith; instead
          of being the substance of things hoped for, it is a mere mirage.
          Faith, is as correct as reason, and if her arguments are considered,
          she is as secure in her conclusions as though she drew them by
          mathematical rules. Beware, I pray you, of a faith which has no basis
          but your own fancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith, again, is not the assurance that Jesus died for me. I sometimes
          feel myself a little at variance with that verse --
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am -- without one plea</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me."</p>
        <p>
          It is eminently suitable for a child of God, but I am not sure as to
          its being the precise way for putting the matter for a sinner. I do
          not believe in Jesus because I am persuaded that his blood was shed
          for me, but rather I discover that his blood was shed especially for
          me from the fact that I have been led to believe in him. I fear me
          there are thousands of people who believe that Jesus died for them,
          who are not born of God, but rather are hardened in their sin by their
          groundless hopes of mercy. There is no particular efficacy in a man's
          assuming that Christ has died for me; for it is a mere truism, if it
          true as some teach, that Jesus died for everybody. On such a theory
          every believer in a universal atonement would necessarily be born of
          God, which is very far from being the case. When the Holy Ghost leads
          us to rely upon the Lord Jesus, then the truth that God gave his only
          begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him might be saved, is opened
          up to our souls, and we see that for us who are believers, Jesus died
          with the special intent that we should be saved. For the Holy Spirit
          to assure us that Jesus shed his blood for us in particular is one
          thing, but merely to conclude that Jesus for us on the notion that he
          died for everybody is as far as the east is from the west, from being
          real faith in Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither is it faith for me to be confident that I am saved, for it may
          be the case that I am not saved, and it can never be faith to believe
          a lie. Many have concluded rashly that they were saved when they were
          still in the gall of bitterness. That was not the exhibition of
          confidence in Christ but the exhibition of a base presumption
          destructive to the last degree. To come back to where we started from,
          faith, in a word, is reliance upon Jesus Christ. Whether the Redeemer
          died in special and particular for me or not, is not the question to
          be raised in the first place; I find that he came into the world to
          save sinners, under that general character I come to him, I find that
          whosoever trusteth him shall be saved, I therefore trust him, and
          having done so, I learn from his word that I am the object of his
          special love, and that I am born of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my first coming to Jesus I can have no knowledge of any personal
          and special interest in the blood of Jesus; but since it is written,
          "God hath set him forth to be a propitiation for our sins: and not for
          ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world," I come and trust
          myself to that propitiation; sink or swim I cast myself on the
          Saviour. Great Son of God, thou hast lived and died, thou hast bled
          and suffered, and made atonement for sin for all such as trust thee,
          and I trust thee, I lean upon thee, I cast myself upon thee. Now,
          whoever has such faith as this is born of God, he has true faith which
          is proof positive of the new birth. Judge ye, therefore, whether ye
          have this faith or no.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me tarry just one minute longer over this. The true faith is set
          forth in Scripture by figures, and one or two of these we will
          mention. It was an eminent type of faith when the Hebrews father in
          Egypt slew the lamb and caught the warm blood in the basin, then took
          a bunch of hyssop and dipped it in the blood and marked the two posts
          of his door, and then struck a red mark across the lintel. That
          smearing of the door represented faith. The deliverance was wrought by
          the blood; and the blood availed through the householder's own
          personally striking it upon his door. Faith does that; it takes of the
          things of Christ, makes them its own, sprinkles the soul, as it were,
          with the precious blood, accepts the way of mercy by which the Lord
          passes over us and exempts his people from destruction. Faith was
          shown to the Jews in another way. When a beast was offered in
          sacrifice for sin, the priest and sometimes the representatives of the
          tribes or the individual laid their hands upon the victim in token
          that they desired their sins to be transferred to it, that it might
          suffer for them as a type of the great substitute. Faith lays her
          hands on Jesus, desiring to receive the benefit of his substitutionary
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          A still more remarkable representation of faith was that of the
          healing look of the serpent-bitten Israelites. On the great standard
          in the midst of the camp Moses lifted up a serpent of brass; high
          overhead above all the tents this serpent gleamed in the sun, and
          whoever of all the dying host would but look to it was made to live.
          looking was a very simple act, but it indicated that the person was
          obedient to God's command. He looked as he was bidden, and the virtue
          of healing came from the brazen serpent through a look. Such is faith.
          It is the simplest thing in the world, but it indicates a great deal
          more than is seen upon its surface:
        </p>
        <p>"There is life for a look at the Crucified One."</p>
        <p>
          To believe in Jesus is but to glance the eye of faith to him, to trust
          him with thy soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          That poor woman who came behind our Saviour in the press offers us
          another figure of what faith is. She said, "If I may but touch the hem
          of his garment I shall be made whole." Taking no medicines, making no
          profession, and performing no ceremonies, she simply touched the
          ravelling of the Saviour's robe, and she was healed at once. O soul,
          if thou canst get into contact with Christ by simply trusting him,
          though that trust be ever so feeble, thou hast the faith of God's
          elect; thou hast the faith which is in every case the token of the new
          birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We must now pass on to show that WHEREVER IT EXISTS IT IS THE
          PROOF OF REGENERATION. There never was a grain of such faith as this
          in the world, except in a regenerate soul, and there never will be
          while the world standeth. It is so according to the text, and if we
          had no other testimony this one passage would be quite enough to prove
          it. "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God."
          "Ah!" I hear thee say, poor soul, "the new birth is a great mystery; I
          do not understand it; I am afraid I am not a partaker in it." You are
          born again if you believe that Jesus is the Christ, if you are relying
          upon a crucified Saviour you are assuredly begotten again unto a
          lively hope. Mystery or no mystery, the new birth is yours if you are
          a believer. Have you never noticed that the greatest mysteries in the
          world reveal themselves by the simplest indications. The simplicity
          and apparent easiness of faith is no reason why I should not regard
          its existence as an infallible indication of the new birth within. How
          know we that the new-born child lives except by its cry? Yet a child's
          cry -- what a simple sound it is! how readily could it be imitated! a
          clever workman could with pipes and strings easily deceive us; yet was
          there never a child's cry in the world but what it indicated the
          mysteries of breathing, heart-beating, blood-flowing, and all the
          other wonders which come with life itself. Do you see yonder person
          just drawn out of the river? Does she live? Yes, life is there. Why?
          Because the lungs still heave. But does it not seem an easy thing to
          make lungs heave? A pair of billows blown into them, might not that
          produce the motion? Ah, yes, the thing is easily imitated after a
          sort; but no lungs heave except where life is. Take another
          illustration. Go into a telegraph office at any time, and you will see
          certain needles moving right and left with unceasing click.
          Electricity is a great mystery, and you cannot see or feel it; but the
          operator tells you that the electric current is moving along the wire.
          How does he know? "I know it by the needle." How is that? I could move
          your needles easily. "Yes; but do not you see the needle has made two
          motions to the right, one to the left, and two to the right again? I
          am reading a message." "But," say you, "I can see nothing in it; I
          could imitate the clicking and moving very easily." Yet he who is
          taught the art sees before him in those needles, not only electric
          action, but a deeper mystery still; he perceives that a mind is
          directing an invisible force, and speaking by means of it. Not to all,
          but to the initiated is it given to see the mystery hidden within the
          simplicity. The believer sees in the faith, which is simple as the
          movements of the needle, an indication that God is operating on the
          human mind, and the spiritual man discerns that there is an inner
          secret intimated thereby, which the carnal eye cannot decipher. To
          believe in Jesus is a better indicator of regeneration than anything
          else, and in no case did it ever mislead. Faith in the living God and
          his Son Jesus Christ is always the result of the new birth, and can
          never exist except in the regenerate. Whoever has faith is a saved
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          I beg you to follow me a little in this argument. A certain divine has
          lately said, "A man's act of believing is not the same as his being
          saved: it is only in the direction of being saved." This is tantamount
          to a denial that every believer in Christ is at once saved; and the
          inference is that a man may not conclude that he is saved because he
          believes in Jesus. Now, observe how opposed this is to Scripture. It
          is certain from the Word of God that the man who believes in Jesus is
          not condemned. Read John iii.18, and many other passages. "He that
          believeth on Him is not condemned." Now is not every unregenerate man
          condemned? Is not a man who is not condemned a saved man? When you are
          sure on divine authority that the believer is not condemned, how in
          the name of everything that is rational can you deny that the believer
          is saved? If he is not condemned, what has he to fear? Will he not
          rightly conclude that being justified by faith, he has peace with God
          through our Lord Jesus Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, secondly, that faith in the fourth verse of the chapter before
          us is said to "overcome the world." "This is the victory that
          overcomes the world, even our faith." What, then, does faith overcome
          the world in persons who are not saved? How can this be possible when
          the apostle saith that that which overcomes the world is born of God?
          Read the fourth verse: "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
          world:" but faith overcomes the world. therefore the man who has faith
          is regenerate; and what means that but that he is saved, and that his
          faith is the instrument by which he achieves victories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, faith accepts the witness of God, and more, he that hath
          faith has the witness in himself to the truth of God. Read the tenth
          verse of the chapter: "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
          witness in himself." It is not said, "He that does this or feels
          that," but "He that believeth hath the witness in himself," his heart
          bears witness to the truth of God. Has any unsaved man an experimental
          witness within? Will you tell me that a man's inner experience bears
          witness to God's gospel and yet the man is in a lost state, or only
          hopeful of being saved ultimately? No, sir, it is impossible. He that
          believeth has that change wrought in him which enables by his own
          consciousness to confirm the witness of God, and such a man must be in
          a state of salvation. It is not possible to say of him that he is an
          unsaved man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, note in this chapter, at the thirteenth verse, that wherever
          there is faith there is eternal life; so run the words, "these things
          have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God;
          that ye may know that ye have eternal life." Our Lord himself, and his
          apostles, in several places have declared, "He that believeth on him
          hath everlasting life." Do not tell me that a sinner who believes in
          Jesus is to make an advance before he can say he is saved, that a man
          who trusts Christ is only on his way to salvation, and must wait until
          he has used the ordinances, and has grown in grace, before he may know
          that he is saved. No, the moment that the sinner's trust in placed on
          the finished work of Jesus he is saved. Heaven and earth may pass
          away, but that man shall never perish. If only one second ago I
          trusted the Saviour I am safe; just as safe as the man who has
          believed in Jesus fifty years, and who has all the while walked
          uprightly. I do not say that the new born convert is as happy, nor as
          useful, nor as holy, nor as ripe for heaven, but I do say that the
          words, "he that believeth on him hath everlasting life," is a truth
          with general bearings, and relates as much to the babe in faith as
          does to the man who has attained to fullness of stature in Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if this chapter were written on purpose to meet the gross error
          that faith does not bring immediate salvation, it extols faith again
          and again, yea, and I may add, our Lord himself crowns faith, because
          faith never wears the crown, but brings all the glory to the dear
          Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let me say a word or two in reply to certain questions. But must
          not a man repent as well as believe? Reply: No man ever believed but
          what he repented at the same time. Faith and repentance go together.
          they must. If I trust Christ to save me from sin, I am at the same
          time repenting of sin, and my mind is changed in relation to sin, and
          everything else that has to do with its state. All the fruits meet for
          repentance are contained in faith itself. You will never find that a
          man who trusts Christ remains an enemy of God, or a lover of sin. The
          fact that he accepts the atonement provided is proof positive that he
          loathes sin, and that his mind is thoroughly changed in reference to
          God. Moreover, as to all the graces which are produced in the
          Christian afterwards, are they not all to be found in embryo in faith?
          "Only believe, and you shall be save," is the cry which many sneer at,
          and others misunderstand; but do you know what "only believe" means?
          Do you know what a world of meaning lies in that word? Read that
          famous chapter to the Hebrews, and see what faith has done and is
          still able to do, and you will see that it is no trifle. Wherever
          there is faith in a man let it but develop itself and there will be a
          purging of himself from sin, a separating himself from the world, a
          conflict with evil, and a warring for the glory of Christ, which
          nothing else could produce. Faith is in itself one of the noblest of
          graces; it is the compendium of all virtues; and as sometimes there
          will lie within one single ear enough seed to make a whole garden
          fertile, so, within that one word "faith," there lies enough of virtue
          to make earth blessed; enough of grace, if the Spirit make it to grow,
          to turn the fallen into the perfect. Faith is not the easy and light
          thing men think. Far are we from ascribing salvation to the profession
          of a mere creed, we loathe the idea; neither do we ascribe salvation
          to a fond persuasion, but we do ascribe salvation to Jesus Christ, and
          the obtaining of it to that simple, child like confidence which
          lovingly casts itself into the arms of him who gave both his hands to
          the nail and suffered to the death for the sins of his people. He who
          believes, then, is saved -- rest assured of that. "Whosoever believeth
          that Jesus is the Christ is born of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now what flows out of this? Love is the legitimate issue! We must
          love if we are begotten of God all those who are also born of God. It
          would be an insult to you if I were to prove that a brother should
          love his brother. Doth not nature herself teach us that? Those, then,
          who are born of God ought to love all those of the same household. And
          who are they? Why, all those who have believed that Jesus is the
          Christ, and are resting their hopes where we rest ours, namely, on
          Christ the Anointed One of God. We are to love all such. We are to do
          this because we are of the family. We believe, and therefore we have
          been begotten of God. Let us act as those who are of the divine
          family; let us count it our privilege we are received into the
          household, and rejoice to perform the lovely obligations of our high
          position. We look around us and see many others who have believed in
          Jesus Christ; let us love them because they are of the same kindred.
          "But they are some of them unsound in doctrine, they make gross
          mistakes as to the Master's ordinances." We are not to love their
          faults, neither ought we to expect them to love ours, we are
          nevertheless to love their persons, for "whosoever believeth that
          Jesus is the Christ is born of God," and therefore he is one of the
          family, and as we love the Father who begat we are to love all those
          who are begotten of him. First, I love God, and therefore I desire to
          promote God's truth and to keep God's gospel free from taint. But then
          I am to love all those whom God has begotten, despite the infirmities
          and errors I see in them, being also myself compassed about with
          infirmities. Life is the reason for love, the common life which is
          indicated by the common faith in the dear Redeemer is to bind us to
          each other. I must confess, though I would pay every deference to
          every brother's conscientious judgment, I do not know how I could
          bring my soul as a child of God to refuse any man communion at my
          Master's table, who believed that Jesus is the Christ. I have proof in
          his doing do, if he be sincere (and I can only judge of that by his
          life), that he is born of God; and has not every child a right to come
          to the Father's table? I know in the olden times, parent used to make
          their children go without meals as a punishment, but everybody tell us
          now this is cruel and unwise, for it injures the child's constitution
          to deprive it of necessary food. There are rods in the Lord's house,
          and there is no need to keep disobedient children away from supper.
          Let them come to the Lord's table, and eat and drink with the Lord
          Jesus and with all his saints, in the hope that when their
          constitution bestows stronger they will throw out the disease which
          now they labor under, and come to be obedient to the whole gospel,
          which saith, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me beg the members of this church to exhibit mutual love to one
          another. Are there many feeble among you? Comfort them. Are there any
          who want instruction? Bring your knowledge to their help. Are there
          any in distress? Assist them. Are they backsliding? Restore them.
          "Little children, love one another," is the rule of Christ's family,
          may we observe it. May the love of God which has been she abroad in
          our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us, reveal itself by
          our love to all the saints. And, remember, other sheep he has which
          are not yet of this fold; them also he must bring in. Let us love
          those who are yet to be brought in, and lovingly go forth at once to
          seek them; in whatever other form of service God has given us, let us
          with loving eyes look after our prodigal brothers, and who knows, we
          may bring into the family this very day some for whom there will be
          joy in the presence of the angels of God, because the lost one has
          been found. God bless and comfort you, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.
