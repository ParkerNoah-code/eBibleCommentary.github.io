          1. Which [God] the Lord does not reject, nor does He say that the
          prophets [spake] from another god than His Father; nor from any other
          essence, but from one and the same Father; nor that any other being
          made the things in the world, except His own Father, when He speaks as
          follows in His teaching: "There was a certain householder, and he
          planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged in it a
          winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went
          into a far country: And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent
          his servants unto the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits
          of it. And the husbandmen took his servants: they cut one to pieces,
          stoned another, and killed another. Again he sent other servants more
          than the first: and they did unto them likewise. But last of all he
          sent unto them his only son, saying, Perchance they will reverence my
          son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
          This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and we shall possess his
          inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard,
          and slew him. When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard shall come,
          what will he do unto these husbandmen? They say unto him, He will
          miserably destroy these wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to
          other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their season."
          Again does the Lord say: "Have ye never read, The stone which the
          builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is
          the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore I say
          unto you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given
          to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof." By these words He
          clearly points out to His disciples one and the same Householder --
          that is, one God the Father, who made all things by Himself; while [He
          shows] that there are various husbandmen, some obstinate, and proud,
          and worthless, and slayers of the Lord, but others who render Him,
          with all obedience, the fruits in their seasons; and that it is the
          same Householder who sends at one time His servants, at another His
          Son. From that Father, therefore, from whom the Son was sent to those
          husbandmen who slew Him, from Him also were the servants [sent]. But
          the Son, as coming from the Father with supreme authority (principali
          auctoritate), used to express Himself thus: "But I say unto you." The
          servants, again, [who came] as from their Lord, spake after the manner
          of servants, [delivering a message]; and they therefore used to say,
          "Thus saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Whom these men did therefore preach to the unbelievers as Lord, Him
          did Christ teach to those who obey Him; and the God who had called
          those of the former dispensation, is the same as He who has received
          those of the latter. In other words, He who at first used that law
          which entails bondage, is also He who did in after times [call His
          people] by means of adoption. For God planted the vineyard of the
          human race when at the first He formed Adam and chose the fathers;
          then He let it out to husbandmen when He established the Mosaic
          dispensation: He hedged it round about, that is, He gave particular
          instructions with regard to their worship: He built a tower, [that
          is], He chose Jerusalem: He digged a winepress, that is, He prepared a
          receptacle of the prophetic Spirit. And thus did He send prophets
          prior to the transmigration to Babylon, and after that event others
          again in greater number than the former, to seek the fruits, saying
          thus to them (the Jews): "Thus saith the Lord, Cleanse your ways and
          your doings, execute just judgment, and look each one with pity and
          compassion on his brother: oppress not the widow nor the orphan, the
          proselyte nor the poor, and let none of you treasure up evil against
          his brother in your hearts, and love not false swearing. Wash you,
          make you clean, put away evil from your hearts, learn to do well, seek
          judgment, protect the oppressed, judge the fatherless (pupillo), plead
          for the widow; and come, let us reason together, saith the Lord." And
          again: "Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no
          guile; depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it." In
          preaching these things, the prophets sought the fruits of
          righteousness. But last of all He sent to those unbelievers His own
          Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, whom the wicked husbandmen cast out of the
          vineyard when they had slain Him. Wherefore the Lord God did even give
          it up (no longer hedged around, but thrown open throughout all the
          world) to other husbandmen, who render the fruits in their seasons, --
          the beautiful elect tower being also raised everywhere. For the
          illustrious Church is [now] everywhere, and everywhere is the
          winepress digged: because those who do receive the Spirit are
          everywhere. For inasmuch as the former have rejected the Son of God,
          and cast Him out of the vineyard when they slew Him, God has justly
          rejected them, and given to the Gentiles outside the vineyard the
          fruits of its cultivation. This is in accordance with what Jeremiah
          says, "The Lord hath rejected and cast off the nation which does these
          things; for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith
          the Lord." And again in like manner does Jeremiah speak: "I set
          watchmen over you; hearken to the sound of the trumpet; and they said,
          We will not hearken. Therefore have the Gentiles heard, and they who
          feed the flocks in them." It is therefore one and the same Father who
          planted the vineyard, who led forth the people, who sent the prophets,
          who sent His own Son, and who gave the vineyard to those other
          husbandmen that render the fruits in their season.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And therefore did the Lord say to His disciples, to make us become
          good workmen: "Take heed to yourselves, and watch continually upon
          every occasion, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with
          surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day shall
          come upon you unawares; for as a snare shall it come upon all dwelling
          upon the face of the earth." "Let your loins, therefore, be girded
          about, and your lights burning, and ye like to men who wait for their
          lord, when he shall return from the wedding." "For as it was in the
          days of Noe, they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they
          married and were given in marriage, and they knew not, until Noe
          entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all; as
          also it was in the days of Lot, they did eat and drink, they bought
          and sold, they planted and builded, until the time that Lot went out
          of Sodom; it rained fire from heaven, and destroyed them all: so shall
          it also be at the coming of the Son of man." "Watch ye therefore, for
          ye know not in what day your Lord shall come." [In these passages] He
          declares one and the same Lord, who in the times of Noah brought the
          deluge because of man's disobedience, and who also in the days of Lot
          rained fire from heaven because of the multitude of sinners among the
          Sodomites, and who, on account of this same disobedience and similar
          sins, will bring on the day of judgment at the end of time (in
          novissimo); on which day He declares that it shall be more tolerable
          for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city and house which shall not
          receive the word of His apostles. "And thou, Capernaum," He said, "is
          it that thou shalt be exalted to heaven? Thou shalt go down to hell.
          For if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in
          Sodom, it would have remained unto this day. Verily I say unto you,
          that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than
          for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Since the Son of God is always one and the same, He gives to those
          who believe on Him a well of water [springing up] to eternal life, but
          He causes the unfruitful fig-tree immediately to dry up; and in the
          days of Noah He justly brought on the deluge for the purpose of
          extinguishing that most infamous race of men then existent, who could
          not bring forth fruit to God, since the angels that sinned had
          commingled with them, and [acted as He did] in order that He might put
          a check upon the sins of these men, but [that at the same time] He
          might preserve the archetype, the formation of Adam. And it was He who
          rained fire and brimstone from heaven, in the days of Lot, upon Sodom
          and Gomorrah, "an example of the righteous judgment of God," that all
          may know, "that every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be
          cut down, and cast into the fire." And it is He who uses [the words],
          that it will be more tolerable for Sodom in the general judgment than
          for those who beheld His wonders, and did not believe on Him, nor
          receive His doctrine. For as He gave by His advent a greater privilege
          to those who believed on Him, and who do His will, so also did He
          point out that those who did not believe on Him should have a more
          severe punishment in the judgment; thus extending equal justice to
          all, and being to exact more from those to whom He gives the more; the
          more, however, not because He reveals the knowledge of another Father,
          as I have shown so fully and so repeatedly, but because He has, by
          means of His advent, poured upon the human race the greater gift of
          paternal grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If, however, what I have stated be insufficient to convince any one
          that the prophets were sent from one and the same Father, from whom
          also our Lord was sent, let such a one, opening the mouth of his
          heart, and calling upon the Master, Christ Jesus the Lord, listen to
          Him when He says, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a king who made
          a marriage for his son, and he sent forth his servants to call them
          who were bidden to the marriage." And when they would not obey, He
          goes on to say, "Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell them that
          are bidden, Come ye, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and all the
          fatlings are killed, and everything is ready; come unto the wedding.
          But they made light of it, and went their way, some to their farm, and
          others to their merchandize; but the remnant took his servants, and
          some they treated despitefully, while others they slew. But when the
          king heard this, he was wroth, and sent his armies and destroyed these
          murderers, and burned up their city, and said to his servants, The
          wedding is indeed ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
          Go out therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
          gather in to the marriage. So the servants went out, and collected
          together as many as they found, bad and good, and the wedding was
          furnished with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he
          saw there a man not having on a wedding garment; and he said unto him,
          Friend, how camest thou hither, not having on a wedding garment? But
          he was speechless. Then said the king to his servants, Take him away,
          hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness: there shall be
          weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are
          chosen." Now, by these words of His, does the Lord clearly show all
          [these points, viz.,] that there is one King and Lord, the Father of
          all, of whom He had previously said, "Neither shalt thou swear by
          Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;" and that He had from
          the beginning prepared the marriage for His Son, and used, with the
          utmost kindness, to call, by the instrumentality of His servants, the
          men of the former dispensation to the wedding feast; and when they
          would not obey, He still invited them by sending out other servants,
          yet that even then they did not obey Him, but even stoned and slew
          those who brought them the message of invitation. He accordingly sent
          forth His armies and destroyed them, and burned down their city; but
          He called together from all the highways, that is, from all nations,
          [guests] to the marriage feast of His Son, as also He says by
          Jeremiah: "I have sent also unto you my servants the prophets to say,
          Return ye now, every man, from his very evil way, and amend your
          doings." And again He says by the same prophet: "I have also sent unto
          you my servants the prophets throughout the day and before the light;
          yet they did not obey me, nor incline their ears unto me. And thou
          shall speak this word to them: This is a people that obeyeth not the
          voice of the Lord, nor receiveth correction; faith has perished from
          their mouth." The Lord, therefore, who has called us everywhere by the
          apostles, is He who called those of old by the prophets, as appears by
          the words of the Lord; and although they preached to various nations,
          the prophets were not from one God, and the apostles from another;
          but, [proceeding] from one and the same, some of them announced the
          Lord, others preached the Father, and others again foretold the advent
          of the Son of God, while yet others declared Him as already present to
          those who then were afar off.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Still further did He also make it manifest, that we ought, after
          our calling, to be also adorned with works of righteousness, so that
          the Spirit of God may rest upon us; for this is the wedding garment,
          of which also the apostle speaks, "Not for that we would be unclothed,
          but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up by
          immortality." But those who have indeed been called to God's supper,
          yet have not received the Holy Spirit, because of their wicked conduct
          "shall be," He declares, "cast into outer darkness." He thus clearly
          shows that the very same King who gathered from all quarters the
          faithful to the marriage of His Son, and who grants them the
          incorruptible banquet, [also] orders that man to be cast into outer
          darkness who has not on a wedding garment, that is, one who despises
          it. For as in the former covenant, "with many of them was He not well
          pleased;" so also is it the case here, that "many are called, but few
          chosen." It is not, then, one God who judges, and another Father who
          calls us together to salvation; nor one, forsooth, who confers eternal
          light, but another who orders those who have not on the wedding
          garment to be sent into outer darkness. But it is one and the same
          God, the Father of our Lord, from whom also the prophets had their
          mission, who does indeed, through His infinite kindness, call the
          unworthy; but He examines those who are called, [to ascertain] if they
          have on the garment fit and proper for the marriage of His Son,
          because nothing unbecoming or evil pleases Him. This is in accordance
          with what the Lord said to the man who had been healed: "Behold, thou
          art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee." For
          he who is good, and righteous, and pure, and spotless, will endure
          nothing evil, nor unjust, nor detestable in His wedding chamber. This
          is the Father of our Lord, by whose providence all things consist, and
          all are administered by His command; and He confers His free gifts
          upon those who should [receive them]; but the most righteous
          Retributor metes out [punishment] according to their deserts, most
          deservedly, to the ungrateful and to those that are insensible of His
          kindness; and therefore does He say, "He sent His armies, and
          destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city." He says here,
          "His armies," because all men are the property of God. For "the earth
          is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell
          therein." Wherefore also the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the
          Romans, "For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are
          ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the
          ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive unto themselves
          condemnation. For rulers are not for a terror to a good work, but to
          an evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is
          good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the minister
          of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid;
          for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God,
          the avenger for wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must
          needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
          For this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers,
          attending continually upon this very thing." Both the Lord, then, and
          the apostles announce as the one only God the Father, Him who gave the
          law, who sent the prophets, who made all things; and therefore does He
          say, "He sent His armies," because every man, inasmuch as he is a man,
          is His workmanship, although he may be ignorant of his God. For He
          gives existence to all; He, "who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil
          and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and unjust."
        </p>
        <p>
          7. And not alone by what has been stated, but also by the parable of
          the two sons, the younger of whom consumed his substance by living
          luxuriously with harlots, did the Lord teach one and the same Father,
          who did not even allow a kid to his elder son; but for him who had
          been lost, [namely] his younger son, he ordered the fatted calf to be
          killed, and he gave him the best robe. Also by the parable of the
          workmen who were sent into the vineyard at different periods of the
          day, one and the same God is declared as having called some in the
          beginning, when the world was first created; but others afterwards,
          and others during the intermediate period, others after a long lapse
          of time, and others again in the end of time; so that there are many
          workmen in their generations, but only one householder who calls them
          together. For there is but one vineyard, since there is also but one
          righteousness, and one dispensator, for there is one Spirit of God who
          arranges all things; and in like manner is there one hire, for they
          all received a penny each man, having [stamped upon it] the royal
          image and superscription, the knowledge of the Son of God, which is
          immortality. And therefore He began by giving the hire to those [who
          were engaged] last, because in the last times, when the Lord was
          revealed He presented Himself to all [as their reward].
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Then, in the case of the publican, who excelled the Pharisee in
          prayer, [we find] that it was not because he worshipped another Father
          that he received testimony from the Lord that he was justified rather
          [than the other]; but because with great humility, apart from all
          boasting and pride, he made confession to the same God. The parable of
          the two sons also: those who are sent into the vineyard, of whom one
          indeed opposed his father, but afterwards repented, when repentance
          profited him nothing; the other, however, promised to go, at once
          assuring his father, but he did not go (for "every man is a liar;" "to
          will is present with him, but he finds not means to perform" ), --
          [this parable, I say], points out one and the same Father. Then,
          again, this truth was clearly shown forth by the parable of the
          fig-tree, of which the Lord says, "Behold, now these three years I
          come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, but I find none" (pointing
          onwards, by the prophets, to His advent, by whom He came from time to
          time, seeking the fruit of righteousness from them, which he did not
          find), and also by the circumstance that, for the reason already
          mentioned, the fig-tree should be hewn down. And, without using a
          parable, the Lord said to Jerusalem, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou
          that killest the prophets, and stonest those that are sent unto thee;
          how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen
          gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your
          house shall be left unto you desolate." For that which had been said
          in the parable, "Behold, for three years I come seeking fruit," and in
          clear terms, again, [where He says], "How often would I have gathered
          thy children together," shall be [found] a falsehood, if we do not
          understand His advent, which is [announced] by the prophets -- if, in
          fact, He came to them but once, and then for the first time. But since
          He who chose the patriarchs and those [who lived under the first
          covenant], is the same Word of God who did both visit them through the
          prophetic Spirit, and us also who have been called together from all
          quarters by His advent; in addition to what has been already said, He
          truly declared, "Many shall come from the east and from the west, and
          shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
          heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness;
          there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." If, then, those who do
          believe in Him through the preaching of His apostles throughout the
          east and west shall recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the
          kingdom of heaven, partaking with them of the [heavenly] banquet, one
          and the same God is set forth as He who did indeed choose the
          patriarchs, visited also the people, and called the Gentiles.
