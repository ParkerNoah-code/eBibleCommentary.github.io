          DIVISION. We are now among the <i>Hallelujahs</i>. The rest of our
          journey lies through the <i>Delectable Mountains</i>. All is praise to
          the close of the book. The key is high-pitched: the music is upon the
          high sounding cymbals. O for a heart full of joyful gratitude, that we
          may run, and leap, and glorify God, even as these Psalms do.

          Alexander thinks that this song may be regarded as composed of two
          equal parts: in the first we see the happiness of those who trust in
          God, and not in man (verses 1-5), while the second gives the reason
          drawn from the Divine perfections (verses 5-10). This might suffice
          for our purpose; but as there is really no break at all, we will keep
          it entire. It is "one pearl", a sacred censer of holy incense, pouring
          forth one sweet perfume.<br />

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Praise the LORD.</p></b>Or,
        <i>Hallelujah</i>. It is saddening to think how this majestic word
        <i>Hallelujah</i>, has been trailed in the mire of late. Its irreverent
        use is an aggravated instance of
        <i>taking the name of Jehovah our God in vain</i>. Let us hope that it
        has been done in ignorance by the vulgar sort; but great responsibility
        lies with leaders who countenance and even copy this <i>blasphemy</i>.
        With holy awe let us pronounce the word HALLELUJAH, and by it summon
        ourselves and all others to adore the God of the whole earth.
        <p align="justify">
          Men need to be called to praise; it is important that they should
          praise; and there are many reasons why they should do it at once. Let
          all who hear the word <i>Hallelujah </i>unite immediately in holy
          praise.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise the LORD, O my soul.</p></b> He would
        practice what he had preached. He would be the leader of the choir which
        he had summoned. It is a poor business if we solely exhort others, and
        do not stir up our own soul. It is an evil thing to say, "Praise God",
        and never to add, "Praise, O my soul." When we praise God let us arouse
        our innermost self, our central life<i
          >. We have but one soul, and if it be saved from eternal wrath, it is
          bound to praise its Savior</i
        >. Come heart, mind, thought! Come my whole being, my soul, my all, be
        all on flame with joyful adoration! Up, my brethren! Lift up the song!
        "Praise the Lord."
        <p align="justify">
          But what am I at? How dare I call upon others, and be negligent
          myself? If ever man was under bonds to bless the Lord I am that man.
          Let me put my soul into the center of the choir, and then let my
          better nature excite my whole manhood to the utmost height of loving
          praise. "O for a well tuned harp!" Nay, rather, O for a
          <i>sanctified </i>heart. Then if my voice should be of the poorer
          sort, and somewhat lacking in melody—yet my soul without my voice
          shall accomplish my resolve to magnify the Lord.

        be given to the praises of my God. While I live I'll love God; and while
        I breathe I'll bless God. It is but for a while, and I will not while
        that time away in idleness, but consecrate it to that same service which

        This "while I have any being" will be a great while, but the whole of it
        shall be filled up with adoration; for the glorious Jehovah is my God,
        my own God by covenant, and by blood relationship in Christ Jesus. I
        have no being apart from my God, therefore, I will not attempt to enjoy
        my being otherwise than by singing to his honor.

        If David be the author, this warning comes from a prince. In any case it
        comes from the Spirit of the living God. Men are always far too apt to
        depend upon the great ones of earth, and forget the Great One above; and
        this habit is the fruitful source of disappointment.
        <p align="justify">
          Princes are only men, and men with greater needs than others; why,
          then, should we look to them for aid? They are in greater danger, are
          burdened with greater cares, and are more likely to be misled than
          other men; therefore, it is folly to select them for our confidence.
          Probably no order of men have been so false to their promises and
          treaties, as men of royal blood. So live as to deserve their trust,
          but do not burden them with your trust.

        Though you should select one son of man out of the many, and should
        imagine that he differs from the rest and may be safely depended on, you
        will be mistaken. There is none to be trusted—no, not one. Adam fell;
        therefore lean not on his sons.
        <p align="justify">
          Man is a helpless creature without God; therefore, look not for help
          in that direction. All men are like the few men who are made into
          princes, they are more in <i>appearance </i>than in <i>reality</i>,
          more in promising than in performing, more apt to help themselves than
          to help others. How many have turned away heartsick from men on whom
          they once relied! Never was this the case with a believer in the Lord.
          He is a very present help in time of trouble. In man there is no help:
          <br />
          in times of mental depression, <br />
          in the day of sore bereavement, <br />
          in the night of conviction of sin, <br />

        and sister of his body, and he must needs lie among his kindred as soon
        as the spirit which was his life has made its exit. There is a spirit in
        man, and when that goes the man goes. The spirit returns to God who gave
        it, and the flesh to the dust out of which it was fashioned.
        <p align="justify">
          This is a poor creature to trust in: a dying creature, a corrupting
          creature. Those hopes will surely fall to the ground which are built

        <b> <p align="justify">In that very day his thoughts perish.</p></b>
        Whatever he may have proposed to do, the proposal ends in smoke. He
        cannot think, and what he had thought of cannot effect itself, and
        therefore it dies. Now that he is gone, men are ready enough to let his
        thoughts go with him into oblivion; another thinker comes, and turns the
        thoughts of his predecessor to ridicule.
        <p align="justify">
          It is a pitiful thing to be waiting upon princes or upon any other
          men, in the hope that they will think of us. In an hour they are gone,
          and where are their schemes for our promotion? A day has ended their
          thoughts, by ending them; and our trusts have perished, for their
          thoughts have perished.

        <p align="justify">
          Men's ambitions, expectations, declarations, and boastings all vanish
          into thin air when the breath of life vanishes from their bodies. This
          is the narrow estate of man: his breath, his earth, and his thoughts;
          and this is his threefold climax therein—his breath goes forth, to his
          earth he returns, and his thoughts perish. Is this a being to be
          relied upon? Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. To trust it would be a
          still greater vanity.

          In each of the two titles here given, namely, "the God of Jacob", and

          a fountain of joy in it; but the first will not cheer us without the
          second. Unless Jehovah be his God, no man can find confidence in the
          fact that he was Jacob's God. But when by faith we know the Lord to be

        He fills it with crooked places; he reverses it, sets it down, or upsets
        it. That which the man aimed at he misses, and he secures that for
        himself which he would gladly have avoided.

        ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 10. The LORD shall reign forever.</p></b>
        Jehovah is King, and his kingdom can never come to an end. Neither does
        he die, nor abdicate his throne, nor lose his crown by force. Glory be
        to his name, his throne is never in jeopardy. As the Lord ever lives, so
        he ever reigns.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Even your God, O Zion, unto all generations.</p></b
        >Zion's God, the God of his worshiping people, is he who in every age
        shall reign. There will always be a Zion; Zion will always have Jehovah
        for her King; for her he will always prove himself to be reigning in
        great power. What should we do in the presence of so great a King, but
        enter into his courts with praise, and pay to him our joyful homage?
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise the LORD.</p></b> Again they said
        <i>Hallelujah</i>. Again the sweet perfume arose from the golden vials
        full of sweet odors. Are we not prepared for an outburst of holy song?
        Do not we also say—Hallelujah? Here ends this happy Psalm. Here ends not
        the praise of the Lord, which shall ascend forever and ever. Amen.
