        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.458)</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "He was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many,
          and made intercession for the transgressors." -- Isaiah 53:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          A VAGUE notion is abroad in the world that the benefit of Christ's
          passion is intended only for good people. The preaching of some
          ministers, and the talk of some professors, would lead the
          uninstructed to imagine that Christ came into the world to save the
          righteous, to call the godly to repentance, and to heal those who
          never were sick. There is in most sinners' consciences, when they are
          aroused, a frightful fear that Christ could not have come to bless
          such as they are, but that he must have intended the merit of his
          blood and the efficacy of his passion for those who possess good works
          or feelings to recommend them to him. Dear friends, you will clearly
          see, if you will but open one eye, how inconsistent such a supposition
          is with the whole teaching of Scripture. Consider the plan itself. It
          was a plan of salvation and of necessity it was intended to bless
          sinners. Wherefore salvation if men be not lost, and for whom
          salvation but for the ruined? The plan was based in grace, but how
          "grace" unless it was meant for persons who deserve nothing? If you
          have to deal with creatures who have not sinned, and have been
          obedient, what need of grace? Build then on justice; let merit have
          its way. But as the whole covenant is a covenant of grace, and as in
          the whole matter it was ordained that grace should reign through
          righteousness unto eternal life, it is plain enough from the very plan
          itself that it must have to do with sinners and not with the
          righteous. Moreover, think of the work itself. The work of Christ was
          to bring in a perfect righteousness. For whom, think you? For those
          who had a righteousness? That were a superfluity. Why should he weave
          a garment for those who were already clothed in scarlet and fine
          linen? He had, moreover, to shed his blood. For whom his blood?
          Wherefore the agony in the garden? Wherefore the cry upon the cross?
          For the perfect? Surely not, beloved. What need had they of an
          atonement? Verily, brethren, the fact that Jesus Christ bled for sin
          upon the cross bears, on its very surface, evidence that he came into
          the world to save sinners. And then look at God's end in the whole
          work. It was to glorify himself, but how could God be glorified by
          washing spotless souls, and by bringing to everlasting glory by grace
          those who could have entered heaven by merit? Inasmuch as the plan and
          design both aim at laying the greatness of human nature in the dust,
          and exalting God, and making his love and his mercy to be magnified,
          it is implied as a matter of necessity, that it came to deal with
          undeserving, ill-deserving sinners, or else that end and aim never
          could be accomplished. Salvation needs a sinner as the raw material
          upon which to exercise its workmanship; the precious blood that
          cleanses needs a filthy sinner upon whom to show its power to purge;
          the atonement of Christ needs guilt upon which to exercise itself in
          the taking of it away; and it is absurd, it is ridiculous, it is
          unworthy of God, to suppose a scheme of salvation, a work so
          tremendous as the atonement of Christ, and an aim so splendid as the
          glorification of God, unless there be sinners to be the instruments of
          God's glory through being the partakers of God's grace. A moment's
          thought will be enough to convince us that the whole plan is made for
          sinners, and that "Jesus Christ died for the ungodly." Indeed, dear
          friends, it is only when we get this view very clearly before us that
          we see Jesus in his glory. When does the shepherd appear most lovely?
          It is a fair picture to pourtray him in the midst of his flock,
          feeding them in the green pastures, and leading them beside the still
          waters; but if my heart is to leap for joy, give me the shepherd
          pursuing his stray sheep over the mountains; let me see him bringing
          home that sheep upon his shoulders rejoicing; let me hear his song of
          mirth when he calleth upon his friends and neighbours to rejoice with
          him because he has found the sheep which was lost. When looks our God
          most like a loving and tender father? Truly he looketh blessed when he
          divideth his inheritance among his sons, but I never saw him so
          resplendent in his fatherhood as when he runneth out to meet the
          prodigal, throweth his arms about his neck, and kisseth him, crying --
          "My son that was dead is alive again." Indeed, for some offices of
          Christ, it is absolutely necessary that there should be a sinner for
          us to see any meaning in them at all. He is a priest. What need of a
          priest except for the sins of the people? Why, I dare to say it,
          Christ's priesthood is a mockery and Christ's sacrifice is ridiculous
          unless there be sin in the world, and sinners whom Jesus came to save.
          Brethren, how is he a Saviour except to the lost? How is he a
          physician but to the sick? How is he like the brazen serpent if he
          doth not save the sin-bitten, or how the scapegoat if he doth not bear
          the sin of transgressors?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text, in its threefold character, shows the intimate connection
          which exists between Jesus and sinners, for in none of its sentences
          is there meaning unless there be a sinner, and unless Christ has come
          into connection with him. It is this one point which I want to work
          out this morning, and may God bless it to many a sinner's troubled
          conscience. "He was numbered with the transgressors; he bare the sin
          of many, and he made intercession for the transgressors." It is for
          transgressors all the way through. Bring in a company of righteous
          people who think they have no sin and they cannot appreciate the text;
          in fact it can have no meaning to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We shall begin then, by taking the first sentence. To the sinner,
          troubled and alarmed on account of guilt, there will be much comfort
          in the thought that CHRIST IS ENROLLED AMONG SINNERS. "He was numbered
          with the transgressors."
        </p>
        <p>
          In what sense are we to understand this? "He was numbered with the
          transgressors."
        </p>
        <p>
          He was numbered with them, first, in the census of the Roman empire.
          There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should
          be taxed, and the espoused wife of Joseph, being great with child,
          must travel to Bethlehem that Christ may be born there, and that he
          may be numbered with the transgressing people who, for their sins,
          were subject to the Roman yoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years rolled on, and that child who had been early numbered with
          transgressors, and had received the seal of transgression in the
          circumcision, which represents the putting away of the flesh -- that
          child, having come to manhood, goes forth into the world and is
          numbered with transgressors in the scroll of fame. Ask public rumour
          "What is the character of Jesus of Nazareth?" and it cannot find a
          word in its vocabulary foul enough for him. "This -- -- -- " they
          sometimes said; and our translators have inserted the word "fellow"
          because in the original there is an ellipsis, the evangelists, I
          suppose, hardly liking to write the word which had been cast upon
          Christ Jesus. Fame, with her lying tongue, said he was a drunken man
          and a wine-bibber, because he would not yield to the asceticism of the
          age. He would not, since he came to be a man among men, do other than
          eat and drink as other men did. He came not to set an example of
          asceticism but of temperance; he came both eating and drinking, and
          they said at once, "Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber." They
          called him mad. His warm enthusiasm, his stern and unflinching rebukes
          of wickedness in high places, brought upon him the accusation that he
          had a devil. "Thou has a devil and art mad," said they. They called
          the Master of the house Beelzebub! Even the drunkards made him their
          song, and the vilest thought him viler than themselves, for he was, by
          current rumour, numbered with the transgressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to make the matter still more forcible, "he was numbered with
          transgressors in the courts of law." The ecclesiastical court of
          Judaism, the Sanhedrim, said of him, "Thou blasphemest;" and they
          smote him on the cheek. Written down among the offenders against the
          dignity of God against the security of the Jewish Church, you find the
          name of Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified. The courts civil also
          asserted the same. Pilate may wash his hands in water, and say, "I
          find no fault in him," but still, driven by the infernal clamours of
          an angry people, he is compelled to write, "This is Jesus, the King of
          the Jews;" and he gives him up to die as a malefactor who has rebelled
          against the sovereign law of the land. Herod, too, the Jewish
          tetrarch, confirms the sentence, and so, with two pens at once, Jesus
          Christ is written down by the civil leaders among transgressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the whole Jewish people numbered him with transgressors; nay,
          they reprobated him as a more abominable transgressor than a thief and
          a murderer who had excited sedition. Barabbas is put in competition
          with Christ, and they say, "Not this man, but Barabbas." See,
          brethren, his being numbered with transgressors is no fiction. Lo, he
          bears the transgressor's scourging! He is tied to the whipping-post,
          his back is marred and scarred; the ploughers make deep furrows, and
          the blood flows in streams. He is numbered with transgressors, for he
          bears the felon's cross; he comes into the street bowed down with the
          weight of his own gibbet, which he must carry upon his raw and
          bleeding shoulders; he goes along to the place of doom; he comes to
          Calvary -- the place of a skull -- and there, hoisted upon the cross,
          hanging in mid-air, as if earth rejected him and heaven refused him
          shelter, he dies the ignominious death of the cross, and is thus
          numbered with transgressors. But will there be none to enter a
          protest? Will no eye pity? Will no man declare his innocence? None;
          they are all silent! Silent, did I say? 'Tis worse! All earth holds up
          its hands for his death; it is carried unanimously. Jew and Gentile,
          bond and free, they are all there. They thrust out the tongue; they
          hoot; they laugh; they cry, "Let him deliver him, seeing he delighted
          in him." His name is written in the calendar of crime by the whole
          universe; for he is despised and rejected of men; of all men is he
          accounted to be the off-scouring of all things, and is put to grief.
          But will not heaven interfere? O God, upon thy throne, wilt thou let
          the innocent suffer? He is fast nailed to the tree, and cries in
          agony, "I thirst." Wilt thou permit this man to be numbered with
          transgressors? Is it rightly done? It is; heaven confirms it. He has
          no sin of his own, but he has the sin of his people upon his
          shoulders; and God, the Eternal Judge, shows that he too considers him
          to be in the roll of transgressors, for he veils his face; and the
          Eternal Father betakes him to his hiding-place, and Christ can neither
          see a smile nor a glance of his Father's face, till he shrieks in
          agony so unutterable, that the words cannot express the meaning of the
          Redeemer's soul, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" The only
          answer from heaven being, "I must forsake transgressors; thou art
          numbered with them, and therefore, I must forsake thee." But surely
          the doom will not be fulfilled? Certainly, he will be taken down ere
          he dies? Death is the curse for sin; it cannot come on any but
          transgressors; it is impossible for the innocent to die, as impossible
          as for immortality to be annihilated. Surely, then, the Lord will
          deliver his Son at the last moment, and having tried him in the
          furnace, he will bring him out? Nay, not so; he must become obedient
          to death, even the death of the cross. He dies without a protest on
          the part of earth, or heaven, or hell; he that was numbered with the
          transgressors, having worn the transgressor's crown of thorns, lies in
          the transgressor's grave. "He made his grave with the wicked, and with
          the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was
          any deceit in his mouth." It is a marvellous thing, brethren, a
          marvellous thing! Who ever heard of an angel being numbered with
          devils? Who ever heard of Gabriel being numbered with fiends? But this
          is more marvellous than that would be. Here is the Son of God
          numbered, not with the sons of men (that were a gracious act) but
          numbered with transgressors; numbered, not with the faithful who
          struggle after purity; numbered, not with those who repel temptation
          and resist sin; numbered, not with those who earn unto themselves a
          good degree and much boldness in the faith -- that were a marvellous
          condescension; but here it is written, "He was numbered with the
          transgressors."
        </p>
        <p>
          I must pause here a moment, and get you to think this matter over a
          little. It is a strange and wonderful thing, and ought not to be
          passed by in silence. Why, think you, was Christ numbered with
          transgressors? First, surely, because he could the better become their
          advocate. I believe, in legal phraseology, in civil cases, the
          advocate considers himself to be part and partner with the person for
          whom he pleads. You hear the counsellor continually using the word
          "we;" he is considered by the judge to represent the person for whom
          he is an advocate. In some suits of law, there is on the part of the
          bar and the bench, a perfect identification of the counsellor with the
          client; nor can they be looked upon in the eye of the law as apart
          from one another. Now, Christ, when the sinner is brought to the bar,
          appears there himself. The trumpet sounds; the great assize is set.
          Come, come, ye sinners, come to the bar to be tried. There stands the
          man whose hands are pierced; he standeth numbered with transgressors.
          Let the trial proceed. What is the accusation? He stands to answer it;
          he points to his side, his hands, his feet, and challenges Justice to
          bring anything against the sinners whom he represents; he pleads his
          blood, and pleads so triumphantly, being numbered with them and having
          a part with them, that the Judge proclaims, "Let them go their way;
          deliver them from going down into the pit, for he at their head hath
          found a ransom."
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another reason why Christ was numbered with
          transgressors, namely, that he might plead with them. Suppose a number
          of prisoners confined in one of our old jails, and there is a person
          desirous to do them good, imagine that he cannot be admitted unless
          his name is put down in the calendar. Well, out his abundant love to
          these prisoners he consents to it, and when he enters to talk with
          them, they perhaps think that he will come in with cold dignity; but
          he says, "Now, let me say to you first of all that I am one of
          yourselves." "Well," they say, "but have you done aught that is
          wrong?" "I will not answer you that," saith he; "but if you will just
          refer to the calendar you will find my name there; I am written down
          there among you as a criminal." Oh, how they open their hearts now!
          They opened their eyes with wonder first, but now they open their
          hearts, and they say, "Art thou become like one of us? Then we will
          talk with thee." And he begins to plead with them. Sinner, dost thou
          see this? Christ puts himself as near on a level with thee as he can.
          He cannot be sinful as thou art, for he is God and perfect man; but he
          so puts his name down in the list that when the roll is called his
          name is called over with thine. Oh, how near doth he come to thee in
          thy ruined state!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he does this that sinners may feel their hearts drawn to him.
          What dost thou become poor as I am that I may be made rich? Jesu, Son
          of God, dost thou allow thyself to be numbered among lost ones that
          thou mightest find me? Oh, then my soul shall open itself to give thee
          a hearty reception. Come in, thou loving Saviour, abide with me, and
          go no more out for ever. There is a tendency in awakened sinners to be
          afraid of Christ; but who will be afraid of a man that is numbered
          with us, and put down in the same list with us? Surely now we may come
          boldly to him, and confess our guilt. He that is numbered with us
          cannot condemn us. He whose name is down in the same indictment with
          ourselves, cometh not to condemn, but to absolve; not to curse, but to
          bless.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was put down in the transgressors' list that we might be written in
          the red roll of the saints. He was holy, and written among the holy;
          we were guilty, and numbered among the guilty; he transfers his name
          from yonder list to this black indictment, and ours are taken from the
          indictment, foul and filthy, and written in the roll which is fair and
          glorious, for there is a transfer made between Christ and his people.
          All that we have goes to Christ, sin and all; and all that Christ has
          comes to us. His righteousness, his blood, and everything that he hath
          belongeth unto us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear hearers, before I leave this point I want to put this to you. Is
          this yours by faith? Remember, faith is wanted here; nothing else. "He
          was numbered with transgressors." Oh, soul, can thy heart say, "Then
          if he was numbered with me, if he put his name down where mine stands
          in that terrific roll, then I will believe in him that he is able and
          willing to save me, and I will trust my soul in his hands?" I conjure
          thee by the living God do it, man, and thy soul is saved. Oh, by him
          who from the highest throne in glory stooped to the cross of deepest
          ignominy, trust thy soul with him. It is all he asks of thee, and this
          he gives thee. Blessed Master, would that thou couldst stand here, and
          say, "Sinners, full of iniquity, I stood with you; God accounted me as
          if I had committed your sin, and visited me as if I had been a
          transgressor; trust me; cast your souls upon my perfect righteousness;
          wash in my cleansing blood, and I will make you whole, and present you
          faultless before my Father's face."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We are taught in the next sentence, that Christ "BARE THE SINS OF
          MANY."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it is as clear as noon-day, that Christ dealt with sinners. Do
          not say Christ died for those who have done no wrong. That is not the
          description given. It is clear, I say, to everyone that chooses to
          look, that Christ could not bear the sins of those who had no sins,
          but could only bear the sins of men who were sinful and guilty.
          Briefly, then, but very plainly, to recount the old, old story over
          again: man stood with a load of sin upon his shoulders, so heavy that
          it would have crushed him lower than the lowest hell; Christ Jesus
          came into the world, stood in the room, place, and stead of his
          people; and he did, in the expressive words of the text, bear their
          sins -- that is to say, their sins were really, not in a legal
          fiction, but really transferred from them to him. You see, a man
          cannot bear a thing which is not on his back; it is impossible that he
          can bear it unless it is actually there. The word "bear," implies
          weight, and weight is the sure indicator of reality. Christ did bear
          sin in its fulness, vileness, and condemnation upon his own shoulders.
          Comprehend this, then, and you have the marrow of the subject. Christ
          did really, literally, and truly, take the sins that belonged to all
          who do believe on him, and those sins did actually and in very deed
          become his sins; (not that he had committed them, nor that he had any
          part or lot in them, except through the imputation to which he had
          consented, and for which he came in to the world,) and there lay the
          sins of all his people upon Christ's shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then notice, that as he did bear them, so other texts tell us that he
          did bear them away. "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
          of the world." Sin being on his head, the scape-goat took it away,
          away, away. Where? Into the wilderness of forgetfulness. If it be
          sought for it shall not be found; the Everlasting God seeth it no
          more, it hath ceased to be, for he hath finished iniquity and made an
          end of sin; and when there is an end of it what more can be said?
          Christ took our debts, but he was not long before he paid them all.
          Where, then, are the debts? There are no debts now; there is not one
          in God's book against his chosen, for Jesus died. If Christ hath paid
          the debt, then there is no debt left; it is gone. I can rejoice in its
          discharge; I can mourn that ever I cast myself into such a position,
          but the debt itself I gone. "I will remove the iniquity of that land
          in one day." "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he
          removed our transgressions from us." "I will cast their sins into the
          midst of the sea." And yet again, "I will put away thy sin like a
          cloud, and thine iniquity like a thick cloud." Now, there were some
          clouds during the last week, but where are they now? They have turned
          to rain; they are gone; no strong-winged angel could find those clouds
          again; there are no such things; they are gone. And so with believers'
          sins, they were black, thick, thick clouds; full of tempests; big with
          lightnings and with thunder; but they are gone. The drops have fallen
          upon Christ; the thunder and the lightning have spent their fury upon
          him, and the clouds are gone, for Christ has taken them away. "He bare
          the sins of many," and he bore them away for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, beloved, you must understand that if it be so, if Christ did
          really bear his people's sins, and did bear them away -- and since a
          thing cannot be in two places at one time, there is now no sin abiding
          upon those for whom Jesus died. "And who are they?" you say. Why, all
          those who trust him. Any man whatsoever, the wide world over, who
          shall ever trust Christ, may know that no sin can be with him because
          his sin was laid on Christ. Oh, I do delight in this precious
          doctrine! If anything could unloose my poor stammering tongue, this
          might, to see sin literally transferred so that there is none left! I
          cannot express the delight and joy of my soul at this moment, in
          contemplation of the blessed deliverance and release which Christ has
          given. I can only sing out again with Kent --
        </p>
        <p>"Sons of God, redeemed by blood,</p>
        <p>Raise your songs to Zion's God --</p>
        <p>Made from condemnation free,</p>
        <p>Grace triumphant sing with me."</p>
        <p>
          Now, do you not see that his must be for sinners? See, you black ones,
          you filthy ones, you lost ones, you ruined ones, this is for sinners.
          You see it does not say it was for sensible sinners; no, no, but
          sinners. It does not say, "He was numbered with awakened
          transgressors;" no, it is "transgressors." It does not say that he
          bare the sins of tender-hearted sinners; no, but "he bare the sin of
          many." This is the only description I can find in my text. Jesus
          Christ came into the world to save sinners, and if in very deed and
          truth I know myself to be this day a sinner, I may trust Christ, and
          trusting Christ I may know, as surely as there is a God in heaven,
          that Jesus Christ took my sins and carried them all away. Now, I want
          to know whether you have got this by an act of faith this morning.
          "Oh," says one, "I am a sinner, but, but -- ." Well, what but? If you
          be a sinner, you are commanded to trust Christ this morning. "Oh, but
          -- ." I will have no "buts," sir, no "but" whatever. Are you a sinner?
          Yes or no. If you say "No," then I have nothing to say to you; Jesus
          Christ came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. If
          you are a sinner, to you is the Word of this salvation sent. "But I
          have been a thief!" I suppose a thief is a sinner? "But I have been a
          drunkard!" A drunkard is a sinner. "But I have been an unclean liver!"
          You are a sinner, then. "But I have such a hard heart!" Well, to have
          a hard heart is one of the greatest sins in the world. "But I am
          unbelieving!" Well, that is a sin too. You come in under the list of
          sinners, and I say that such Christ contemplated, and the two
          sentences we have already considered prove this to a demonstration. He
          contemplated such as you are when he came to save, for "he was
          numbered with transgressors," and "he bare" -- not the virtues of
          many, not the merits of many, not the good works of many, but "the sin
          of many." So, if you have any sin, here is Christ the sin-bearer; and
          if you are a sinner, here is Christ, numbered with you. "Oh!" says
          one, "but what is faith? I want to know at once." Faith, sinner, is to
          believe in Jesus, and to trust in Jesus now. Saving faith can sing
          this verse --
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am, and waiting not</p>
        <p>To rid my soul of one foul blot,</p>
        <p>To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come, I come."</p>
        <p>
          It is as sinners, not as sensible sinners, not as repenting sinners,
          that Jesus died for us. Sinners as sinners, Jesus Christ has chosen,
          redeemed, and called; in fact, for them, and for only such, Jesus
          Christ came into the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Our third sentence tells us that JESUS INTERCEDES FOR SINNERS.
          "And made intercession for the transgressors."
        </p>
        <p>
          He prays for his saints, but, dear friends, remember that by nature
          they are transgressors, and nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does our text say? He intercedes for transgressors! There is a
          transgressor here this morning. He has been hearing the gospel for
          many years -- for many years; and he has heard it preached faithfully
          too. He is growing grey now; but while his head is getting white his
          heart is black; he is an old hard-hearted reprobate, and by-and-bye,
          unless grace prevents -- but I need not tell that story. What is that
          I hear? The feet of justice, slowly but surely coming. I hear a voice
          saying -- "Lo, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree
          and find none; cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?" The woodman
          feels his axe; it is sharp and keen. "Now," says he, "I will lay to at
          this barren tree, and cut it down." But hark! There is one that maketh
          intercession for transgressors, hear him, hear him, "Spare it yet a
          little while, till I dig about it and dung it, and if it bear fruit
          well; but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down." You see there
          was nothing in that tree why he should plead for it, and there is
          nothing in you why he should plead for you, yet he does it. This very
          morning, perhaps, he is crying "Spare him yet a little while; let him
          hear the gospel again; let him be entreated once more; oh! let him
          have another sickness that it may make his conscience feel; let me
          have another endeavour with his hard heart; it may be, it may be that
          he will yield." O sinner, bless God that Jesus Christ pleads for you
          in that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that done, he pleads for their forgiveness. They are nailing him
          to the cross; the wretches are driving iron through his hands; but
          even while they fasten him to the tree hear him -- "Father, forgive
          them, for they know not what they do." Oh, I spoke to a brother this
          week, whose heart all-conquering love touched. He had been a great
          blasphemer, and when we were talking together about the fact that
          Jesus Christ loved him even when he was cursing, I saw how it broke
          his heart; and it broke mine too, to think that I could rebel against
          Christ whilst he was loving me; that I could despise him while he was
          putting himself in my way in order to do me good. Oh! it is this that
          breaks a man's heart; to think that Christ should have been loving me,
          with the whole force of his soul, while I was despising him, and would
          have nothing to do with him. There is a man there who has been
          cursing, and swearing, and blaspheming, and the very man whom he has
          cursed has been crying "Father, forgive him, for he knows not what he
          does." O sinner, I would this might break thy heart, and bring thee to
          the Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does he end there. He next prays that those for whom he intercedes
          may be saved, and may have a new life given them. "I will pray the
          Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
          with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot
          receive." Every soul that is quickened by the Holy Spirit is so
          quickened as the result of his intercession for transgressors. His
          prayer brings down the life, and dead sinners live. When they live he
          does not cease to pray for them, for by his intercession they are
          preserved. They are tempted and tried, but hear what he says. "Satan
          hath desired to have thee that he may sift thee as wheat, but I have
          prayed for thee that thy strength fail not." Yes, brethren, beloved,
          and this is the reason why we are not condemned, for our Apostle puts
          it -- "Who is he that condemneth?" and the answer he gives is, "Christ
          hath died, yea, rather, hath risen again, who ever maketh intercession
          for us;" as if that intercession choked at once the advocate of hell,
          and delivered us from condemnation. And more, our coming to glory is
          the result of the pleading of Christ for transgressors. "Father, I
          will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am,
          that they may behold my glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a great many sermons preached that have not the gospel in
          them, especially those sermons the drift of which is to tell the
          sinners "Go home and pray; go home and pray." That is very good
          advice, but it is not the gospel. The sinner might answer me, "How can
          I come before God as I am; I cannot plead before him, for I am a
          wretch undone; if I should stand in his presence he would drive me
          from him." Behold Jesus Christ maketh intercession for transgressors.
          It is a common saying in the world, that a man who pleads his own
          cause has a fool for his client, certainly it is so in heaven. But
          when Christ comes in, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, he takes up the
          brief, and now the adversary trembles, for no sooner does he find that
          the suit is put into the hands of him who is the advocate of his
          people than he knows that his case is lost, and that the sinner will
          go free. So, sinner, you are safe if he pleads for you. "Ah," say you,
          "but if he asks me what he should plead I have nothing to tell him."
          You know the counsellor goes into the cell, and he says to the
          prisoner -- "Now, just tell me the case; what can I say in your
          favour?" The criminal replies, "Well, there is so-and-so, and
          so-and-so," and perhaps he is able to say "Why, sir, I am as innocent
          as a new-born babe of the whole affair, and I can prove an alibi, or I
          can do this or that." Very well; the advocate having ground to go
          upon, pleads the case in the court right confidently. But now I hear
          you say, "Ah, I cannot tell the Lord Jesus Christ what he is to plead,
          for I have nothing to plead; the fact is I am guilty, and thoroughly
          guilty too, and I deserve to be punished, and must be; I have nothing
          to plead." Now what does our blessed Advocate say? "Oh," saith he,
          "but I have the plea in myself;" and up he rises in the court of law,
          and when the accusation is read he puts in this to that accusation --
          "In the name of the sinner for whom I intercede, and with whom I am
          numbered, I plead absolution and forgiveness through punishment
          already borne." "How?" saith Justice. And he shows the nail-prints in
          his hands, and lays bare his side, and says, "I suffered for that
          sinner; I was punished with the sinner's punishment, and therefore I
          claim, as the reward of my passion and my agony, that the sinner
          should go his way." Do you not see that Christ is a precious pleader
          because he can appear for us, and what is more, he can find a plea for
          us. "Ah!" I hear you say, "but I have no means of getting such an
          advocate as that; I wish I had, but I have nothing to give him; if he
          asks any fees I have nothing; I do not deserve the love of Christ; I
          do not know why he should take up my cause; if he would I should be
          saved, but I cannot think he will, for I cannot hope to pay him."
          "Nay," says he, "but I will take up your cause freely, willingly,
          cheerfully, and I will make intercession for you, not because you
          deserve it, but because you need it; not because you are not a
          transgressor, but because you are." That very thing, sinner, that
          makes you think Christ will not look at you, is the very reason why he
          will. You are full of disease. "Ah!" say you, "the physician will
          never look at such an arm as that;" but because the ulcer is reeking,
          that is why he stops and says, "I will cure that." Your qualification
          is your disqualification, and what you think to be the reason why he
          never will look at you, is certainly the only reason you can plead why
          he should. You are nothing; you are utterly lost; you have no merit;
          you have nothing unless the Lord Jesus Christ make prevalent,
          acceptable, and perpetual intercession for transgressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I come to a conclusion reluctantly; but I must say these few words.
          There are some of you that make very light of sinning. I pray you be
          reasonable, and think this matter over. It was no light thing for God
          to save a sinner, for the Son of God himself must be numbered with
          sinners, and smart and die for sinners, or else they could not be
          saved. Touch not the unclean thing; hate it. If it is deadly to a holy
          Christ, it must be damnable to you. Oh! pass it by, and loathe it as
          the Egyptians loathed the water of the river when it was turned to
          blood in their sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          To you who make but little of Christ, there is this word: you know
          what sin means; I do not think you can ever make too much of sin, but
          I pray you do not make too little of Christ. To you who think you have
          no qualifications for Christ, I say this closing sentence: I do
          beseech you get rid of that foul, that legal, that soul-destroying
          idea that Christ wants any preparation by you or in you before you
          come to him. You may come to him now; nay, more, you are commanded to
          come to him now, just as you are. And to every man among you to-day,
          and to every woman and child, I preach this gospel in the name of
          Jesus Christ: "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
          saved." Trust him now -- in your seat -- standing in the aisles --
          crowded in these galleries -- trust him now; God commands you. "This
          is the commandment, that ye believe on Jesus Christ whom he hath
          sent." As Peter said, so say I, "Repent and be converted, every one of
          you;" and as Paul said to the Philippian jailer, so say I, "Believe in
          the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." If you
          do not, this shall condemn you; not your sin, but your unbelief; for
          they that believe not are condemned already, Why, why are such
          condemned? Because they believe not. That is the accusation; that is
          the damning crime and curse. "Well," says one, "then if God commands
          me to trust Christ, though I certainly have no reason why I should,
          then I'll do it." Ah! soul, do it then. Can you do it? Can you trust
          him now? Is it a full trust? Are you leaning on your feelings? Give
          them up. Are you depending a little on what you mean to do? Give that
          up. Do you trust him wholly? Can you say, "His blessed wounds, his
          flowing blood, his perfect righteousness, on these I rest. I do trust
          him, wholly?" Are you half afraid to say you do? Do you think it is
          such a bold thing? Do it then; do a bold thing for once! Say, "Lord,
          I'll trust thee, and if thou cast me away, I'll still trust thee; I
          bless thee that thou canst save me, and that thou wilt save me." Can
          you say that? I say, have you believed in him? You are saved, then;
          you are not in a salvable state, but you are saved; not partly, but
          wholly saved; not some of your sins blotted out, but all; behold the
          whole list, and it is written at the bottom of them all: "The blood of
          Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin." But I hear one say, "It is
          too good to be true!" Soul, wilt thou be lost through thinking little
          things of Christ? "Ah!" says another, "it is too simple; if this be
          the gospel, we shall have all the ragamuffins in the streets believing
          in Christ and being saved." And glory be to God if it be so! For my
          part I am never afraid of big sinners being saved. I would have every
          harlot, I would have every whoremonger and adulterer to be saved. I
          would not be afraid that they would go on in their sins if they
          believed in Christ. Oh! no; faith in Christ would change their nature;
          and it will change yours too; for this is salvation: to have the
          nature changed, to be made a new creature in Christ, and to be made
          holy. Come, soul, wilt thou trust him? I do not like you all to go
          away after crowding in here without getting that blessing. Some of you
          have come up to the Handel Festival; but here is better music if you
          trust Christ, for you shall hear the bells of heaven ringing, and all
          the music of the angels as they rejoice over you as a brother
          redeemed. Many of you have come up to see the Great Exhibition; but
          here is a greater wonder than that, if you came into this place this
          morning in a state of nature, and go out in a state of grace, only to
          wait a little while, and then to reach a state of glory! Some of you
          have come up to see the great Cattle Show; but here is something
          better to see than ever was reared on English pasture; here is food
          for your souls; here is that whereof if a man eateth he shall live for
          ever; and here it is held out to you. Nothing can be plainer. Trust
          Christ and you are saved. Outside in the street there is a
          drinking-fountain. When you get there, if you are thirsty go to it;
          you will find no policeman there to send you away. No one will cry,
          "You must not drink because you do not wear a satin dress." "You must
          not drink because you wear a fustian jacket." No, no, go and drink;
          and when you have hold of the ladle and are putting it to your lips,
          if there should come a doubt -- "I do not feel my thirst enough,"
          still take a drink whether you do or not. So I say to you, Jesus
          Christ stands like a great flowing fountain in the corners of the
          street, and he inviteth every thirsty soul to come and drink. You need
          not stop and say, "Am I thirsty enough? Am I black enough?" You do
          want it whether you think you do or not. Come as you are; come as you
          are. Every fitness is legality; every preparation is a lie; every
          getting ready for Chrst is coming the wrong way. You are only making
          yourselves worse while you think you are making yourselves better. You
          are like a boy at school who has made a little blot, and he gets out
          his knife to scratch it out, and makes it ten times worse than before.
          Leave the blots alone. Come as you are. If you are the blackest soul
          out of hell, trust Christ, and that act of trust shall make you clean.
          This seems a simple thing, and yet it is the hardest thing in the
          world to bring you to it; so hard a thing that all the preachers that
          ever preached cannot make a man believe in Christ. Though we put it as
          plainly as we can, and plead with you, you only go away and say, "It
          is too good to be true;" or else you despise it because it is so
          simple; for the gospel, like Christ, is despised and rejected of men,
          because it has no form and comeliness, and no beauty in it that they
          should desire it. Oh! may the Holy Ghost lay this home to you; may he
          make you willing in the day of his power. I hope he has; I trust he
          has, so that ere we go we may all join in singing this one verse, and
          then separate; --
        </p>
        <p>"A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>On Christ's kind arms I fall;</p>
        <p>He is my strength; my righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus, and my all."<br /></p>
