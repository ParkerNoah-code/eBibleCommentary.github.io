          9. For thou, Jehovah, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
          far above all gods.10. Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: he preserveth
          the souls of his meek ones; he will deliver them out of the hand of
          the wicked.11. Light has been sown for the righteous, and gladness for
          the upright in heart.12. Rejoice in Jehovah, ye righteous, and
          celebrate the memory of his holiness.

          9 For thou, Jehovah, art high above all the earth Having already, in
          another place, explained these words, I shall not say more at present
          upon them. Only it is to be noticed, that there is a comparison drawn
          between God and the angels, and whatever has any claim to eminence.
          The Psalmist limits all other excellency in such a manner, as to leave
          no room for questioning that all majesty is comprehended in God only.
          This was the case more eminently when God manifested himself in his
          only-begotten Son, who is the express image of himself. Before that
          period his greatness was less apparent, because he was less known.
        </p>
        <p>
          10 Ye that love Jehovah, hate evil Those that fear God are here
          enjoined to practice righteousness, as Paul says,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity,"
          (2 Timothy 2:19)
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows from the very nature of God, that we cannot be judged and
          acknowledged to be his servants unless we depart from sin, and
          practice holiness. God is in himself the fountain of righteousness,
          and he must necessarily hate all iniquity, unless we could suppose
          that he should deny himself; and we have fellowship with him only on
          the terms of separation from unrighteousness. As the persecution of
          the wicked is apt to provoke us to seek revenge, and unwarrantable
          methods of escape, the Psalmist guards us against this temptation, by
          asserting that God is the keeper and protector of his people. If
          persuaded of being under the Divine guardianship, we will not strive
          with the wicked, nor retaliate injury upon those who have wronged us,
          but commit our safety to him who will faithfully defend it. This
          gracious act of condescension, by which God takes us under his care,
          should serve as a check to any impatience we might feel in abstaining
          from what is evil, and preserving the course of integrity under
          provocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Light has been sown for the righteous He confirms the truth just
          advanced, and anticipates an objection which might be brought against
          it. We have seen that the Lord's people are often treated with the
          utmost cruelty and injustice, and would seem to be abandoned to the
          fury of their enemies. The Psalmist reminds us for our encouragement
          that God, even when he does not immediately deliver his children,
          upholds them by his secret power. In the first clause of the verse
          there is a double metaphor. By light is meant joy, or a prosperous
          issue, (according to a phraseology which is common in Scripture,) as
          darkness denotes adversity. The latter metaphor of sowing is rather
          more difficult to understand. Some think that gladness is sown for the
          just, as seed which, when cast into the ground, dies or lies buried in
          the earth a considerable time before it germinates. This idea may be a
          good one; but, perhaps, the simplest meaning of the words is the
          following, that though the righteous may be almost banished out of the
          world, and unable to venture themselves forth in public, and hidden
          from view, God will spread abroad their joy like seed, or bring forth
          to notice the light of their joy which had been shut up. The second
          clause of the verse is an exegesis of the first -- light being
          interpreted to mean joy, and the righteous such as are upright in
          heart This definition of righteousness is worthy of notice, That it
          does not consist in a mere outward appearance, but comprehends
          integrity of heart, more being required to constitute us righteous in
          God's sight than that we simply keep our tongue, hands, or feet, from
          wickedness. In the concluding verse he exhorts the Lord's people to
          gratitude, that looking upon God as their Redeemer, they should lead a
          life corresponding to the mercy they have received, and rest contented
          under all the evils they encounter, with the consciousness that they
          enjoy his protection.<br />
