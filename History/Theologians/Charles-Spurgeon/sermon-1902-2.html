        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2797)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, September 21st, 1902,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, October 13th, 1878.</p>
        <p>
          "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
          and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and
          to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." -- Isaiah 55:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOME years ago,* I preached from the last four words of this verse,
          laying special stress upon the abundant pardon which is given to
          repenting sinners through the rich mercy of our God. On this occasion,
          I am going to put the emphasis upon the first part of the verse,
          speaking more upon the necessity of the sinner forsaking his evil way,
          and of the unrighteous man abandoning his evil thoughts. There is
          urgent necessity for us continually to insist upon this course of
          action. This chapter, as we noticed in our reading, is full of gospel
          teaching, and it expresses, under the most striking and cheering
          metaphors, both the fullness and the freeness of the gospel. But the
          prophet also insists most clearly that the wicked man must forsake his
          way, and the unrighteous man must turn from his thoughts, and return
          to the Lord, that he may obtain the mercy and pardon that God is
          waiting and willing to bestow.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a merely legal demand; it is a gospel demand, found in the
          centre of a gospel chapter in the writings of the most evangelical of
          all the prophets. The chapter begins with a number of gracious and
          wide invitations, and so naturally leads on to the promise of the
          coming Saviour. Only God himself could find a Saviour for our ruined
          race, and none but God's own Son could be that Saviour. Then there
          follows, in due order, the promise of a people to be saved. The Savour
          shall not come to the earth in vain. He shall call a people unto
          himself, and "nations" shall run unto him. Then, following the promise
          of a Saviour, and the declaration of the certainty that many shall be
          saved by him, there comes in this loving invitation, "Seek ye the Lord
          while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near." Since he is
          to have a people who shall be his for ever, put in your claim to be
          amongst them; and since, as a Saviour, he is near to you, call upon
          him, and he will hear your call.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings us to our text, which is consistent with the rest of the
          chapter, even though some people think it is not. Here we are told,
          first, that the wicked must forsake his way. There is no Saviour for
          the man who will not forsake his sin. Such a man can never be among
          the people who shall run to Christ, for how can he run to Christ while
          he continues in the way of sin? Such a man shall seek sin, he cannot
          embrace the Saviour who hates sin with a perfect hatred. This is the
          theme upon which I am going to speak now, and I want to do it in the
          spirit of the Master, of whom Malachi wrote, "For who may abide the
          day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appeareth? For he is
          like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and he shall sit as a
          refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi,
          and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord
          an offering in righteousness." May the Master bless his own searching
          word, and he shall have all the praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let us meditate a while upon THE NECESSITY OF
          CONVERSION. If a man is to be saved, he must turn from his sins.
          "Right about face!" is the marching order for every sinner. There is
          no hope of forgiveness for him if he will continue with his face as it
          now is. He must turn from his sin if he would be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be at once evident to you when I ask, -- How would it be
          consistent with the holiness of God for him to put aside our past sin,
          and then to allow us to go on sinning as we did before? How could he
          be thought to be just and pure if he should remit the punishment for
          past transgressions, without seeing in us any determination to abstain
          from such sin in the future? Christ Jesus came into the world to save
          sinners, but he never came here to spare their sins. God would never
          have sent his Son to this earth to be the messenger of sin, yet Christ
          would be nothing better than the messenger of sin if he had come, and
          said to men, "You may continue in your sin, yet I will forgive you.
          You may live as you like, yet you shall find mercy with the Lord at
          the last." It must strike you, in a moment, that such a course as this
          would be inconsistent with the character of the Judge of all the
          earth, who must do right. There is no such teaching as that in the
          whole of the Scriptures; and he who dares to believe it, believes a
          lie. Nowhere, in the whole compass of revelation, is there a promise
          of forgiveness to the man who continues in his iniquity. There is a
          promise of pardon to the sinner who forsakes his wicked way, and turns
          from his evil thoughts; there are many promises of forgiveness to
          those who confess their sins in humble penitence, and who seek to live
          new lives under the power of the Holy Spirit. Possibly, someone would
          remind me that the greatest promises are given to those who believe in
          the Lord Jesus Christ. That is quite true; but the faith which
          believes in Jesus is a living and active faith, which works in the
          soul a hatred of sin; and if a man says, "I believe in Christ," and
          yet continues to delight in sin, he is a liar, and the truth is not in
          him, for "faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone." That
          faith alone will save us which is proved to be a vital and real faith
          by bringing forth "fruits meet for repentance." It is no use wanting
          or trying to be saved without a change of heart, and a change of life.
          "Ye must be born again," is Christ's own word to all unregenerate
          sinners. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. "Be not deceived;
          God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
          reap." There has never been any revocation of these truths, and again
          I repeat that, in the whole compass of the Word of God, there is no
          promise of pardon to the man who continues in his iniquities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither, dear friends, is there a single case in fact, nor one emblem
          in parable, that would lead any man to hope that he could keep his
          sins, and yet be saved. If you remind me of the woman in the city who
          was a sinner, I also remind you that her life had been completely
          changed, else our Saviour would not have permitted her to wash his
          feet with her tears, and wipe them with the hairs of her head. Saul of
          Tarsus was guilty of the great sin of persecuting the saints; but see
          what a changed man was Paul the apostle of the Gentiles. Zaccheus, the
          rich tax-gatherer, offered to make full restitution and recompense to
          any whom he might have wronged. So is it evermore where the grace of
          God works effectually. When the Lord Jesus Christ saves a sinner from
          the punishment of sin, he also saves him from the love of sin; -- he
          makes him holy as well as makes him happy and safe. The same lesson is
          taught in our Lord's parables. For instance, there was no rejoicing
          over the lost sheep while it was still wandering away from the fold;
          the joy began when that lost sheep was found, and was brought home on
          the shepherd's shoulder. A more striking example is that of the
          prodigal son. There was no joy over him while he was in the far
          country, and no kiss for him from his father while he was feeding the
          swine. He must come back, he must say, "Father, I have sinned," there
          must be the forsaking of his former evil ways, or else there could be
          no enjoyment of his father's forgiveness. We must ever say, as plainly
          as we can possibly say it, -- If thou wilt keep thy sins, thou shalt
          go to hell; but if thou wouldst go to heaven, thou must part company
          with thy sins. He who would be married to Christ must first be
          divorced from sin. There is no possibility of walking in the way of
          the Lord and, at the same time, treading the pathway of evil. "No man
          can serve two masters." No one can, at the same time, be a servant of
          the Saviour and a servant of Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, dear friends, our common sense tells us that it would be
          highly dangerous to society if men were to be pardoned, and yet were
          not to be renewed in character and life. If Christ should meet with a
          man, and say to him, "I forgive thee because of the precious blood I
          shed for thee on Calvary; go and be a drunkard still, go and be
          unchaste, go and be a thief," this would be the way to undermine the
          very pillars of society, and, very soon, we should not be safe in our
          beds. If there were no laws, or if the laws had no system of
          punishment for the guilty, human society would cease to be endurable.
          He who ruleth all things righteously will never set up such a scheme
          as this. The Judge of all the earth must punish sin; he will by no
          means clear the guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it would be a serious injury to the man himself if he could
          be pardoned, and yet not be changed. For God to forgive us without
          renewing us, would be a frightful peril to ourselves. A man, finding
          himself so easily forgiven, and having no change of heart, would
          plunge into sin worse than ever; and, so far as my observation is
          concerned, I have come to the conclusion that the very worst form of
          character is produced in a man who, for some reason or other, thinks
          himself to be a favourite of heaven, and yet continues to indulge in
          sin. I recollect the thrill of horror, which passed through me, in my
          youthful days, when I heard a man, who was accustomed to be drunk,
          boast that he could say what none of his pot companions could say,
          namely, that he was one of the elect of God. I felt, child as I was,
          that he was one of the devil's chosen followers, and I do not doubt
          that he really was. If a man once gets into his head such a perverted
          notion of the free grace of God as to imagine that it is compatible
          with the love of sin, and a life of sin, he is on the high road to
          being made into the worst conceivable character; and if such a man as
          that could be delivered from all the consequences of his sin, from all
          such consequences as might be looked upon as arbitrarily fixed by the
          punishing hand of God, (I know that I am talking of an impossibility,)
          even then he must be miserable. Such a man must go on from bad to
          worse; and sin, whatever we may think of it, is misery. The worm that
          never dies is sin; the fire that is never quenched is sin; and hell is
          sin fully developed. "Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death,"
          and that second death is hell. O sirs, if you could get rid of the
          disease, the pain, the headaches, the qualms of conscience which
          follow upon indulgence in sin, it would be a mischievous riddance for
          you, for the very pain that is caused by sin is part of God's way of
          calling to you to come back to him. As long as you are in this world,
          the consequences that follow after certain forms of sin are really,
          with all their bitterness, -- and they are bitter, -- but a healthful
          tonic that should make you give up sin, and turn to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you go on sinning, you cannot be saved. If you continue to love
          sin, and to practise it, you cannot be saved. Think, for a moment,
          what any other result would involve; if it were possible for a man to
          live in sin, and yet be forgiven, what would be the value of the work
          of the Holy Ghost? He has come in order that we may be born again, and
          have new hearts and right spirits; but if men could be forgiven
          without having new hearts and right spirits, of what service would the
          Holy Spirit be? This would be contrary, also, to the whole design of
          Christ in our salvation. The angel said to Joseph, before our
          Saviour's birth, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save
          his people from their sins;" but if they can be saved in their sins,
          where is the meaning of his name? When he hung upon the cross, and one
          of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, "forthwith came there
          out blood and water;" but what is the use of the purifying water if we
          need not be purified, and can be pardoned without being cleansed? Paul
          wrote to Titus that Christ "gave himself for us, that he might redeem
          us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
          zealous of good works;" but how can that purpose be accomplished if
          men can be pardoned, and yet continue to live in sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside that, the very character of heaven prevents such a thing being
          done; we know that the unholy cannot enter there, nothing that
          defileth can pass the watchers at the pearly portals; therefore, be ye
          sure of this, -- that you can never enter heaven, and you can never
          have forgiveness, if you continue to cling to your sins. You must
          forsake them, or mercy cannot be yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having spoken thus upon the necessity of conversion, I turn, for a
          little while, to the second part of our subject, THE NATURE OF THIS
          CONVERSION. How is it described here?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it deals with the life: "Let the wicked forsake his way."
          Observe that it is "his way" that he is to forsake; that is, his
          natural way, the way in which he says he was brought up, the way that
          his natural affections, and propensities, and passions lead him. He
          must forsake this way, even though it is the way in which he has
          walked these thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, or even eighty
          years; he will have to get out of this way, however much he may
          delight in it. Possibly, he has now got to love sin so much that he
          says he could not give it up. There are some sins which men roll under
          their tongues as dainty morsels; but if you are to be saved, you will
          have to give them up. If you would have mercy of God, you must give
          them all up. You must give up your old sins, your sweet sins, your pet
          sins; the sins of the flesh, with all their pleasure, and the sins of
          the mind, with all their pride, must be given up; for notice that word
          "forsake." "Let the wicked forsake his way." It does not say, "Let him
          own that his way is bad." There are some who will say, 'Oh, yes, I
          know that my way is very wrong;" and there they stop. Such an
          admission as that will not save you, my friend; you must forsake your
          way as well as own that it is wrong. To know that it is wrong, and yet
          to go on in it, will double your sin. This kind of confession will not
          help you in the least; on the contrary, it will only increase your
          guilt. You must forsake your wicked way if you are to be forgiven.
          "Oh, sir," you say, "I am very sorry for all the sin that I have
          committed!" I am glad that you are, and I hope that you will be still
          more so; but that sorrow alone will never save you. It is not saying,
          "I am sorry," nor yet your being sorry for your sin that will save
          you; that is right as far as it goes, but you must forsake the sin as
          well as be sorry for it. "I must forsake it; well, I resolve that I
          will do so." Yet that resolve by itself will not save you, for there
          are plenty of good resolutions that are good for nothing. You have
          actually to forsake your wicked way before you have complied with the
          requirements of our text. I know how the devil will try to deceive
          you, when you have made a good resolution. He will say, "Ah, you are a
          fine fellow; and that is a splendid resolution of yours!" Yet mere
          resolutions are not worth a penny a thousand; we must act, not simply
          resolve what we mean to do. We must not be like the man who owes a lot
          of money, and has not a penny to pay, yet who keeps on saying to his
          creditors, "I hope I shall be able to pay you tomorrow." Then, when
          that day comes, he says he is very sorry, but he missed the friend he
          expected to see, so he must postpone the payment for a few days; yet,
          when the few days have passed, there is still nothing forthcoming. So
          it is with many who resolve to forsake sin; they are like those who
          promise, but never pay. This will not do; you must forsake your sin if
          it is to be forgiven.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will tell you what I will do," says one; "I will still keep to my
          old way, but I will not travel quite so rapidly in it; I will not live
          such a fast life as I have done." I tell thee, friend, that thou must
          forsake that old way of thine altogether if thou wouldst be saved. If
          thou standest still in it, if thou art decent and respectable in it,
          all that will avail thee nothing. Thou must clear right out of it, for
          so our text puts it, "Let the wicked forsake his way." In plain terms,
          the prophet means just this. Is your way the way of the drunkard? Now,
          no drunkard can ever inherit the kingdom of God as long as he
          continues a drunkard, so you cannot be saved if you remain in that
          condition. Are you a thief? Do you privately cheat in business? All
          that kind of thing must be given up. It is no use for you to say, "I
          will do it, and yet go to heaven." You will be damned unless that sin,
          as well as others, be given up. Or have you been a blasphemer? Do you
          talk profanely or filthily? You must wash all that foulness out of
          your mouth if you would be saved: "Let the wicked forsake his way." Am
          I addressing any who have practised vice in unmentionable forms? Oh,
          how many there are who do that, and yet are not ashamed! You must
          forsake all that, young man, or old man either; it is no use mincing
          matters with you. If you mean to go to hell, go on with your
          wickedness; but if you would be forgiven for the past, you must cut
          all connection with these evil things for the future. I most solemnly
          assure you, in the name of God, that there can be no compromise about
          this and every other sin. 'Let the wicked forsake his way, a fleshly
          way, a way of lust, a way of self-indulgence, any way of sin, -- it
          must be forsaken. You must abandon it, or else you must abandon all
          hope of ever getting to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That is pretty strong language," says someone. Do you think so? I
          shall have to use still stronger expressions presently, for the next
          point concerning the nature of this repentance is that it deals with
          the man's thoughts: "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
          unrighteous man his thoughts." "But thoughts are free," says some
          unthinking person; "I shall never be hanged for my thoughts." No,
          perhaps not; but have you never heard that old saying, "A man may not
          be hanged for his thoughts, but he may be damned for his thoughts;"
          for, in thought, is often the very essence of sin. A deed might in
          itself be colourless; but the motive for doing it -- the thought at
          the back of it -- puts the venom, and virus, and guilt into the deed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As that is the case, what sort of thoughts must the unrighteous man
          give up? He must give up a great many fine opinions of which he is
          very proud; -- his opinion about God, for instance. It is possible
          that he has thought nothing of him; or if he has thought of him at
          all, he has dared even to judge his Creator, and to find fault with
          what God does. Ah, sir! You must give up all such thoughts of God, and
          you must come to reverence him, and to regard him as so great that you
          are less than nothing in comparison with him. You will also have to
          give up your opinion concerning God's law. You thought it was too
          severe, too stringent, and that you could improve it a great deal. You
          will have to confess, with the apostle Paul, that the law is
          spiritual, and that you are "carnal, sold under sin." You will have to
          change your mind upon a great many subjects if you really wish to be
          saved. You will have to forsake your old thoughts concerning sin. You
          said, "Oh, it is a mere trifle, -- a peccadillo! Poor helpless
          creatures as we are, God won't be angry with us for such a little
          thing as that." You will have to feel that sin is exceedingly sinful,
          a great and deadly evil, or you will never be likely to seek and to
          find peace with God. You will also have to change your mind about the
          Lord Jesus Christ. He is nothing to you now; but he will have to be
          everything to you if you are to be saved by him. You will have to
          change your mind about yourself; you fancy that you are a fine fellow
          now, but you will have to regard yourself as less than nothing before
          you come to your right position before God. If ever you are to find
          mercy at his hands, you will have to forsake your present thoughts on
          all these matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you ask, "What other thoughts shall we have to forsake?" I reply,
          -- A whole set of thoughts in which many people indulge. To the
          ungodly man, it is often quite a treat to sit down, and think of what
          he calls the jolly days of his youth when he sowed his wild oats. He
          wishes that he had a handful or two of them left. Ah, sir! You will
          have to give up all thoughts of that sort; but you will have to think
          of those past days with bitter tears of sorrow over the sins that you
          then committed. The ungodly man often pictures to himself scenes of
          carnal delight; and if he cannot have a share in such scenes, he often
          wishes that he could. I would remind any of you, who have ever done
          so, that you may commit every sin forbidden in the Decalogue, without
          having actually committed any one of them, by simply revelling in them
          in your thoughts. Remember that solemn affirmation of the Lord Jesus
          Christ concerning the seventh commandment, "I say unto you, That
          whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
          with her already in his heart;" and learn from it how our Lord meant
          his interpretation to apply to the whole law, so that we should
          understand that the very thought of evil is sin; and to suck it down
          as a sweet morsel to think upon, even though we never dared to
          perpetrate the act, is still a gross evil; and if we would be
          forgiven, we must forsake all these vile, flesh-delighting thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must also forsake our thoughts in the sense of turning from all
          purposes of evil. That, indeed, is the main meaning of the Hebrew word
          used here: "Let the unrighteous man forsake his purposes." You say
          that you will do this or that, without any thought of whether God
          would have it so or not. Possibly it is your purpose, as you express
          it, "to have your fling." You have come up from the country, young
          man, you are pleased that you have got away from your mother's apron
          strings, and now you are going to have your own way. Forsake all such
          thoughts, I implore you; and, if any, whom I am now addressing, have
          formed any purpose of sin, -- if you have resolved to indulge in this
          or that evil, whatever it may be, I charge you, if you desire to have
          eternal life, to hate all such purposes and thoughts of sin. The
          garment spotted by the flesh must be flung away from us, and the very
          thought of evil must be banished from our minds as far as it is
          possible for us to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all, for the text further says, "and let him return unto
          the Lord," so that this conversion deals with the sinner in his
          relation to God. He who would find mercy must return to God to obtain
          it. Do you ask how you are to do so? Well, first, you must begin to
          think about God. I really believe that some of you do not think half
          as much about God as you do about the Sultan of Turkey; and with some
          of you, almost anybody is a greater factor in your life than God is.
          With some of you, it would not make any difference if there were no
          God at all, except that you would be rather glad if that could be
          proved to be the case, for you would feel easier in your mind, and
          could, in such a case, go on in your sin without any of the
          compunction that you now feel. Yet, is it not a singular state of mind
          for a man, who knows that he is a creature made by God, but who really
          cares so little about him that, if he could be assured that there were
          no such being, he would be better pleased than he is now? Oh, what a
          wretched state your heart must be in if it feels like that! It will
          have to be greatly altered if you are ever to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, first, you must begin to think of God; and then, thinking of him,
          you must yield to him, give up your will to his will; and, doing that,
          you must pray to him, cry to him for mercy; and then you must trust
          him. Especially, you must accept his way of salvation by faith in
          Jesus Christ; and when you do that, then you will be sure to love him.
          When you get as far as that, you will be a new creature altogether.
          Then, God will delight in you; then, it will be misery to you to be
          out of his presence, and it will be the highest joy of your life to
          have constant communion with him.

          III. Now I finish with the third part of our subject, that is, THE
          GOSPEL OF THIS CONVERSION.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly, somebody says, "You have been preaching to us the law, sir."
          No, I have not. The law says nothing about repentance. The law curses
          you from the very first moment when you have broken it. That gracious
          message, "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
          blotted out," is not the utterance of law, but of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will try briefly to show you the gospel of it. It lies, first, in
          the fact that God has promised that he will abundantly pardon those
          who turn from their evil ways: "Let him return unto the Lord, and he
          will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
          pardon." To the man who confesses his guilt, the law says, "Yes, you
          are guilty, and you must suffer the penalty attached to your crime."
          If a person pleads "guilty" in a court of law, the judge does not say
          to him, "If you will promise amendment, you may go free." No, he
          pronounces sentence upon him, and God, the righteous Judge, might
          justly have done the same to us; but, instead of doing so, he says,
          "Forsake your wicked way, and your evil thoughts, and turn to me, and
          I will abundantly pardon you. Only repent of your iniquity, and
          abandon it, and it shall all be blotted out. All the evil of your past
          life shall be forgiven and forgotten; and your sins and your
          transgressions I will not remember against you any more for ever." Oh,
          precious gospel message! Who would not turn from his sin when such a
          gracious promise awaits him in the turning?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet there is more even than that, a great deal; for not only does God
          bid men turn to him, but he enables them to turn to him; so the gospel
          of this passage is, that God the Holy Ghost is freely given to sinners
          to turn them, first in their hearts, and then in their lives. What you
          cannot do of yourself, the Holy Spirit will enable you to do, or will
          do for you. There is no form of sin which you cannot conquer by the
          power of the Spirit of God, and that Spirit is freely given to all who
          sincerely seek his aid. He is here on earth still. On the day of
          Pentecost, he descended from heaven, and he has never gone back again.
          "But," says someone, "the Holy Spirit was given to the saints." Yes, I
          know he was; but he was also given to sinners like yourself, for Peter
          said to those who were awakened on the day of Pentecost, "Repent, and
          be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
          remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
          For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are
          afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." I wish that
          many of you would pray the prayer, "Turn us, O God, and we shall be
          turned." You must be turned, by sovereign grace, if you would really
          turn unto the Lord; and you must forsake your wicked way, and your
          evil thoughts, if you are to be saved, and you cannot do this of
          yourself; but the Holy Spirit has been given on purpose to enable you
          to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a further gospel message in the fact that Jesus Christ
          himself came into the world on purpose that this Divine Spirit might
          be given in connection with the exercise, by men, of faith in him. One
          of the simplest declarations of the gospel is, "He that believeth on
          the Son hath everlasting life;" and one of the last sayings of our
          Lord Jesus Christ before he went back to heaven was, "He that
          believeth and is baptized shall be saved." To believe is to trust; and
          whosoever trusts Christ Jesus, depends upon the merit of his death,
          relies upon the excellence of his atoning sacrifice, and proves the
          reality of his faith by confessing it in the Scriptural way, such a
          man shall assuredly be saved; and, in order to his being saved, he
          shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by whose almighty power he
          shall be enabled to conquer the sin that still dwells within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, -- and this is the part of the gospel that is the best of
          all, -- in order that you might be able to believe that God can have
          mercy on the guilty, and in order that you might be saved, God gave
          his Son, Jesus Christ, to offer a full and complete atonement for sin.
          I never weary of preaching that glorious truth to you, but I long
          that, when I have done so, you may close in with Christ, and that
          Christ may close in with you, that you may be eternally saved.
          According to the righteous law of God, sin must be punished.
          Conscience tells you that it is not possible that guilt should go
          without its due penalty. Therefore it was that Jesus came, and bore
          the dread penalty that was due to sin. The lash of the law must fall
          on someone, so he bared his shoulders to its terrible blows. The sword
          of divine justice was unsheathed, and it must smite someone; so Jesus
          gave his heart to that sword's point, and quenched the flaming blade
          in the crimson fountain of his own blood. Now that this has been done,
          God can be just, and yet the Justifier of everyone who believes in
          Jesus; and the effect of that atoning sacrifice upon everyone who
          truly trusts to it is that he finds himself so changed that he hates
          the sin he formerly loved, he rushes out of the wicked way in which he
          once delighted, he abhors the thoughts that once charmed him, and he
          turns to the Saviour whom once he despised.
