        <p align="justify">
          This sublime SONG OF THE EXODUS is one and indivisible. True poetry
          has here reached its climax: no human mind has ever been able to
          equal, much less to excel, the grandeur of this Psalm. God is spoken
          of as leading forth his people from Egypt to Canaan, and causing the
          whole earth to be moved at his coming. Things inanimate are
          represented as imitating the actions of living creatures when the Lord
          passes by. They are illustrated with marvelous force of language,
          until one seems to look upon the actual scene. The God of Jacob is
          exalted as having command over river, sea, and mountain, and causing
          all nature to pay homage and tribute before his glorious majesty.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. When Israel went out of Egypt</p></b>.
        The song begins with a burst, as if the poetic fury could not be
        restrained—but overleaped all bounds. The soul elevated and filled with
        a sense of divine glory cannot wait to fashion a preface—but springs at
        once into the middle of its theme. Israel emphatically came out of
        Egypt, out of the population among whom they had been scattered, from
        under the yoke of bondage, and from under the personal grasp of the king
        who had made the people into national slaves. Israel came out with a
        high hand and a stretched out arm, defying all the power of the empire,
        and making the whole of Egypt to travail with sore anguish, as the
        chosen nation was as it were born out of its midst.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            The house of Jacob from a people of strange language.
          </p></b
        >
        They had gone down into Egypt as a single family, "the house of Jacob";
        and, though they had multiplied greatly, they were still so united, and
        were so fully regarded by God as a single unit, that they are rightly
        spoken of as the <i>house </i>of Jacob. They were as one man in their
        willingness to leave Goshen; numerous as they were, not a single
        individual stayed behind.

        <p align="justify">
          Unanimity is a pleasing token of the divine presence, and one of its
          sweetest fruits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One of their inconveniences in Egypt was the difference of languages,
          which was very great. The Israelites appear to have regarded the
          Egyptians as stammerers and babblers, since they could not understand
          them, and they very naturally considered the Egyptians to be
          barbarians, as they would no doubt often beat them because they did
          not comprehend their orders. The language of foreign taskmasters is
          never musical in an exile's ear.
          <i
            >How sweet it is to a Christian who has been compelled to hear the
            filthy conversation of the wicked, when at last he is brought out
            from their midst to dwell among his own people!</i
          >
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
          </p></b
        >
        The pronoun "his" comes in where we would have looked for the name of
        God; but the poet is so full of thought concerning the Lord that he
        forgets to mention his name, like the spouse in the Song, who begins,
        "Let <i>him </i>kiss me," or Magdalene when she cried, "Tell me where
        you have laid <i>him</i>."
        <p align="justify">
          From the mention of Judah and Israel certain critics have inferred
          that this Psalm must have been written after the division of the two
          kingdoms; but this is only another instance of the extremely slender
          basis upon which an hypothesis is often built up. Before the formation
          of the two kingdoms David had said, "Go number Israel and Judah," and
          this was common parlance, for Uriah the Hittite said, "The ark, and
          Israel and Judah abide in tents"; so that nothing can be inferred from
          the use of the two names.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No division into two kingdoms can have been intended here, for the
          poet is speaking of the coming out of Egypt when the people were so
          united that he has just before called them "the house of Jacob." It
          would be quite as fair to prove from the first verse that the Psalm
          was written when the people were in union as to prove from the second
          that its authorship dates from their separation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Judah was the tribe which led the way in the wilderness march, and it
          was foreseen in prophecy to be the royal tribe, hence its poetic
          mention in this place. The meaning of the passage is that the whole
          people at the coming out of Egypt were separated unto the Lord to be a
          peculiar people, a nation of priests whose motto should be, "Holiness
          unto the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Judah was the Lord's "holy thing," set apart for his special use. The
          nation was peculiarly Jehovah's dominion, for it was governed by a
          theocracy in which God alone was King. It was his domain in a sense in
          which the rest of the world was outside his kingdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These were the young days of Israel, the time of her espousals, when
          she went after the Lord into the wilderness, her God leading the way
          with signs and miracles. The whole people were the shrine of Deity,
          and their camp was one great temple.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a change there must have been for the godly among them from the
          idolatries and blasphemies of the Egyptians to the holy worship and
          righteous rule of the great King in Jeshurun. They lived in a world of
          wonders, where God was seen in the wondrous bread they ate and in the
          water they drank, as well as in the solemn worship of his holy place.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            When the Lord is manifestly present in a church, and his gracious
            rule obediently owned, what a golden age has come
          </p></i
        >, and what honorable privileges his people enjoy! May it be so among
        us. <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. The sea saw it, and fled</p></b>; or
        rather, "The sea saw and fled"—it saw God and all his people following
        his lead, and it was struck with awe and fled away. A bold figure! The
        Red Sea mirrored the hosts which had come down to its shore, and
        reflected the cloud which towered high over all, as the symbol of the
        presence of the Lord: never had such a scene been imaged upon the
        surface of the Red Sea, or any other sea, before. It could not endure
        the unusual and astounding sight, and fleeing to the right and to the
        left, opened a passage for the elect people.
        <p align="justify">
          A like miracle happened at the end of the great march of Israel, for
          "<b>Jordan was driven back</b>." This was a swiftly flowing river,
          pouring itself down a steep decline, and it was not merely divided,
          but its current was driven back so that the rapid torrent, contrary to
          nature, flowed uphill.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This was God's work: the poet does not sing of the suspension of
          natural laws, or of a singular phenomenon not readily to be explained;
          but to him the presence of God with his people is everything, and in
          his lofty song he tells how the river was driven back because the Lord
          was there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this case poetry is nothing but the literal fact, and the fiction
          lies on the side of the atheistic critics who will suggest any
          explanation of the miracle rather than admit that the Lord made bare
          his holy arm in the eyes of all his people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>division of the sea </i>and the
          <i>drying up of the river </i>are placed together though forty years
          intervened, because they were the opening and closing scenes of one
          great event.

        will also conduct us through the Jordan of death out of our wilderness
        wanderings in the desert of this tried and changeful life. It is all one
        and the same deliverance, and the beginning ensures the end.

            Verse 4. The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
            lambs.
          </p></b
        >At the coming of the Lord to Mount Sinai, the hills moved; either
        leaping for joy in the presence of their Creator like young lambs; or,
        if you will, springing from their places in affright at the awesome
        majesty of Jehovah, and flying like a flock of sheep when alarmed. Men
        fear the mountains—but the mountains tremble before the Lord. Sheep and
        lambs move lightly in the meadows; but the hills, which we are
        accustomed to call <i>eternal</i>, were as readily made to move as the
        most active creatures. Rams in their strength, and lambs in their play,
        are not more stirred than were the solid hills when Jehovah marched by.
        <p align="justify">
          Nothing is immovable but God himself: the mountains shall depart, and
          the hills be removed—but the covenant of his grace abides fast forever
          and ever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Even thus do <i>mountains of sin </i>and <i>hills of trouble </i>move
          when the Lord comes forth to lead his people to their eternal Canaan.
          Let us never fear—but rather let our faith say unto this mountain, "Be
          removed hence and cast into the sea," and it shall be done.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 5. What ailed you, O sea?</p></b>Were you
        terribly afraid? Did your strength fail you? Did your very heart dry up?
        <b> <p align="justify">What ailed you, O you sea, that you fled?</p></b
        >You were neighbor to the power of Pharaoh—but you never feared his
        hosts; stormy wind could never prevail against you so as to divide you
        in twain; but when the way of the Lord was in your great waters you were
        seized with affright, and you became a fugitive from before him.
        <b> <p align="justify">O Jordan, that you were driven back?</p></b>What
        ailed you, O quick descending river? Your fountains had not dried up,
        neither had a chasm opened to engulf you! The near approach of Israel
        and her God sufficed to make you retrace your steps. What ails all our
        enemies that they fly when the Lord is on our side? What ails Hell
        itself that it is utterly routed when Jesus lifts up a standard against
        it? "Fear took hold upon them there," for fear of HIM the stoutest
        hearted did quake, and became as dead men.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. You mountains, that you skipped like rams; and you hills,

        >
        What ailed you, that you were thus moved? There is but one reply: the
        majesty of God made you to leap! A gracious mind will chide human nature
        for its strange insensibility—when the sea and the river, the mountains
        and the hills, are all sensitive to the presence of God. Man is endowed
        with reason and intelligence, and yet he sees unmoved, that which the
        material creation beholds with fear. God has come nearer to us than ever
        he did to Sinai, or to Jordan, for he has assumed our nature—and yet the
        mass of mankind are neither driven back from their sins, nor moved in
        the paths of obedience.

          Our deliverance from under the yoke of sin is strikingly typified in
          the going up of Israel from Egypt, and so also was the victory of our
          Lord over the powers of death and Hell. The <i>Exodus </i>should
          therefore be earnestly remembered by Christian hearts. Did not Moses
          on the mount of transfiguration speak to our Lord of "the exodus"
          which he should shortly accomplish at Jerusalem; and is it not written
          of the hosts above that they sing the song of Moses the servant of
          God, and of the Lamb? Do we not ourselves expect another coming of the
          Lord, when before his face Heaven and earth shall flee away and there
          shall be no more sea? We join then with the singers around the
          Passover table and make their Hallel ours, for we too have been led
          out of bondage and guided like a flock through a desert land, wherein
          the Lord supplies our needs with heavenly manna and water from the
          Rock of ages. Praise the Lord!
