        <h2>
          CHAPTER 1: Christian Theology; Its Several Branches; And Their
          Relation to Other Departments of Human Knowledge
        </h2>
        <p>1. What is Religion? And what is Theology in its Christian sense?</p>
        <p>
          Religion, in its most general sense, is the sum of the relations which
          man sustains to God, and comprises the truths, the experiences,
          actions, and institutions which correspond to, or grow out of those
          relations.
        </p>
        <p>Theology, in its most general sense, is the science of religion.</p>
        <p>
          The Christian religion is that body of truths, experiences, actions,
          and institutions which are determined by the revelation supernaturally
          presented in the Christian Scriptures. Christian Theology is the
          scientific determination, interpretation. and defense of those
          Scriptures, together with the history of the manner in which the
          truths it reveals have been understood, and the duties they impose
          have been performed, by all Christians In all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What is Theological Encyclopedia? and what Theological Methodology?
        </p>
        <p>
          Theological Encyclopædia, from the Greek ἐγκυκλοπαιδεία (the whole
          circle of general education), presents to the student the entire
          circle of the special sciences devoted to the discovery, clarity, and
          defense of the contents of the supernatural revelation contained in
          the Christian Scriptures, and aims to present these sciences in those
          organic relations which are determined by their actual genesis and
          inmost nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theological Methodology is the science of theological method. As each
          department of human inquiry demands a mode of treatment peculiar to
          itself; and as even each subdivision of each general department
          demands its own special modifications of treatment, so theological
          methodology provides for the scientific determination of the true
          method, general and special, of pursuing the theological sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this includes two distinct categories: (a) The methods proper to
          the original investigation and construction of the several sciences,
          and (b) the methods proper to elementary instruction in the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this should be accompanied with critical and historical
          information, and direction as to the use of the vast literature with
          which these sciences are illustrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To what extent is the scientific arrangement of all the theological
          sciences possible? And on what account is the attempt desirable?
        </p>
        <p>
          Such an arrangement can approach perfection only in proportion as
          these sciences themselves approach their final and absolute form. At
          present every such attempt must be only more or less an approximation
          to an ideal unattainable in the present state of knowledge in this
          life. Every separate attempt also must depend for its comparative
          success upon the comparative justness of the general theological
          principles upon which it is based. It is evident that those who make
          Reason, and those who make the inspired Church, and those who make the
          inspired Scriptures the source and standard of all divine knowledge
          must severally configure the theological sciences to the different
          foundations on which they are made to stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point of view adopted in this book is the evangelical and
          specifically the Calvinistic or Augustinian one, assuming the
          following fundamental principles: 1st. The inspired Scriptures are the
          sole, and an infallible standard of all religious knowledge. 2nd.
          Christ and his work is the center around which all Christian theology
          is brought into order. 3rd. The salvation brought to light in the
          gospel is supernatural and of FREE GRACE. 4th. All religious knowledge
          has a practical end. The theological sciences, instead of being
          absolute ends in themselves, find their noblest purpose and effect in
          the advancement of personal holiness, the more efficient service of
          our fellowmen, and THE GREATER GLORY OF GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantages of such a grouping of the theological sciences are
          obvious, and great. The relations of all truths are determined by
          their nature, whence it follows that their nature is revealed by an
          exhibition of their relations. Such an exhibition will also tend to
          widen the mental horizon of the student, to incite him to breadth of
          culture, and prevent him from unduly exalting or exclusively
          cultivation any one special branch, and thus from perverting it by
          regarding it out of its natural limitations and dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. What are the fundamental questions which all theological science
          proposes to answer, and which therefore determine the arrangement of
          the several departments of that general science?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Is there a God? 2nd. Has God spoken? 3rd. What has God said? 4th.
          How have men in time past understood his word and practically, in
          their persons and institutions, realized his intentions?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What position in an encyclopedia of theological sciences must be
          given to other branches of human knowledge?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident that as the Supernatural Revelation God has been pleased
          to give has come to us in an historical form, that history, and that
          of the Christian Church, is inseparably connected with all human
          history more or less directly. Further, it is evident that as all
          truth is one, all revealed truths and duties are inseparably connected
          with all departments of human knowledge, and with all the institutions
          of human society. It hence follows that theological science can at no
          point be separated from general science, that some knowledge of every
          department of human knowledge must always be comprehended in every
          system of Theological Encyclopedia as auxiliary to the Theological
          sciences themselves. Some of these auxiliary sciences sustain special
          relations to certain of the theological sciences, and are very
          remotely related to others. It is, however, convenient to give them a
          position by themselves, as in general constituting a discipline
          preparatory and auxiliary to the science of theology as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. State the main divisions of the proposed arrangement of the
          theological sciences.
        </p>
        <p>1. Sciences Auxiliary to the study of theology.</p>
        <p>
          2. Apologetics—embracing the answers to the two questions— Is there a
          God? and Has God spoken?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Exegetical Theology—embracing the critical determination of the
          ipsissima verba of the Divine Revelation, and the Interpretation their
          meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Systematic Theology— embracing the development into an
          all–embracing and self–consistent system of the contents of that
          Revelation, and its subsequent elucidation and defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Practical Theology—embracing the principles and laws revealed in
          Scripture for the guidance of Christians (a) in the promulgation of
          this divine revelation thus ascertained and interpreted, and thus (b)
          in bringing all men into practical obedience to the duties it imposes
          and (c) into the fruition of the blessings it confers.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Historical Theology—embracing the history of the actual development
          during all past ages and among all people of the theoretical and
          practical elements of that revelation 1. in the faith and 2. in the
          life of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. State the chief departments of human knowledge related to study of
          Theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. As underlying and conditioning all knowledge, we have Universal
          History, and as auxiliary to theological science especially the
          Histories of Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Greece, Rome and of Medieval
          and Modern Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Archaeology in its most comprehensive sense, including the
          interpretation of inscriptions, monuments, coins, and remains of art,
          and the illustrations gathered thence and from all other available
          sources, of the geographical distribution and physical conditions and
          of the political, religious, and social institutions and customs of
          all peoples, of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Ethnology— the science of the divisions of the human family into
          races and nations, and of their dispersion over the world— which
          traces their origin and affiliations and their varieties of physical,
          intellectual, moral, and religious character, and the sources and
          modifying conditions of these variations.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Comparative Philology, the science which starting from the
          natural groups of human languages, traces the relations and origins of
          languages and dialects, and transcending the first dawn of human
          history, traces the unity of races now separated, and the elements of
          long extinct civilizations, and the facts of historic changes
          otherwise left without record.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. The Science of Comparative Religion, the critical study and
          comparison of the history, beliefs, spirit, principles, institutions,
          and practical character of all the Ethnic religions, tracing the light
          they throw upon (a) human nature and history, (b) the moral government
          of God, and (c) the supernatural revelation recorded in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. Philosophy, the ground and mistress of all the merely human
          sciences. This will include the history of the origin and development
          of all the schools of philosophy, ancient, mediaeval, and modern—a
          critical study and comparison of their principles, methods, and
          doctrines, and the range and character of their respective influence
          upon all other sciences and institutions, especially upon those which
          are political and religious, and more especially upon those which are
          definitely Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. Psychology, or that department of experimental science which
          unfolds the laws of action of the human mind under normal conditions,
          as exhibited (a) in the phenomena of individual consciousness and
          action, and (b) in the phenomena of social and political life.
        </p>
        <p>
          8th. Æsthetics, or the science of the laws of the Beautiful in all its
          forms of Music, Rhetoric, Architecture, Painting, etc., and the
          principles and history of every department of art.
        </p>
        <p>
          9th. The Physical Sciences, their methods, general and special; their
          history, genesis, development, and present tendencies; their relation
          to Philosophy, especially to Theism and natural religion, to
          civilization, to the Scriptural records historically and doctrinally.
        </p>
        <p>
          10th. Æstatistics, or that department of investigation which aims to
          present us with a full knowledge of the present state of the human
          family in the world, in respect to every measurable variety of
          condition— as to numbers and state, physical, intellectual, religious,
          social, and political, of civilization, commerce, literature, science,
          art, etc., etc.; from which elements the immature forms of social
          science and political economy are being gradually developed.
        </p>
        <p>8. What particulars are included under the head of Apologetics?</p>
        <p>
          This department falls under two heads: 1. Is there a God. 2. Has He
          spoken; and includes—
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The proof of the being of God, that is of an extra mundane person
          transcendent yet immanent, creating, preserving and governing all
          things according to his eternal plan. This will involve the discussion
          and refutation of all Antitheistic systems, as Atheism, Pantheism,
          Naturalistic Deism, Materialism, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The Development of Natural theology, embracing the relation of
          God to intelligent and responsible agents as Moral Governor, and the
          indications of his will and purpose, and consequently of the duties
          and destinies of mankind, as far as these can be traced by the light
          of Nature—
        </p>
        <p>3rd. The evidences of Christianity, including—</p>
        <p>
          1. The discussion of the proper use of reason in religious questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The demonstration of the a priori possibility of a supernatural
          revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The necessity for and the probability of such a revelation, the
          character of God and the condition of man as revealed by the light of
          nature, being considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The positive proof of the actual fact that such a revelation has
          been given (a) through the Old Testament prophets, (b) through the New
          Testament prophets, and (c) above all in the person and work of
          Christ. This will involve, of course, a critical discussion of all the
          evidence bearing on this subject, external and internal, historical,
          rational, moral, and spiritual, natural and supernatural, theoretical
          and practical, and a refutation of all the criticism, historical and
          rational, which has been brought to bear against the fact of
          revelation or the integrity of the record. Much that is here adduced
          will of course necessarily be also comprehended under the heads of
          Systematic and of Exegetical Theology.
        </p>
        <p>9. What is included under Exegetical Theology?</p>
        <p>
          If the facts 1. That there is a God, and 2. that he has spoken, be
          established, it remains to answer the question, &quot;What has God
          said?&quot; Exegetical Theology is the general title of that
          department of theological science which aims at the Interpretation of
          the Scriptures as the word of God, recorded in human language, and
          transmitted to us through human channels; and in order to this,
          Interpretation aims to gather and organize all that knowledge which is
          necessarily introductory thereto. This includes the answer to two main
          questions 1. What books form the canon, and what were the exact words
          of which the original autographs of the writers of these several books
          consisted, and 2. What do those divine words, so ascertained, mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answers to all questions preliminary to actual Interpretation,
          come under the head of Introduction and this is divided 1. into
          General Introduction, presenting all that information, preliminary to
          interpretation, which stands related in common to the Bible as a
          whole, or to each Testament as a whole, and 2. into Special
          Introduction, which includes all necessary preparation for the
          interpretation of each book of the Bible in detail.
        </p>
        <p>A. General INTRODUCTION includes—</p>
        <p>
          1st. The Higher Criticism or the canvass of the still existing
          evidences of all kinds establishing the authenticity and genuineness
          of each book in the sacred canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The Criticism of the Text, which, from a comparison of the best
          ancient manuscripts and versions, from internal evidence, and by means
          of a critical history of the text from its first appearance to the
          present, seeks to determine the ipsissima verbs of the original
          autographs of the inspired writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Biblical Philology, which answers the questions: Why were
          different languages used in the record? and why Hebrew and Greek? What
          are the special characteristics of the dialects of those languages
          actually used, and their relation to the families of language to which
          they belong? And what were the special characteristics of dialect,
          style, etc., of the sacred writers individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Biblical Archaeology, including the physical and political
          geography of Bible lands during the course of Bible history. and
          determining the physical, ethnological, social, political, and
          religious conditions of the people among whom the Scriptures
          originated, together with an account of their customs and
          institutions, and of the relation of these to those of their ancestors
          and of their contemporaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Hermeneutics, or the scientific determination of the principles
          and rules of Biblical Interpretation, including 1. the logical and
          grammatical and rhetorical principles determining the interpretation
          of human language in general, 2. the modification of these principles
          appropriate to the interpretation of the specific forms of human
          discourse, e.g., history, poetry, prophecy parable, symbol. etc., and
          3. those further modifications of these principles appropriate to the
          interpretation of writings supernaturally inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. Apologetics having established the fact that the Christian
          Scriptures are the vehicle of a supernatural revelation, we must now
          discuss and determine the nature and extent of Biblical Inspiration as
          far as this is determined by the claims and the phenomena of the
          Scriptures themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. The History of Interpretation, including the history of ancient
          and modern versions and schools of interpretation, illustrated by a
          critical comparison of the most eminent commentaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. SPECIAL INTRODUCTION treats of each book of the Bible by itself,
          and furnishes all that knowledge concerning its dialect, authorship,
          occasion, design, and reception that is necessary for its accurate
          interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. Exegesis proper is the actual application of all the knowledge
          gathered, and of all the rules developed, in the preceding departments
          of Introduction to the Interpretation of the sacred text, as it stands
          in its original connections of Testaments, books, paragraphs, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the laws of grammar, the usus loquendi of words, the analogy
          of Scripture, and the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Exegesis seeks to
          determine the mind of the Spirit as expressed in the inspired
          sentences as they stand in their order.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several special departments classed under the general head
          of Exegetical Theology, which involve in some degree that arrangement
          and combination of Scripture testimonies under topics or subjects,
          which is the distinctive characteristic of Systematic Theology. These
          are—
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Typology, which embraces a scientific determination of the laws
          of biblical symbols and types, and their interpretation, especially
          those of the Mosaic ritual as related to the person and work of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Old Testament Christology, the critical exposition of the
          Messianic idea as it is developed in the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Biblical Theology, traces the gradual evolution of the several
          elements of revealed truth from their first suggestion through every
          successive stage to their fullest manifestation in the sacred text,
          and which exhibits the peculiar forms and connections in which these
          several truths are presented by each inspired writer.

          4th. The Development of the principles of Prophetical Interpretation
          and their application to the construction of an outline of the
          Prophecies of both Testaments.— &quot;Notes on New Testament
          Literature,&quot; by Dr. J. A. Alexander.
        </p>
        <p>10. What is included under the head of Systematic Theology?</p>
        <p>
          As the name imports, Systematic Theology has for its object the
          gathering all that the Scriptures teach as to what we are to believe
          and to do, and the presenting all the elements of this teaching in a
          symmetrical system. The human mind must seek unity in all its
          knowledge. God’s truth is one, and all the contents of all revelations
          natural and supernatural must constitute one self–contained system,
          each part organically related to every other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method of construction is inductive. It rests upon the results of
          Exegesis for its foundation. Passages of Scripture ascertained and
          interpreted are its data. These when rightly interpreted reveal their
          own relations and place in the system of which the Person and work of
          Christ is the center. And as the contents of revelation stand
          intimately related to all the other departments of human knowledge,
          the work of Systematic Theology necessarily involves the demonstration
          and illustration of the harmony of all revealed truth with all valid
          science, material and psychological, with all true speculative
          philosophy, and with all true moral philosophy and practical
          philanthropy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It includes— 1. The construction of all the contents of revelation
          into a complete system of faith and duties. 2. The history of this
          process as it has prevailed in the Church during the past. 3.
          Polemics.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The construction of all the contents of revelation into a complete
          system. This includes the scientific treatment (a) of all the matters
          of faith revealed, and (b) of all the duties enjoined.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the arrangement of topics the great majority of theologians have
          followed what Dr. Chalmers calls the synthetical method. Starting with
          the idea and nature of God revealed in the Scriptures, they trace his
          eternal purposes and temporal acts in creation, providence, and
          redemption to the final consummation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctor himself prefers what he calls the analytic method, and
          starts with the facts of experience and the light of nature, and man’s
          present morally diseased condition, leads upward to redemption and to
          the character of God as revealed therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the former of these methods all the elements of the system
          are usually grouped under the following heads:
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Theology proper: including the existence, attributes, triune
          personality of God, together with his eternal purposes, and temporal
          acts of creation and providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Anthropology: (doctrine of man) including the creation and nature
          of man, his original state, fall, and consequent moral ruin. This
          embraces the Biblical Psychology, and the Scriptural doctrine of sin,
          its nature, origin, and mode of propagation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. Soteriology:(doctrine of salvation) which includes the plan,
          execution, and application and glorious effects of human salvation.
          This embraces Christology (the doctrine of Christ), the incarnation,
          the constitution of Christ’s person, his life, death, and
          resurrection, together with the office–work of the Holy Ghost, and the
          means of grace, the word and sacraments.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Christian Ethics: embracing the principles, rules motives, and
          aids of human duty revealed in the Bible as determined (a) by his
          natural relations as a man with his fellows, and (b) his supernatural
          relations as a redeemed man.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Eschatology (science of last things) comprehending death, the
          intermediate state of the soul, the second advent, the resurrection of
          the dead, the general judgment, heaven and hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. Ecclesiology (science of the Church), including the scientific
          determination of all that the Scriptures teach as to the Church
          visible and invisible, in its temporal and in its eternal state;
          including the Idea of the Church—its true definition, constitution and
          organization, its officers and their functions. A comparison and
          criticism of all the modifications of ecclesiastical organization that
          have ever existed, together with their genesis, history, and practical
          effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Doctrine–History, which embraces the history of each of these great
          doctrines traced in its first appearance and subsequent development,
          though the controversies it excited and the Confessions in which it is
          defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Polemics, or Controversial Theology, including the defense of the
          true system of doctrine as a whole and of each constituent element of
          it in detail against the perversions of heretical parties within the
          pale of the general Church. This embraces—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The general principles and true method of religious controversies.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The definition of the true Status Quaestiones in each controversy,
          and an exposition of the sources of evidence and of the methods,
          defensive and offensive, by which the truth is to be vindicated.
        </p>
        <p>3. The history of controversies.</p>
        <p>
          11. What is included under the head of Practical Theology? Practical
          Theology is both a science and an art. As an art it has for its
          purpose the effective publication of the contents of revelation among
          all men, and the perpetuation, extension, and edification of the
          earthly kingdom of God. As a science it has for its province the
          revealed principles and laws of the art above defined. Hence as
          Systematic Theology roots itself in a thorough Exegesis at once
          scientific and spiritual, so does Practical Theology root itself in
          the great principles developed by Systematic Theology, the department
          of Ecclesiology being common ground to both departments: the product
          of the one, and the foundation of the other.
        </p>
        <p>It includes the following main divisions—</p>
        <p>
          1st. The discussion of the Idea and Design of the Church, and of its
          divinely revealed attributes.

          2nd. The determination of the divinely appointed constitution of the
          Church, and methods of administration, with the discussion and
          refutation of all the rival forms of church organization that have
          prevailed, their history, and the controversies which they have
          encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The discussion of the nature and extent of the discretion Christ
          has allowed his followers in adjusting the methods of ecclesiastical
          organization and administration to changing social and historical

          See &quot;Lectures on Theological Encyclopædia and Methodology, &quot;
          by Rev. John M&#x27;Clintock, D.D., LL.D., edited by J. T. Short, B.
          D.; and &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra,&quot; Vol. 1, 1844; &quot;Theological
          Encyclopædia and Methodology, &quot; from unpublished lecture of Prof.
          Tholuck, by Prof. E. A. Park.
        </p>
        <p>12. What is included under the bead of HISTORICAL THEOLOGY?</p>
        <p>
          According to the logical evolution of the whole contents of the
          theological sciences, the interpretation of the letter of Scripture,
          and the construction of the entire system of related truths and duties
          revealed therein, must precede the History of the actual development
          of that revelation in the life and faith of the Church, just as the
          fountain must precede the stream which flows from it. Yet, as a matter
          of fact, in the actual study of the family of theological sciences,
          History must precede and lay the foundation for all the rest. History
          alone gives us the Scriptures in which our revelation is recorded and
          the means whereby the several books and theit ipsissima verba are
          critically ascertained. We are indebted to the same source for our
          methods of interpretation, and for their results as illustrated in the
          body of theological literature accumulated in the past; also for our
          creeds and confessions and records of controversies, and hence for the
          records preserving the gradual evolution of our system of doctrine. In
          the order of production and of acquisition History comes first, while
          in the order of a logical exposition, of the constituent theological
          sciences in their relations within the system, History has the honor
          of crowning the whole series.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historical Theology is divided into Biblical and Ecclesiastical. The
          first derived chiefly from inspired sources, and continuing down to
          the close of the New Testament canon. The latter beginning where the
          former ends, and continuing to the present time.
        </p>
        <p>Biblical History is subdivided into—</p>
        <p>
          1st. Old Testament History including 1. the Patriarchal, 2. Mosaic,
          and 3. Prophetical eras, together with 4. the history of the chosen
          people during the interval between the close of the Old and the
          opening of the New Testament. 2nd. New Testament History, including l.
          the life of Christ, 2. The founding of the Christian Church by the
          Apostles down to the end of the first century.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Ecclesiastical History several preliminary departments
          of study are essential to its prosecution as a science.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Several of the auxiliary sciences already enumerated must be
          cited as specifically demanded in this connection. These are— l.
          Ancient, Mediæval, and Modern Geography. 2. Chronology. 3. The
          Antiquities of all the peoples embraced in the area through which the
          Church has at any period extended. 4. Statistics, exhibiting the
          actual condition of the world at any particular period. 5. The entire
          course of General History.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The Sources from which Ecclesiastical History is derived should
          be critically investigated. 1. Monumental sources, such as (a)
          buildings, (b) inscriptions, (c) coins, etc. 2. Documental, which are—
          (a) Public, such as the Acts of Councils, the briefs, decretals, and
          bulls of Popes; the archives of governments, and the creeds,
          confessions, catechisms, and liturgies of the Churches, etc., etc. (b)
          Private documents, such as contemporary literature of all kinds,
          pamphlets, biographies, annals, and later reports and compilations.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The History of the literature of ecclesiastical history from
          Eusebius to Neander, Kurtz, and Schaff . . The methods which have been
          and which should be followed in the arrangement of the material of
          Church History. The actual Method always has been and probably always
          will be a combination of the two natural methods—(a) chronological,
          and (b) topical.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fundamental principle upon which, according to Dr. M’Clintock, the
          materials of Church History should be arranged, is the distinction
          between the life and the faith of the Church. The two divisions
          therefore, are 1. History of the life of the Church, or Church History
          proper, and 2. History of the thought of the Church, or
          Doctrine–History.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The History of the Life of the Church deals with persons,
          communities, and events, and should be treated according to the
          ordinary methods of historical composition.
        </p>
        <p>2. The History of the Thought of the Church comprise—</p>
        <p>
          1. Patristics, or the literature of the early Christian Fathers; and
          Petrology, or a scientific exhibition of their doctrine. These fathers
          are grouped under three heads—(a) Apostolic, (b) Ante–Nicene, and (c)
          Post–Nicene, terminating with Gregory the Great among the
          Latin&#x27;s, AD. 604, and with John of Damascus among the Greeks, AD.
          754. This study involves the discussion of (a) the proper use of these
          Fathers, and their legitimate authority in modern controversies; (b) a
          full history of their literature, and of the principal editions of
          their works; and (c) the meaning, value, and doctrine of each
          individual Father separately—
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christian Archæology, which treats of the usage, worship and
          discipline of the early Church, and the history of Christian worship,
          art, architecture, poetry, painting, music, etc., etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Doctrine–History, or the critical history of the genesis and
          development of each element of the doctrinal system of the Church, or
          of any of its historical branches, with an account of all the
          heretical forms of doctrine from which the truth has been separated,
          and the history of all the controversies by of which the elimination
          has been effected. This will, of course, be accompanied with a
          critical history of the entire Literature of Doctrine – History, of
          the principles recognized the methods pursued, and the works produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Symbolics, which involves—(a) The scientific determination of the
          necessity for and uses of public Creeds and Confessions. (b) The
          history of the occasions, of the actual genesis, and subsequent
          reception, authority, and influence of each one of the Creeds and
          Confessions of Christendom. (c) The study of the doctrinal contents of
          each Creed, and of each group of Creeds separately, and (d)
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparative Symbolics, or the comparative study of all the Confessions
          of the Church, and thence a systematic exhibition of all their
          respective points of agreement and of contrast. M’Clintock’s
          &quot;Theological Encyclopædia&quot;; &quot;Notes on Ecclesiastical
          History,&quot; by Dr. J. A. Alexander, edited by Dr. S. D. Alexander.
