        <h2>DISCOURSE XI.</h2>
        <p>ON THE HOLINESS OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Exodus xv. 11.—Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is
          like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
        </p>
        <p>
          This verse is one of the loftiest descriptions of the majesty and
          excellency of God in the whole Scripture.887 It is a part of Moses’
          Ἐπινίκιον, or “triumphant song,” after a great and real, and a typical
          victory; in the womb of which all the deliverances of the church were
          couched. It is the first song upon holy record, and it consists of
          gratulatory and prophetic matter; it casts a look backward to what God
          did for them in their deliverance from Egypt; and a look forward to
          what God shall do for the church in future ages. That deliverance was
          but a rough draught of something more excellent to be wrought towards
          the closing up of the world; when his plagues shall be poured out upon
          the anti‑christian powers, which should revive the same song of Moses
          in the church, as fitted so many ages before for such a scene of
          affairs (Rev. xv. 2, 3). It is observed, therefore, that many words in
          this song are put in the future tense, noting a time to come; and the
          very first word, ver. 1, “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel
          this song;” ישיר, shall sing; implying, that it was composed and
          calculated for the celebrating some greater action of God’s, which was
          to be wrought in the world.888 Upon this account, some of the Jewish
          rabbins, from the consideration of this remark, asserted the doctrine
          of the resurrection to be meant in this place; that Moses and those
          Israelites should rise again to sing the same song, for some greater
          miracles God should work, and greater triumphs he should bring forth,
          exceeding those wonders at their deliverance from Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          It consists of, 1. A preface (ver. 1); “I will sing unto the Lord.”889
          2. An historical narration of matter of fact (ver. 3, 4), “Pharaoh’s
          chariots and his host hath he cast into the Red Sea;” which he solely
          ascribes to God (ver. 6), “Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious
          in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy;”
          which he doth prophetically, as respecting something to be done in
          after‑times; or further for the completing of that deliverance; or, as
          others think, respecting their entering into Canaan; for the words, in
          these two verses, are put in the future tense. The manner of the
          deliverance is described (ver. 8); “The floods stood upright as an
          heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.” In the
          9th verse, he magnifies the victory from the vain glory and security
          of the enemy; “The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will
          divide the spoil,” &amp;c. And ver. 16, 17, He prophetically describes
          the fruit of this victory, in the influence it shall have upon those
          nations, by whose confines they were to travel to the promised land;
          “Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they
          shall be as still as a stone, till thy people pass over which thou
          hast purchased.” The phrase of this and the 17th and 18th verses,
          seems to be more magnificent than to design only the bringing the
          Israelites to the earthly Canaan; but seems to respect the gathering
          his redeemed ones together, to place them in the spiritual sanctuary
          which he had established, wherein the Lord should reign forever and
          ever, without any enemies to disturb his royalty; “The Lord shall
          reign forever and ever” (ver. 18). The prophet, in the midst of his
          historical narrative, seems to be in an ecstasy, and breaks out in a
          stately exaltation of God in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? &amp;c. Interrogations
          are, in Scripture, the strongest affirmations or negations; it is here
          a strong affirmation of the incomparableness of God, and a strong
          denial of the worthiness of all creatures to be partners with him in
          the degrees of his excellency; it is a preference of God before all
          creatures in holiness, to which the purity of creatures is but a
          shadow in desert of reverence and veneration, he being “fearful in
          praises.” The angels cover their faces when they adore him in his
          particular perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amongst the gods. Among the idols of the nations, say some; others
          say,890 it is not to be found that the Heathen idols are ever
          dignified with the title of “strong or mighty,” as the word translated
          gods, doth import; and therefore understand it of the angels, or other
          potentates of the world; or rather inclusively, of all that are noted
          for, or can lay claim to, the title of strength and might upon the
          earth or in heaven. God is so great and majestic, that no creature can
          share with him in his praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fearful in praises. Various are the interpretations of this passage:
          to be “reverenced in praises;” his praise ought to be celebrated with
          a religious fear. Fear is the product of his mercy as well as his
          justice; “He hath forgiveness that he may be feared” (Ps. cxxx. 4).
          Or, “fearful in praises;” whom none can praise without amazement at
          the considerations of his works. None can truly praise him without
          being affected with astonishment at his greatness.891 Or, “fearful in
          praises;” whom no mortal can sufficiently praise, since he is above
          all praise.892 Whatsoever a human tongue can speak, or an angelical
          understanding think of the excellency of his nature and the greatness
          of his works, falls short of the vastness of the Divine perfection. A
          creature’s praises of God are as much below the transcendent eminency
          of God, as the meanness of a creature’s being is below the eternal
          fulness of the Creator. Or, rather, “fearful,” or terrible, “in
          praises;” that is, in the matter of thy praise: and the learned Rivet
          concurs with me in this sense. The works of God, celebrated in this
          song, were terrible; it was the miraculous overthrow of the strength
          and flower of a mighty nation; his judgments were severe, as well as
          his mercy was seasonable. The word נורא signifies glorious and
          illustrious, as well as terrible and fearful. No man can hear the
          praise of thy name, for those great judicial acts, without some
          astonishment at thy justice, the stream, and thy holiness, the spring
          of those mighty works. This seems to be the sense of the following
          words, “doing wonders:” fearful in the matter of thy praise; they
          being wonders which thou hast done among us and for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing wonders. Congealing the waters by a wind, to make them stand
          like walls for the rescue of the Israelites; and melting them by a
          wind, for the overthrow of the Egyptians, are prodigies that challenge
          the greatest adorations of that mercy which delivered the one, and
          that justice which punished the other; and of the arm of that power
          whereby he effected both his gracious and righteous purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence observe, that the judgments of God upon his enemies, as well as
          his mercies to his people, are matters of praise. The perfections of
          God appear in both. Justice and mercy are so linked together in his
          acts of providence, that the one cannot be forgotten whilst the other
          is acknowledged. He is never so terrible as in the assemblies of his
          saints, and the deliverance of them (Ps. lxxxix. 7). As the creation
          was erected by him for his glory; so all the acts of his government
          are designed for the same end: and his creatures deny him his due, if
          they acknowledge not his excellency in whatsoever dreadful, as well as
          pleasing garbs, it appears in the world. His terror as well as his
          righteousness appears, when he is a God of salvation (Ps. lxv. 5). “By
          terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our
          salvation.” But the expression I pitch upon in the text to handle, is
          glorious in holiness. He is magnified or honorable in holiness; so the
          word נאדר is translated (Isa. xlii. 21). “He will magnify the law, and
          make it honorable.” Thy holiness hath shone forth admirably in this
          last exploit, against the enemies and oppressors of thy people. The
          holiness of God is his glory, as his grace is his riches: holiness is
          his crown, and his mercy is his treasure. This is the blessedness and
          nobleness of his nature; it renders him glorious in himself, and
          glorious to his creatures, that understand any thing of this lovely
          perfection. Holiness is a glorious perfection belonging to the nature
          of God. Hence he is in Scripture styled often the Holy One, the Holy
          One of Jacob, the Holy One of Israel; and oftener entitled Holy, than
          Almighty, and set forth by this part of his dignity more than by any
          other. This is more affixed as an epithet to his name than any other:
          you never find it expressed, His mighty name, or His wise name; but
          His great name, and most of all, His holy name. This is his greatest
          title of honor; in this doth the majesty and venerableness of his name
          appear. When the sinfulness of Sennacherib is aggravated, the Holy
          Ghost takes the rise from this attribute (2 Kings xix. 22). “Thou hast
          lift up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel;” not
          against the wise, mighty, &amp;c., but against the Holy One of Israel,
          as that wherein the majesty of God was most illustrious. It is upon
          this account he is called light, as impurity is called darkness; both
          in this sense are opposed to one another: he is a pure and unmixed
          light, free from all blemish in his essence, nature, and operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Heathens have owned it. Proclus calls him, the undefiled Governor
          of the world.893 The poetical transformations of their false gods, and
          the extravagancies committed by them, was—in the account of the wisest
          of them—an unholy thing to report and hear.894 And some vindicate
          Epicurus from the atheism wherewith he was commonly charged; that he
          did not deny the being of God, but those adulterous and contentious
          deities the people worshipped, which were practices unworthy and
          unbecoming the nature of God.895 Hence they asserted, that virtue was
          an imitation of God, and a virtuous man bore a resemblance to God: if
          virtue were a copy from God, a greater holiness must be owned in the
          original. And when some of them were at a loss how to free God from
          being the author of sin in the world, they ascribe the birth of sin to
          matter, and run into an absurd opinion, fancying it to be uncreated,
          that thereby they might exempt God from all mixture of evil; so sacred
          with them was the conception of God, as a Holy God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The absurdest heretics have owned it. The Maniches and
          Marchionites, that thought evil came by necessity, yet would salve
          God’s being the author of it, by asserting two distinct eternal
          principles, one the original of evil, as God was the fountain of good:
          so rooted was the notion of this Divine purity, that none would ever
          slander goodness itself with that which was so disparaging to it.896
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The nature of God cannot rationally be conceived without it. Though
          the power of God be the first rational conclusion, drawn from the
          sight of his works, wisdom the next, from the order and connexion of
          his works, purity must result from the beauty of his works: that God
          cannot be deformed by evil, who hath made every thing so beautiful in
          its time. The notion of a God cannot be entertained without separating
          from him whatsoever is impure and bespotting both in his essence and
          actions. Though we conceive him infinite in Majesty, infinite in
          essence, eternal in duration, mighty in power, and wise and immutable
          in his counsels; merciful in his proceedings with men, and whatsoever
          other perfections may dignify so sovereign a Being, yet if we conceive
          him destitute of this excellent perfection, and imagine him possessed
          with the least contagion of evil, we make him but an infinite monster,
          and sully all those perfections we ascribed to him before; we rather
          own him a devil than a God. It is a contradiction to be God and to be
          darkness, or to have one mote of darkness mixed with his light. It is
          a less injury to him to deny his being, than to deny the purity of it;
          the one makes him no god, the other a deformed, unlovely, and a
          detestable god. Plutarch said not amiss, That he should count himself
          less injured by that man, that should deny that there was such a man
          as Plutarch, than by him that should affirm that there was such a one
          indeed, but he was a debauched fellow, a loose and vicious person. It
          is a less wrong to God to discard any acknowledgments of his being,
          and to count him nothing, than to believe him to exist, but imagine a
          base and unholy Deity: he that saith, God is not holy, speaks much
          worse than he that saith, There is no God at all. Let these two things
          be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. If any, this attribute hath an excellency above his other
          perfections. There are some attributes of God we prefer, because of
          our interest in them, and the relation they bear to us: as we esteem
          his goodness before his power, and his mercy whereby he relieves us,
          before his justice whereby he punisheth us; as there are some we more
          delight in, because of the goodness we receive by them; so there are
          some that God delights to honor, because of their excellency.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. None is sounded out so loftily, with such solemnity, and so
          frequently by angels that stand before his throne, as this. Where do
          you find any other attribute trebled in the praises of it, as this
          (Isa. vi. 3)? “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth
          is full of his glory;” and (Rev. iv. 8), “The four beasts rest not day
          and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,” &amp;c. His
          power or sovereignty, as Lord of hosts, is but once mentioned, but
          with a ternal repetition of his holiness. Do you hear, in any
          angelical song, any other perfection of the Divine Nature thrice
          repeated? Where do we read of the crying out Eternal, eternal,
          eternal; or, Faithful, faithful, faithful, Lord God of Hosts?
          Whatsoever other attribute is left out, this God would have to fill
          the mouths of angels and blessed spirits for ever in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He singles it out to swear by (Ps. lxxxix. 35): “Once have I sworn
          by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David:” and (Amos iv. 2),
          “The Lord will swear by his holiness:” he twice swears by his
          holiness; once by his power (Isa. lxii. 8); once by all, when he
          swears by his name (Jer. xliv. 26). He lays here his holiness to
          pledge for the assurance of his promise, as the attribute most dear to
          him, most valued by him, as though no other could give an assurance
          parallel to it in this concern of an everlasting redemption which is
          there spoken of: he that swears, swears by a greater than himself; God
          having no greater than himself, swears by himself: and swearing here
          by his holiness, seems to equal that single one to all his other
          attributes, as if he were more concerned in the honor of it, than of
          all the rest. It is as if he should have said, Since I have not a more
          excellent perfection to swear by, than that of my holiness, I lay this
          to pawn for your security, and bind myself by that which I will never
          part with, were it possible for me to be stripped of all the rest. It
          is a tacit imprecation of himself, If I lie unto David, let me never
          be counted holy, or thought righteous enough to be trusted by angels
          or men. This attribute he makes most of.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is his glory and beauty. Holiness is the honor of the creature;
          sanctification and honor are linked together (1 Thess. iv. 4); much
          more is it the honor of God; it is the image of God in the creature
          (Eph. iv. 24). When we take the picture of a man, we draw the most
          beautiful part, the face, which is a member of the greatest
          excellency. When God would be drawn to the life, as much as can be, in
          the spirit of his creatures, he is drawn in this attribute, as being
          the most beautiful perfection of God, and most valuable with him.
          Power is his hand and arm; omniscience, his eye; mercy, his bowels;
          eternity, his duration; his holiness is his beauty (2 Chron. xx.
          21);—“should praise the beauty of holiness.” In Ps. xxvii. 4, David
          desires “to behold the beauty of the Lord, and inquire in his holy
          temple;” that is, the holiness of God manifested in his hatred of sin
          in the daily sacrifices. Holiness was the beauty of the temple (Isa.
          xlvi. 11); holy and beautiful house are joined together; much more the
          beauty of God that dwelt in the sanctuary. This renders him lovely to
          all his innocent creatures, though formidable to the guilty ones. A
          heathen philosopher could call it the beauty of the Divine essence,
          and say, that God was not so happy by an eternity of life, as by an
          excellency of virtue.897 And the angels’ song intimate it to be his
          glory (Isa. vi. 3); “The whole earth is full of thy glory;” that is,
          of his holiness in his laws, and in his judgments against sin, that
          being the attribute applauded by them before.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is his very life. So it is called (Eph. iv. 18), “Alienated from
          the life of God,” that is, from the holiness of God: speaking of the
          opposite to it, the uncleanness and profaneness of the Gentiles. We
          are only alienated from that which we are bound to imitate; but this
          is the perfection alway set out as the pattern of our actions, “Be ye
          holy, as I am holy;” no other is proposed as our copy; alienated from
          that purity of God, which is as much as his life, without which he
          could not live. If he were stripped of this, he would be a dead God,
          more than by the want of any other perfection. His swearing by it
          intimates as much; he swears often by his own life; “As I live, saith
          the Lord:” so he swears by his holiness, as if it were his life, and
          more his life than any other. Let me not live, or let me not be holy,
          are all one in his oath. His Deity could not outlive the life of his
          purity.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. As it seems to challenge an excellency above all his other
          perfections, so it is the glory of all the rest. As it is the glory of
          the Godhead, so it is the glory of every perfection in the Godhead. As
          his power is the strength of them, so his holiness is the beauty of
          them. As all would be weak, without almightiness to back them, so all
          would be uncomely without holiness to adorn them. Should this be
          sullied, all the rest would lose their honor and their comfortable
          efficacy: as, at the same instant that the sun should lose its light,
          it would lose its heat, its strength, its generative and quickening
          virtue. As sincerity is the lustre of every grace in a Christian, so
          is purity the splendor of every attribute in the Godhead. His justice
          is a holy justice; his wisdom a holy wisdom; his arm of power a holy
          arm (Ps. xcviii. 1); his truth or promise a holy promise (Ps. cv. 42).
          Holy and true go hand in hand (Rev. vi. 10). His name, which signifies
          all his attributes in conjunction, is holy (Ps. ciii. 1); yea, he is
          “righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works” (Ps. cxlv. 17):
          it is the rule of all his acts, the source of all his punishments. If
          every attribute of the Deity were a distinct member, purity would be
          the form, the soul, the spirit to animate them. Without it, his
          patience would be an indulgence to sin, his mercy a fondness, his
          wrath a madness, his power a tyranny, his wisdom an unworthy subtilty.
          It is this gives a decorum to all. His mercy is not exercised without
          it, since he pardons none but those that have an interest, by union,
          in the obedience of a Mediator, which was so delightful to his
          infinite purity. His justice, which guilty man is apt to tax with
          cruelty and violence in the exercise of it, is not acted out of the
          compass of this rule. In acts of man’s vindictive justice there is
          something of impurity, perturbation, passion, some mixture of cruelty;
          but none of these fall upon God in the severest acts of wrath. When
          God appears to Ezekiel, in the resemblance of fire, to signify his
          anger against the house of Judah for their idolatry, “from his loins
          downward” there was “the appearance of fire;” but, from the loins
          upward, “the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber” (Ezek.
          viii. 2). His heart is clear in his most terrible acts of vengeance;
          it is a pure flame, wherewith he scorcheth and burns his enemies: he
          is holy in the most fiery appearance. This attribute, therefore, is
          never so much applauded, as when his sword hath been drawn, and he
          hath manifested the greatest fierceness against his enemies. The
          magnificent and triumphant expression of it in the text, follows just
          upon God’s miraculous defeat and ruin of the Egyptian army: “The sea
          covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters:” then it
          follows, “Who is like unto thee, O Lord, glorious in holiness?” And
          when it was so celebrated by the seraphims (Isa. vi. 3), it was when
          the “posts moved, and the house was filled with smoke” (ver. 4), which
          are signs of anger (Ps. xviii. 7, 8). And when he was about to send
          Isaiah upon a message of spiritual and temporal judgments, that he
          would make the “heart of that people fat, and their ears heavy, and
          their eyes shut; waste their cities without inhabitant, and their
          houses without man, and make the land desolate” (ver. 9‒12): and the
          angels which here applaud him for his holiness, are the executioners
          of his justice, and here called seraphims, from burning or fiery
          spirits, as being the ministers of his wrath. His justice is part of
          his holiness, whereby he doth reduce into order those things that are
          out of order. When he is consuming men by his fury, he doth not
          diminish, but manifest purity (Zeph. iii. 5); “The just Lord is in the
          midst of her; he will do no iniquity.” Every action of his is free
          from all tincture of evil. It is also celebrated with praise, by the
          four beasts about his throne, when he appears in a covenant garb with
          a rainbow about his throne, and yet with thunderings and lightnings
          shot against his enemies (Rev. iv. 8, compared with ver. 3, 5), to
          show that all his acts of mercy, as well as justice, are clear from
          any stain. This is the crown of all his attributes, the life of all
          his decrees, the brightness of all his actions: nothing is decreed by
          him, nothing is acted by him, but what is worthy of the dignity, and
          becoming the honor, of this attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the better understanding this attribute, observe, I. The nature of
          this holiness. II. The demonstration of it. III. The purity of his
          nature in all his acts about sin. IV. The use of all to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The nature of Divine holiness in general. The holiness of God
          negatively, is a perfect and unpolluted freedom from all evil. As we
          call gold pure that is not embased by any dross, and that garment
          clean that is free from any spot, so the nature of God is estranged
          from all shadow of evil, all imaginable contagion. Positively, It is
          the rectitude or integrity of the Divine nature, or that conformity of
          it, in affection and action, to the Divine will, as to his eternal
          law, whereby he works with a becomingness to his own excellency, and
          whereby he hath a delight and complacency in everything agreeable to
          his will, and an abhorrency of everything contrary thereunto. As there
          is no darkness in his understanding, so there is no spot in his will:
          as his mind is possessed with all truth, so there is no deviation in
          his will from it. He loves all truth and goodness; he hates all
          falsity and evil. In regard of his righteousness, he loves
          righteousness (Ps. xi. 7); “The righteous Lord loveth righteousness,”
          and “hath no pleasure in wickedness” (Ps. v. 4). He values purity in
          his creatures, and detests all impurity, whether inward or outward. We
          may, indeed, distinguish the holiness of God from his righteousness in
          our conceptions: holiness is a perfection absolutely considered in the
          nature of God; righteousness, a perfection, as referred to others, in
          his actions towards them and upon them.898
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, this property of the Divine nature is, 1. An essential
          and necessary perfection: he is essentially and necessarily holy. It
          is the essential glory of his nature: his holiness is as necessary as
          his being; as necessary as his omniscience: as he cannot but know what
          is right, so he cannot but do what is just. His understanding is not
          as created understanding, capable of ignorance as well as knowledge;
          so his will is not as created wills, capable of unrighteousness, as
          well as righteousness. There can be no contradiction or contrariety in
          the Divine nature, to know what is right, and to do what is wrong; if
          so, there would be a diminution of his blessedness, he would not be a
          God alway blessed, “blessed forever,” as he is (Rom. ix. 5). He is as
          necessarily holy, as he is necessarily God; as necessarily without
          sin, as without change. As he was God from eternity, so he was holy
          from eternity. He was gracious, merciful, just in his own nature, and
          also holy; though no creature had been framed by him to exercise his
          grace, mercy, justice, or holiness upon.899 If God had not created a
          world, he had, in his own nature, been Almighty, and able to create a
          world. If there never had been anything but himself, yet he had been
          omniscient, knowing everything that was within the verge and compass
          of his infinite power; so he was pure in his own nature, though he
          never had brought forth any rational creature whereby to manifest this
          purity. These perfections are so necessary, that the nature of God
          could not subsist without them. And the acts of those, ad intra, or
          within himself, are necessary; for being omniscient in nature, there
          must be an act of knowledge of himself and his own nature. Being
          infinitely holy, an act of holiness in infinitely loving himself, must
          necessarily flow from this perfection.900 As the Divine will cannot
          but be perfect, so it cannot be wanting to render the highest love to
          itself, to its goodness, to the Divine nature, which is due to him.
          Indeed, the acts of those, ad extra, are not necessary, but upon a
          condition. To love righteousness, without himself, or to detect sin,
          or inflict punishment for the committing of it, could not have been,
          had there been no righteous creature for him to love, no sinning
          creature for him to loathe, and to exercise his justice upon, as the
          object of punishment. Some attributes require a condition to make the
          acts of them necessary; as it is at God’s liberty, whether he will
          create a rational creature, or no; but when he decrees to make either
          angel or man, it is necessary, from the perfection of his nature, to
          make them righteous. It is at God’s liberty whether he will speak to
          man, or no; but if he doth, it is impossible for him to speak that
          which is false, because of his infinite perfection of veracity. It is
          at his liberty whether he will permit a creature to sin; but if he
          sees good to suffer it, it is impossible but that he should detest
          that creature that goes cross to his righteous nature. His holiness is
          not solely an act of his will, for then he might be unholy as well as
          holy; he might love iniquity and hate righteousness; he might then
          command that which is good, and afterwards command that which is bad
          and unworthy; for what is only an act of his will, and not belonging
          to his nature, is indifferent to him. As the positive law he gave to
          Adam, of not eating the forbidden fruit, was a pure act of his will,
          he might have given him liberty to eat of it, if he had pleased, as
          well as prohibited him. But what is moral and good in its own nature,
          is necessarily willed by God, and cannot be changed by him, because of
          the transcendent eminency of his nature, and righteousness of his
          will. As it is impossible for God to command his creature to hate him,
          or to dispense with a creature for not loving him,—for this would be
          to command a thing intrinsically evil, the highest ingratitude, the
          very spirit of all wickedness, which consists in the hating God,—yet,
          though God be thus necessarily holy, he is not so by a bare and simple
          necessity, as the sun shines, or the fire burns; but by a free
          necessity, not compelled thereunto, but inclined from the fulness of
          the perfection of his own nature and will; so as by no means he can be
          unholy, because he will not be unholy; it is against his nature to be
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God is only absolutely holy; “There is none holy as the Lord” (1
          Sam. ii. 2); it is the peculiar glory of his nature; as there is none
          good but God, so none holy but God. No creature can be essentially
          holy, because mutable; holiness is the substance of God, but a quality
          and accident in a creature. God is infinitely holy, creatures finitely
          holy. He is holy from himself, creatures are holy by derivation from
          him. He is not only holy, but holiness; holiness in the highest
          degree, is his sole prerogative. As the highest heaven is called the
          heaven of heavens, because it embraceth in its circle all the heavens,
          and contains the magnitude of them, and hath a greater vastness above
          all that it encloseth, so is God the Holy of holies; he contains the
          holiness of all creatures put together, and infinitely more. As all
          the wisdom, excellency, and power of the creatures if compared with
          the wisdom, excellency, and power of God, is but folly, vileness, and
          weakness; so the highest created purity, if set in parallel with God,
          is but impurity and uncleanness (Rev. xv. 4): “Thou only art holy.” It
          is like the light of a glow‑worm to that of the sun (Job xiii. 15);
          “The heavens are not pure in his sight, and his angels he charged with
          folly” (Job iv. 18). Though God hath crowned the angels with an
          unspotted sanctity, and placed them in a habitation of glory, yet, as
          illustrious as they are, they have an unworthiness in their own nature
          to appear before the throne of so holy a God; their holiness grows dim
          and pale in his presence. It is but a weak shadow of that Divine
          purity, whose light is so glorious, that it makes them cover their
          faces out of weakness to behold it, and cover their feet out of shame
          in themselves. They are not pure in his sight, because, though they
          love God (which is a principle of holiness) as much as they can, yet,
          not so much as he deserves; they love him with the intensest degree,
          according to their power; but not with the intensest degree, according
          to his own amiableness; for they cannot infinitely love God, unless
          they were as infinite as God, and had an understanding of his
          perfections equal with himself, and as immense as his own knowledge.
          God, having an infinite knowledge of himself, can only have an
          infinite love to himself, and, consequently, an infinite holiness
          without any defect; because he loves himself according to the vastness
          of his own amiableness, which no finite being can. Therefore, though
          the angels be exempt from corruption and soil, they cannot enter into
          comparison with the purity of God, without acknowledgment of a dimness
          in themselves. Besides, he charges them with folly, and puts no trust
          in them; because they have the power of sinning, though not the act of
          sinning; they have a possible folly in their own nature to be charged
          with. Holiness is a quality separable from them, but it is inseparable
          from God. Had they not at first a mutability in their nature, none of
          them could have sinned, there had been no devils; but because some of
          them sinned, the rest might have sinned. And though the standing
          angels shall never be changed, yet they are still changeable in their
          own nature, and their standing is due to grace, not to nature; and
          though they shall be for ever preserved, yet they are not, nor ever
          can be, immutable by nature, for then they should stand upon the same
          bottom with God himself; but they are supported by grace against that
          changeableness of nature which is essential to a creature; the Creator
          only hath immortality, that is, immutability (1 Tim. iii. 16). It is
          as certain a truth, that no creature can be naturally immutable and
          impeccable, as that God cannot create anything actually polluted and
          imperfect. It is as possible that the highest creature may sin, as it
          is possible that it may be annihilated; it may become not holy, as it
          may become not a creature, but nothing. The holiness of a creature may
          be reduced into nothing, as well as his substance; but the holiness of
          the Creator cannot be diminished, dimmed, or overshadowed (James i.
          17): “He is the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness or
          shadow of turning.” It is as impossible his holiness should be
          blotted, as that his Deity should be extinguished: for whatsoever
          creature hath essentially such or such qualities, cannot be stripped
          of them, without being turned out of its essence. As a man is
          essentially rational; and if he ceaseth to be rational, he ceaseth to
          be man. The sun is essentially luminous; if it should become dark in
          its own body, it would cease to be the sun. In regard to this absolute
          and only holiness of God, it is thrice repeated by the seraphims (Isa.
          vi. 3). The three‑fold repetition of a word notes the certainty or
          absoluteness of the thing, or the irreversibleness of the resolve; as
          (Ezek. xxi. 27), “I will overturn, overturn, overturn,” notes the
          certainty of the judgment; also, (Rev. viii. 8), “Woe, woe, woe;”
          three times repeated, signifies the same. The holiness of God is so
          absolutely peculiar to him, that it can no more be expressed in
          creatures, than his omnipotence, whereby they may be able to create a
          world; or his omniscience, whereby they may be capable of knowing all
          things, and knowing God as he knows himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God is so holy, that he cannot possibly approve of any evil done by
          another, but doth perfectly abhor it; it would not else be a glorious
          holiness (Ps. v. 3). “He hath no pleasure in wickedness.” He doth not
          only love that which is just, but abhor, with a perfect hatred, all
          things contrary to the rule of righteousness. Holiness can no more
          approve of sin than it can commit it: to be delighted with the evil in
          another’s act, contracts a guilt, as well as the commission of it; for
          approbation of a thing is a consent to it. Sometimes the approbation
          of an evil in another is a more grievous crime than the act itself, as
          appears in Rom. i. 32, who knowing the judgment of God, “not only do
          the same, but have pleasure in them that do it;” where the “not only”
          manifests it to be a greater guilt to take pleasure in them. Every sin
          is aggravated by the delight in it; to take pleasure in the evil of
          another’s action, shows a more ardent affection and love to sin, than
          the committer himself may have. This, therefore, can as little fall
          upon God, as to do an evil act himself; yet, as a man may be delighted
          with the consequences of another’s sin, as it may occasion some public
          good, or private good to the guilty person, as sometimes it may be an
          occasion of his repentance, when the horridness of a fact stares him
          in the face, and occasions a self‑reflection for that, and other
          crimes, which is attended with an indignation against them, and
          sincere remorse for them; so God is pleased with those good things his
          goodness and wisdom bring forth upon the occasion of sin. But in
          regard of his holiness, he cannot approve of the evil, whence his
          infinite wisdom drew forth his own glory, and his creature’s good. His
          pleasure is not in the sinful act of the creature, but in the act of
          his own goodness and skill, turning it to another end than what the
          creature aimed at.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) He abhors it necessarily. Holiness is the glory of the Deity,
          therefore necessary. The nature of God is so holy, that he cannot but
          hate it (Hab. i. 13): “Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and
          canst not look on iniquity:” he is more opposite to it than light to
          darkness, and, therefore, it can expect no countenance from him. A
          love of holiness cannot be without a hatred of everything that is
          contrary to it. As God necessarily loves himself, so he must
          necessarily hate everything that is against himself: and as he loves
          himself for his own excellency and holiness, he must necessarily
          detest whatsoever is repugnant to his holiness, because of the evil of
          it. Since he is infinitely good, he cannot but love goodness, as it is
          a resemblance to himself, and cannot but abhor unrighteousness, as
          being most distant from him, and contrary to him. If he have any
          esteem for his own perfections, he must needs have an implacable
          aversion to all that is so repugnant to him, that would, if it were
          possible, destroy him, and is a point directed, not only against his
          glory, but against his life. If he did not hate it, he would hate
          himself: for since righteousness is his image, and sin would deface
          his image; if he did not love his image, and loathe what is against
          his image, he would loathe himself, he would be an enemy to his own
          nature. Nay, if it were possible for him to love it, it were possible
          for him not to be holy, it were possible then for him to deny himself,
          and will that he were no God, which is a palpable contradiction.901
          Yet this necessity in God of hating sin, is not a brutish necessity,
          such as is in mere animals, that avoid, by a natural instinct, not of
          choice, what is prejudicial to them; but most free, as well as
          necessary, arising from an infinite knowledge of his own nature, and
          of the evil nature of sin, and the contrariety of it to his own
          excellency, and the order of his works.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Therefore intensely. Nothing do men act for more than their
          glory. As he doth infinitely, and therefore perfectly know himself, so
          he infinitely, and therefore perfectly knows what is contrary to
          himself, and, as according to the manner and measure of his knowledge
          of himself, is his love to himself, as infinite as his knowledge, and
          therefore inexpressible and unconceivable by us: so, from the
          perfection of his knowledge of the evil of sin, which is infinitely
          above what any creature can have, doth arise a displeasure against it
          suitable to that knowledge. In creatures the degrees of affection to,
          or aversion from a thing, are suited to the strength of their
          apprehensions of the good or evil in them. God knows not only the
          workers of wickedness, but the wickedness of their works (Job xi. 11),
          for “he knows vain men, he sees wickedness also.” The vehemency of
          this hatred is expressed variously in Scripture; he loathes it so,
          that he is impatient of beholding it; the very sight of it affects him
          with detestation (Hab. i. 13); he hates the first spark of it in the
          imagination (Zech. viii. 17); with what variety of expressions doth he
          repeat his indignation at their polluted services (Amos v. 21, 22); “I
          hate, I detest, I despise, I will not smell, I will not regard; take
          away from me the noise of thy songs, I will not hear!” So, (Isa. i.
          14), “My soul hates, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear
          them.” It is the abominable thing that he hates (Jer. xliv. 4); he is
          vexed and fretted at it (Isa. lxiii. 10; Ezek. xvi. 33). He abhors it
          so, that his hatred redounds upon the person that commits it. (Ps. v.
          5), “He hates all workers of iniquity.” Sin is the only primary object
          of his displeasure: he is not displeased with the nature of man as
          man, for that was derived from him; but with the nature of man as
          sinful, which is from the sinner himself. When a man hath but one
          object for the exercise of all his anger, it is stronger than when
          diverted to many objects: a mighty torrent, when diverted into many
          streams, is weaker than when it comes in a full body upon one place
          only. The infinite anger and hatred of God, which is as infinite as
          his love and mercy, has no other object, against which he directs the
          mighty force of it, but only unrighteousness. He hates no person for
          all the penal evils upon him, though they were more by ten thousand
          times than Job was struck with, but only for his sin. Again, sin being
          only evil, and an unmixed evil, there is nothing in it that can abate
          the detestation of God, or balance his hatred of it; there is not the
          least grain of goodness in it, to incline him to the least affection
          to any part of it. This hatred cannot but be intense; for as the more
          any creature is sanctified, the more is he advanced in the abhorrence
          of that which is contrary to holiness; therefore, God being the
          highest, most absolute and infinite holiness, doth infinitely, and
          therefore intensely, hate unholiness; being infinitely righteous, doth
          infinitely abhor unrighteousness; being infinitely true, doth
          infinitely abhor falsity, as it is the greatest and most deformed
          evil. As it is from the righteousness of his nature that he hath a
          content and satisfaction in righteousness (Ps. xi. 7), “The righteous
          Lord loveth righteousness;” so it is from the same righteousness of
          his nature, that he detests whatsoever is morally evil: as his nature
          therefore is infinite, so must his abhorrence be.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Therefore universally, because necessarily and intensely. He doth
          not hate it in one, and indulge it in another, but loathes it wherever
          he finds it; not one worker of iniquity is exempt from it (Ps. v. 5):
          “Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.” For it is not sin, as in this
          or that person, or as great or little; but sin, as sin is the object
          of his hatred; and, therefore, let the person be never so great, and
          have particular characters of his image upon him, it secures him not
          from God’s hatred of any evil action he shall commit. He is a jealous
          God, jealous of his glory (Exod. xx. 5); a metaphor, taken from
          jealous husbands, who will not endure the least adultery in their
          wives, nor God the least defection of man from his law. Every act of
          sin is a spiritual adultery, denying God to be the chief good, and
          giving that prerogative by that act to some vile thing. He loves it no
          more in his own people than he doth in his enemies; he frees them not
          from his rod, the testimony of his loathing their crimes: whosoever
          sows iniquity, shall reap affliction. It might be thought that he
          affected their dross, if he did not refine them, and loved their
          filth, if he did not cleanse them; because of his detestation of their
          sin, he will not spare them from the furnace, though because of love
          to their persons in Christ, he will exempt them from Tophet. How did
          the sword ever and anon drop down upon David’s family, after his
          unworthy dealing in Uriah’s case, and cut off ever and anon some of
          the branches of it? He doth sometimes punish it more severely in this
          life in his own people, than in others. Upon Jonah’s disobedience a
          storm pursues him, and a whale devours him, while the profane world
          lived in their lusts without control. Moses, for one act of unbelief,
          is excluded from Canaan, when greater sinners attained that happiness.
          It is not a light punishment, but a vengeance he takes on their
          inventions (Ps. xcix. 8), to manifest that he hates sin as sin, and
          not because the worst persons commit it. Perhaps, had a profane man
          touched the ark, the hand of God had not so suddenly reached him; but
          when Uzzah, a man zealous for him, as may be supposed by his care for
          the support of the tottering ark, would step out of his place, he
          strikes him down for his disobedient action, by the side of the ark,
          which he would indirectly (as not being a Levite) sustain (2 Sam. vi.
          7). Nor did our Saviour so sharply reprove the Pharisees, and turn so
          short from them as he did from Peter, when he gave a carnal advice,
          and contrary to that wherein was to be the greatest manifestation of
          God’s holiness, viz. the death of Christ (Matt. xvi. 23). He calls him
          Satan, a name sharper than the title of the devil’s children wherewith
          he marked the Pharisees, and given (besides him) to none but Judas,
          who made a profession of love to him, and was outwardly ranked in the
          number of his disciples. A gardener hates a weed the more for being in
          the bed with the most precious flowers. God’s hatred is universally
          fixed against sin, and he hates it as much in those whose persons
          shall not fall under his eternal anger, as being secured in the arms
          of a Redeemer, by whom the guilt is wiped off, and the filth shall be
          totally washed away: though he hates their sin, and cannot but hate
          it, yet he loves their persons, as being united as members to the
          Mediator and mystical Head. A man may love a gangrened member, because
          it is a member of his own body, or a member of a dear relation, but he
          loathes the gangrene in it more than in those wherein he is not so
          much concerned. Though God’s hatred of believers’ persons is removed
          by faith in the satisfactory death of Jesus Christ, yet his antipathy
          against sin was not taken away by that blood; nay, it was impossible
          it should. It was never designed, nor had it any capacity to alter the
          unchangeable nature of God, but to manifest the unspottedness of his
          will, and his eternal aversion to anything that was contrary to the
          purity of his Being, and the righteousness of his laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Perpetually: this must necessarily follow upon the others. He can
          no more cease to hate impurity than he can cease to love holiness: if
          he should in the least instant approve of anything that is filthy, in
          that moment he would disapprove of his own nature and being; there
          would be an interruption in his love of himself, which is as eternal
          as it is infinite. How can he love any sin which is contrary to his
          nature, but for one moment, without hating his own nature, which is
          essentially contrary to sin? Two contraries cannot be loved at the
          same time; God must first begin to hate himself before he can approve
          of any evil which is directly opposite to himself. We, indeed, are
          changed with a temptation, sometimes bear an affection to it, and
          sometimes testify an indignation against it; but God is always the
          same without any shadow of change, and “is angry with the wicked every
          day” (Ps. vii. 11), that is, uninterruptedly in the nature of his
          anger, though not in the effects of it. God indeed may be reconciled
          to the sinner, but never to the sin; for then he should renounce
          himself, deny his own essence and his own divinity, if his
          inclinations to the love of goodness, and his aversion from evil,
          could be changed, if he suffered the contempt of the one, and
          encouraged the practice of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God is so holy, that he cannot but love holiness in others. Not
          that he owes anything to his creature, but from the unspeakable
          holiness of his nature, whence affections to all things that bear a
          resemblance of him do flow; as light shoots out from the sun, or any
          glittering body: it is essential to the infinite righteousness of his
          nature to love righteousness wherever he beholds it (Ps. xi. 7): “The
          righteous Lord loveth righteousness.” He cannot, because of his
          nature, but love that which bears some agreement with his nature, that
          which is the curious draught of his own wisdom and purity: he cannot
          but be delighted with a copy of himself: he would not have a holy
          nature, if he did not love holiness in every nature: his own nature
          would be denied by him, if he did not affect everything that had a
          stamp of his own nature upon it. There was indeed nothing without God,
          that could invite him to manifest such goodness to man, as he did in
          creation: but after he had stamped that rational nature with a
          righteousness convenient for it, it was impossible but that he should
          ardently love that impression of himself, because he loves his own
          Deity, and consequently all things which are any sparks and images of
          it: and were the devils capable of an act of righteousness, the
          holiness of his nature would incline him to love it, even in those
          dark and revolted spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. God is so holy, that he cannot positively will or encourage sin in
          any. How can he give any encouragement to that which he cannot in the
          least approve of, or look upon without loathing, not only the crime,
          but the criminal? Light may sooner be the cause of darkness than
          holiness itself be the cause of unholiness, absolutely contrary to it:
          it is a contradiction, that he that is the Fountain of good should be
          the source of evil; as if the same fountain should bubble up both
          sweet and bitter streams, salt and fresh (James iii. 11); since
          whatsoever good is in man acknowledges God for its author, it follows
          that men are evil by their own fault. There is no need for men to be
          incited to that to which the corruption of their own nature doth so
          powerfully bend them. Water hath a forcible principle in its own
          nature to carry it downward; it needs no force to hasten the motion:
          “God tempts no man, but every man is drawn away by his own lust”
          (James i. 13, 14). All the preparations for glory are from God (Rom.
          ix. 23); but men are said to “be fitted to destruction” (ver. 22); but
          God is not said to fit them; they, by their iniquities, fit themselves
          for ruin, and he, by his long‑suffering, keeps the destruction from
          them for awhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God cannot command any unrighteousness. As all virtue is summed
          up in a love to God, so all iniquity is summed up in an enmity to God:
          every wicked work declares a man an enemy to God (Col. i. 21):
          “enemies in your minds by wicked works.” If he could command his
          creature anything which bears an enmity in its nature to himself, he
          would then implicitly command the hatred of himself, and he would be,
          in some measure, a hater of himself: he that commands another to
          deprive him of his life, cannot be said to bear any love to his own
          life. God can never hate himself, and therefore cannot command
          anything that is hateful to him and tends to a hating of him, and
          driving the creature further from him; in that very moment that God
          should command such a thing, he would cease to be good. What can be
          more absurd to imagine, than that Infinite Goodness should enjoin a
          thing contrary to itself, and contrary to the essential duty of a
          creature, and order him to do anything that bespeaks an enmity to the
          nature of the Creator, or a deflouring and disparaging his works? God
          cannot but love himself, and his own goodness; he were not otherwise
          good; and, therefore, cannot order the creature to do anything
          opposite to this goodness, or anything hurtful to the creature itself,
          as unrighteousness is.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Nor can God secretly inspire any evil into us. It is as much
          against his nature to incline the heart to sin as it is to command it:
          as it is impossible but that he should love himself, and therefore
          impossible to enjoin anything that tends to a hatred of himself; by
          the same reason it is as impossible that he should infuse such a
          principle in the heart, that might carry a man out to any act of
          enmity against him. To enjoin one thing, and incline to another, would
          be an argument of such insincerity, unfaithfulness, contradiction to
          itself, that it cannot be conceived to fall within the compass of the
          Divine nature (Deut. xxxii. 4), who is a “God without iniquity,”
          because “a God of truth” and sincerity, “just and right is he.” To
          bestow excellent faculties upon man in creation, and incline him, by a
          sudden impulsion, to things contrary to the true end of him, and
          induce an inevitable ruin upon that work which he had composed with so
          much wisdom and goodness, and pronounced good with so much delight and
          pleasure, is inconsistent with that love which God bears to the
          creature of his own framing: to incline his will to that which would
          render him the object of his hatred, the fuel for his justice, and
          sink him into deplorable misery, it is most absurd, and
          unchristian‑like to imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Nor can God necessitate man to sin. Indeed sin cannot be
          committed by force; there is no sin but is in some sort voluntary;
          voluntary in the root, or voluntary in the branch; voluntary by an
          immediate act of the will, or voluntary by a general or natural
          inclination of the will. That is not a crime to which a man is
          violenced, without any concurrence of the faculties of the soul to
          that act; it is indeed not an act, but a passion; a man that is forced
          is not an agent, but a patient under the force: but what necessity can
          there be upon man from God, since he hath implanted such a principle
          in him, that he cannot desire anything but what is good, either really
          or apparently; and if a man mistakes the object, it is his own fault;
          for God hath endowed him with reason to discern, and liberty of will
          to choose upon that judgment. And though it is to be acknowledged that
          God hath an absolute sovereign dominion over his creature, without any
          limitation, and may do what he pleases, and dispose of it according to
          his own will, as a “potter doth with his vessel” (Rom. ix. 21);
          according as the church speaks (Isa. lxiv. 8), “We are the clay, and
          thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand;” yet he cannot
          pollute any undefiled creature by virtue of that sovereign power,
          which he hath to do what he will with it; because such an act would be
          contrary to the foundation and right of his dominion, which consists
          in the excellency of his nature, his immense wisdom, and unspotted
          purity; if God should therefore do any such act, he would expunge the
          right of his dominion by blotting out that nature which renders him
          fit for that dominion, and the exercise of it.902 Any dominion which
          is exercised without the rules of goodness, is not a true sovereignty,
          but an insupportable tyranny. God would cease to be a rightful
          Sovereign if he ceased to be good; and he would cease to be good, if
          he did command, necessitate, or by any positive operation, incline
          inwardly the heart of a creature directly to that which were morally
          evil, and contrary to the eminency of his own nature. But that we may
          the better conceive of this, let us trace man in his first fall,
          whereby he subjected himself and all his posterity to the curse of the
          law and hatred of God; we shall find no footsteps, either of precept,
          outward force, or inward impulsion.903 The plain story of man’s
          apostasy dischargeth God from any interest in the crime as an
          encouragement, and excuseth him from any appearance of suspicion, when
          he showed him the tree he had reserved, as a mark of his sovereignty,
          and forbad him to eat of the fruit of it; he backed the prohibition
          with the threatening the greatest evil, viz. death; which could be
          understood to imply nothing less than the loss of all his happiness;
          and in that couched an assurance of the perpetuity of his felicity, if
          he did not, rebelliously, reach forth his hand to take and “eat of the
          fruit” (Gen. ii. 16, 17). It is true God had given that fruit an
          excellency, “a goodness for food, and a pleasantness to the eye” (Gen.
          iii. 6). He had given man an appetite, whereby he was capable of
          desiring so pleasant a fruit; but God had, by creation, arranged it
          under the command of reason, if man would have kept it in its due
          obedience; he had fixed a severe threatening to bar the unlawful
          excursions of it; he had allowed him a multitude of other fruits in
          the garden, and given him liberty enough to satisfy his curiosity in
          all, except this only. Could there be anything more obliging to man,
          to let God have his reserve of that one tree, than the grant of all
          the rest; and more deterring from any disobedient attempt than so
          strict a command, spirited with so dreadful a penalty? God did not
          solicit him to rebel against him; a solicitation to it, and a command
          against it, were inconsistent. The devil assaults him, and God
          permitted it, and stands, as it were, a spectator of the issue of the
          combat. There could be no necessity upon man to listen to, and
          entertain the suggestions of the serpent; he had a power to resist
          him, and he had an answer ready for all the devil’s arguments, had
          they been multiplied to more than they were; the opposing the order of
          God had been a sufficient confutation of all the devil’s plausible
          reasonings; that Creator, who hath given me my being, hath ordered me
          not to eat of it. Though the pleasure of the fruit might allure him,
          yet the force of his reason might have quelled the liquorishness of
          his sense; the perpetual thinking of, and sounding out, the command of
          God, had silenced both Satan and his own appetite; had disarmed the
          tempter, and preserved his sensitive part in its due subjection. What
          inclination can we suppose there could be from the Creator, when, upon
          the very first offer of the temptation, Eve opposes to the tempter the
          prohibition and threatening of God, and strains it to a higher peg
          than we find God had delivered it in? For in Gen. ii. 17, it is, “You
          shall not eat of it;” but she adds (Gen. iii. 3), “Neither shall you
          touch it;” which was a remark that might have had more influence to
          restrain her. Had our first parents kept this fixed upon their
          understandings and thoughts, that God had forbidden any such act as
          the eating of the fruit, and that he was true to execute the
          threatening he had uttered, of which truth of God they could not but
          have a natural notion, with what ease might they have withstood the
          devil’s attack, and defeated his design! And it had been easy with
          them, to have kept their understandings by the force of such a
          thought, from entertaining any contrary imagination. There is no
          ground for any jealousy of any encouragements, inward impulsions, or
          necessity from God in this affair. A discharge of God from this first
          sin will easily induce a freedom of him from all other sins which
          follow upon it. God doth not then encourage, or excite, or incline to
          sin. How can he excite to that which, when it is done, he will be sure
          to condemn? How can he be a righteous Judge to sentence a sinner to
          misery for a crime acted by a secret inspiration from himself?
          Iniquity would deserve no reproof from him, if he were any way
          positively the author of it. Were God the author of it in us, what is
          the reason our own consciences accuse us for it, and convince us of
          it? that, being God’s deputy, would not accuse us of it, if the
          sovereign power by which it acts, did incline us to it. How can he be
          thought to excite to that which he hath enacted such severe laws to
          restrain, or incline man to that which he hath so dreadfully punished
          in his Son, and which it is impossible but the excellency of his
          nature must incline him eternally to hate? We may sooner imagine, that
          a pure flame shall engender cold, and darkness be the offspring of a
          sunbeam, as imagine such a thing as this. “What shall we say, is there
          unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” The apostle execrates such a
          thought (Rom. ix. 14).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. God cannot act any evil, in or by himself. If he cannot approve of
          sin in others, nor excite any to iniquity, which is less, he cannot
          commit evil himself, which is greater; what he cannot positively will
          in another, can never be willed in himself; he cannot do evil through
          ignorance, because of his infinite knowledge; nor through weakness,
          because of his infinite power; nor through malice, because of his
          infinite rectitude. He cannot will any unjust thing, because, having
          an infinitely perfect understanding, he cannot judge that to be true
          which is false; or that to be good which is evil: his will is
          regulated by his wisdom. If he could will any unjust and irrational
          thing, his will would be repugnant to his understanding; there would
          be a disagreement in God, will against mind, and will against wisdom;
          he being the highest reason, the first truth, cannot do an
          unreasonable, false, defective action. It is not a defect in God that
          he cannot do evil, but a fulness and excellency of power; as it is not
          a weakness in the light, but the perfection of it, that it is unable
          to produce darkness; “God is the Father of lights, with whom is no
          variableness” (James i. 17). Nothing pleases him, nothing is acted by
          him, but what is beseeming the infinite excellency of his own nature;
          the voluntary necessity whereby God cannot be unjust, renders him a
          God blessed forever; he would hate himself for the chief good, if, in
          any of his actions, he should disagree with his goodness. He cannot do
          any unworthy thing, not because he wants an infinite power, but
          because he is possessed of an infinite wisdom, and adorned with an
          infinite purity; and being infinitely pure, cannot have the least
          mixture of impurity. As if you can suppose fire infinitely hot, you
          cannot suppose it to have the least mixture of coldness; the better
          anything is, the more unable it is to do evil; God being the only
          goodness, can as little be changed in his goodness as in his essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The next inquiry is, The proof that God is holy, or the
          manifestation of it. Purity is as requisite to the blessedness of God,
          as to the being of God; as he could not be God without being blessed,
          so he could not be blessed without being holy. He is called by the
          title of Blessed, as well as by that of holy (Mark xiv. 61); “Art thou
          the Christ, the son of the Blessed?” Unrighteousness is a misery and
          turbulency in any spirit wherein it is; for it is a privation of an
          excellency which ought to be in every intellectual being, and what can
          follow upon the privation of an excellency but unquietness and grief,
          the moth of happiness? An unrighteous man, as an unrighteous man, can
          never be blessed, though he were in a local heaven. Had God the least
          spot upon his purity, it would render him as miserable in the midst of
          his infinite sufficiency, as iniquity renders a man in the confluence
          of his earthly enjoyments. The holiness and felicity of God are
          inseparable in him. The apostle intimates that the heathen made an
          attempt to sully his blessedness, when they would liken him to
          corruptible, mutable, impure man (Rom. i. 23, 25): “They changed the
          glory of the incorruptible God into an image, made like to corruptible
          man;” and after, he entitles God a “God blessed forever.” The gospel
          is therefore called, “The glorious gospel of the blessed God” (1 Tim.
          i. 11), in regard of the holiness of the gospel precepts, and in
          regard of the declaration of the holiness of God in all the streams
          and branches, wherein his purity, in which his blessedness consists,
          is as illustrious as any other perfection of the Divine Being. God
          hath highly manifested this attribute in the state of nature; in the
          legal administration; in the dispensation of the gospel. His wisdom,
          goodness, and power, are declared in creation; his sovereign authority
          in his law; his grace and mercy in the gospel, and his righteousness
          in all. Suitable to this threefold state, may be that eternal
          repetition of his holiness in the prophecy (Isa. vi. 3); holy, as
          Creator and Benefactor; holy, as Lawgiver and Judge; holy, as Restorer
          and Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, His holiness appears, as he is Creator, in framing man in a
          perfect uprightness. Angels, as made by God, could not be evil; for
          God beheld his own works with pleasure, and could not have pronounced
          them all good, had some been created pure, and others impure; two
          moral contrarieties could not be good. The angels had a first estate,
          wherein they were happy (Jude 6); and had they not left their own
          habitation and state, they could not have been miserable. But, because
          the Scripture speaks only of the creation of man, we will consider,
          that the human nature was well strung and tuned by God, according to
          the note of his own holiness (Eccles. vii. 29); “God hath made man
          upright:” he had declared his power in other creatures, but would
          declare in his rational creature, what he most valued in himself; and,
          therefore, created him upright, with a wisdom which is the rectitude
          of the mind, with a purity which is the rectitude of the will and
          affections. He had declared a purity in other creatures, as much as
          they were capable of, viz. in the exact tuning them to answer one
          another. And that God, who so well tuned and composed other creatures,
          would not make man a jarring instrument, and place a cracked creature
          to be Lord of the rest of his earthly fabric. God, being holy, could
          not set his seal upon any rational creature, but the impression would
          be like himself, pure and holy also; he could not be created with an
          error in his understanding; that had been inconsistent with the
          goodness of God to his rational creature; if so, the erroneous motion
          of the will, which was to follow the dictates of the understanding,
          could not have been imputed to him as his crime, because it would have
          been, not a voluntary, but a necessary effect of his nature; had there
          been an error in the first wheel, the error of the next could not have
          been imputed to the nature of that, but to the irregular motion of the
          first wheel in the engine. The sin of men and angels, proceeded not
          from any natural defect in their understandings, but from
          inconsideration; he that was the author of harmony in his other
          creatures, could not be the author of disorder in the chief of his
          works. Other creatures were his footsteps, but man was his image (Gen.
          i. 26, 27): “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness;” which,
          though it seems to imply no more in that place, than an image of his
          dominion over the creatures, yet the apostle raises it a peg higher,
          and gives us a larger interpretation of it (Col. iii. 10): “And have
          put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of
          Him that created him;” making it to consist in a resemblance to his
          righteousness. Image, say some, notes the form, as man was a spirit in
          regard of his soul; likeness, notes the quality implanted in his
          spiritual nature; the image of God was drawn in him, both as he was a
          rational, and as he was a holy creature. The creatures manifested the
          being of a superior power, as their cause, but the righteousness of
          the first man evidenced, not only a sovereign power, as the donor of
          his being, but a holy power, as the pattern of his work. God appeared
          to be a holy God in the righteousness of his creature, as well as an
          understanding God in the reason of his creature, while he formed him
          with all necessary knowledge in his mind and all necessary uprightness
          in his will. The law of love to God, with his whole soul, his whole
          mind, his whole heart and strength, was originally written upon his
          nature; all the parts of his nature were framed in a moral conformity
          with God, to answer this law, and imitate God in his purity, which
          consists in a love of himself, and his own goodness and excellency.
          Thus doth the clearness of the stream point us to the purer fountain,
          and the brightness of the beam evidence a greater splendor in the sun
          which shot it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, His holiness appears in his laws, as he is a Lawgiver and a
          Judge. Since man was bound to be subject to God, as a creature, and
          had a capacity to be ruled by the law, as an understanding and willing
          creature; God gave him a law, taken from the depths of his holy
          nature, and suited to the original faculties of man. The rules which
          God hath fixed in the world, are not the resolves of bare will, but
          result particularly from the goodness of his nature; they are nothing
          else but the transcripts of his infinite detestation of sin, as he is
          the unblemished governor of the world. This being the most adorable
          property of his nature, he hath impressed it upon that law which he
          would have inviolably observed as a perpetual rule for our actions,
          that we may every moment think of this beautiful perfection. God can
          command nothing but what hath some similitude with the rectitude of
          his own nature; all his laws, every paragraph of them, therefore,
          scent of this, and glitter with it (Deut. iv. 8): “What nation hath
          statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law I set before you
          this day?” and, therefore, they are compared to fine gold, that hath
          no speck or dross (Ps. xix. 10).
        </p>
        <p>
          This purity is evident—1. In the moral law, or law of nature. 2. In
          the ceremonial law. 3. In the allurements annexed to it, for keeping
          it, and the affrightments to restrain from the breaking of it. 4. In
          the judgments inflicted for the violation of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the moral law: which is therefore dignified with the title of
          Holy, twice in one verse (Rom. vii. 12): “Wherefore, the law is holy,
          and the commandment is holy, just, and good;” it being the express
          image of God’s will, as our Saviour was of his person, and bearing a
          resemblance to the purity of his nature. The tables of this law were
          put into the ark, that, as the mercy seat was to represent the grace
          of God, so the law was to represent the holiness of God (Ps. xix. 1).
          The Psalmist, after he had spoken of the glory of God in the heavens,
          wherein the power of God is exposed to our view, introduceth the law,
          wherein the purity of God is evidenced to our minds (ver. 7, 8,
          &amp;c.): “Perfect, pure, clean, righteous,” are the titles given to
          it. It is clearer in holiness than the sun is in brightness; and more
          mighty in itself, to command the conscience, than the sun is to run
          its race. As the holiness of the Scripture demonstrates the divinity
          of its Author; so the holiness of the law doth the purity of the
          Lawgiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The purity of this law is seen in the matter of it. It prescribes
          all that becomes a creature towards God, and all that becomes one
          creature towards another of his own rank and kind. The image of God is
          complete in the holiness of the first table, and the righteousness of
          the second; which is intimated by the apostle (Eph. iv. 24), the one
          being the rule of what we owe to God, the other being the rule of what
          we owe to man: there is no good but it enjoins, and no evil but it
          disowns. It is not sickly and lame in any part of it; not a good
          action, but it gives it its due praise; and not an evil action, but it
          sets a condemning mark upon. The commands of it are frequently in
          Scripture called judgments, because they rightly judge of good and
          evil; and are a clear light to inform the judgment of man in the
          knowledge of both. By this was the understanding of David enlightened
          to know every false way, and to “hate it” (Ps. cxix. 104). There is no
          case can happen, but may meet with a determination from it; it teaches
          men the noblest manner of living a life like God himself; honorably
          for the Lawgiver, and joyfully for the subject. It directs us to the
          highest end; sets us at a distance from all base and sordid practices;
          it proposeth light to the understanding, and goodness to the will. It
          would tune all the strings, set right all the orders of mankind: it
          censures the least mote, countenanceth not any stain in the life. Not
          a wanton glance can meet with any justification from it (Matt. v. 28);
          not a rash anger but it frowns upon (ver. 22). As the Lawgiver wants
          nothing as an addition to his blessedness, so his law wants nothing as
          a supplement to its perfection (Deut. iv. 2). What our Saviour seems
          to add, is not an addition to mend any defects, but a restoration of
          it from the corrupt glosses, wherewith the Scribes and Pharisees had
          eclipsed the brightness of it: they had curtailed it, and diminished
          part of its authority, cutting off its empire over the least evil, and
          left its power only to check the grosser practices. But Christ
          restores it to the due extent of its sovereignty, and shows it those
          dimensions in which the holy men of God considered it as “exceeding
          broad” (Ps. cxix. 96), reaching to all actions, all motions, all
          circumstances attending them; full of inexhaustible treasures of
          righteousness. And though this law, since the fall, doth irritate sin,
          it is no disparagement, but a testimony to the righteousness of it;
          which the apostle manifests by his “Wherefore” (Rom. vii. 8), “sin,
          taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of
          concupiscence;” and repeating the same sense (ver. 11), subjoins a
          “Wherefore” (ver. 12), “Wherefore the law is holy.” The rising of
          men’s sinful hearts against the law of God, when it strikes with its
          preceptive and minatory parts upon their consciences, evidenceth the
          holiness of the law and the Lawgiver. In its own nature it is a
          directing rule, but the malignant nature of sin is exasperated by it;
          as an hostile quality in a creature will awaken itself at the
          appearance of its enemy. The purity of this beam, and transcript of
          God, bears witness to a greater clearness and beauty in the sun and
          original. Undefiled streams manifest an untainted fountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is seen in the manner of its precepts. As it prescribes all
          good, and forbids all evil, so it doth enjoin the one, and banish the
          other as such. The laws of men command virtuous things; not as
          virtuous in themselves, but as useful for human society; which the
          magistrate is the conservator of, and the guardian of justice.904 The
          laws of men contain not all the precepts of virtue, but only such as
          are accommodated to their customs, and are useful to preserve the
          ligaments of their government. The design of them is not so much to
          render the subjects good men, as good citizens: they order the
          practice of those virtues that may strengthen civil society, and
          discountenance those vices only which weaken the sinews of it: but
          God, being the guardian of universal righteousness, doth not only
          enact the observance of all righteousness, but the observance of it as
          righteousness. He commands that which is just in itself, enjoins
          virtues as virtues, and prohibits vices as vices: as they are
          profitable or injurious to ourselves, as well as to others. Men
          command temperance and justice; not as virtues in themselves, but as
          they prevent disorder and confusion in a commonwealth; and forbid
          adultery and theft, not as vices in themselves, but as they are
          intrenchments upon property; not as hurtful to the person that commits
          them, but as hurtful to the person against whose right they are
          committed. Upon this account, perhaps, Paul applauds the holiness of
          the law of God in regard of its own nature, as considered in itself,
          more than he doth the justice of it in regard of man, and the goodness
          and conveniency of it to the world (Rom. vii. 12); the law is holy
          twice, and just and good but once.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) In the spiritual extent of it. The most righteous powers of the
          world do not so much regard in their laws what the inward affections
          of their subjects are: the external acts are only the objects of their
          decrees, either to encourage them if they be useful, or discourage
          them if they be hurtful to the community. And, indeed, they can do no
          other, for they have no power proportioned to inward affections, since
          the inward disposition falls not under their censure; and it would be
          foolish for any legislative power to make such laws, which it is
          impossible for it to put in execution. They can prohibit the outward
          acts of theft and murder, but they cannot command the love of God, the
          hatred of sin, the contempt of the world; they cannot prohibit unclean
          thoughts, and the atheism of the heart. But the law of God surmounts
          in righteousness all the laws of the best‑regulated commonwealths in
          the world: it restrains the licentious heart, as well as the violent
          hand; it damps the very first bubblings of corrupt nature, orders a
          purity in the spring, commands a clean fountain, clean streams, clean
          vessels. It would frame the heart to an inward, as well as the life to
          an outward righteousness, and make the inside purer than the outside.
          It forbids the first belchings of a murderous or adulterous intention:
          it obligeth a man as a rational creature, and therefore exacts a
          conformity of every rational faculty, and of whatsoever is under the
          command of them. It commands the private closet to be free from the
          least cobweb, as well as the outward porch to be clean from mire and
          dirt. It frowns upon all stains and pollutions of the most retired
          thoughts: hence the apostle calls it a “spiritual law” (Rom. vii. 14),
          as not political, but extending its force further than the frontiers
          of the man; placing its ensigns in the metropolis of the heart and
          mind, and curbing with its sceptre the inward motions of the spirit,
          and commanding over the secrets of every man’s breast.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) In regard of the perpetuity of it. The purity and perpetuity of
          it are linked together by the Psalmist (Ps. xix. 9): “The fear of the
          Lord is clean, enduring for ever;” the fear of the Lord, that is, that
          law which commands the fear and worship of God, and is the rule of it.
          And, indeed, God values it at such a rate, that rather than part with
          a tittle, or let the honor of it lie in the dust, he would not only
          let “heaven and earth pass away,” but expose his Son to death for the
          reparation of the wrong it had sustained. So holy it is, that the
          holiness and righteousness of God cannot dispense with it, cannot
          abrogate it, without despoiling himself of his own being: it is a copy
          of the eternal law. Can he ever abrogate the command of love to
          himself, without showing some contempt of his own excellency and very
          being? Before he can enjoin a creature not to love him, he must make
          himself unworthy of love, and worthy of hatred; this would be the
          highest unrighteousness, to order us to hate that which is only worthy
          of our highest affections. So God cannot change the first command, and
          order us to worship many gods; this would be against the excellency
          and unity of God: for God cannot constitute another God, or make
          anything worthy of an honor equal with himself.905 Those things that
          are good, only because they are commanded, are alterable by God: those
          things that are intrinsically and essentially good, and therefore
          commanded, are unalterable as long as the holiness and righteousness
          of God stand firm. The intrinsic goodness of the moral law, the
          concern God hath for it; the perpetuity of the precepts of the first
          table, and the care he hath had to imprint the precepts of the second
          upon the minds and consciences of men, as the Author of nature for the
          preservation of the world, manifests the holiness of the Lawmaker and
          Governor.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His holiness appears in the ceremonial law: in the variety of
          sacrifices for sin, wherein he writ his detestation of unrighteousness
          in bloody characters. His holiness was more constantly expressed in
          the continual sacrifices, than in those rarer sprinklings of judgments
          now and then upon the world; which often reached, not the worst, but
          the most moderate sinners, and were the occasions of the questioning
          of the righteousness of his providence both by Jews and Gentiles. In
          judgments his purity was only now and then manifest: by his long
          patience, he might be imagined by some reconciled to their crimes, or
          not much concerned in them; but by the morning and evening sacrifice
          he witnessed a perpetual and uninterrupted abhorrence of whatsoever
          was evil. Besides those, the occasional washings and sprinklings upon
          ceremonial defilements, which polluted only the body, gave an
          evidence, that everything that had a resemblance to evil, was
          loathsome to him. Add, also, the prohibitions of eating such and such
          creatures that were filthy; as the swine that wallowed in the mire, a
          fit emblem for the profane and brutish sinner; which had a moral
          signification, both of the loathsomeness of sin to God, and the
          aversion themselves ought to have to everything that was filthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This holiness appears in the allurements annexed to the law for
          keeping it, and the affrightments to restrain from the breaking of it.
          Both promises and threatenings have their fundamental root in the
          holiness of God, and are both branches of this peculiar perfection. As
          they respect the nature of God, they are declarations of his hatred of
          sin, and his love of righteousness; the one belong to his
          threatenings, the other to his promises; both join together to
          represent this divine perfection to the creature, and to excite to an
          imitation in the creature. In the one, God would render sin odious,
          because dangerous, and curb the practice of evil, which would
          otherwise be licentious; in the other, he would commend righteousness,
          and excite a love of it, which would otherwise be cold. By there God
          suits the two great affections of men, fear and hope; both the
          branches of self‑love in man: the promises and threatenings are both
          the branches of holiness in God. The end of the promises is the same
          with the exhortation the apostle concludes from them (2 Cor. vii. 1);
          “Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
          of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” As the
          end of precept is to direct, the end of threatenings is to deter from
          iniquity, so that the promises is to allure to obedience. Thus God
          breathes out his love to righteousness in every promise; his hatred of
          sin in every threatening. The rewards offered in the one, are the
          smiles of pleased holiness; and the curses thundered in the other, are
          the sparklings of enraged righteousness.

        <p>
          4. His holiness appears in the judgment inflicted for the violation of
          this law. Divine holiness is the root of Divine justice, and Divine
          justice is the triumph of Divine holiness. Hence both are expressed in
          Scripture by one word of righteousness, which sometimes signifies the
          rectitude of the Divine nature, and sometimes the vindicative stroke
          of his arm (Ps. ciii. 6); “The Lord executeth righteousness and
          judgment for all that are oppressed.” So (Dan. ix. 7) “Righteousness
          (that is, justice) belongs to thee.” The vials of his wrath are filled
          from his implacable aversion to iniquity. All penal evils shower down
          upon the heads of wicked men, spread their root in, and branch out
          from, this perfection. All the dreadful storms and tempests in the
          world are blown up by it. Why doth he “rain snares, fire and
          brimstone, and a horrible tempest!” Because “the righteous Lord loveth
          righteousness” (Ps. xi. 6, 7). And, as was observed before, when he
          was going about the dreadfulest work that ever was in the world, the
          overturning the Jewish state, hardening the hearts of that unbelieving
          people, and cashiering a nation, once dear to him, from the honor of
          his protection; his holiness, as the spring of all this, is applauded
          by the seraphims (Isa. vi. 3, compared with ver. 9‒11), &amp;c.
          Impunity argues the approbation of a crime, and punishment the
          abhorrency of it. The greatness of the crime, and the righteousness of
          the Judge, are the first natural sentiments that arise in the minds of
          men upon the appearance of Divine judgments in the world, by those
          that are near them;906 as, when men see gibbets erected, scaffolds
          prepared, instruments of death and torture provided, and grievous
          punishments inflicted, the first reflection in the spectator is the
          malignity of the crime, and the detestation the governors are
          possessed with.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) How severely hath he punished his most noble creatures for it!
          The once glorious angels, upon whom he had been at greater cost than
          upon any other creatures, and drawn more lively lineaments of his own
          excellency, upon the transgression of his law, are thrown into the
          furnace of justice, without any mercy to pity them (Jude 6). And
          though there were but one sort of creatures upon the earth that bore
          his image, and were only fit to publish and keep up his honor below
          the heavens, yet, upon their apostasy, though upon a temptation from a
          subtle and insinuating spirit, the man, with all his posterity, is
          sentenced to misery in life, and death at last; and the woman, with
          all her sex, have standing punishments inflicted on them, which, as
          they begun in their persons, were to reach as far as the last member
          of their successive generations. So holy is God, that he will not
          endure a spot in his choicest work. Men, indeed, when there is a crack
          in an excellent piece of work, or a stain upon a rich garment, do not
          cast it away; they value it for the remaining excellency, more than
          hate it for the contracted spot; but God saw no excellency in his
          creature worthy regarding, after the image of that which he most
          esteemed in himself was defaced.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) How detestable to him are the very instruments of sin! For the
          ill use the serpent, an irrational creature, was put to by the devil,
          as an instrument in the fall of man, the whole brood of those animals
          are cursed (Gen. iii. 14), “cursed above all cattle, and above every
          beast of the field.” Not only the devil’s head is threatened to be for
          ever bruised, and, as some think, rendered irrecoverable upon this
          further testimony of his malice in the seduction of man, who, perhaps,
          without this new act, might have been admitted into the arms of mercy,
          notwithstanding his first sin; “though the Scripture gives us no
          account of this, only this is the only sentence we read of pronounced
          against the devil, which puts him into an irrecoverable state by a
          mortal bruising of his head.” But, I say, he is not only punished, but
          the organ, whereby he blew in his temptation, is put into a worse
          condition than it was before. Thus God hated the sponge, whereby the
          devil deformed his beautiful image: thus God, to manifest his
          detestation of sin, ordered the beast, whereby any man was slain, to
          be slain as well as the malefactor (Lev. xx. 15). The gold and silver
          that had been abused to idolatry, and were the ornaments of images,
          though good in themselves, and incapable of a criminal nature, were
          not to be brought into their houses, but detested and abhorred by
          them, because they were cursed, and an abomination to the Lord. See
          with what loathing expressions this law is enjoined to them (Deut.
          vii. 25, 26). So contrary is the holy nature of God to every sin, that
          it curseth everything that is instrumental in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) How detestable is everything to him that is in the sinner’s
          possession! The very earth, which God had made Adam the proprietor of,
          was cursed for his sake (Gen. iii. 17, 18). It lost its beauty, and
          lies languishing to this day; and, notwithstanding the redemption by
          Christ, hath not recovered its health, nor is it like to do, till the
          completing the fruits of it upon the children of God (Rom. viii.
          20‒22). The whole lower creation was made subject to vanity, and put
          into pangs, upon the sin of man, by the righteousness of God detesting
          his offence. How often hath his implacable aversion from sin been
          shown, not only in his judgments upon the offender’s person, but by
          wrapping up, in the same judgment, those which stood in a near
          relation to them! Achan, with his children and cattle, are overwhelmed
          with stones, and burned together (Josh. vii. 24, 25). In the
          destruction of Sodom, not only the grown malefactors, but the young
          spawn, the infants, at present incapable of the same wickedness, and
          their cattle, were burned up by the same fire from heaven; and the
          place where their habitations stood, is, at this day, partly a heap of
          ashes, and partly an infectious lake, that chokes any fish that swims
          into it from Jordan, and stifles, as is related, by its vapor, any
          bird that attempts to fly over it. O, how detestable is sin to God,
          that causes him to turn a pleasant land, as the “garden of the Lord”
          (as it is styled Gen. xiii. 10), into a lake of sulphur; to make it,
          both in his word and works, as a lasting monument of his abhorrence of
          evil!
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) What design hath God in all these acts of severity and vindictive
          justice, but to set off the lustre of his holiness? He testifies
          himself concerned for those laws, which he hath set as hedges and
          limits to the lusts of men; and, therefore, when he breathes forth his
          fiery indignation against a people, he is said to get himself honor:
          as when he intended the Red Sea should swallow up the Egyptian army
          (Exod. xiv. 17, 18), which Moses, in his triumphant song, echoes back
          again (Exod. xv. 1): “Thou hast triumphed gloriously;” gloriously in
          his holiness, which is the glory of his nature, as Moses himself
          interprets it in the text. When men will not own the holiness of God,
          in a way of duty, God will vindicate it in a way of justice and
          punishment. In the destruction of Aaron’s sons, that were
          will‑worshippers, and would take strange fire, “sanctified” and
          “glorified” are coupled (Lev. x. 3): he glorified himself in that act,
          in vindicating his holiness before all the people, declaring that he
          will not endure sin and disobedience. He doth therefore, in this life,
          more severely punish the sins of his people, when they presume upon
          any act of disobedience, for a testimony that the nearness and
          dearness of any person to him shall not make him unconcerned in his
          holiness, or be a plea for impurity. The end of all his judgments is
          to witness to the world his abominating of sin. To punish and witness
          against men, are one and the same thing (Micah i. 2): “The Lord shall
          witness against you;” and it is the witness of God’s holiness (Hos. v.
          5): “And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face:” one renders it
          the excellency of Israel, and understands it of God: the word גאון,
          which is here in our translation, “pride,” is rendered “excellency”
          (Amos viii. 7): “The Lord God hath sworn by his excellency;” which is
          interpreted “holiness” (Amos iv. 2): “The Lord God hath sworn by his
          holiness.” What is the issue or end of this swearing by “holiness,”
          and of his “excellency” testifying against them? In all those places
          you will find them to be sweeping judgments: in one, Israel and
          Ephraim shall “fall in their iniquity;” in another, he will “take them
          away with hooks,” and “their posterity with fish‑hooks;” and in
          another, he would “never forget any of their works.” He that punisheth
          wickedness in those he before used with the greatest tenderness,
          furnisheth the world with an undeniable evidence of the detestableness
          of it to him. Were not judgments sometimes poured out upon the world,
          it would be believed that God were rather an approver than an enemy to
          sin. To conclude, since God hath made a stricter law to guide men,
          annexed promises above the merit of obedience to allure them, and
          threatenings dreadful enough to affright men from disobedience, he
          cannot be the cause of sin, nor a lover of it. How can he be the
          author of that which he so severely forbids; or love that which he
          delights to punish; or be fondly indulgent to any evil, when he hates
          the ignorant instruments in the offences of his reasonable creatures?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. The holiness of God appears in our restoration. It is in the
          glass of the gospel we behold the “glory of the Lord” (2 Cor. iii.
          18); that is, the glory of the Lord, into whose image we are changed;
          but we are changed into nothing, as the image of God, but into
          holiness: we bore not upon us by creation, nor by regeneration, the
          image of any other perfection: we cannot be changed into his
          omnipotence, omniscience, &amp;c., but into the image of his
          righteousness. This is the pleasing and glorious sight the gospel
          mirror darts in our eyes. The whole scene of redemption is nothing
          else but a discovery of judgment and righteousness (Isa. i. 27): “Zion
          shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This holiness of God appears in the manner of our restoration, viz.
          by the death of Christ. Not all the vials of judgments, that have, or
          shall be poured out upon the wicked world, nor the flaming furnace of
          a sinner’s conscience, nor the irreversible sentence pronounced
          against the rebellious devils, nor the groans of the damned creatures,
          give such a demonstration of God’s hatred of sin, as the wrath of God
          let loose upon his Son. Never did Divine holiness appear more
          beautiful and lovely, than at the time our Saviour’s countenance was
          most marred in the midst of his dying groans. This himself
          acknowledges in that prophetical psalm (xxii. 1, 2), when God had
          turned his smiling face from him, and thrust his sharp knife into his
          heart, which forced that terrible cry from him, “My God, my God, why
          hast thou forsaken me?” He adores this perfection of holiness (ver.
          3), “But thou art holy;” thy holiness is the spring of all this sharp
          agony, and for this thou inhabitest, and shalt forever inhabit, the
          praises of all thy Israel. Holiness drew the veil between God’s
          countenance and our Saviour’s soul. Justice indeed gave the stroke,
          but holiness ordered it. In this his purity did sparkle, and his
          irreversible justice manifested that all those that commit sin are
          worthy of death; this was the perfect index of his “righteousness”
          (Rom. iii. 25), that is, of his holiness and truth; then it was that
          God that is holy, was “sanctified in righteousness” (Isa. v. 16). It
          appears the more, if you consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The dignity of the Redeemer’s person. One that had been from
          eternity; had laid the foundations of the world; had been the object
          of the Divine delight: he that was God blessed forever, become a
          curse; he who was blessed by angels, and by whom God blessed the
          world, must be seized with horror; the Son of eternity must bleed to
          death! When did ever sin appear so irreconcileable to God? Where did
          God ever break out so furiously in his detestation of iniquity? The
          Father would have the most excellent person, one next in order to
          himself, and equal to him in all the glorious perfections of his
          nature (Phil. ii. 6), die on a disgraceful cross, and be exposed to
          the flames of Divine wrath, rather than sin should live, and his
          holiness remain forever disparaged by the violations of his law.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The near relation he stood in to the Father. He was his “own Son
          that he delivered up” (Rom. viii. 32); his essential image, as dearly
          beloved by him as himself; yet he would abate nothing of his hatred of
          those sins imputed to one so dear to him, and who never had done
          anything contrary to his will. The strong cries uttered by him could
          not cause him to cut off the least fringe of this royal garment, nor
          part with a thread the robe of his holiness was woven with. The
          torrent of wrath is opened upon him, and the Father’s heart beats not
          in the least notice of tenderness to sin, in the midst of his Son’s
          agonies. God seems to lay aside the bowels of a father, and put on the
          garb of an irreconcileable enemy,907 upon which account, probably, our
          Saviour in the midst of his passion gives him the title of God; not of
          Father, the title he usually before addressed to him with, (Matt.
          xxvii. 46), “My God, my God;” not, My Father, my Father; “why hast
          thou forsaken me?” He seems to hang upon the cross like a disinherited
          son, while he appeared in the garb and rank of a sinner. Then was his
          head loaded with curses, when he stood under that sentence of “Cursed
          is every one that hangs upon a tree” (Gal. iii. 13), and looked as one
          forlorn and rejected by the Divine purity and tenderness. God dealt
          not with him as if he had been one in so near a relation to him. He
          left him not to the will only of the instruments of his death; he
          would have the chiefest blow himself of bruising of him (Isa. liii.
          10): “It pleased the Lord to bruise him:” the Lord, because the power
          of creatures could not strike a blow strong enough to satisfy and
          secure the rights of infinite holiness. It was therefore a cup
          tempered and put into his hands by his Father; a cup given him to
          drink. In other judgments he lets out his wrath against his creatures;
          in this he lets out his wrath, as it were, against himself, against
          his Son, one as dear to him as himself. As in his making creatures,
          his power over nothing to bring it into being appeared; but in
          pardoning sin he hath power over himself; so in punishing creatures,
          his holiness appears in his wrath against creatures, against sinners
          by inherency; but by punishing sin in his Son, his holiness sharpens
          his wrath against him who was his equal, and only a reputed sinner; as
          if his affection to his own holiness surmounted his affection to his
          Son: for he chose to suspend the breakings out of his affections to
          his Son, and see him plunged in a sharp and ignominious misery,
          without giving him any visible token of his love, rather than see his
          holiness lie groaning under the injuries of a transgressing world.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The value he puts upon his holiness appears further, in the
          advancement of this redeeming person, after his death. Our Saviour was
          advanced, not barely for his dying, but for the respect he had in his
          death to this attribute of God (Heb. i. 9): “Thou hast loved
          righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath
          anointed thee with the oil of gladness,” &amp;c. By righteousness is
          meant this perfection, because of the opposition of it to iniquity.
          Some think “therefore” to be the final cause; as if this were the
          sense, “Thou art anointed with the oil of gladness, that thou mightest
          love righteousness and hate iniquity.” But the Holy Ghost seeming to
          speak in this chapter not only of the Godhead of Christ but of his
          exaltation; the doctrine whereof he had begun in ver. 3, and
          prosecutes in the following verses, I would rather understand
          “therefore,” for “this cause, or reason, hath God anointed thee;” not
          “to this end.” Christ indeed had an unction of grace, whereby he was
          fitted for his mediatory work; he had also an unction of glory,
          whereby he was rewarded for it. In the first regard, it was a
          qualifying him for his office; in the second regard, it was a solemn
          inaugurating him in his royal authority. And the reason of his being
          settled upon a “throne for ever and ever,” is, “because he loved
          righteousness.” He suffered himself to be pierced to death, that sin,
          the enemy of God’s purity, might be destroyed, and the honor of the
          law, the image of God’s holiness, might be repaired and fulfilled in
          the fallen creature. He restored the credit of Divine holiness in the
          world, in manifesting, by his death, God an irreconcileable enemy to
          all sin; in abolishing the empire of sin, so hateful to God, and
          restoring the rectitude of nature, and new framing the image of God in
          his chosen ones. And God so valued this vindication of his holiness,
          that he confers upon him, in his human nature, an eternal royalty and
          empire over angels and men. Holiness was the great attribute respected
          by Christ in his dying, and manifested in his death; and for his love
          to this, God would bestow an honor upon his person, in that nature
          wherein he did vindicate the honor of so dear a perfection. In the
          death of Christ, he showed his resolution to preserve its rights; in
          the exaltation of Christ, he evinced his mighty pleasure for the
          vindication of it; in both, the infinite value he had for it, as dear
          to him as his life and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It may be farther considered, that in this way of redemption, his
          holiness in the hatred of sin seems to be valued above any other
          attribute. He proclaims the value of it above the person of his Son;
          since the Divine nature of the Redeemer is disguised, obscured, and
          vailed, in order to the restoring the honor of it. And Christ seems to
          value it above his own person, since he submitted himself to the
          reproaches of men, to clear this perfection of the Divine nature, and
          make it illustrious in the eyes of the world. You heard before, at the
          beginning of the handling this argument, it was the beauty of the
          Deity, the lustre of his nature, the link of all his attributes, his
          very life; he values it equal with himself, since he swears by it, as
          well as by his life; and none of his attributes would have a due
          decorum without it; it is the glory of power, mercy, justice, and
          wisdom, that they are all holy; so that though God had an infinite
          tenderness and compassion to the fallen creature, yet it should not
          extend itself in his relief to the prejudice of the rights of his
          purity: he would have this triumph in the tenderness of his mercy, as
          well as the severities of his justice. His mercy had not appeared in
          its true colors, nor attained a regular end, without vengeance on sin.
          It would have been a compassion that would, in sparing the sinner,
          have encouraged the sin, and affronted holiness in the issues of it:
          had he dispersed his compassions about the world, without the regard
          to his hatred of sin, his mercy had been too cheap, and his holiness
          had been contemned; his mercy would not have triumphed in his own
          nature, whilst his holiness had suffered; he had exercised a mercy
          with the impairing his own glory; but now, in this way of redemption,
          the rights of both are secured, both have their due lustre: the
          odiousness of sin is equally discovered with the greatest of his
          compassions; an infinite abhorrence of sin, and an infinite love to
          the world, march hand in hand together. Never was so much of the
          irreconcileableness of sin to him set forth, as in the moment he was
          opening his bowels in the reconciliation of the sinner. Sin is made
          the chiefest mark of his displeasure, while the poor creature is made
          the highest object of Divine pity. There could have been no motion of
          mercy, with the least injury to purity and holiness. In this way mercy
          and truth, mercy to the misery of the creature, and truth to the
          purity of the law, “have met together;” the righteousness of God, and
          the peace of the sinner, “have kissed each other” (Ps. lxxxv. 10).

        <p>
          2. The holiness of God in his hatred of sin appears in our
          justification, and the conditions he requires of all that would enjoy
          the benefit of redemption. His wisdom hath so tempered all the
          conditions of it, that the honor of his holiness is as much preserved,
          as the sweetness of his mercy is experimented by us; all the
          conditions are records of his exact purity, as well as of his
          condescending grace. Our justification is not by the imperfect works
          of creatures, but by an exact and infinite righteousness, as great as
          that of the Deity which had been offended: it being the righteousness
          of a Divine person, upon which account it is called the righteousness
          of God; not only in regard of God’s appointing it, and God’s accepting
          it, but as it is a righteousness of that person that was God, and is
          God. Faith is the condition God requires to justification; but not a
          dead, but an active faith, such a “faith as purifies the heart” (James
          ii. 20; Acts xv. 9). He calls for repentance, which is a moral
          retracting our offences, and an approbation of contemned righteousness
          and a violated law; an endeavor to gain what is lost, and to pluck out
          the heart of that sin we have committed. He requires mortification,
          which is called crucifying; whereby a man would strike as full and
          deadly a blow at his lusts, as was struck at Christ upon the cross,
          and make them as certainly die, as the Redeemer did. Our own
          righteousness must be condemned by us, as impure and imperfect: we
          must disown everything that is our own, as to righteousness, in
          reverence to the holiness of God, and the valuation of the
          righteousness of Christ. He hath resolved not to bestow the
          inheritance of glory without the root of grace. None are partakers of
          the Divine blessedness that are not partakers of the Divine nature:
          there must be a renewing of his image before there be a vision of his
          face (Heb. xii. 14). He will not have men brought only into a relative
          state of happiness by justification, without a real state of grace by
          sanctification; and so resolved he is in it, that there is no
          admittance into heaven of a starting, but a persevering holiness (Rom.
          ii. 7), “a patient continuance in well‑doing:” patient, under the
          sharpness of affliction, and continuing, under the pleasures of
          prosperity. Hence it is that the gospel, the restoring doctrine, hath
          not only the motives of rewards to allure to good, and the danger of
          punishments to scare us from evil, as the law had; but they are set
          forth in a higher strain, in a way of stronger engagement; the rewards
          are heavenly, and the punishments eternal: and more powerful motives
          besides, from the choicer expressions of God’s love in the death of
          his Son. The whole design of it is to reinstate us in a resemblance to
          this Divine perfection; whereby he shows what an affection he hath to
          this excellency of his nature, and what a detestation he hath of evil,
          which is contrary to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It appears in the actual regeneration of the redeemed souls, and a
          carrying it on to a full perfection. As election is the effect of
          God’s sovereignty, our pardon the fruit of his mercy, our knowledge a
          stream from his wisdom, our strength an impression of his power; so
          our purity is a beam from his holiness. The whole work of
          sanctification, and the preservation of it, our Saviour begs for his
          disciples of his Father, under this title (John xvii. 11, 17): “Holy
          Father, keep them through thy own name,” and “sanctify them through
          thy truth;” as the proper source whence holiness was to flow to the
          creature: as the sun is the proper fountain whence light is derived,
          both to the stars above, and the bodies here below. Whence He is not
          only called Holy, but the Holy One of Israel (Isa. xliii. 15), “I am
          the Lord your Holy One, the Creator of Israel:” displaying his
          holiness in them, by a new creation of them as his Israel. As the
          rectitude of the creature at the first creation was the effect of his
          holiness, so the purity of the creature, by a new creation, is a
          draught of the same perfection. He is called the Holy One of Israel
          more in Isaiah, that evangelical prophet, in erecting Zion, and
          forming a people for himself, than in the whole Scripture besides. As
          he sent Jesus Christ to satisfy his justice for the expiation of the
          guilt of sin, so he sends the Holy Ghost for the cleansing of the
          filth of sin, and overmastering the power of it: Himself is the
          fountain, the Son is the pattern, and the Holy Ghost the immediate
          imprinter of this stamp of holiness upon the creature. God hath such a
          value for this attribute, that he designs the glory of this in the
          renewing the creature, more than the happiness of the creature; though
          the one doth necessarily follow upon the other, yet the one is the
          principal design, and the other the consequent of the former: whence
          our salvation is more frequently set forth, in Scripture, by a
          redemption from sin, and sanctification of the soul, than by a
          possession of heaven.908 Indeed, as God could not create a rational
          creature, without interesting this attribute in a special manner, so
          he cannot restore the fallen creature without it. As in creating a
          rational creature, there must be holiness to adorn it, as well as
          wisdom to form the design, and power to effect it; so in the
          restoration of the creature, as he could not make a reasonable
          creature unholy, so he cannot restore a fallen creature, and put him
          in a meet posture to take pleasure in him, without communicating to
          him a resemblance of himself. As God cannot be blessed in himself
          without this perfection of purity, so neither can a creature be
          blessed without it. As God would be unlovely to himself without this
          attribute, so would the creature be unlovely to God, without a stamp
          and mark of it upon his nature. So much is this perfection one with
          God, valued by him, and interested in all his works and ways!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third thing I am to do, is to lay down some proposition in
          the defence of God’s holiness in all his acts, about, or concerning
          sin. It was a prudent and pious advice of Camero, not to be too busy
          and rash in inquiries and conclusions about the reason of God’s
          providence in the matter of sin. The Scripture hath put a bar in the
          way of such curiosity, by telling us, that the ways of God’s wisdom
          and righteousness in his judgments are “unsearchable” (Rom. xi. 33):
          much more the ways of God’s holiness, as he stands in relation to sin,
          as a Governor of the world; we cannot consider those things without
          danger of slipping: our eyes are too weak to look upon the sun without
          being dazzled: too much curiosity met with a just check in our first
          parent. To be desirous to know the reason of all God’s proceedings in
          the matter of sin, is to second the ambition of Adam, to be as wise as
          God, and know the reason of his actings equally with himself. It is
          more easy, as the same author saith, to give an account of God’s
          providence since the revolt of man, and the poison that hath
          universally seized upon human nature, than to make guesses at the
          manner of the fall of the first man. The Scripture hath given us but a
          short account of the manner of it, to discourage too curious inquiries
          into it. It is certain that God made man upright; and when man sinned
          in paradise, God was active in sustaining the substantial nature and
          act of the sinner while he was sinning, though not in supporting the
          sinfulness of the act: he was permissive in suffering it: he was
          negative in withholding that grace which might certainly have
          prevented his crime, and consequently his ruin; though he withheld
          nothing that was sufficient for his resistance of that temptation
          wherewith he was assaulted. And since the fall of man, God, as a wise
          governor, is directive of the events of the transgression, and draws
          the choicest good out of the blackest evil, and limits the sins of
          men, that they creep not so far as the evil nature of men would urge
          them to; and as a righteous Judge, he takes away the talent from idle
          servants, and the light from wicked ones, whereby they stumble and
          fall into crimes, by the inclinations and proneness of their own
          corrupt natures, leaves them to the bias of their own vicious habits,
          denies that grace which they have forfeited, and have no right to
          challenge, and turns their sinful actions into punishments, both to
          the committers of them and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. God’s holiness is not chargeable with any blemish for his
          creating man in a mutable state. It is true, angels and men were
          created with a changeable nature; as though there was a rich and
          glorious stamp upon them by the hand of God, yet their natures were
          not incapable of a base and vile stamp from some other principle: as
          the silver which bears upon it the image of a great prince, is capable
          of being melted down, and imprinted with no better an image than that
          of some vile and monstrous beast. Though God made man upright, yet he
          was capable of seeking “many inventions” (Eccl. vii. 29); yet the hand
          of God was not defiled by forming man with such a nature. It was
          suitable to the wisdom of God to give the rational creature, whom he
          had furnished with a power of acting righteously, the liberty of
          choice, and not fix him in an unchangeable state without a trial of
          him in his natural; that if he did obey, his obedience might be the
          more valuable; and if he did freely offend, his offence might be more
          inexcusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. No creature can be capable of immutability by nature. Mutability is
          so essential to a creature, that a creature cannot be supposed without
          it; you must suppose it a Creator, not a creature, if you allow it to
          be of an immutable nature. Immutability is the property of the Supreme
          Being. God “only hath immortality” (1 Tim. vi. 16); immortality, as
          opposed not only to a natural, but to a sinful death; the word only
          appropriates every sort of immortality to God, and excludes every
          creature, whether angel or man, from a partnership with God in this by
          nature. Every creature, therefore, is capable of a death in sin. “None
          is good but God,” and none is naturally free from change but God,
          which excludes every creature from the same prerogative; and
          certainly, if one angel sinned, all might have sinned, because there
          was the same root of mutability in one as well as another. It is as
          possible for a creature to be a Creator, as for a creature to have
          naturally an incommunicable property of the Creator. All things,
          whether angels or men, are made of nothing, and therefore, capable of
          defection;909 because a creature being made of nothing, cannot be
          good, per essentiam, or essentially good, but by participation from
          another. Again, every rational creature, being made of nothing, hath a
          superior which created him and governs him, and is capable of a
          precept; and, consequently, capable of disobedience as well as
          obedience to the precept, to transgress it, as well as obey it. God
          cannot sin, because he can have no superior to impose a precept on
          him. A rational creature, with a liberty of will and power of choice,
          cannot be made by nature of such a mould and temper, but he must be as
          well capable of choosing wrong, as of choosing right; and, therefore,
          the standing angels, and glorified saints, though they are immutable,
          it is not by nature that they are so, but by grace, and the good
          pleasure of God; for though they are in heaven, they have still in
          their nature a remote power of sinning, but it shall never be brought
          into act, because God will always incline their wills to love him, and
          never concur with their wills to any evil act. Since, therefore,
          mutability is essential to a creature as a creature, this
          changeableness cannot properly be charged upon God as the author of
          it; for it was not the term of God’s creating act, but did necessarily
          result from the nature of the creature, as unchangeableness doth
          result from the essence of God. The brittleness of a glass is no blame
          to the art of him that blew up the glass into such a fashion; that
          imperfection of brittleness is not from the workman, but the matter;
          so, though unchangeableness be an imperfection, yet it is so necessary
          a one, that no creature can be naturally without it; besides, though
          angels and men were mutable by creation, and capable to exercise their
          wills, yet they were not necessitated to evil, and this mutability did
          not infer a necessity that they should fall, because some angels,
          which had the same root of changeableness in their natures with those
          that fell, did not fall, which they would have done, if capableness of
          changing, and necessity of changing, were one and the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though God made the creature mutable, yet he made him not evil.
          There could be nothing of evil in him that God created after his own
          image, and pronounced “good” (Gen. i. 27, 31). Man had an ability to
          stand, as well as a capacity to fall: he was created with a principal
          of acting freely, whereby he was capable of loving God as his chief
          good, and moving to him as his last end; there was a beam of light in
          man’s understanding to know the rule he was to conform to, a harmony
          between his reason and his affections, an original righteousness: so
          that it seemed more easy for him to determine his will to continue in
          obedience to the precept, than to swerve from it; to adhere to God as
          his chief good, than to listen to the charms of Satan. God created him
          with those advantages, that he might with more facility have kept his
          eyes fixed upon the Divine beauty, than turn his back upon it, and
          with greater ease have kept the precept God gave him, than have broken
          it. The very first thought darted, or impression made, by God, upon
          the angelical or human nature, was the knowledge of himself as their
          Author, and could be no more than such whereby both angels and men
          might be excited to a love of that adorable Being, that had framed
          them so gloriously out of nothing; and if they turned their wills and
          affections to another object it was not by the direction of God, but
          contrary to the impression God had made upon them, or the first
          thought he flashed into them. They turned themselves to the admiring
          their own excellency, or affecting an advantage distinct from that
          which they were to look for only from God (1 Tim. iii. 6). Pride was
          the cause of the condemnation of the devil. Though the wills of angels
          and men were created mutable, and so were imperfect, yet they were not
          created evil. Though they might sin, yet they might not sin, and,
          therefore, were not evil in their own nature. What reflection, then,
          could this mutability of their nature be upon God? So far is it from
          any, that he is fully cleared, by storing up in the nature of man
          sufficient provision against his departure from him. God was so far
          from creating him evil, that he fortified him with a knowledge in his
          understanding, and a strength in his nature to withstand any invasion.
          The knowledge was exercised by Eve, in the very moment of the
          serpent’s assaulting her (Gen. iii. 3); Eve said to the serpent, “God
          hath said, ye shall not eat of it:” and had her thoughts been intent
          upon this, “God hath said,” and not diverted to the motions of the
          sensitive appetite and liquorish palate, it had been sufficient to put
          by all the passes the devil did, or could have made at her. So that
          you see, though God made the creature mutable, yet he made him not
          evil. This clears the holiness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Therefore it follows, That though God created man changeable, yet
          he was not the cause of his change by his fall. Though man was created
          defectible, yet he was not determined by God influencing his will by
          any positive act to that change and apostasy. God placed him in a free
          posture, set life and happiness before him on the one hand, misery and
          death on the other; as he did not draw him into the arms of perpetual
          blessedness, so he did not drive him into the gulf of his misery.910
          He did not incline him to evil. It was repugnant to the goodness of
          God to corrupt the righteousness of those faculties he had so lately
          beautified him with. It was not likely he should deface the beauty of
          that work he had composed with so much wisdom and skill. Would he, by
          any act of his own, make that bad, which, but a little before, he had
          acquiesced in as good? Angels and men were left to their liberty and
          conduct of their natural faculties; and if God inspired them with any
          motions, they could not but be motions to good, and suited to that
          righteous nature he had endued them with. But it is most probable that
          God did not, in a supernatural way, act inwardly upon the mind of man,
          but left him wholly to that power, which he had, in creation,
          furnished him with. The Scripture frees God fully from any blame in
          this, and lays it wholly upon Satan, as the tempter, and upon man, as
          the determiner of his own will (Gen. iii. 6); Eve “took of the fruit,
          and did eat;” and Adam took from her of the fruit, “and did eat.” And
          Solomon (Eccles. vii. 29) distinguisheth God’s work in the creation of
          man “upright,” from man’s work in seeking out those ruining
          inventions. God created man in a righteous state, and man cast himself
          into a forlorn state. As he was a mutable creature, he was from God;
          as he was a changed and corrupted creature, it was from the devil
          seducing, and his own pliableness in admitting. As silver, and gold,
          and other metals, were created by God in such a form and figure, yet
          capable of receiving other forms by the industrious art of man; when
          the image of a man is put upon a piece of metal, God is not said to
          create that image, though he created the substance with such a
          property, that it was capable of receiving it; this capacity is from
          the nature of the metal by God’s creation of it, but the carving the
          figure of this or that man is not the act of God, but the act of man.
          As images, in Scripture, are called the work of men’s hands, in regard
          of the imagery, though the matter, wood or stone, upon which the image
          was carved, was a work of God’s creative power. When an artificer
          frames an excellent instrument, and a musician exactly tunes it, and
          it comes out of their hands without a blemish, but capable to be
          untuned by some rude hand, or receive a crack by a sudden fall, if it
          meet with a disaster, is either the workman or musician to be blamed?
          The ruin of a house, caused by the wastefulness or carelessness of the
          tenant, is not to be imputed to the workman that built it strong, and
          left it in a good posture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. God’s holiness is not blemished by enjoining man a law,
          which he knew he would not observe.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The law was not above his strength. Had the law been impossible to
          be observed, no crime could have been imputed to the subject, the
          fault had lain wholly upon the Governor; the non‑observance of it had
          been from a want of strength, and not from a want of will. Had God
          commanded Adam to fly up to the sun, when he had not given him wings,
          Adam might have a will to obey it, but his power would be too short to
          perform it. But the law set him for a rule, had nothing of
          impossibility in it; it was easy to be observed; the command was
          rather below, than above his strength; and the sanction of it was more
          apt to restrain and scare him from the breach of it, than encourage
          any daring attempts against it; he had as much power, or rather more,
          to conform to it, than to warp from it; and greater arguments and
          interest to be observant of it, than to violate it; his all was
          secured by the one, and his ruin ascertained by the other. The
          commands of God are not grievous (1 John v. 3); from the first to the
          last command, there is nothing impossible, nothing hard to the
          original and created nature of man, which were all summed up in a love
          to God, which was the pleasure and delight of man, as well as his
          duty, if he had not, by inconsiderateness, neglected the dictates and
          resolves of his own understanding. The law was suited to the strength
          of man, and fitted for the improvement and perfection of his nature;
          in which respect, the apostle calls it “good,” as it refers to man, as
          well as “holy,” as it refers to God (Rom. vii. 12). Now, since God
          created man a creature capable to be governed by a law, and as a
          rational creature endued with understanding and will, not to be
          governed, according to his nature, without a law; was it congruous to
          the wisdom of God to respect only the future state of man, which, from
          the depth of his infinite knowledge, he did infallibly foresee would
          be miserable, by the wilful defection of man from the rule? Had it
          been agreeable to the wisdom of God, to respect only this future
          state, and not the present state of the creature; and therefore leave
          him lawless, because he knew he would violate the law? Should God
          forbear to act like a wise governor, because he saw that man would
          cease to act like an obedient subject? Shall a righteous magistrate
          forbear to make just and good laws, because he foresees, either from
          the dispositions of his subjects, their ill‑humor, or some
          circumstances which will intervene, that multitudes of them will
          incline to break those laws, and fall under the penalty of them? No
          blame can be upon that magistrate who minds the rule of righteousness,
          and the necessary duty of his government, since he is not the cause of
          those turbulent affections of men, which he wisely foresees will rise
          up against his just edicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though the law now be above the strength of man, yet is not the
          holiness of God blemished by keeping it up. It is true, God hath been
          graciously pleased to mitigate the severity and rigor of the law, by
          the entrance of the gospel; yet where men refuse the terms of the
          gospel, they continue themselves under the condemnation of the law,
          and are justly guilty of the breach of it, though they have no
          strength to observe it. The law, as I said before, was not above man’s
          strength, when he was possessed of original righteousness, though it
          be above man’s strength, since he was stripped of original
          righteousness. The command was dated before man had contracted his
          impotency, when he had a power to keep it as well as to break it. Had
          it been enjoined to man only after the fall, and not before, he might
          have had a better pretence to excuse himself, because of the
          impossibility of it; yet he would not have had sufficient excuse,
          since the impossibility did not result from the nature of the law, but
          from the corrupted nature of the creature. It was “weak through the
          flesh” (Rom. viii. 3), but it was promulged when man had a strength
          proportioned to the commands of it. And now, since man hath unhappily
          made himself incapable of obeying it, must God’s holiness in his law
          be blemished for enjoining it? Must he abrogate those commands, and
          prohibit what before he enjoined, for the satisfaction of the
          corrupted creature? Would not this be his “ceasing to be holy,” that
          his creature might be unblameably unrighteous? Must God strip himself
          of his holiness, because man will not discharge his iniquity? He
          cannot be the cause of sin, by keeping up the law, who would be the
          cause of all the unrighteousness of men, by removing the authority of
          it. Some things in the law that are intrinsically good in their own
          nature, are indispensable, and it is repugnant to the nature of God
          not to command them. If he were not the guardian of his indispensable
          law, he would be the cause and countenancer of the creatures’
          iniquity. So little reason have men to charge God with being the cause
          of their sin, by not repealing his law to gratify their impotence,
          that he would be unholy if he did. God must not lose his purity,
          because man hath lost his, and cast away the right of his sovereignty,
          because man hath cast away his power of obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God’s foreknowledge that his law would not be observed, lays no
          blame upon him. Though the foreknowledge of God be infallible, yet it
          doth not necessitate the creature in acting. It was certain from
          eternity, that Adam would fall, that men would do such and such
          actions, that Judas would betray our Saviour; God foreknew all those
          things from eternity; but, it is as certain that this foreknowledge
          did not necessitate the will of Adam, or any other branch of his
          posterity, in the doing those actions that were so foreseen by God;
          they voluntarily run into such courses, not by any impulsion. God’s
          knowledge was not suspended between certainty and uncertainty; he
          certainly foreknew that his law would be broken by Adam; he foreknew
          it in his own decree of not hindering him, by giving Adam the
          efficacious grace which would infallibly have prevented it; yet Adam
          did freely break this law, and never imagined that the foreknowledge
          of God did necessitate him to it; he could find no cause of his own
          sin, but the liberty of his own will; he charges the occasion of his
          sin upon the woman, and consequently upon God in giving the woman to
          him (Gen. iii. 12). He could not be so ignorant of the nature of God,
          as to imagine him without a foresight of future things: since his
          knowledge of what was to be known of God by creation, was greater than
          any man’s since, in all probability. But, however, if he were not
          acquainted with the notion of God’s foreknowledge, he could not be
          ignorant of his own act; there could not have been any necessity upon
          him, any kind of constraint of him in his action, that could have been
          unknown to him; and he would not have omitted a plea of so strong a
          nature, when he was upon his trial for life or death; especially when
          he urgeth so weak an argument, to impute his crime to God, as the gift
          of the woman; as if that which was designed him for a help, were
          intended for his ruin. If God’s prescience takes away the liberty of
          the creature, there is no such thing as a free action in the world
          (for there is nothing done but is foreknown by God, else we render God
          of a limited understanding), nor ever was, no, not by God himself, ad
          extra; for whatsoever he hath done in creation, whatsoever he hath
          done since the creation, was foreknown by him: he resolved to do it,
          and, therefore, foreknew that he would do it. Did God do it,
          therefore, necessarily, as necessity is opposed to liberty? As he
          freely decrees what he will do, so he effects what he freely decreed.
          Foreknowledge is so far from intrenching upon the liberty of the will,
          that predetermination, which in the notion of it speaks something
          more, doth not dissolve it; God did not only foreknow, but determine
          the suffering of Christ (Acts iv. 27, 28). It was necessary,
          therefore, that Christ should suffer, that God might not be mistaken
          in his foreknowledge, or come short of his determinate decree; but did
          this take away the liberty of Christ in suffering? (Eph. v. 2): “Who
          offered himself up to God;” that is, by a voluntary act, as well as
          designed to do it by a determinate counsel. It did infallibly secure
          the event, but did not annihilate the liberty of the action, either in
          Christ’s willingness to suffer, or the crime of the Jews that made him
          suffer. God’s prescience is God’s provision of things arising from
          their proper causes; as a gardener foresees in his plants the leaves
          and the flowers that will arise from them in the spring, because he
          knows the strength and nature of their several roots which lie under
          ground; but his foresight of these things is not the cause of the rise
          and appearance of those flowers. If any of us see a ship moving
          towards such a rock or quicksand, and know it to be governed by a
          negligent pilot, we shall certainly foresee that the ship will be torn
          in pieces by the rock, or swallowed up by the sands; but is this
          foresight of ours from the causes, any cause of the effect; or can we
          from hence be said to be the authors of the miscarriage of the ship,
          and the loss of the passengers and goods? The fall of Adam was
          foreseen by God to come to pass by the consent of his free will, in
          the choice of the proposed temptation. God foreknew Adam would sin,
          and if Adam would not have sinned, God would have foreknown that he
          would not sin. Adam might easily have detected the serpent’s fraud,
          and made a better election; God foresaw that he would not do it; God’s
          foreknowledge did not make Adam guilty or innocent: whether God had
          foreknown it or no, he was guilty by a free choice, and a willing
          neglect of his own duty. Adam knew that God foreknew that he might eat
          of the fruit, and fall and die, because God had forbidden him; the
          foreknowledge that he would do it, was no more a cause of his action,
          than the foreknowledge that he might do it. Judas certainly knew that
          his Master foreknew that he would betray him, for Christ had
          acquainted him with it (John xiii. 21, 26); yet he never charged this
          foreknowledge of Christ with any guilt of his treachery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. III. The holiness of God is not blemished by decreeing the
          eternal rejection of some men. Reprobation, in its first notion, is an
          act of preterition, or passing by. A man is not made wicked by the act
          of God; but it supposeth him wicked; and so it is nothing else but
          God’s leaving a man in that guilt and filth wherein he beholds him. In
          its second notion, it is an ordination, not to a crime, but to a
          punishment (Jude 4): “an ordaining to condemnation.” And though it be
          an eternal act of God, yet, in order of nature, it follows upon the
          foresight of the transgression of man, and supposeth the crime. God
          considers Adam’s revolt, and views the whole mass of his corrupted
          posterity, and chooses some to reduce to himself by his grace, and
          leaves others to lie sinking in their ruins. Since all mankind fell by
          the fall of Adam, and have corruption conveyed to them successively by
          that root, whereof they are branches; all men might justly be left
          wallowing in that miserable condition to which they are reduced by the
          apostasy of their common head; and God might have passed by the whole
          race of man, as well as he did the fallen angels, without any hope of
          redemption. He was no more bound to restore man, than to restore
          devils, nor bound to repair the nature of any one son of Adam; and had
          he dealt with men as he dealt with the devils, they had had, all of
          them, as little just ground to complain of God; for all men deserved
          to be left to themselves, for all were concluded under sin; but God
          calls out some to make monuments of his grace, which is an act of the
          sovereign mercy of that dominion, whereby “he hath mercy on whom he
          will have mercy” (Rom. ix. 18); others he passes by, and leaves them
          remaining in that corruption of nature wherein they were born. If men
          have a power to dispose of their own goods, without any
          unrighteousness, why should not God dispose of his own grace, and
          bestow it upon whom he pleases; since it is a debt to none, but a free
          gift to any that enjoy it? God is not the cause of sin in this,
          because his operation about this is negative; it is not an action, but
          a denial of action, and therefore cannot be the cause of the evil
          actions of men.911 God acts nothing, but withholds his power; he doth
          not enlighten their minds, nor incline their wills so powerfully, as
          to expel their darkness, and root out those evil habits which possess
          them by nature. God could, if he would, savingly enlighten the minds
          of all men in the world, and quicken their hearts with a new life by
          an invincible grace; but in not doing it, there is no positive act of
          God, but a cessation of action. We may with as much reason say, that
          God is the cause of all the sinful actions that are committed by the
          corporation of devils, since their first rebellion, because he leaves
          them to themselves, and bestows not a new grace upon them,—as say, God
          is the cause of the sins of those that he overlooks and leaves in that
          state of guilt wherein he found them. God did not pass by any without
          the consideration of sin; so that this act of God is not repugnant to
          his holiness, but conformable to his justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. IV. The holiness of God is not blemished by his secret will to
          suffer sin to enter into the world. God never willed sin by his
          preceptive will. It was never founded upon, or produced by any word of
          his, as the creation was. He never said, Let there be sin under the
          heaven, as he said, “Let there be water under the heaven.” Nor doth he
          will it by infusing any habit of it, or stirring up inclinations to
          it; no, “God tempts no man” (James i. 13). Nor doth he will it by his
          approving will; it is detestable to him, nor ever can he be otherwise;
          he cannot approve it either before commission or after.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The will of God is in some sort concurrent with sin. He doth not
          properly will it, but he wills not to hinder it, to which, by his
          omnipotence, he could put a bar. If he did positively will it, it
          might be wrought by himself, and so could not be evil. If he did in no
          sort will it, it would not be committed by his creature; sin entered
          into the world, either God willing the permission of it, or not
          willing the permission of it. The latter cannot be said; for then the
          creature is more powerful than God, and can do that which God will not
          permit. God can, if he be pleased, banish all sin in a moment out of
          the world: he could have prevented the revolt of angels, and the fall
          of man; they did not sin whether he would or no: he might, by his
          grace, have stepped in the first moment, and made a special impression
          upon them of the happiness they already possessed, and the misery they
          would incur by any wicked attempt. He could as well have prevented the
          sin of the fallen angels, and confirmed them in grace, as of those
          that continued in their happy state: he might have appeared to man,
          informed him of the issue of his design, and made secret impressions
          upon his heart, since he was acquainted with every avenue to his will.
          God could have kept all sin out of the world, as well as all creatures
          from breathing in it; he was as well able to bar sin forever out of
          the world, as to let creatures lie in the womb of nothing, wherein
          they were first wrapped. To say God doth will sin as he doth other
          things, is to deny his holiness; to say it entered without anything of
          his will, is to deny his omnipotence. If he did necessitate Adam to
          fall, what shall we think of his purity? If Adam did fall without any
          concern of God’s will in it, what shall we say of his sovereignty? The
          one taints his holiness, and the other clips his power. If it came
          without anything of his will in it, and he did not foresee it, where
          is his omniscience? If it entered whether he would or no, where is his
          omnipotence (Rom. ix. 19)? “Who hath resisted his will?” There cannot
          be a lustful act in Abimelech, if God will withhold his power (Gen.
          xx. 6); “I withheld thee:” nor a cursing word in Balaam’s mouth,
          unless God give power to speak it (Numb. xxii. 38): “Have I now any
          power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that
          shall I speak.” As no action could be sinful, if God had not forbidden
          it; so no sin could be committed, if God did not will to give way to
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God doth not will directly, and by an efficacious will. He doth not
          directly will it, because he hath prohibited it by his law, which is a
          discovery of his will: so that if he should directly will sin, and
          directly prohibit it, he would will good and evil in the same manner,
          and there would be contradictions in God’s will: to will sin
          absolutely, is to work it (Ps. cxv. 3): “God hath done whatsoever he
          pleased.” God cannot absolutely will it, because he cannot work it.
          God wills good by a positive decree, because he hath decreed to effect
          it.912 He wills evil by a private decree, because he hath decreed not
          to give that grace which would certainly prevent it. God doth not will
          sin simply, for that were to approve it, but he wills it, in order to
          that good his wisdom will bring forth from it.913 He wills not sin for
          itself, but for the event. To will sin as sin, or as purely evil, is
          not in the capacity of a creature, neither of man nor devil. The will
          of a rational creature cannot will anything but under the appearance
          of good, of some good in the sin itself, or some good in the issue of
          it. Much more is this far from God, who, being infinitely good, cannot
          will evil as evil; and being infinitely knowing, cannot will that for
          good which is evil.914 Infinite wisdom can be under no error or
          mistake: to will sin as sin, would be an unanswerable blemish on God;
          but to will to suffer it in order to good, is the glory of his wisdom;
          it could never have peeped up its head, unless there had been some
          decree of God concerning it. And there had been no decree of God
          concerning it, had he not intended to bring good and glory out of it.
          If God did directly will the discovery of his grace and mercy to the
          world, he did in some sort will sin, as that without which there could
          not have been any appearance of mercy in the world; for an innocent
          creature is not the object of mercy, but a miserable creature: and no
          rational creature but must be sinful before it be miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God wills the permission of sin. He doth not positively will sin,
          but he positively wills to permit it. And though he doth not approve
          of sin, yet he approves of that act of his will, whereby he permits
          it. For since that sin could not enter into the world without some
          concern of God’s will about it, that act of his will that gave way to
          it, could not be displeasing to him: God could never be displeased
          with his own act: “He is not as man, that he should repent” (1 Sam.
          xv. 29). What God cannot repent of, he cannot but approve of: it is
          contrary to the blessedness of God to disapprove of, and be displeased
          with any act of his own will. If he hated any act of his own will, he
          would hate himself, he would be under a torture: every one that hates
          his own acts, is under some disturbance and torment for them. That
          which is permitted by him, is in itself, and in regard of the evil of
          it, hateful to him: but as the prospect of that good which he aims at
          in the permission of it is pleasing to him, so that act of his will,
          whereby he permits it, is ushered in by an approving act of his
          understanding. Either God approved of the permission, or not; if he
          did not approve his own act of permission, he could not have decreed
          an act of permission. It is inconceivable that God should decree such
          an act which he detested, and positively will that which he hated.
          Though God hated sin, as being against his holiness, yet he did not
          hate the permission of sin, as being subservient by the immensity of
          his wisdom to his own glory. He could never be displeased with that
          which was the result of his eternal counsel, as this decree of
          permitting sin was, as well as any other decree, resolved upon in his
          own breast. For as God acts nothing in time, but what he decreed from
          eternity, so he permits nothing in time but what he decreed from
          eternity to permit. To speak properly, therefore, God doth not will
          sin, but he wills the permission of it, and this will to permit is
          active and positive in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This act of permission is not a mere and naked permission, but such
          an one as is attended with a certainty of the event. The decrees of
          God to make use of the sin of man for the glory of his grace in the
          mission and passion of his Son, hung upon this entrance of sin. Would
          it consist with the wisdom of God to decree such great and stupendous
          things, the event whereof should depend upon an uncertain foundation
          which he might be mistaken in? God would have sat in counsel from
          eternity to no purpose, if he had only permitted those things to be
          done, without any knowledge of the event of this permission. God would
          not have made such provision for redemption to no purpose, or an
          uncertain purpose, which would have been, if man had not fallen; or if
          it had been an uncertainty with God whether he would fall or no.
          Though the will of God about sin was permissive, yet the will of God
          about that glory he would promote by the defect of the creature, was
          positive; and, therefore, he would not suffer so many positive acts of
          his will to hang upon an uncertain event; and, therefore, he did
          wisely and righteously order all things to the accomplishment of his
          great and gracious purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This act of permission doth not taint the holiness of God. That
          there is such an act as permission, is clear in Scripture (Acts xiv.
          16): “Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
          ways.” But that it doth not blemish the holiness of God, will appear,
        </p>
        <p>1st. From the nature of this permission.</p>
        <p>
          1. It is not a moral permission, a giving liberty of toleration by any
          law to commit sin with impunity; when, what one law did forbid,
          another law doth leave indifferent to be done or not, as a man sees
          good in himself. As when there is a law made among men, that no man
          shall go out of such a city or country without license; to go out
          without license is a crime by the law; but when that law is repealed
          by another, that gives liberty for men to go and come at their
          pleasure, it doth not make their going or coming necessary, but leaves
          those which were before bound, to do as they see good in themselves.
          Such a permission makes a fact lawful, though not necessary; a man is
          not obliged to do it, but he is left to his own discretion to do as he
          pleases, without being chargeable with a crime for doing it. Such a
          permission there was granted by God to Adam of eating of the fruits of
          the garden, to choose any of them for food, except the tree of
          “knowledge of good and evil.” It was a precept to him, not to “eat of
          the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil;” but the other
          was a permission, whereby it was lawful for him to feed upon any other
          that was most agreeable to his appetite: but there is not such a
          permission in the case of sin; this had been an indulgence of it,
          which had freed man from any crime, and, consequently, from
          punishment; because, by such a permission by law, he would have had
          authority to sin if he pleased. God did not remove the law, which he
          had before placed as a bar against evil, nor ceased that moral
          impediment of his threatening: such a permission as this, to make sin
          lawful or indifferent, had been a blot upon God’s holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But this permission of God, in the case of sin, is no more than the
          not hindering a sinful action, which he could have prevented. It is
          not so much an action of God, as a suspension of his influence, which
          might have hindered an evil act, and a forbearing to restrain the
          faculties of man from sin; it is, properly, the not exerting that
          efficacy which might change the counsels that are taken, and prevent
          the action intended; as when one man sees another ready to fall, and
          can preserve him from falling by reaching out his hand, he permits him
          to fall, that is, he hinders him not from falling. So God describes
          his act about Abimelech (Gen. xx. 6); “I withheld thee from sinning
          against me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.” If Abimelech
          had sinned, he had sinned by God’s permission; that is, by God’s not
          hindering, or not restraining him by making any impressions upon him.
          So that permission is only a withholding that help and grace, which,
          if bestowed, would have been an effectual remedy to prevent a crime;
          and it is rather a suspension, or cessation, than properly a
          permission, and sin may be said to be committed, not without God’s
          permission, rather than by his permission. Thus, in the fall of man,
          God did not hold the reins strict upon Satan, to restrain him from
          laying the bait, nor restrain Adam from swallowing the bait: he kept
          to himself that efficacious grace which he might have darted out upon
          man to prevent his fall. God left Satan to his malice of tempting, and
          Adam to his liberty of resisting, and his own strength, to use that
          sufficient grace he had furnished him with, whereby he might have
          resisted and overcome the temptation. As he did not drive man to it,
          so he did not secretly restrain him from it. So, in the Jews
          crucifying our Saviour, God did not imprint upon their minds, by his
          Spirit, a consideration of the greatness of the crime, and the horror
          of his justice due to it; and, being without those impediments, they
          run furiously, of their own accord, to the commission of that evil;
          as, when a man lets a wolf or dog out upon his prey, he takes off the
          chain which held them, and they presently act according to their
          natures.915 In the fall of angels and men, God’s act was leaving them
          to their own strength; in sins after the fall, it is God’s giving them
          up to their own corruption; the first is a pure suspension of grace;
          the other hath the nature of a punishment (Ps. lxxxi. 12): “So I gave
          them up to their own hearts’ lusts.” The first object of this
          permissive will of God was to leave angels and men to their liberty,
          and the use of their free will, which was natural to them,916 not
          adding that supernatural grace which was necessary, not that they
          should not at all sin, but that they should infallibly not sin: they
          had a strength sufficient to avoid sin, but not sufficient infallibly
          to avoid sin; a grace sufficient to preserve them, but not sufficient
          to confirm them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now this permission is not the cause of sin, nor doth blemish the
          holiness of God. It doth not intrench upon the freedom of men, but
          supposeth it, establisheth it, and leaves man to it. God acted
          nothing, but only ceased to act; and therefore could not be the
          efficient cause of man’s sin. As God is not the author of good, but by
          willing and effecting it, so he is not the author of evil, but by
          willing and effecting it: but he doth not positively will evil, nor
          effect it by any efficacy of his own. Permission is no action, nor the
          cause of that action which is permitted; but the will of that person
          who is permitted to do such an action is the cause.917 God can no more
          be said to be the cause of sin, by suffering a creature to act as it
          will, than he can be said to be the cause of the not being of any
          creature, by denying it being, and letting it remain nothing; it is
          not from God that it is nothing, it is nothing in itself. Though God
          be said to be the cause of creation, yet he is never by any said to be
          the cause of that nothing which was before creation. This permission
          of God is not the cause of sin, but the cause of not hindering sin.
          Man and angels had a physical power of sinning from God, as they were
          created with freewill, and supported in their natural strength; but
          the moral power to sin was not from God; he counselled them not to it,
          laid no obligation upon them to use their natural power for such an
          end; he only left them to their freedom, and not hindered them in
          their acting what he was resolved to permit.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. The holiness of God is not tainted by this, because he was under
          no obligation to hinder their commission of sin. Ceasing to act,
          whereby to prevent a crime or mischief, brings not a person permitting
          it under guilt, unless where he is under an obligation to prevent it;
          but God, in regard of his absolute dominion, cannot be charged with
          any such obligation. One man, that doth not hinder the murder of
          another, when it is in his power, is guilty of the murder in part;
          but, it is to be considered, that he is under a tie by nature, as
          being of the same kind, and being the other’s brother, by a communion
          of blood, also under an obligation of the law of charity, enacted by
          the common Sovereign of the world: but what tie was there upon God,
          since the infinite transcendancy of his nature, and his sovereign
          dominion, frees him from any such obligation (Job ix. 12)? “If he
          takes away, who shall say, What dost thou?” God might have prevented
          the fall of men and angels; he might have confirmed them all in a
          state of perpetual innocency; but where is the obligation? He had made
          the creature a debtor to himself, but he owed nothing to the creature.
          Before God can be charged with any guilt in this case, it must be
          proved, not only that he could, but that he was bound to hinder it. No
          person can be justly charged with another’s fault, merely for not
          preventing it, unless he be bound to prevent it; else, not only the
          first sin of angels and man would be imputed to God, as the Author,
          but all the sins of men. He could not be obliged by any law, because
          he had no superior to impose any law upon him; and it will be hard to
          prove that he was obliged, from his own nature, to prevent the
          entrance of sin, which he would use as an occasion to declare his own
          holiness, so transcendent a perfection of his nature, more than ever
          it could have been manifested by a total exclusion of it, viz. in the
          death of Christ. He is no more bound, in his own nature, to preserve,
          by supernatural grace, his creature from falling, after he had framed
          him with a sufficient strength to stand, than he was obliged, in his
          own nature, to bring his creature into being when it was nothing. He
          is not bound to create a rational creature, much less bound to create
          him with supernatural gifts; though, since God would make a rational
          creature, he could not but make him with a natural uprightness and
          rectitude. God did as much for angels and men as became a wise
          governor: he had published his law, backed it with severe penalties,
          and the creature wanted not a natural strength to observe and obey it.
          Had not man power to obey all the precepts of the law, as well as one?
          How was God bound to give him more grace, since what he had already
          was enough to shield him, and keep up his resistance against all the
          power of hell? It had been enough to have pointed his will against the
          temptation, and he had kept off the force of it. Was there any promise
          past to Adam of any further grace which he could plead as a tie upon
          God? No such voluntary limit upon God’s supreme dominion appears upon
          record. Was anything due to man which he had not? anything promised
          him which was not performed? What action of debt, then, can the
          creature bring against God? Indeed, when man began to neglect the
          light of his own reason, and became inconsiderate of the precept, God
          might have enlightened his understanding by a special flash, a
          supernatural beam, and imprinted upon him a particular consideration
          of the necessity of his obedience, the misery he was approaching to by
          his sin, the folly of any apprehension of an equality in knowledge; he
          might have convinced him of the falsity of the serpent’s arguments,
          and uncased to him the venom that lay under those baits. But how doth
          it appear that God was bound to those additional acts when he had
          already lighted up in him a “spirit, which was the candle of the Lord”
          (Prov. xx. 27), whereby he was able to discern all, if he had attended
          to it. It was enough that God did not necessitate man to sin, did not
          counsel him to it; that he had given him sufficient warning in the
          threatening, and sufficient strength in his faculties, to fortify him
          against temptation. He gave him what was due to him as a creature of
          his own framing; he withdrew no help from him, that was due to him as
          a creature, and what was not due he was not bound to impart. Man did
          not beg preserving grace of God, and God was not bound to offer it,
          when he was not petitioned for it especially: yet if he had begged it,
          God having before furnished him sufficiently, might, by the right of
          his sovereign dominion, have denied it without any impeachment of his
          holiness and righteousness. Though he would not in such a case have
          dealt so bountifully with his creature as he might have done, yet he
          could not have been impleaded, as dealing unrighteously with his
          creature. The single word that God had already uttered, when he gave
          him his precept, was enough to oppose against all the devil’s wiles,
          which tended to invalidate that word: the understanding of man could
          not imagine that the word of God was vainly spoken; and the very
          suggestion of the devil, as if the Creator should envy his creature,
          would have appeared ridiculous, if he had attended to the voice of his
          own reason. God had done enough for him, and was obliged to do no
          more, and dealt not unrighteously in leaving him to act according to
          the principles of his nature. To conclude, if God’s permission of sin
          were enough to charge it upon God, or if God had been obliged to give
          Adam supernatural grace, Adam, that had so capacious a brain, could
          not be without that plea in his mouth, “Lord thou mightest have
          prevented it; the commission of it by me could not have been without
          thy permission of it:” or, “Thou hast been wanting to me, as the
          author of my nature.” No such plea is brought by Adam into the court,
          when God tried and cast him; no such pleas can have any strength in
          them. Adam had reason enough to know, that there was sufficient reason
          to overrule such a plea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the permission of sin casts no dirt upon the holiness of God, as
          I think hath been cleared, we may under this head consider two things
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That God’s permission of sin is not so much as his restraint or
          limitation of it. Since the entrance of the first sin into the world
          by Adam, God is more a hinderer than a permitter of it. If he hath
          permitted that which he could have prevented, he prevents a world
          more, that he might, if he pleased, permit: the hedges about sin are
          larger than the outlets; they are but a few streams that glide about
          the world, in comparison of that mighty torrent he dams up both in men
          and devils. He that understands what a lake of Sodom is in every man’s
          nature, since the universal infection of human nature, as the apostle
          describes it (Rom. iii. 9, 10, &amp;c.), must acknowledge, that if God
          should cast the reins upon the necks of sinful men, they would run
          into thousands of abominable crimes, more than they do: the impression
          of all natural laws would be rased out, the world would be a public
          stew, and a more bloody slaughter house; human society would sink into
          a chaos; no starlight of commendable morality would be seen in it; the
          world would be no longer an earth, but an hell, and have lain deeper
          in wickedness than it doth. If God did not limit sin, as he doth the
          sea, and put bars to the waves of the heart, as well as those of the
          waters, and say of them, “Hitherto you shall go, and no further;” man
          hath such a furious ocean in him, as would overflow the banks; and
          where it makes a breach in one place, it would in a thousand, if God
          should suffer it to act according to its impetuous current. As the
          devil hath lust enough to destroy all mankind, if God did not bridle
          him; deal with every man as he did with Job, ruin their comforts, and
          deform their bodies with scabs; infect religion with a thousand more
          errors; fling disorders into commonwealths, and make them as a fiery
          furnace, full of nothing but flame; if he were not chained by that
          powerful arm, that might let him loose to fulfil his malicious fury;
          what rapines, murders, thefts, would be committed, if he did not stint
          him! Abimelech would not only lust after Sarah, but deflour her; Laban
          not only pursue Jacob, but rifle him; Saul not only hate David, but
          murder him; David not only threaten Nabal, but root him up, and his
          family, did not God girdle in the wrath of man:918 a greater remainder
          of wrath is pent in, than flames out, which yet swells for an outlet.
          God may be concluded more holy in preventing men’s sins, than the
          author of sin in permitting some; since, were it not for his
          restraints by the pull‑back of conscience, and infused motions and
          outward impediments, the world would swarm more with this cursed
          brood.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His permission of sin is in order to his own glory, and a greater
          good. It is no reflection upon the Divine goodness to leave man to his
          own conduct, whereby such a deformity as sin sets foot in the world;
          since he makes his wisdom illustrious in bringing good out of evil,
          and a good greater than that evil he suffered to spring up.919 God did
          not permit sin, as sin, or permit it barely for itself. As sin is not
          lovely in its own nature, so neither is the permission of sin
          intrinsically good or amiable for itself, but for those ends aimed at
          in the permission of it. God permitted sin, but approved not of the
          object of that permission, sin; because that, considered in its own
          nature, is solely evil: nor can we think that God could approve of the
          act of permission, considered only in itself as an act; but as it
          respected that event which his wisdom would order by it. We cannot
          suppose that God should permit sin, but for some great and glorious
          end: for it is the manifestation of his own glorious perfections he
          intends in all the acts of his will (Prov. xvi. 4), “The Lord hath
          made all things for himself”—פעל hath wrought all things; which is not
          only his act of creation, but ordination: “for himself,” that is, for
          the discovery of the excellency of his nature, and the communication
          of himself to his creature. Sin indeed, in its own nature, hath no
          tendency to a good end; the womb of it teems with nothing but
          monsters; it is a spurn at God’s sovereignty, and a slight of his
          goodness: it both deforms and torments the person that acts it; it is
          black and abominable, and hath not a mite of goodness in the nature of
          it. If it ends in any good, it is only from that Infinite
          transcendency of skill, that can bring good out of evil, as well as
          light out of darkness. Therefore God did not permit it as sin, but as
          it was an occasion for the manifestation of his own glory. Though the
          goodness of God would have appeared in the preservation of the world,
          as well as it did in the creation of it, yet his mercy could not have
          appeared without the entrance of sin, because the object of mercy is a
          miserable creature; but man could not be miserable as long as he
          remained innocent. The reign of sin opened a door for the reign and
          triumph of grace (Rom. v. 21), “As sin hath reigned unto death, so
          might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life;” without it,
          the bowels of mercy had never sounded, and the ravishing music of
          Divine grace could never have been heard by the creature. Mercy, which
          renders God so amiable, could never else have beamed out to the world.
          Angels and men upon this occasion beheld the stirrings of Divine
          grace, and the tenderness of Divine nature, and the glory of the
          Divine persons in their several functions about the redemption of man,
          which had else been a spring shut up, and a fountain sealed; the song
          of glory to God, and good will to men in a way of redemption had never
          been sung by them. It appears in his dealing with Adam, that he
          permitted his fall, not only to show his justice in punishing, but
          principally his mercy in rescuing; since he proclaims to him first the
          promise of a Redeemer to “bruise the serpent’s head,” before he
          settled the punishment he should smart under in the world (Gen. iii.
          15‒17). And what fairer prospect could the creature have of the
          holiness of God, and his hatred of sin, than in the edge of that sword
          of justice, which punished it in the sinner; but glittered more in the
          punishment of a Surety so near allied to him? Had not man been
          criminal, he could not have been punishable, nor any been punishable
          for him: and the pulse of Divine holiness could not have beaten so
          quick, and been so visible, without an exercise of his vindicative
          justice. He left man’s mutable nature, to fall under righteousness,
          that thereby he might commend the righteousness of his own nature
          (Rom. iii. 7). Adam’s sin in its nature tended to the ruin of the
          world, and God takes an occasion from it for the glory of his grace in
          the redemption of the world; he brings forth thereby a new scene of
          wonders from heaven, and a surprising knowledge on earth; as the sun
          breaks out more strongly after a night of darkness and tempest. As God
          in creation framed a chaos by his power, to manifest his wisdom in
          bringing order out of disorder, light out of darkness, beauty out of
          confusion and deformity, when he was able by a word to have made all
          creatures stand up in their beauty, without the precedency of a chaos;
          so God permitted a moral chaos to manifest a greater wisdom in the
          repairing a broken image, and restoring a deplorable creature, and
          bringing out those perfections of his nature, which had else been
          wrapt up in a perpetual silence in his own bosom. It was therefore
          very congruous to the holiness of God to permit that which he could
          make subservient for his own glory, and particularly for the
          manifestation of this attribute of holiness, which seems to be in
          opposition to such a permission.920
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. V. The holiness of God is not blemished by his concurrence with
          the creature in the material part of a sinful act. Some to free God
          from having any hand in sin, deny his concurrence to the actions of
          the creature; because, if he concurs to a sinful action, he concurs to
          the sin also: not understanding how there can be a distinction between
          the act, and the sinfulness or viciousness of it; and how God can
          concur to a natural action, without being stained by that moral evil
          which cleaves to it. For the understanding of this, observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is a concurrence of God to all the acts of the creature (Acts
          xvii. 28); “in him we live, and move, and have our being.” We depend
          upon God in our acting as well as in our being: there is as much an
          efficacy of God in our motion as in our production; as none have life
          without his power in producing it, so none have any operation without
          his providence concurring with it. In him, or by him, that is, by his
          virtue preserving and governing our motions, as well as by his power
          bringing us into being. Hence man is compared to an axe (Isa. x. 15),
          an instrument that hath no action, without the co‑operation of a
          superior agent handling it: and the actions of the second causes are
          ascribed to God; the grass, that is, the product of the sun, rain, and
          earth, he is said to make to grow upon the mountains (Ps. cxlvii. 8);
          and the skin and flesh, which is by natural generation, he is said to
          clothe us with (Job x. 5), in regard of his co‑working with second
          causes, according to their natures. As nothing can exist, so nothing
          can operate without him; let his concurrence be removed, and the being
          and action of the creature cease; remove the sun from the horizon, or
          a candle from a room, and the light which flowed from either of them
          ceaseth. Without God’s preserving and concurring power, the course of
          nature would sink, and the creation be in vain. All created things
          depend upon God as agents, as well as beings, and are subordinate to
          him in a way of action, as well as in a way of existing.921 If God
          suspend his influence from their action, they would cease to act, as
          the fire did from burning the three children, as well as if God
          suspend his influence from their being, they would cease to be. God
          supports the nature whereby actions are wrought, the mind where
          actions are consulted, and the will where actions are determined, and
          the motive‑power whereby actions are produced. The mind could not
          contrive, nor the hand act, a wickedness, if God did not support the
          power of the one in designing, and the strength of the other in
          executing a wicked intention. Every faculty in its being, and every
          faculty in its motion, hath a dependence upon the influence of God. To
          make the creature independent upon God in anything which speaks
          perfection, as action considered as action is, is to make the creature
          a sovereign being. Indeed, we cannot imagine the concurrence of God to
          the good actions of men since the fall, without granting a concurrence
          of God to evil actions; because there is no action so purely good but
          hath a mixture of evil in it, though it takes its denomination of good
          from the better part (Eccles. vii. 20), “There is no man that doth
          good, and sins not.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though the natural virtue of doing a sinful action be from God, and
          supported by him, yet this doth not blemish the holiness of God; while
          God concurs with them in the act, he instils no evil into men.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) No act, in regard of the substance of it, is evil. Most of the
          actions of our faculties, as they are actions, might have been in the
          state of innocency. Eating is an act Adam would have used if he had
          stood firm, but not eating to excess. Worship was an act that should
          have been performed to God in innocence, but not hypocritically. Every
          action is good by a physical goodness, as it is an act of the mind or
          hand, which have a natural goodness by creation; but every action is
          not morally good: the physical goodness of the action depends on God,
          the moral evil on the creature. There is no action, as a corporeal
          action, is prohibited by the law of God; but as it springs from an
          evil disposition, and is tainted by a venomous temper of mind.922
          There is no action so bad, as attended with such objects and
          circumstances; but if the objects and circumstances were changed,
          might be a brave and commendable action: so that the moral goodness or
          badness of an act is not to be esteemed from the substance of the act,
          which hath always a physical goodness; but from the objects,
          circumstances, and constitution of the mind in the doing of it.
          Worship is an act good in itself; but the worship of an image is bad
          in regard of the object. Were that act of worship directed to God that
          is paid to a statue, and offered up to him with a sincere frame of
          mind, it would be morally good. The act, in regard of its substance,
          is the same in both, and considered as separated from the object to
          which the worship is directed, hath the same real goodness in regard
          of the substance; but when you consider this action in relation to the
          different objects, the one hath a moral goodness, and the other a
          moral evil. So in speaking: speaking being a motion of the tongue in
          the forming of words, is an excellency belonging to a reasonable
          creature; an endowment bestowed, continued, and supported by God. Now,
          if the same tongue forms words whereby it curseth God this minute, and
          forms words whereby it blesses and praises God the next minute, the
          faculty of speaking is the same, the motion of the tongue is the same
          in pronouncing the name of God either in a way of cursing or blessing
          (James iii. 9, 10); it is the “same mouth that blesseth and curseth;”
          and the motion of it is naturally good in regard of the substance of
          the act in both; it is the use of an excellent power God hath given,
          and which God preserves, in the use of it. But the estimation of the
          moral goodness or evil is not from the act itself, but from the
          disposition of the mind. Once more: killing, as an act is good; nor is
          it unlawful as an act; for if so, God would never have commanded his
          people Israel to wage any war, and justice could not be done upon
          malefactors by the magistrate. A man were bound to sacrifice his life
          to the fury of an invader, rather than secure it by dispatching that
          of an enemy; but killing an innocent, or killing without authority, or
          out of revenge, is bad. It is not the material part of the act, but
          the object, manner, and circumstance, that makes it good or evil. It
          is no blemish to God’s holiness to concur to the substance of an
          action, without having any hand in the immorality of it; because,
          whatsoever is real in the substance of the action might be done
          without evil. It is not evil as it is an act, as it is a motion of the
          tongue or hand, for then every motion of the tongue or hand would be
          evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Hence it follows, that an act, as an act, is one thing, and the
          viciousness another. The action is the efficacy of the faculty,
          extending itself to some outward object; but the sinfulness of an act
          consists in a privation of that comeliness and righteousness which
          ought to be in an action; in a want of conformity of the act with the
          law of God, either written in nature, or revealed in the Word.923 Now,
          the sinfulness of an action is not the act itself, but is considered
          in it as it is related to the law, and is a deviation from it; and so
          it is something cleaving to the action, and therefore to be
          distinguished from the act itself, which is the subject of the
          sinfulness. When we say such an action is sinful, the action is the
          subject, and the sinfulness of the action is that which adheres to it.
          The action is not the sinfulness, nor the sinfulness the action; they
          are distinguished as the member, and a disease in the member, the arm
          and the palsy in it: the arm is not the palsy, nor is the palsy the
          arm; but the palsy is a disease that cleaves to the arm: so sinfulness
          is a deformity that cleaves to an action. The evil of an action is not
          the effect of an action, nor attends it as it is an action, but as it
          is an action so circumstantiated, and conversant about this or that
          object; for the same action done by two several persons, may be good
          in one, and bad in the other; as when two judges are in joint
          commission for the trial of a malefactor, both upon the appearance of
          his guilt condemn him. This action in both, considered as an action,
          is good; for it is an adjudging a man to death, whose crime deserves
          such a punishment. But this same act, which is but one joint act of
          both, may be morally good in one judge, and morally evil in the other:
          morally good in him that condemns him out of an unbiassed
          consideration of the demerit of his fact, obedience to the law, and
          conscious of the duty of his place; and morally evil in the other, who
          hath no respect to those considerations, but joins in the act of
          condemnation, principally moved by some private animosity against the
          prisoner, and desire of revenge for some injury he hath really
          received, or imagines that he hath received from him. The act in
          itself is the same materially in both; but in one it is an act of
          justice, and in the other an act of murder, as it respects the
          principles and motives of it in the two judges; take away the respect
          of private revenge, and the action in the ill judge had been as
          laudable as the action of the other. The substance of an act, and the
          sinfulness of an act, are separable and distinguishable; and God may
          concur with the substance of an act, without concurring with the
          sinfulness of the act: as the good judge, that condemned the prisoner
          out of conscience, concurred with the evil judge, who condemned the
          prisoner out of private revenge; not in the principle and motive of
          condemnation, but in the material part of condemnation. So God assists
          in that action of a man wherein sin is placed, but not in that which
          is the formal reason of sin, which is a privation of some perfection
          the action ought morally to have.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It will appear further in this, that hence it follows that the
          action, and the viciousness of the action, may have two distinct
          causes. That may be a cause of the one that is not the cause of the
          other, and hath no hand in the producing of it. God concurs to the act
          of the mind as it counsels, and to the external action upon that
          counsel, as he preserves the faculty, and gives strength to the mind
          to consult, and the other parts to execute; yet he is not in the least
          tainted with the viciousness of the action. Though the action be from
          God as a concurrent cause, yet the ill quality of the action is solely
          from the creature with whom God concurs. The sun and the earth concur
          to the production of all the plants that are formed in the womb of the
          one, and midwifed by the other. The sun distributes heat, and the
          earth communicates sap; it is the same heat dispersed by the one, and
          the same juice bestowed by the other: it hath not a sweet juice for
          one, and a sour juice for another. This general influx of the sun and
          earth is not the immediate cause that one plant is poisonous, and
          another wholesome; but the sap of the earth is turned by the nature
          and quality of each plant: if there were not such an influx of the sun
          and earth, no plant could exert that poison which is in its nature;
          but yet the sun and earth are not the cause of that poison which is in
          the nature of the plant. If God did not concur to the motions of men,
          there could be no sinful action, because there could be no action at
          all; yet this concurrence is not the cause of that venom that is in
          the action, which ariseth from the corrupt nature of the creature, no
          more than the sun and earth are the cause of the poison of the plant,
          which is purely the effect of its own nature upon that general influx
          of the sun and earth. The influence of God pierceth through all
          subjects; but the action of man done by that influence is vitiated
          according to the nature of its own corruption. As the sun equally
          shines through all the quarrels in the window; if the glass be bright
          and clear, there is a pure splendor; if it be red or green, the
          splendor is from the sun; but the discoloring of that light upon the
          wall, is from the quality of the glass. But to be yet plainer: the
          soul is the image of God, and by the acts of the soul, we may come to
          the knowledge of the acts of God; the soul gives motion to the body
          and every member of it, and no member could move without a concurrent
          virtue of the soul; if a member be paralytic or gouty, whatsoever
          motion that gouty member hath, is derived to it from the soul; but the
          goutiness of the member was not the act of the soul, but the fruit of
          ill humors in the body; the lameness of the member, and the motion of
          the member, have two distinct causes; the motion is from one cause,
          and ill motion from another.924 As the member could not move
          irregularly without some ill humor or cause of that distemper, so it
          could not move at all without the activity of the soul: so, though God
          concur to the act of understanding, willing, and execution, why can he
          not be as free from the irregularity in all those, as the soul is free
          from the irregularity of the motion of the body, while it is the cause
          of the motion itself? There are two illustrations generally used in
          this case, that are not unfit; the motion of the pen in writing is
          from the hand that holds it, but the blurs by the pen are from some
          fault in the pen itself: and the music of the instrument is from the
          hand that touches it, but the jarring from the faultiness of the
          strings; both are the causes of the motion of the pen and strings, but
          not the blurs or jarrings.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It is very congruous to the wisdom of God, to move his creatures
          according to their particular natures; but this motion makes him not
          the cause of sin. Had our innocent nature continued, God had moved us
          according to that innocent nature; but when the state was changed for
          a corrupt one, God must either forbear all concourse, and so
          annihilate the world, or move us according to that nature he finds in
          us. If he had overthrown the world upon the entrance of sin, and
          created another upon the same terms, sin might have as soon defaced
          his second work, as it did the first; and then it would follow, that
          God would have been alway building and demolishing. It was not fit for
          God to cease from acting as a wise governor of his creature, because
          man did cease from his loyalty as a subject. Is it not more agreeable
          to God’s wisdom as a governor, to concur with his creature according
          to his nature, than to deny his concurrence upon every evil
          determination of the creature? God concurred with Adam’s mutable
          nature in his first act of sin; he concurred to the act, and left him
          to his mutability. If Adam had put out his hand to eat of any other
          unforbidden fruit, God would have supported his natural faculty then,
          and concurred with him in his motion. When Adam would put out his hand
          to take the forbidden fruit, God concurred to that natural action, but
          left him to the choice of the object, and to the use of his mutable
          nature: and when man became apostate, God concurs with him according
          to that condition wherein he found him, and cannot move him otherwise,
          unless he should alter that nature man had contracted. God moving the
          creature as he found him, is no cause of the ill motion of the
          creature: as when a wheel is broken the space of a foot, it cannot but
          move ill in that part till it be mended. He that moves it, uses the
          same motion (as it is his act) which he would have done had the wheel
          been sound; the motion is good in the mover, but bad in the subject:
          it is not the fault of him that moves it, but the fault of that wheel
          that is moved, whose breaches came by some other cause. A man doth not
          use to lay aside his watch for some irregularity, as long as it is
          capable of motion, but winds it up: why should God cease from
          concurring with his creature in its vital operations and other actions
          of his will, because there was a flaw contracted in that nature, that
          came right and true out of his hand? And as he that winds up his
          disordered watch, is in the same manner the cause of its motion then,
          as he was when it was regular, yet, by that act of his, he is not the
          cause of the false motion of it, but that is from the deficiency of
          some part of the watch itself: so, though God concurs to that action
          of the creature, whereby the wickedness of the heart is drawn out, yet
          is not God therefore as unholy as the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) God hath one end in his concurrence, and man another in his
          action: so that there is a righteous, and often a gracious end in God,
          when there is a base and unworthy end in man. God concurs to the
          substance of the act; man produceth the circumstance of the act,
          whereby it is evil. God orders both the action wherein he concurs, and
          the sinfulness over which he presides, as a governor, to his own ends.
          In Joseph’s case, man was sinful, and God merciful; his brethren acted
          “envy,” and God designed “mercy” (Gen. xlv. 4, 5). They would be rid
          of him as an eye‑sore, and God concurred with their action to make him
          their preserver (Gen. l. 20), “Ye thought evil against me, but God
          meant it unto good.” God concurred to Judas his action of betraying
          our Saviour; he supported his nature while he contracted with the
          priests, and supported his members while he was their guide to
          apprehend him; God’s end was the manifestation of his choicest love to
          man, and Judas’ end was the gratification of his own covetousness. The
          Assyrian did a divine work against Jerusalem, but not with a Divine
          end (Isa. x. 5‒7). He had a mind to enlarge his empire, enrich his
          coffers with the spoil, and gain the title of a conqueror; he is
          desirous to invade his neighbors, and God employs him to punish his
          rebels; but he means not so, nor doth his heart think so; he intended
          not as God intended. The axe doth not think what the carpenter intends
          to do with it. But God used the rapine of ambitious nature as an
          instrument of his justice; as the exposing malefactors to wild beasts
          was an ancient punishment, whereby the magistrates intended the
          execution of justice, and to that purpose used the natural fierceness
          of the beasts to an end different from what those ravaging creatures
          aimed at. God concurred with Satan in spoiling Job of his goods, and
          scarifying his body; God gave Satan licence to do it, and Job
          acknowledges it to be God’s act (Job i. 12‒21); but their ends were
          different; God concurred with Satan for the clearing the integrity of
          his servant, when Satan aimed at nothing but the provoking him to
          curse his Creator. The physician applies leeches to suck the
          superfluous blood, but the leeches suck to glut themselves, without
          any regard to the intention of the physician, and the welfare of the
          patient. In the same act where men intend to hurt, God intends to
          correct; so that his concurrence is in a holy manner, while men commit
          unrighteous actions. A judge commands the executioner to execute the
          sentence of death, which he hath justly pronounced against a
          malefactor, and admonisheth him to do it out of love to justice; the
          executioner hath the authority of the judge for his commission, and
          the protection of the judge for his security; the judge stands by to
          countenance and secure him in the doing of it; but if the executioner
          hath not the same intention as the judge, viz. a love to justice in
          the performance of his office, but a private hatred to the offender,
          the judge, though he commanded the fact of the executioner, yet did
          not command this error of his in it; and though he protects him in the
          fact, yet he owns not this corrupt disposition in him in the doing
          what was enjoined him, as any act of his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude this. Since the creature cannot act without God, cannot
          lift up a hand, or move his tongue, without God’s preserving and
          upholding the faculty, and preserving the power of action, and
          preserving every member of the body in its actual motion, and in every
          circumstance of its motion, we must necessarily suppose God to have
          such a way of concurrence as doth not intrench upon his holiness. We
          must not equal the creature to God, by denying his dependence on him;
          nor must we imagine such a concurrence to the sinfulness of an act, as
          stains the Divine purity, which is, I think, sufficiently salved by
          distinguishing the matter of the act from the evil adhering to it; for
          since all evil is founded in some good, the evil is distinguishable
          from the good, and the deformity of the action from the action itself;
          which, as it is a created act, hath a dependence on the will and
          influence of God; and as it is a sinful act, is the product of the
          will of the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VI. The holiness of God is not blemished by proposing objects to
          a man, which he makes use of to sin. There is no object proposed to
          man, but is directed by the providence of God, which influenceth all
          the motions in the world; and there is no object proposed to man, but
          his active nature may, according to the goodness or badness of his
          disposition, make a good or an ill use of. That two men, one of a
          charitable, the other of a hard‑hearted disposition, meet with an
          indigent and necessitous object, is from the providence of God; yet
          this indigent person is relieved by the one, and neglected by the
          other. There could be no action in the world, but about some object;
          there could be no object offered to us but by Divine Providence; the
          active nature of man would be in vain, if there were not objects about
          which it might be exercised. Nothing could present itself to man as an
          object, either to excite his grace, or awaken his corruption, but by
          the conduct of the Governor of the world. That David should walk upon
          the battlements of his palace, and Bathsheba be in the bath at the
          same time, was from the Divine Providence which orders all the affairs
          of the world (2 Sam. xi. 7); and so some understand (Jer. vi. 21):
          “Thus saith the Lord, I will lay stumbling‑blocks before this people,
          and the fathers and sons together shall fall upon them.” Since they
          have offered sacrifices without those due qualifications in their
          hearts, which were necessary to render them acceptable to me, I will
          lay in their way such objects, which their corruption will use ill to
          their farther sin and ruin; so (Ps. cv. 25), “He turned their heart to
          hate his people;” that is, by the multiplying his people, he gave
          occasion to the Egyptians of hating them, instead of caressing them,
          as they had formerly done. But God’s holiness is not blemished by
          this; for,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This proposing or presenting of objects invades not the liberty of
          any man. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, set in the midst
          of the garden of Eden, had no violent influence on man to force him to
          eat of it; his liberty to eat of it, or not, was reserved entire to
          himself; no such charge can be brought against any object whatsoever.
          If a man meet accidentally at a table with meat that is grateful to
          his palate, but hurtful to the present temper of his body, doth the
          presenting this sort of food to him strip him of his liberty to
          decline it, as well as to feed of it? Can the food have any internal
          influence upon his will, and lay the freedom of it asleep whether he
          will or no? Is there any charm in that, more than in other sorts of
          diet? No; but it is the habit of love which he hath to that particular
          dish, the curiosity of his fancy, and the strength of his own
          appetite, whereby he is brought into a kind of slavery to that
          particular meat, and not anything in the food itself. When the word is
          proposed to two persons, it is embraced by the one, rejected by the
          other; is it from the word itself, which is the object, that these two
          persons perform different acts? The object is the same to both, but
          the manner of acting about the object is not the same; is there any
          invasion of their liberty by it? Is the one forced by the word to
          receive it, and the other forced by the word to reject it? Two such
          contrary effects cannot proceed from one and the same cause; outward
          things have only an objective influence, not an inward; if the mere
          proposal of things did suspend or strike down the liberty of man, no
          angels in heaven, no man upon earth, no, not our Saviour himself,
          could do anything freely, but by force; objects that are ill used are
          of God’s creation, and though they have allurements in them, yet they
          have no compulsive power over the will.925 The fruit of the tree of
          knowledge of good and evil was pleasing to the sight; it had a quality
          to allure; there had not else needed a prohibition to bar the eating
          of it; but it could not have so much power to allure, as the Divine
          threatening to deter.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The objects are good in themselves, but the ill use of them is from
          man’s corruption. Bathsheba was, by God’s providence, presented to
          David’s sight, but it was David’s disposition moved him to so evil an
          act; what if God knew that he would use that object ill? yet he knew
          he had given him a power to refrain from any ill use of it; the
          objects are innocent, but our corruption poisons them. The same object
          hath been used by one to holy purposes and holy improvements, that
          hath been used by another to sinful ends; when a charitable object is
          presented to a good man, and a cruel man, one relieves him, the other
          reviles him; the object was rather an occasion to draw out the charity
          of one, as well as the other; but the refusing to reach out a helping
          hand, was not from the person in calamity, but the disposition of the
          refuser to whom he was presented; it is not from the nature of the
          object that men do good or evil, but from the disposition of the
          person; what is good in itself, is made bad by our corruption. As the
          same meat which nourishes and strengthens a sound constitution,
          cherisheth the disease of another that eats at the same table, not
          from any unwholesome quality in the food, but the vicious quality of
          the humors lodging in the stomach, which turn the diet into fuel for
          themselves, which in its own nature was apt to engender a wholesome
          juice. Some are perfected by the same things whereby others are
          ruined. Riches are used by some, not only for their own, but the
          advantage of others in the world; by others only for themselves, and
          scarcely so much as their necessities require. Is this the fault of
          the wealth, or the dispositions of the persons, who are covetous
          instead of being generous? It is a calumny, therefore, upon God to
          charge him with the sin of man upon this account. The rain that drops
          from the clouds upon the plants is sweet in itself, but when it
          moistens the root of any venomous plant, it is turned into the juice
          of the plant, and becomes venomous with it. The miracles that our
          Saviour wrought, were applauded by some, and envied by the Pharisees;
          the sin arose not from the nature of the miracles, but the malice of
          their spirits. The miracles were fitter in their own nature to have
          induced them to an adoration of our Saviour, than to excite so vile a
          passion against one that had so many marks from heaven to dignify him,
          and proclaim him worthy of their respect. The person of Christ was an
          object proposed to the Jews; some worship him, others condemn and
          crucify him, and according to their several vices and base ends they
          use this object. Judas to content his covetousness, the Pharisees to
          glut their revenge, Pilate for his ambition, to preserve himself in
          his government, and avoid the articles the people might charge him
          with of countenancing an enemy to Cæsar. God at that time put into
          their minds a rational and true proposition which they apply to ill
          purposes.926 Caiaphas said, that “it was expedient for one man to die
          for the people,” which “he spake not of himself” (John xi. 50, 51).
          God put it into his mind; but he might have applied it better than he
          did, and considered, though the maxim was commendable, whether it
          might justly be applied to Christ, or whether there was such a
          necessity that he must die, or the nation be destroyed by the Romans.
          The maxim was sound and holy, decreed by God; but what an ill use did
          the high‑priest make of it to put Christ to death as a seditious
          person, to save the nation from the Roman fury!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Since the natural corruption of men will use such objects ill, may
          not God, without tainting himself, present such objects to them in
          subserviency to his gracious decrees? Whatsoever God should present to
          men in that state, they would make an ill use of; hath not God, then,
          the sovereign prerogative to present what he pleases, and suppress
          others? To offer that to them which may serve his holy purpose, and
          hide other things from them which are not so conducing to his gracious
          ends, which would be as much the occasions of exciting their sin, as
          the others which he doth bring forth to their view? The Jews, at the
          time of Christ, were of a turbulent and seditious humor; they expected
          a Messiah, a temporal king, and would readily have embraced any
          occasion to have been up in arms to have delivered themselves from the
          Roman yoke; to this purpose the people attempted once to make him
          king: and probably the expectation they had that he had such a design
          to head them, might be one reason of their “hosannas;” because without
          some such conceit it was not probable they should so soon change their
          note, and vote him to the cross in so short a time, after they had
          applauded him as if he had been upon a throne; but their being
          defeated of strong expectations, usually ended in a more ardent fury.
          This turbulent and seditious humor God directs in another channel,
          suppresseth all occurrences that might excite them to a rebellion
          against the Romans, which, if he had given way to, the crucifying
          Christ, which was God’s design to bring about at that time, had not
          probably been effected, and the salvation of mankind been hindered or
          stood at a stay for a time. God, therefore, orders such objects and
          occasions, that might direct this seditious humor to another channel,
          which would else have run out in other actions, which had not been
          conducing to the great design he had then in the world. Is it not the
          right of God, and without any blemish to his holiness, to use those
          corruptions which he finds sown in the nature of his creature by the
          hand of Satan, and to propose such objects as may excite the exercise
          of them for his own service? Sure God hath as much right to serve
          himself of the creature of his own framing, and what natures soever
          they are possessed with, and to present objects to that purpose, as a
          falconer hath to offer this or that bird to his hawk to exercise his
          courage, and excite his ravenousness, without being termed the author
          of that ravenousness in the creature. God planted not those
          corruptions in the Jews, but finds them in those persons over whom he
          hath an absolute sovereignty in the right of a Creator, and that of a
          Judge for their sins: and by the right of that sovereignty may offer
          such objects and occasions, which, though innocent in themselves, he
          knows they will make use of to ill purposes, but which by the same
          decree that he resolves to present such occasions to them, he also
          resolves to make use of them for his own glory. It is not conceivable
          by us what way that death of Christ, which was necessary for the
          satisfaction of Divine justice, could be brought about without
          ordering the evil of some men’s hearts by special occasions to effect
          his purpose; we cannot suppose that Christ can be guilty of any crime
          that deserved death by the Jewish law; had he been so a criminal, he
          could not have been a Redeemer: a perfect innocence was necessary to
          the design of his coming.927 Had God himself put him to that death,
          without using instruments of wickedness in it, by some remarkable hand
          from heaven, the innocence of his nature had been forever eclipsed,
          and the voluntariness of his sacrifice had been obscured: the
          strangeness of such a judgment would have made his innocence
          incredible; he could not reasonably have been proposed as an object of
          faith. What, to believe in one that was struck dead by a hand from
          heaven? The propagation of the doctrine of redemption had wanted a
          foundation; and though God might have raised him again, the certainty
          of his death had been as questionable as his innocence in dying, had
          he not been raised. But God orders everything so as to answer his own
          most wise and holy ends, and maintain his truth, and the fulfilling
          the predictions of the minutest concerns about them, and all this by
          presenting occasions innocent in themselves, which the corruptions of
          the Jews took hold of, and whereby God, unknown to them, brought about
          his own decrees: and may not this be conceived without any taint upon
          God’s holiness? for when there are seeds of all sin in man’s nature,
          why may not God hinder the sprouting up of this or that kind of seed,
          and leave liberty to the growth of the other, and shut up other ways
          of sinning, and restrain men from them, and let them loose to that
          temptation which he intends to serve himself of, hiding from them
          those objects which were not so serviceable to his purpose, wherein
          they would have sinned, and offer others, which he knew their
          corruption would use ill, and were serviceable to his ends; since the
          depravation of their natures would necessarily hurry them to evil
          without restraining grace, as a scale will necessarily rise up when
          the weight in it, which kept it down, is taken away?
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VII. The holiness of God is not blemished by withdrawing his
          grace from a sinful creature, whereby he falls into more sin. That God
          withdraws his grace from men, and gives them up sometimes to the fury
          of their lusts, is as clear in Scripture, as anything (Deut. xxix. 4):
          “Yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see,
          and ears to hear,” &amp;c. Judas was delivered to Satan after the sop,
          and put into his power, for despising former admonitions. He often
          leaves the reins to the devil, that he may use what efficacy he can in
          those that have offended the Majesty of God; he withholds further
          influences of grace, or withdraws what before he had granted them.
          Thus he withheld that grace from the sons of Eli, that might have made
          their father’s pious admonitions effectual to them (1 Sam. ii. 25):
          “They hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord
          would slay them.” He gave grace to Eli to reprove them, and withheld
          that grace from them, which might have enabled them against their
          natural corruption and obstinacy to receive that reproof. But the
          holiness of God is not blemished by this.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Because the act of God in this is only negative.928 Thus God is
          said to “harden” men: not by positive hardening, or working anything
          in the creature, but by not working, not softening, leaving a man to
          the hardness of his own heart, whereby it is unavoidable by the
          depravation of man’s nature, and the fury of his passions, but that he
          should be further hardened, and “increase unto more ungodliness,” as
          the expression is (2 Tim. ii. 19). As a man is said to give another
          his life, when he doth not take it away when it lay at his mercy; so
          God is said to “harden” a man, when he doth not mollify him when it
          was in his power, and inwardly quicken him with that grace whereby he
          might infallibly avoid any further provoking of him. God is said to
          harden men when he removes not from them the incentives to sin, curbs
          not those principles which are ready to comply with those incentives,
          withdraws the common assistances of his grace, concurs not with
          counsels and admonitions to make them effectual; flasheth not in the
          convincing light which he darted upon them before. If hardness follows
          upon God’s withholding his softening grace, it is not by any positive
          act of God, but from the natural hardness of man. If you put fire near
          to wax or rosin, both will melt; but when that fire is removed, they
          return to their natural quality of hardness and brittleness; the
          positive act of the fire is to melt and soften, and the softness of
          the rosin is to be ascribed to that; but the hardness is from the
          rosin itself, wherein the fire hath no influence, but only a negative
          act by a removal of it: so, when God hardens a man, he only leaves him
          to that stony heart which he derived from Adam, and brought with him
          into the world. All men’s understandings being blinded, and their
          wills perverted in Adam, God’s withdrawing his grace is but a leaving
          them to their natural pravity, which is the cause of their further
          sinning, and not God’s removal of that special light he before
          afforded them, or restraint he held over them. As when God withdraws
          his preserving power from the creature, he is not the efficient, but
          deficient cause of the creature’s destruction; so, in this case, God
          only ceaseth to bind and dam up that sin which else would break out.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The whole positive cause of his hardness is from man’s corruption.
          God infuseth not any sin into his creatures, but forbears to infuse
          his grace, and restrain their lusts, which, upon the removal of his
          grace, work impetuously: God only gives them up to that which he knows
          will work strongly in their hearts. And, therefore, the apostle wipes
          off from God any positive act in that uncleanness the heathens were
          given up to (Rom. i. 24, “Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness,
          through the lusts of their own hearts.” And, ver. 26, God gave them up
          to “vile affections;” but they were their own affections, none of
          God’s inspiring,) by adding, “through the lusts of their own hearts.”
          God’s giving them up was the logical cause, or a cause by way of
          argument; their own lusts were the true and natural cause; their own
          they were, before they were given up to them, and belonging to none,
          as the author, but themselves, after they were given up to them. The
          lust in the heart, and the temptation without, easily close and mix
          interests with one another: as the fire in a coal pit will with the
          fuel, if the streams derived into it for the quenching it be dammed
          up: the natural passions will run to a temptation, as the waters of a
          river tumble towards the sea. When a man that hath bridled in a
          high‑mettled horse from running out, gives him the reins; or a
          huntsman takes off the string that held the dog, and lets him run
          after the hare,—are they the immediate cause of the motion of the one,
          or the other?—no, but the mettle and strength of the horse, and the
          natural inclination of the hound, both which are left to their own
          motions to pursue their own natural instincts. Man doth as naturally
          tend to sin as a stone to the centre, or as a weighty thing inclines
          to a motion to the earth: it is from the propension of man’s nature
          that he “drinks up iniquity like water:” and God doth no more when he
          leaves a man to sin, by taking away the hedge which stopped him, but
          leave him to his natural inclination. As a man that breaks up a dam he
          hath placed, leaves the stream to run in their natural channel; or one
          that takes away a prop from a stone to let it fall, leaves it only to
          that nature which inclines it to a descent; both have their motion
          from their own nature, and man is sin from his own corruption. The
          withdrawing the sunbeams is not the cause of darkness, but the
          shadiness of the earth; nor is the departure of the sun the cause of
          winter, but the coldness of the air and earth, which was tempered and
          beaten back into the bowels of the earth by the vigor of the sun, upon
          whose departure they return to their natural state: the sun only
          leaves the earth and air as it found them at the beginning of the
          spring or the beginning of the day.929 If God do not give a man grace
          to melt him, yet he cannot be said to communicate to him that nature
          which hardens him, which man hath from himself. As God was not the
          cause of the first sin of Adam, which was the root of all other, so he
          is not the cause of the following sins, which, as branches, spring
          from that root; man’s free‑will was the cause of the first sin, and
          the corruption of his nature by it the cause of all succeeding sins.
          God doth not immediately harden any man, but doth propose those
          things, from whence the natural vice of man takes an occasion to
          strengthen and nourish itself. Hence, God is said to “harden Pharaoh’s
          heart” (Exod. vii. 13), by concurring with the magicians in turning
          their rods into serpents, which stiffened his heart against Moses,
          conceiving him by reason of that, to have no more power than other
          men, and was an occasion of his farther hardening: and Pharaoh is said
          to “harden himself” (Exod. viii. 32); that is, in regard of his own
          natural passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God is holy and righteous, because he doth not withdraw from man,
          till man deserts him. To say, that God withdrew that grace from Adam,
          which he had afforded him in creation, or anything that was due to
          him, till he had abused the gifts of God, and turned them to an end
          contrary to that of creation, would be a reflection upon the Divine
          holiness. God was first deserted by man before man was deserted by
          God; and man doth first contemn and abuse the common grace of God, and
          those relics of natural light, that “enlighten every man that comes
          into the world” (John i. 9); before God leaves him to the hurry of his
          own passions. Ephraim was first joined to idols, before God pronounced
          the fatal sentence, “Let him alone” (Hos. iv. 17): and the heathens
          first changed the glory of the incorruptible God, before God withdrew
          his common grace from the corrupted creature (Rom. i. 23, 24); and
          they first “served the creature more than the Creator,” before the
          Creator gave them up to the slavish chains of their vile affections
          (ver. 25, 26). Israel first cast off God before God cast off them; but
          then “he gave them up to their own hearts’ lusts, and they walked in
          their own counsels” (Ps. lxxxi. 11, 12). Since sin entered into the
          world by the fall of Adam, and the blood of all his posterity was
          tainted, man cannot do anything that is formally good; not for want of
          faculties, but for the want of a righteous habit in those faculties,
          especially in the will; yet God discovers himself to man in the works
          of his hands; he hath left in him footsteps of natural reason; he doth
          attend him with common motions of his Spirit; corrects him for his
          faults with gentle chastisements. He is near unto all in some kind of
          instructions: he puts many times providential bars in their way of
          sinning; but when they will rush into it as the horse into the battle,
          when they will rebel against the light, God doth often leave them to
          their own course, sentence him that is “filthy to be filthy still”
          (Rev. xxii. 11), which is a righteous act of God, as he is rector and
          governor of the world. Man’s not receiving, or not improving what God
          gives, is the cause of God’s not giving further, or taking away his
          own, which before he had bestowed; this is so far from being repugnant
          to the holiness and righteousness of God, that it is rather a
          commendable act of his holiness and righteousness, as the rector of
          the world, not to let those gifts continue in the hand of a man who
          abuses them contrary to his glory. Who will blame a father, that,
          after all the good counsels he hath given to his son to reclaim him,
          all the corrections he hath inflicted on him for his irregular
          practice, leaves him to his own courses, and withdraws those
          assistances which he scoffed at, and turned the deaf ear unto? Or, who
          will blame the physician for deserting the patient, who rejects his
          counsel, will not follow his prescriptions, but dasheth his physic
          against the wall? No man will blame him, no man will say that he is
          the cause of the patient’s death, but the true cause is the fury of
          the distemper, and the obstinacy of the diseased person, to which the
          physician left him. And who can justly blame God in this case, who yet
          never denied supplies of grace to any that sincerely sought it at his
          hands; and what man is there that lies under a hardness, but first was
          guilty of very provoking sins? What unholiness is it to deprive men of
          those assistances, because of their sin, and afterwards to direct
          those counsels and practices of theirs, which he hath justly given
          them up unto, to serve the ends of his own glory in his own methods?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Which will appear further by considering, that God is not obliged
          to continue his grace to them. It was at his liberty whether he could
          give any renewing grace to Adam after his fall, or to any of his
          posterity: he was at his own liberty to withhold it or communicate it:
          but, if he were under any obligation then, surely he must be under
          less now, since the multiplication of sin by his creatures: but, if
          the obligation were none just after the fall, there is no pretence now
          to fasten any such obligation on God. That God had no obligation at
          first, hath been spoken to before; he is less obliged to continue his
          grace after a repeated refusal, and a peremptory abuse, than he was
          bound to proffer it after the first apostasy. God cannot be charged
          with unholiness in withdrawing his grace after we have received it,
          unless we can make it appear that his grace was a thing due to us, as
          we are his creatures, and as he is governor of the world. What prince
          looks upon himself as obliged to reside in any particular place of his
          kingdom? But suppose he be bound to inhabit in one particular city,
          yet after the city rebels against him, is he bound to continue his
          court there, spend his revenue among rebels, endanger his own honor
          and security, enlarge their charter, or maintain their ancient
          privileges? Is it not most just and righteous for him to withdraw
          himself, and leave them to their own tumultuousness and sedition,
          whereby they should eat the fruit of their own doings? If there be an
          obligation on God as a governor, it would rather lie on the side of
          justice to leave man to the power of the devil whom he courted, and
          the prevalency of those lusts he hath so often caressed; and wrap up
          in a cloud all his common illuminations, and leave him destitute of
          all common workings of his Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VIII. God’s holiness is not blemished by his commanding those
          things sometimes which seem to be against nature, or thwart some other
          of his precepts; as when God commanded Abraham with his own hand to
          sacrifice his son (Gen. xxii. 2), there was nothing of unrighteousness
          in it. God hath a sovereign dominion over the lives and beings of his
          creatures, whereby as he creates one day, he might annihilate the
          next; and by the same right that he might demand the life of Isaac, as
          being his creature, he might demand the obedience of Abraham, in a
          ready return of that to him, which he had so long enjoyed by his
          grant. It is true, killing is unjust when it is done without cause,
          and by a private authority; but the authority of God surmounts all
          private and public authority whatsoever. Our lives are due to him when
          he calls for them; and they are more than once forfeit to him by
          reason of transgression. But, howsoever the case is, God commanded him
          to do it for the trial of his grace, but suffered him not to do it in
          favor to his ready obedience; but had Isaac been actually slain and
          offered, how had it been unrighteous in God, who enacts laws for the
          regulation of his creature, but never intended them to the prejudice
          of the rights of his sovereignty? Another case is that of the
          Israelites borrowing jewels of the Egyptians, by the order of God
          (Exod. xi. 2, 3; xii. 36). Is not God Lord of men’s goods, as well as
          their lives? What have any, they have not received? and that not as
          proprietors independent on God, but his stewards; and may not he
          demand a portion of his steward to bestow upon his favorite? He that
          had power to dispose of the Egyptians’ goods, had power to order the
          Israelites to ask them. Besides, God acted the part of a just judge in
          ordering them their wages for their service in this method, and making
          their task‑masters give them some recompense for their unjust
          oppression so many years; it was a command from God, therefore, rather
          for the preservation of justice (the basis of all those laws which
          link human society), than any infringement of it. It was a material
          recompense in part, though not a formal one in the intention of the
          Egyptians; it was but in part a recompense; it must needs come short
          of the damage the poor captives had sustained by the tyranny of their
          masters, who had enslaved them contrary to the rules of hospitality;
          and could not make amends for the lives of the poor infants of Israel,
          whom they had drowned in the river. He that might for the unjust
          oppression of his people have taken away all their lives, destroyed
          the whole nation, and put the Israelites into the possession of their
          lands, could, without any unrighteousness, dispose of part of their
          goods; and it was rather an act of clemency to leave them some part,
          who had doubly forfeited all. Again, the Egyptians were as ready to
          lend by God’s influence, as the Israelites were to ask by God’s order:
          and though it was a loan, God, as Sovereign of the world, and Lord of
          the earth, and the fulness thereof, alienated the property by assuming
          them to the use of the tabernacle, to which service, most, if not all
          of them, were afterwards dedicated. God, who is lawgiver, hath power
          to dispense with his own law, and make use of his own goods, and
          dispose of them as he pleases; it is no unholiness in God to dispose
          of that which he hath a right unto. Indeed, God cannot command that
          which is in its own nature intrinsically evil; as to command a
          rational creature not to love him, not to worship him, to call God to
          witness to a lie; these are intrinsically evil; but for the disposing
          of the lives and goods of his creatures, which they have from him in
          right, and not in absolute propriety, is not evil in him, because
          there is no repugnancy in his own nature to such acts, nor is it
          anything inconsistent with the natural duty of a creature, and in such
          cases he may use what instruments he please. The point was, that
          holiness is a glorious perfection of the nature of God. We have showed
          the nature of this holiness in God; what it is; and we have
          demonstrated it, and proved that God is holy, and must needs be so;
          and also the purity of his nature in all his acts about sin: let us
          now improve it by way of use.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Is holiness a transcendent perfection belonging to the nature of
          God? The first use shall be of instruction and information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inform. 1. How great and how frequent is the contempt of this eminent
          perfection in the Deity! Since the fall, this attribute, which renders
          God most amiable in himself, renders him most hateful to his apostate
          creature. It is impossible that he that loves iniquity, can affect
          that which is irreconcileably contrary to the iniquity he loves.
          Nothing so contrary to the sinfulness of man as the holiness of God,
          and nothing is thought of by the sinner with so much detestation. How
          do men account that which is the most glorious perfection of the
          Divinity, unworthy to be regarded as an accomplishment of their own
          souls! and when they are pressed to an imitation of it, and a
          detestation of what is contrary to it, have the same sentiment in
          their heart which the devil had in his language to Christ, Why art
          thou come to torment us before our time? What an enmity the world
          naturally hath to this perfection, I think is visible in the practice
          of the heathen, who among all their heroes which they deified,
          elevated none to that dignity among them for this or that moral virtue
          that came nearest to it, but for their valor or some usefulness in the
          concerns of this life. Æsculapius was deified for his skill in the
          cure of diseases; Bacchus, for the use of the grape; Vulcan, for his
          operations by fire; Hercules, for his destroying of tyrants and
          monsters; but none for their mere virtue; as if anything of purity
          were unworthy their consideration in the frame of a Deity, when it is
          the glory of all other perfections; so essential it is, that when men
          reject the imitation of this, God regards it as a total rejection of
          himself, though they own all the other attributes of his nature (Ps.
          lxxxi. 11): “Israel would none of me:” why? because “they walked not
          in his ways” (ver. 13); those ways wherein the purity of the Divine
          nature was most conspicuous; they would own him in his power, when
          they stood in need of a deliverance; they would own him in his mercy,
          when they were plunged in distress; but they would not imitate him in
          his holiness. This being the lustre of the Divine nature, the contempt
          of it is an obscuring all his other perfections, and a dashing a blot
          upon his whole escutcheon. To own all the rest, and deny him this, is
          to frame him as an unbeautiful monster,—a deformed power. Indeed, all
          sin is against this attribute; all sin aims in general at the being of
          God, but in particular at the holiness of his Being. All sin is a
          violence to this perfection; there is not an iniquity in the world,
          but directs its venomous sting against the Divine purity; some sins
          are directed against his omniscience, as secret wickedness; some
          against his providence, as distrust; some against his mercy, as
          unbelief; some against his wisdom, as neglecting the means instituted
          by him, censuring his ways and actings; some against his power, as
          trusting in means more than in God, and the immoderate fear of men
          more than of God; some against his truth, as distrusting his promise,
          or not fearing his threatening; but all agree together in their enmity
          against this, which is the peculiar glory of the Deity: every one of
          them is a receding from the Divine image; and the blackness of every
          one is the deeper, by how much the distance of it from the holiness of
          God is the greater. This contrariety to the holiness of God, is the
          cause of all the absolute atheism (if there be any such) in the world;
          what was the reason “the fool hath said in his heart, There is no
          God,” but because the fool is “corrupt, and hath done abominable work”
          (Ps. xiv. 1)? If they believe the being of a God, their own reason
          will enforce them to imagine him holy; therefore, rather than fancy a
          holy God, they would fain fancy none at all.—In particular,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The holiness of God is injured, in unworthy representations of God,
          and imaginations of him in our own minds. The heathen fell under this
          guilt, and ascribed to their idols those vices which their own
          sensuality inclined them to, unworthy of a man, much more unworthy of
          a God, that they might find a protection of their crimes in the
          practice of their idols. But is this only the notion of the heathens?
          may there not be many among us whose love to their lusts, and desires
          of sinning without control, move them to slander God in their
          thoughts, rather than reform their lives, and are ready to frame, by
          the power of their imaginative faculty, a God, not only winking, but
          smiling, at their impurities? I am sure God charges the impieties of
          men upon this score, in that Psalm (l. 21) which seems to be a
          representation of the day of judgment, as some gather from ver. 6,
          when God sums up all together: “These things hast thou done, and I
          kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as
          thyself;” not a detester, but approver of thy crimes: and the Psalmist
          seems to express God’s loathing of sin in such a manner, as intimates
          it to be contrary to the ideas and resemblances men make of him in
          their minds (Ps. v. 4); “For thou art not a God that hast pleasure in
          wickedness;” as we say, in vindication of a man, he is not such a man
          as you imagine him to be; thou art not such a God as the world
          commonly imagines thee to be, a God taking pleasure in iniquity. It is
          too common for men to fancy God not as he is, but as they would have
          him; strip him of his excellency for their own security. As God made
          man after his image, man would dress God after his own modes, as may
          best suit the content of his lusts, and encourage him in a course of
          sinning; for, when they can frame such a notion of God, as if he were
          a countenancer of sin, they will derive from thence a reputation to
          their crimes, commit wickedness with an unbounded licentiousness, and
          crown their vices with the name of virtues, because they are so like
          to the sentiments of that God they fancy: from hence (as the Psalmist,
          in the Psalm before mentioned) ariseth that mass of vice in the world;
          such conceptions are the mother and nurse of all impiety. I question
          not but the first spring is some wrong notion of God, in regard of his
          holiness: we are as apt to imagine God as we would have him, as the
          black Ethiopians were to draw the image of their gods after their own
          dark hue, and paint him with their own color: as a philosopher in
          Theodoret speaks; If oxen and lions had hands, and could paint as men
          do, they would frame the images of their gods according to their own
          likeness and complexion. Such notions of God render him a swinish
          being, and worse than the vilest idols adored by the Egyptians, when
          men fancy a God indulgent to their appetites and most sordid lusts.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In defacing the image of God in our own souls. God, in the first
          draught of man, conformed him to his own image, or made him an image
          of himself; because we find that in regeneration this image is renewed
          (Eph. iv. 24); “The new man, which, after God, is created in
          righteousness and true holiness.” He did not take angels for his
          pattern, in the first polishing the soul, but himself. In defacing
          this image we cast dirt upon the holiness of God, which was his
          pattern in the framing of us, and rather choose to be conformed to
          Satan, who is God’s grand enemy, to have God’s image wiped out of us,
          and the devil’s pictured in us: therefore, natural men, in an
          unregenerate state, may justly be called devils, since our Saviour
          called the worst man, Judas, so (John vi. 1), and Peter, one of the
          best (Matt. xvi. 23): and if this title be given, by an infallible
          Judge, to one of the worst, and one of the best, it may, without wrong
          to any, be ascribed to all men that wallow in their sin, which is
          directly contrary to that illustrious image God did imprint upon them.
          How often is it seen that men control the light of their own nature,
          and stain the clearest beams of that candle of the Lord in their own
          spirits, that fly in the face of their own consciences, and say to
          them, as Ahab to Micaiah, Thou didst “never prophesy good to me;” thou
          didst never encourage me in those things that are pleasing to the
          flesh; and use it at the same rate as the wicked king did the prophet,
          “imprison it in unrighteousness” (Rom. i. 18), because it starts up in
          them sometimes sentiments of the holiness of God, which it represents
          in the soul of man! How jolly are many men when the exhalations of
          their sensitive part rise up to cloud the exactest principle of moral
          nature in their minds, and render the monstrous principles of the law
          of corruption more lively! Whence ariseth the wickedness which hath
          been committed with an open face in the world, and the applause that
          hath been often given to the worst of villanies? Have we not known,
          among ourselves, men to glory in their shame, and esteem that a most
          gentle accomplishment of man, which is the greatest blot upon his
          nature, and which, if it were upon God, would render him no God, but
          an impure devil; so that to be a gentleman among us hath been the same
          as to be an incarnate devil; and to be a man, was to be no better, but
          worse, than a brute? Vile wretches! is not this a contempt of Divine
          holiness, to kill that Divine seed which lies languishing in the midst
          of corrupted nature; to cut up any sprouts of it as weeds unworthy to
          grow in their gardens, and cultivate what is the seed of hell; prefer
          the rotten fruits of Sodom, marked with a Divine curse, before those
          relics of the fruits of Eden, of God’s own planting?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The holiness of God is injured in charging our sin upon God.
          Nothing is more natural to men, than to seek excuses for their sin,
          and transfer it from themselves to the next at hand, and rather than
          fail, shift it upon God himself; and if they can bring God into a
          society with them in sin, they will hug themselves in a security that
          God cannot punish that guilt wherein he is a partner. Adam’s children
          are not of a different disposition from Adam himself, who, after he
          was arraigned and brought to his trial, boggles not at flinging his
          dirt in the face of God, his Creator, and accuseth him as if he had
          given him the woman, not to be his help, but his ruin (Gen. iii. 12);
          “And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave
          me of the tree, and I did eat.” He never supplicates for pardon, nor
          seeks a remedy, but reflects his crime upon God: Had I been alone, as
          I was first created, I had not eaten; but the woman, whom I received
          as a special gift from thee, hath proved my tempter and my bane. When
          man could not be like God in knowledge, he endeavored to make God like
          him in his crime; and when his ambition failed of equalizing himself
          with God, he did, with an insolence too common to corrupted nature,
          attempt, by the imputation of his sin, to equal the Divinity with
          himself. Some think Cain had the same sentiment in his answer to God’s
          demand where his brother was (Gen. ii. 9); “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
          Art not thou the Keeper and Governor of the world? why didst not thou
          take care of him, and hinder my killing him, and drawing this guilt
          upon myself, and terror upon my conscience? David was not behind,
          when, after the murder of Uriah, he sweeps the dirt from his own door
          to God’s (2 Sam. xi. 25); “The sword devoureth one as well as
          another;” fathering that solely upon Divine Providence which was his
          own wicked contrivance: though afterwards he is more ingenuous in
          clearing God, and charging himself (Ps. li. 4): “Against thee, thee
          only have I sinned;” and he clears God in his judgment too. It is too
          common for the “foolishness of man to pervert his way;” and then “his
          heart frets against the Lord” (Prov. xix. 3). He studies mischief,
          runs in a way of sin, and when he hath conjured up troubles to
          himself, by his own folly, he excuseth himself, and, with indignation,
          charges God as the author both of his sin and misery, and sets his
          mouth against the heavens. It is a more horrible thing to accuse God
          as a principal or accessary in our guilt, than to conceive him to be a
          favorer of our iniquity; yet both are bad enough.

          4. The holiness of God is injured when men will study arguments from
          the holy word of God to color and shelter their crimes. When men will
          seek for a shelter for their lies, in that of the midwives to preserve
          the children, or in that of Rahab to save the spies, as if, because
          God rewarded their fidelity, he countenanced their sin. How often is
          Scripture wrested to be a plea for unbecoming practices, that God, in
          his word, may be imagined a patron for their iniquity? It is not
          unknown that some have maintained their quaffing and carousing (from
          Eccles. viii. 11), “That a man hath no better thing under the sun than
          to eat, drink, and be merry:” and their gluttony (from Matt. v. 11),
          “That which goes into the belly defiles not a man.” The Jesuits’
          morals are a transcript of this. How often hath the Passion of our
          Saviour, the highest expression of God’s holiness, been employed to
          stain it, and encourage the most debauched practices! Grace hath been
          turned into wantonness, and the abundance of grace been used as a
          blast to increase the flames of sin, as if God had no other aim in
          that work of redemption, but to discover himself more indulgent to our
          sensual appetites, and by his severity with his Son, become more
          gracious to our lusts; this is to feed the roots of hell with the dews
          of heaven, to make grace a pander for the abuse of it, and to employ
          the expressions of his holiness in his word to be a sword against the
          essential holiness of his nature: as if a man should draw an apology
          for his treason out of that law that was made to forbid, not to
          protect, his rebellion. Not the meanest instrument in the temple was
          to be alienated from the use it was by Divine order appointed to, nor
          was it to be employed in any common use; and shall the word of God,
          which is the image of his holiness, be transferred by base
          interpretations to be an advocate for iniquity? Such an ill use of his
          word reflects upon that hand which imprinted those characters of
          purity and righteousness upon it: as the misinterpretation of the
          wholesome laws of a prince, made to discourage debauchery, reflects
          upon his righteousness and sincerity in enacting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The holiness of God is injured, when men will put up petitions to
          God to favor them in a wicked design. Such there are, and taxed by the
          apostle (James iv. 3), “Ye ask amiss, that you may consume it upon
          your lusts,” who desired mercies from God, with an intent to make them
          instruments of sin, and weapons of unrighteousness; as it is reported
          of a thief, that he always prayed for the success of his robbery. It
          hath not been rare in the world to appoint fasts and prayers for
          success in wars manifestly unjust, and commenced upon breaches of
          faith. Many covetous men petition God to prosper them in their unjust
          gain; as if the blessed God sat in his pure majesty upon a throne of
          grace, to espouse unjust practices, and make iniquity prosperous.
          There are such as “offer sacrifice with an evil mind” (Prov. xxi. 27),
          to barter with God for a divine blessing to spirit a wicked
          contrivance. How great a contempt of the holiness of God is this! How
          inexcusable would it be for a favorite to address himself to a just
          prince with this language: Sir, I desire a boon of such lands that lie
          near me, for an addition to my estate, that I may have supports for my
          debauchery, and be able to play the villain more powerfully among my
          neighbors! Hereby he implies that his prince is a friend to such
          crimes and wickedness he intends his petition for. Is not this the
          language of many men’s hearts in the immediate presence of God? The
          order of prayer runs thus, “Hallowed be thy name;” first to have a
          deep sense of the holiness of the Divine nature, and an ardent desire
          for the glory of it. This order is inverted by asking those things
          which are not agreeable to the will of God, not meet for us to ask,
          and not meet for God to give; or asking things agreeable to the will
          of God, but with a wicked intention. This is, in effect, to desire God
          to strip himself of his holiness, and commit sacrilege upon his own
          nature to gratify our lusts.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The purity of God is contemned, in hating and scoffing at the
          holiness which is in a creature. Whoever looks upon the holiness of a
          creature as an unlovely thing, can have no good opinion of the
          amiableness of Divine purity. Whosoever hates those qualities and
          graces that resemble God in any person, must needs contemn the
          original pattern, which is more eminent in God. If there be no
          comeliness in a creature’s holiness, to render it grateful to us, we
          should say of God himself, were he visible among us, with those in the
          prophet (Isa. liii.), “There is no beauty in him, that we should
          desire him.” Holiness is beautiful in itself. If God be the most
          lovely Being, that which is a likeness to him, so far as it doth
          resemble him, must needs be amiable, because it partakes of God; and,
          therefore, those that see no beauty in an inferior holiness, but
          contemn it because it is a purity above them, contemn God much more.
          He that hates that which is imperfect merely for that excellency which
          is in it, doth much more hate that which is perfect, without any
          mixture or stain. Holiness being the glory of God, the peculiar title
          of the Deity, and from him derived unto the nature of a creature, he
          that mocks this in a person, derides God himself; and, when he cannot
          abuse the purity in the Deity, he will do it in his image; as rebels
          that cannot wrong the king in his person, will do it in his picture,
          and his subjects that are loyal to him. He that hates the picture of a
          man, hates the person represented by it much more; he that hates the
          beams, hates the sun; the holiness of a creature is but a beam from
          that infinite Sun, a stream from that eternal Fountain. Where there is
          a derision of the purity of any creature, there is a greater
          reflection upon God in that derision, as he is the Author of it. If a
          mixed and stained holiness be more the subject of any man’s scoffs
          than a great deal of sin, that person hath a disposition more roundly
          to scoff at God himself, should he appear in that unblemished and
          unspotted purity which infinitely shines in his nature. O! it is a
          dangerous thing to scoff and deride holiness in any person, though
          never so mean; such do deride and scoff at the most holy God.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The holiness of God is injured by our unprepared addresses to him,
          when, like swine, we come into the presence of God with all our mire
          reeking and steaming upon us. A holy God requires a holy worship; and
          if our best duties, having filth in every part, as performed by us,
          are unmeet for God, how much more unsuitable are dead and dirty duties
          to a living and immense holiness! Slight approaches and drossy frames
          speak us to have imaginations of God as of a slight and sottish being.
          This is worse than the heathens practised, who would purge their flesh
          before they sacrificed, and make some preparations in a seeming
          purity, before they would enter into their temples. God is so holy,
          that were our services as refined as those of angels, we could not
          present him with a service meet for his holy nature (Josh. xxiv. 19).
          We contemn, then, this perfection, when we come before him without due
          preparation; as if God himself were of an impure nature, and did not
          deserve our purest thoughts in our applications to him; as if any
          blemished and polluted sacrifice were good enough for him, and his
          nature deserved no better. When we excite not those elevated frames of
          spirit which are due to such a being, when we think to put him off
          with a lame and imperfect service, we worship him not according to the
          excellency of his nature, but put a slight upon his majestic sanctity.
          When we nourish in our duties those foolish imaginations which creep
          upon us; when we bring into, and continue our worldly, carnal,
          debauched fancies in his presence, worse than the nasty servants, or
          bemired dogs, a man would blush to be attended with in his visits to a
          neat person. To be conversing with sordid sensualities, when we are at
          the feet of an infinite God, sitting upon the throne of his holiness,
          is as much a contempt of him, as it would be of a prince, to bring a
          vessel full of nasty dung with us, when we come to present a petition
          to him in his royal robes; or as it would have been to God, if the
          high priest should have swept all the blood and excrements of the
          sacrifices from the foot of the altar into the Holy of holies, and
          heaped it up before the mercy‑seat, where the presence of God dwelt
          between the cherubims, and afterwards shovelled it up into the ark, to
          be lodged with Aaron’s rod and the pot of manna.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. God’s holiness is slighted in depending upon our imperfect services
          to bear us out before the tribunal of God. This is too ordinary. The
          Jews were often infected with it (Rom. iii. 10), who, not well
          understanding the enormity of their transgressions, the interweaving
          of sin with their services, and the unspottedness of the Divine
          purity, mingled an opinion of merit with their sacrifices, and
          thought, by the cutting the throat of a beast, and offering it upon
          God’s altar, they had made a sufficient compensation to that holiness
          they had offended. Not to speak of many among the Romanists who have
          the same notion, thinking to make satisfaction to God by erecting an
          hospital, or endowing a church, as if this injured perfection could be
          contented with the dregs of their purses, and the offering of an
          unjust mammon, more likely to mind God of the injury they have done
          him, than contribute to the appeasing of him. But is it not too
          ordinary with miserable men, whose consciences accuse them of their
          crimes, to rely upon the mumbling of a few formal prayers, and in the
          strength of them, to think to stand before the tremendous tribunal of
          God, and meet with a discharge upon this account from any accusation
          this Divine perfection can present against them? Nay, do not the best
          Christians sometimes find a principle in them, that makes them stumble
          in their goings forth to Christ, and glorifying the holiness of God in
          that method which he hath appointed? Sometimes casting an eye at their
          grace, and sticking awhile to this or that duty, and gazing at the
          glory of the temple‑building, while they should more admire the
          glorious Presence that fills it. What is all this but a vilifying of
          the holiness of the Divine nature, as though it would be well enough
          contented with our impurities and imperfections, because they look
          like a righteousness in our estimation? As though dross and dung,
          which are the titles the apostles gives to all the righteousness of a
          fallen creature (Phil. iii. 8), were valuable in the sight of God, and
          sufficient to render us comely before him. It is a blasphemy against
          this attribute, to pretend that anything so imperfect, so daubed, as
          the best of our services are, can answer to that which is infinitely
          perfect, and be a ground of demanding eternal life: it is at best, to
          set up a gilded Dagon, as a fit companion for the ark of his Holiness;
          our own righteousness as a suitable mate for the righteousness of God:
          as if he had repented of the claim he made by the law to an exact
          conformity, and thrown off the holiness of his nature for the fondling
          of a corrupted creature. Rude and foolish notions of the Divine purity
          are clearly evidenced by any confidence in any righteousness of our
          own, though never so splendid. It is a rendering the righteousness of
          God as dull and obscure as that of men; a mere outside, as their own;
          as blind as the heathens pictured their Fortune, that knew as little
          how to discern the nature and value of the offerings made to her, as
          to distribute her gifts, as if it were all one to them, to have a dog
          or a lamb presented in sacrifice. As if God did not well understand
          his own nature, when he enacted so holy a law, and strengthened it
          with so severe a threatening; which must follow upon our conceit, that
          he will accept a righteousness lower than that which bears some
          suitableness to the holiness of his own nature, and that of his law;
          and that he could easily be put off with a pretended and counterfeit
          service. What are the services of the generality of men, but
          suppositions, that they can bribe God to an indulgence of them in
          their sins, and by an oral sacrifice, cause him to divest himself of
          his hatred of their former iniquities, and countenance their following
          practices. As the harlot, that would return fresh to her uncleanness,
          upon the confidence that her peace offering had contented the
          righteousness of God (Prov. vii. 14): as though a small service could
          make him wink at our sins, and lay aside the glory of his nature;
          when, alas! the best duties in the most gracious persons in this life,
          are but as the steams of a spiced dung‑hill, a composition of myrrh
          and froth, since there are swarms of corruptions in their nature, and
          secret sins that they need a cleansing from.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. It is a contemning the holiness of God, when we charge the law of
          God with rigidness. We cast dirt upon the holiness of God when we
          blame the law of God, because it shackles us, and prohibit our desired
          pleasures; and hate the law of God, as they did the prophets, because
          they did not prophesy smooth things; but called to them, to “get” them
          “out of the way, and turn aside out of the path, and cause the Holy
          One of Israel to cease from before them” (Isa. xxx. 10, 11). Put us no
          more in mind of the holiness of God, and the holiness of his law; it
          is a troublesome thing for us to hear of it: let him be gone from us,
          since he will not countenance our vices, and indulge our crimes; we
          would rather hear there is a God, than you would tell us of a holy
          one. We are contrary to the law, when we wish it were not so exact;
          and, therefore, contrary to the holiness of God, which set the stamp
          of exactness and righteousness upon it. We think him injurious to our
          liberty, when, by his precept he thwarts our pleasure; we wish it of
          another frame, more mild, more suitable to our minds: it is the same,
          as if we should openly blame God for consulting with his own
          righteousness, and not with our humors, before he settled his law;
          that he should not have drawn from the depths of his righteous nature,
          but squared it to accommodate our corruption. This being the language
          of such complaints, is a reproving God, because he would not be
          unholy, that we might be unrighteous with impunity. Had the Divine law
          been suited to our corrupt state, God must have been unholy to have
          complied with his rebellious creature. To charge the law with
          rigidness, either in language or practice, is the highest contempt of
          God’s holiness; for it is an implicit wish, that God were as defiled,
          polluted, disorderly, as our corrupted selves.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. The holiness of God is injured opinionatively. (1.) In the opinion
          of venial sins. The Romanists divide sins into venial and mortal:
          mortal, are those which deserve eternal death; venial, the lighter
          sort of sins, which rather deserve to be pardoned than punished; or if
          punished, not with an eternal, but temporal punishment. This opinion
          hath no foundation in, but is contrary to, Scripture. How can any sin
          be in its own nature venial, when the due “wages of every sin is
          death” (Rom. vi. 23)? and he who “continues not in every thing that
          the law commands,” falls under a “curse” (Gal. iii. 10). It is a mean
          thought of the holiness and majesty of God to imagine, that any sin
          which is against an infinite majesty, and as infinite a purity both in
          the nature of God and the law of God, should not be considered as
          infinitely heinous. All sins are transgressions of the eternal law,
          and in every one the infinite holiness of God is some way slighted.
          (2.) In the opinion of works of supererogation. That is, such works as
          are not commanded by God, which yet have such a dignity and worth in
          their own nature, that the performers of them do not only merit at
          God’s hands for themselves, but fill up a treasure of merits for
          others, that come short of fulfilling the precepts God hath enjoined.
          It is such a mean thought of God’s holiness, that the Jews, in all the
          charges brought against them in Scripture, were never guilty of. And
          if you consider what pitiful things they are, which are within the
          compass of such works, you have sufficient reason to bewail the
          ignorance of man, and the low esteem he hath of so glorious a
          perfection. The whipping themselves often in a week, extraordinary
          watchings, fastings, macerating their bodies, wearing a capuchin’s
          habit, &amp;c. are pitiful things to give content to an Infinite
          Purity. As if the precept of God required only the inferior degrees of
          virtue, and the counsels the more high and excellent; as if the law of
          God, which the Psalmist counts “perfect” (Ps. xix. 7), did not command
          all good, and forbid all evil; as if the holiness of God had forgotten
          itself in the framing the law, and made it a scanty and defective
          rule; and the righteousness of a creature were not only able to make
          an eternal righteousness, but surmount it. As man would be at first as
          knowing as God, so some of his posterity would be more holy than God;
          set up a wisdom against the wisdom of God, and a purity above the
          Divine purity. Adam was not so presumptuous; he intended no more than
          an equalling God in knowledge; but those would exceed him in
          righteousness, and not only presume to render a satisfaction for
          themselves to the holiness they have injured, but to make a purse for
          the supply of others that are indigent, that they may stand before the
          tribunal of God with a confidence in the imaginary righteousness of a
          creature. How horrible is it for those that come short of the law of
          God themselves, to think that they can have enough for a loan to their
          neighbors! An unworthy opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inform. 2. It may inform us, how great is our fall from God, and how
          distant we are from him. View the holiness of God, and take a prospect
          of the nature of man, and be astonished to see a person created in the
          Divine image, degenerated into the image of the devil. We are as far
          fallen from the holiness of God, which consists in a hatred of sin, as
          the lowest point of the earth is from the highest point of the
          heavens. The devil is not more fallen from the rectitude of his nature
          and likeness to God, than we are; and that we are not in the same
          condition with those apostate spirits, is not from anything in our
          nature, but from the mediation of Christ, upon which account God hath
          indulged in us a continuance of some remainders of that which Satan is
          wholly deprived of. We are departed from our original pattern; we were
          created to live the “life of God,” that is, a life of “holiness;” but
          now we are “alienated from the life of God” (Eph. iv. 18), and of a
          beautiful piece we are become deformed, daubed over with the most
          defiling mud: we “work uncleanness with greediness,” according to our
          ability, as creatures; as God doth work “holiness” with affection and
          ardency, according to his infiniteness, as Creator. More distant we
          are from God by reason of sin, than the vilest creature, the most
          deformed toad, or poisonous serpent, is from the highest and most
          glorious angel. By forsaking our innocence, we departed from God as
          our original copy. The apostle might well say (Rom. iii. 23), that by
          sin “we are come short of the glory of God.” Interpreters trouble
          themselves much about that place, “Man is come short of the glory of
          God,” that is, of the holiness of God, which is the glory of the
          Divine nature, and was pictured in the rational, innocent creature. By
          the “glory of God,” is meant the holiness of God; (as 1 Cor. iii. 18),
          “Beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, we are changed into
          the same image from glory to glory;” that is the glory of God in the
          text, into the image of which we are changed; but the Scripture speaks
          of no other image of God, but that of holiness; “we are come short of
          the glory of God;” of the holiness of God, which is the glory of God;
          and the image of it, which was the glory of man. By sin, which is
          particular in opposition to the purity of God, man was left many
          leagues behind any resemblance to God; he stripped off that which was
          the glory of his nature, and was the only means of glorifying God as
          his Creator. The word ὑστεροῦνται, the apostle uses, is very
          significant,—postponed by sin an infinite distance from any imitation
          of God’s holiness, or any appearance before him in a garb of nature
          pleasing to him. Let us lament our fall and distance from God.

          Inform. 3. All unholiness is vile, and opposite to the nature of God.
          It is such a loathsome thing, that the “purity of God’s eye is averse
          from beholding” (Hab. i. 3). It is not said there, that he will not,
          but he cannot, look on evil; there cannot be any amicableness between
          God and sin, the natures of both are so directly and unchangeably
          contrary to one another. Holiness is the life of God; it endures as
          long as his life; he must be eternally averse from sin, he can live no
          longer than he lives in the hatred and loathing of it. If he should
          for one instant cease to hate it, he would cease to live. To be a holy
          God, is as essential to him, as to be a living God; and he would not
          be a living God, but a dead God, if he were in the least point of time
          an unholy God. He cannot look on sin without loathing it; he cannot
          look on sin but his heart riseth against it; it must needs be most
          odious to him, as that which is against the glory of his nature, and
          directly opposite to that which is the lustre and varnish of all his
          other perfections. It is the “abominable thing which his soul hates”
          (Jer. xliv. 4); the vilest terms imaginable are used to signify it. Do
          you understand the loathsomeness of a miry swine, or the nauseousness
          of the vomit of a dog? these are emblems of sin (2 Peter ii. 22). Can
          you endure the steams of putrefied carcasses from an open sepulchre
          (Rom. iii. 23)? is the smell of the stinking sweat or excrements of a
          body delightful? the word ῥυπαρία in James i. 21, signifies as much.
          Or is the sight of a body overgrown with scabs and leprosy grateful to
          you? So vile, so odious is sin, in the sight of God. It is no light
          thing, then, to fly in the face of God; to break his eternal law; to
          dash both the tables in pieces: to trample the transcript of God’s own
          nature under our feet; to cherish that which was inconsistent with his
          honor; to lift up our heels against the glory of his nature; to join
          issue with the devil in stabbing his heart, and depriving him of his
          life. Sin, in every part of it, is an opposition to the holiness of
          God, and consequently an envying him a being and life, as well as a
          glory. If sin be such a thing, “ye that love the Lord, hate evil.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Inform. 4. Sin cannot escape a due punishment. A hatred of
          unrighteousness, and consequently a will to punish it, is as essential
          to God as a love of righteousness. Since he is not as an heathen idol,
          but hath eyes to see, and purity to hate every iniquity, he will have
          an infinite justice to punish whatsoever is against infinite holiness.
          As he loves everything that is amiable, so he loathes everything that
          is filthy, and that constantly, without any change; his whole nature
          is set against it; he abhors nothing but this. It is not the devil’s
          knowledge or activity that his hatred is terminated in, but the malice
          and unholiness of his nature; it is this only is the object of his
          severity; it is in the recompense of this only that there can be a
          manifestation of his justice. Sin must be punished; for,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This detestation of sin must be manifested. How should we certainly
          know his loathing of it, if he did not manifest, by some act, how
          ungrateful it is to him? As his love to righteousness would not
          appear, without rewarding it; so his hatred of iniquity would be as
          little evidenced, without punishing it; his justice is the great
          witness to his purity. The punishment, therefore, inflicted on the
          wicked, shall be, in some respect, as great as the rewards bestowed
          upon the righteous. Since the hatred of sin is natural to God, it is
          as natural to him to show, one time or other, his hatred of it. And
          since men have a conceit that God is like them in impurity, there is a
          necessity of some manifestation of himself to be infinitely distant
          from those conceits they have of him (Ps. l. 21); “I will reprove
          thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.” He would else
          encourage the injuries done to his holiness, favor the extravagances
          of the creature, and condemn, or at least slight, the righteousness
          both of his own nature, and his sovereign law. What way is there for
          God to manifest his hatred, but by threatening the sinner? and what
          would this be but a vain affrightment, and ridiculous to the sinner,
          if it were never to be put in execution? There is an indissoluble
          connection between his hatred of sin, and punishment of the offender
          (Ps. xi. 5, 6); “The wicked, his soul hates. Upon the wicked he shall
          rain snares, fire, and brimstone,” &amp;c. He cannot approve of it
          without denying himself; and a total impunity would be a degree of
          approbation. The displeasure of God is eternal and irreconcileable
          against sin; for sin being absolutely contrary to his holy nature, he
          is eternally contrary to it; if there be not, therefore, a way to
          separate the sin from the sinner, the sinner must lie under the
          displeasure of God; no displeasure can be manifested without some
          marks of it upon the person that lies under that displeasure. The
          holiness of God will right itself of the wrongs done to it, and
          scatter the profaners of it at the greatest distance from him, which
          is the greatest punishment that can be inflicted; to be removed far
          from the Fountain of Life is the worst of deaths; God can as soon lay
          aside his purity, as always forbear his displeasure against an impure
          person; it is all one not to hate it, and not to manifest his hatred
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As his holiness is natural and necessary, so is the punishment of
          unholiness necessary to him. It is necessary that he should abominate
          sin, and therefore necessary he should discountenance it. The
          severities of God against sin are not vain scare‑crows; they have
          their foundation in the righteousness of his nature; it is because he
          is a righteous and holy God, that he “will not forgive our
          transgressions and sins” (Josh. xxiv. 19), that is, that he will
          punish them. The throne of his “holiness is a fiery flame” (Dan. vii.
          9); there is both a pure light and a scorching heat. Whatsoever is
          contrary to the nature of God, will fall under the justice of God; he
          would else violate his own nature, deny his own perfection, seem to be
          out of love with his own glory and life. He doth not hate it out of
          choice, but from the immutable propension of his nature; it is not so
          free an act of his will, as the creation of man and angels, which he
          might have forborne as well as effected. As the detestation of sin
          results from the universal rectitude of his nature, so the punishment
          of sin follows upon that, as he is the righteous Governor of the
          world: it is as much against his nature not to punish it, as it is
          against his nature not to loathe it; he would cease to be holy if he
          ceased to hate it, and he would cease to hate it if he ceased to
          punish it. Neither the obedience of our Saviour’s life, nor the
          strength of his cries, could put a bar to the cup of his passion; God
          so hated sin, that when it was but imputed to his Son, without any
          commission of it, he would bring a hell upon his soul. Certainly if
          God could have hated sin without punishing it, his Son had never felt
          the smart of his wrath; his love to his Son had been strong enough to
          have caused him to forbear, had not the holiness of his nature been
          stronger to move him to inflict a punishment according to the demerit
          of his sin. God cannot but be holy, and therefore cannot but be just,
          because injustice is a part of unholiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Therefore there can be no communion between God and unholy spirits.
          How is it conceivable, that God should hate the sin, and cherish the
          sinner, with all his filth in his bosom? that he should eternally
          detest the crime, and eternally fold the sinner in his arms? Can less
          be expected from the purity of his nature, than to separate an impure
          soul, as long as it remains so? Can there be any delightful communion
          between those whose natures are contrary? Darkness and light may as
          soon kiss each other, and become one nature: God and the devil may as
          soon enter into an eternal league and covenant together. For God to
          have pleasure in wickedness, and to admit evil to dwell with him, are
          equally impossible to his nature (Ps. v. 4): while he hates impurity,
          he cannot have communion with an impure person. It may as soon be
          expected, that God should hate himself, offer violence to his own
          nature, lay aside his purity as an abominable thing, and blot his own
          glory, as love an impure person, entertain him as his delight, and set
          him in the same heaven and happiness with himself, and his holy
          angels. He must needs loathe him, he must needs banish him from his
          presence, which is the greatest punishment. God’s holiness and hatred
          of sin necessarily infer the punishment of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inform. 5. There is, therefore, a necessity of the satisfaction of the
          holiness of God by some sufficient mediator. The Divine purity could
          not meet with any acquiescence in all mankind after the fall: sin was
          hated; the sinner would be ruined, unless some way were found out to
          repair the wrongs done to the holiness of God; either the sinner must
          be condemned for ever, or some satisfaction must be made, that the
          holiness of the Divine nature might eternally appear in its full
          lustre. That it is essential to the nature of God to hate all
          unrighteousness, as that which is absolutely repugnant to his nature,
          none do question. That the justice of God is so essential to him, as
          that sin could not be pardoned without satisfaction, some do question;
          though this latter seems rationally to follow upon the former.930 That
          holiness is essential to the nature of God, is evident; because, else,
          God may as much be conceived without purity, as he might be conceived
          without the creating the sun or stars. No man can, in his right wits,
          frame a right notion of a Deity without purity. It would be less
          blasphemy against the excellency of God, to conceit him not knowing,
          than to imagine him not holy: and, for the essentialness of his
          justice, Joshua joins both his holiness and his jealousy as going hand
          in hand together (Josh. xxiv. 19); “He is a holy God, he is a jealous
          God, he will not forgive your sin.” But consider only the purity of
          God, since it is contrary to sin, and, consequently, hating the
          sinner; the guilty person cannot be reduced to God, nor can the
          holiness of God have any complacency in a filthy person, but as fire
          hath in stubble, to consume it. How the holy God should be brought to
          delight in man without a salvo for the rights of his holiness, is not
          to be conceived without an impeachment of the nature of God. The law
          could not be abolished; that would reflect, indeed, upon the
          righteousness of the Lawgiver: to abolish it, because of sin, would
          imply a change of the rectitude of his nature. Must he change his
          holiness for the sake of that which was against his holiness, in a
          compliance with a profane and unrighteous creature? This should engage
          him rather to maintain his law, than to null it; and to abrogate his
          law as soon as he had enacted it, since sin stepped into the world
          presently after it, would be no credit to his wisdom. There must be a
          reparation made of the honor of God’s holiness; by ourselves it could
          not be without condemnation; by another it could not be without a
          sufficiency in the person: no creature could do it. All the creatures
          being of a finite nature, could not make a compensation for the
          disparagements of Infinite Holiness. He must have despicable and vile
          thoughts of this excellent perfection, that imagines that a few tears,
          and the glavering fawnings at the death of a creature, can be
          sufficient to repair the wrongs, and restore the rights of this
          attribute. It must, therefore, be such a compensation as might be
          commensurate to the holiness of the Divine nature and the Divine law,
          which could not be wrought by any, but Him that was possessed of a
          Godhead to give efficacy and exact congruity to it. The Person
          designed and appointed by God for so great an affair, was “one in the
          form of God, one equal with God,” (Phil. ii. 6), who could not be
          termed by such a title of dignity, if he had not been equal to God in
          the universal rectitude of the Divine nature, and therefore in his
          holiness. The punishment due to sin is translated to that person for
          the righting Divine holiness, and the righteousness of that Person is
          communicated to the sinner for the pardon of the offending creature.
          If the sinner had been eternally damned, God’s hatred of sin had been
          evidenced by the strokes of his justice; but his mercy to a sinner had
          lain in obscurity. If the sinner had been pardoned and saved without
          such a reparation, mercy had been evident; but his holiness had hid
          its head for ever in his own bosom. There was therefore a necessity of
          such a way to manifest his purity, and yet to bring forth his mercy:
          that mercy might not alway sigh for the destruction of the creature,
          and that holiness might not mourn for the neglect of its honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inform. 6. Hence it will follow, there is no justification of a sinner
          by any thing in himself. After sin had set foot in the world, man
          could present nothing to God acceptable to him, or bearing any
          proportion to the holiness of his law, till God set forth a Person,
          upon whose account the acceptation of our persons and services is
          founded (Eph. i. 6), “Who hath made us accepted in the Beloved.” The
          Infinite purity of God is so glorious, that it shames the holiness of
          angels, as the light of the sun dims the light of the fire; much more
          will the righteousness of fallen man, who is vile, and “drinks up
          iniquity like water,” vanish into nothing in his presence. With what
          self‑abasement and abhorrence ought he to be possessed that comes as
          short of the angels in purity, as a dunghill doth of a star! The
          highest obedience that ever was performed by any mere man, since
          lapsed nature, cannot challenge any acceptance with God, or stand
          before so exact an inquisition. What person hath such a clear
          innocence, and unspotted obedience in such a perfection, as in any
          degree to suit the holiness of the Divine nature? (Ps. cxliii. 2):
          “Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no
          man living be justified.” If God should debate the case simply with a
          man in his own person, without respecting the Mediator, he were not
          able to “answer one of a thousand.” Though we are his servants, as
          David was, and perform a sincere service, yet there are many little
          motes and dust of sin in the best works, that cannot lie undiscovered
          from the eye of his holiness; and if we come short in the least of
          what the law requires, we are “guilty of all” (James ii. 10). So that
          “In thy sight shall no man living be justified;” in the sight of thy
          infinite holiness, which hates the least spot; in the sight of thy
          infinite justice, which punishes the least transgression. God would
          descend below his own nature, and vilify both his knowledge and his
          purity, should he accept that for a righteousness and holiness which
          is not so in itself; and nothing is so, which hath the least stain
          upon it contrary to the nature of God. The most holy saints in
          Scripture, upon a prospect of his purity, have cast away all
          confidence in themselves; every flash of the Divine purity has struck
          them into a deep sense of their own impurity and shame for it (Job
          xlii. 6), “Wherefore I abhor myself in dust and ashes.” What can the
          language of any man be that lies under a sense of infinite holiness
          and his own defilement in the least, but that of the prophet (Isa. vi.
          5), “Woe is me, I am undone?” And what is there in the world can
          administer any other thought than this, unless God be considered in
          Christ, “reconciling the world to himself?” As a holy God, so righted,
          as that he can dispense with the condemnation of a sinner, without
          dispensing with his hatred of sin; pardoning the sin in the criminal,
          because it hath been punished in the Surety. That righteousness which
          God hath “set forth” for justification, is not our own, but a
          “righteousness which is of God” (Phil. iii. 9, 10), of God’s
          appointing, and of God’s performing; appointed by the Father, who is
          God, and performed by the Son, who is one with the Father; a
          righteousness surmounting that of all the glorious angels, since it is
          an immutable one which can never fail, an “everlasting righteousness”
          (Dan. ix. 24); a righteousness wherein the holiness of God can
          acquiesce, as considered in itself, because it is a righteousness of
          one equal with God. As we therefore dishonor the Divine Majesty when
          we insist upon our own bemired righteousness for our justification as
          if “mortal man were as just as God,” and a “man as pure as his Maker”
          (Job iv. 17), so we highly honor the purity of his nature, when we
          charge ourselves with folly, acknowledge ourselves unclean, and accept
          of that righteousness which gives a full content to his infinite
          purity. There can be no justification of a sinner by anything in
          himself.

          Inform. 7. If holiness be a glorious perfection of the Divine nature,
          then the Deity of Christ might be argued from hence. He is indeed
          dignified with the title of the “Holy One” (Acts iii. 14, 16), a title
          often given to God in the Old Testament; and he is called the “Holy of
          holies” (Dan. ix. 24); but because the angels seemed to be termed
          “Holy ones” (Dan. iv. 13, 17), and the most sacred place in the temple
          was also called the “Holy of holies,” I shall not insist upon that.
          But you find our Saviour particularly applauded by the angels, as
          “holy,” when this perfection of the Divine nature, together with the
          incommunicable name of God, are linked together, and ascribed to him
          (Isa. vi. 3): “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; and the whole
          earth is full of his glory;” which the apostle interprets of “Christ”
          (John xii. 39, 41). Isaiah, again: “He hath blinded their eyes, and
          hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, nor
          understand with their hearts, and be converted, and I should heal
          them.” These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of
          him. He that Isaiah saw environed with the seraphims, in a reverential
          posture before his face, and praised as most holy by them, was the
          true and eternal God; such acclamations belong to none but the great
          Jehovah, God, blessed forever; but, saith John, it was the “glory of
          Christ” that Isaiah saw in this vision; Christ, therefore, is “God
          blessed forever,” of whom it was said, “Holy, holy, holy Lord of
          Hosts.”931 The evangelist had been speaking of Christ, the miracles
          which he wrought, the obstinacy of the Jews against believing on him;
          his glory, therefore, is to be referred to the subject he had been
          speaking of. The evangelist was not speaking of the Father, but of the
          Son, and cites those words out of Isaiah; not to teach anything of the
          Father, but to show that the Jews could not believe in Christ. He
          speaks of him that had wrought so many miracles; but Christ wrought
          those miracles: he speaks of him whom the Jews refused to believe on;
          but Christ was the person they would not believe on, while they
          acknowledged God. It was the glory of this person Isaiah saw, and this
          person Isaiah spake of, if the words of the evangelist be of any
          credit. The angels are too holy to give acclamations belonging to God,
          to any but him that is God.

          if he were not perfectly righteous and holy, he were incapable to
          govern and judge the world (Rom. iii. 5): “If there be unrighteousness
          with God, how shall he judge the world?” “God will not do wickedly,
          neither will the Almighty pervert judgment” (Job xxxiv. 12). How
          despicable is a judge that wants innocence! As omniscience fits God to
          be a judge, so holiness fits him to be a righteous judge (Ps. i. 6):
          “The Lord knows,” that is, loves, “the way of the righteous; but the
          way of the ungodly shall perish.”

          gives us a prospect of his nature, represents him in the “beauty of
          holiness” (Ps. cx. 3), more than the whole glass of the creation. It
          is in this evangelical glass the glory of the Lord is beheld, and
          rendered amiable and imitable (2 Cor. iii. 18). It is a doctrine
          “according to godliness” (1 Tim. vi. 3), directing us to live the life
          of God; a life worthy of God, and worthy of our first creation by his
          hand. It takes us off from ourselves, fixeth us upon a noble end,
          points our actions, and the scope of our lives to God. It quells the
          monsters of sin, discountenanceth the motes of wickedness; and it is
          no mean argument for the divinity of it, that it sets us no lower a
          pattern for our imitation, than the holiness of the Divine Majesty.
          God is exalted upon the throne of his holiness in it, and the creature
          advanced to an image and resemblance of it (1 Pet. i. 16): “Be ye
          holy, for I am holy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 2. The second use is for comfort. This attribute frowns upon
          lapsed nature, but smiles in the restorations made by the gospel.
          God’s holiness, in conjunction with his justice, is terrible to a
          guilty sinner; but now, in conjunction with his mercy, by the
          satisfaction of Christ, it is sweet to a believing penitent. In the
          “first covenant,” the purity of his nature was joined with the rigors
          of his justice; in the “second covenant,” the purity of his nature is
          joined with the sweetness and tenderness of his mercy. In the one,
          justice flames against the sinner in the right of injured holiness; in
          the other, mercy yearns towards a believer, with the consent of
          righted holiness. To rejoice in the holiness of God is the true and
          genuine spirit of a renewed man: “My heart rejoiceth in the
          Lord;”—what follows?—“There is none holy as the Lord” (1 Sam. ii. 1,
          2). Some perfections of the Divine nature are astonishing, some
          affrighting; but this may fill us both with astonishment at it, and a
          joy in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. By covenant, we have an interest in this attribute, as well as any
          other. In that clause of “God’s being our God,” entire God with all
          his glory, all his perfections are passed over as a portion, and a
          gracious soul is brought into union with God, as his God; not with a
          part of God, but with God in the simplicity, extent, integrity of his
          nature; and therefore in this attribute. And, upon some account, it
          may seem more in this attribute than in any other; for if he be our
          God, he is our God in his life and glory, and therefore in his purity
          especially, without which he could not live; he could not be happy and
          blessed. Little comfort will it be to have a dead God, or a vile God,
          made over to us; and as, by this covenant, he is our Father, so he
          gives us his nature, and communicates his holiness in all his
          dispensations; and in those that are severest, as well as those that
          are sweetest (Heb. xii. 10): “But he corrects us for our profit, that
          we might be partakers of his holiness.” Not simply “partakers of
          holiness,” but of “his holiness;” to have a portraiture of it in our
          nature, a medal of it in our hearts, a spark of the same nature with
          that immense splendor and flame in himself. The holiness of a covenant
          soul is a resemblance of the holiness of God, and formed by it; as the
          picture of the sun in a cloud is a fruit of his beams, and an image of
          its author. The fulness of the perfection of holiness remains in the
          nature of God, as the fulness of the light doth in the sun; yet there
          are transmissions of light from the sun to the moon, and it is a light
          of the same nature both in the one and in the other. The holiness of a
          creature is nothing else but a reflection of the Divine holiness upon
          it; and to make the creature capable of it, God takes various methods,
          according to his covenant grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This attribute renders God a fit object for trust and dependence.
          The notion of an unholy and unrighteous God, is an uncomfortable idea
          of him, and beats off our hands from laying any hold of him. It is
          upon this attribute the reputation and honor of God in the world is
          built; what encouragement can we have to believe him, or what
          incentives could we have to serve him, without the lustre of this in
          his nature? The very thought of an unrighteous God is enough to drive
          men at the greatest distance from him; as the honesty of a man gives a
          reputation to his word, so doth the holiness of God give credit to his
          promise. It is by this he would have us stifle our fears and fortify
          our trust (Isa. xli. 14): “Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of
          Israel; I will help thee, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the Holy
          One of Israel:” he will be in his actions what he is in his nature.
          Nothing shall make him defile his own excellency; unrighteousness is
          the ground of mutability; but the promise of God doth never fail,
          because the rectitude of his nature doth never languish: were his
          attributes without the conduct of this, they would be altogether
          formidable. As this is the glory of all his other perfections, so this
          only renders him comfortable to a believing soul. Might we not fear
          his power to crush us, his mercy to overlook us, his wisdom to design
          against us, if this did not influence them? What an oppression is
          power without righteousness in the hand of a creature; destructive,
          instead of protecting! The devil is a mighty spirit, but not fit to be
          trusted, because he is an impure spirit. When God would give us the
          highest security of the sincerity of his intentions, he swears by this
          attribute (Ps. viii. 35): his holiness, as well as his truth, is laid
          to pawn for the security of his promise. As we make God the judge
          between us and others, when we swear by him, so he makes his holiness
          the judge between himself and his people, when he swears by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is this renders him fit to be confided in for the answer of
          our prayers. This is the ground of his readiness to give. “If you,
          being evil, know how to give good gifts, how much more shall your
          Father which is in heaven give good gifts to them that ask him” (Matt.
          vii. 11)! Though the holiness of God be not mentioned, yet it is to be
          understood; the emphasis lies on these words, “if you, being evil:”
          God is then considered in a disposition contrary to this, which can be
          nothing but his righteousness. If you that are unholy, and have so
          much corruption in you, to render you cruel, can bestow upon your
          children the good things they want, how much more shall God, who is
          holy, and hath nothing in him to check his mercifulness to his
          creatures, grant the petitions of his supplicants! It was this
          attribute edged the fiduciary importunity of the souls under the
          altar, for the revenging their blood unjustly shed upon the earth:
          “How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not avenge our blood on
          them that dwell on the earth” (Rev. vi. 10)? Let not thy holiness
          stand with folded arms, as careless of the eminent sufferings of those
          that fear thee; we implore thee by the holiness of thy nature, and the
          truth of thy word.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This renders him fit to be confided in for the comfort of our
          souls in a broken condition. The reviving the hearts of the
          spiritually afflicted, is a part of the holiness of his nature; “Thus
          saith the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is
          Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a
          contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble” (Isa.
          lvii. 15). He acknowledgeth himself the lofty One; they might
          therefore fear he would not revive them; but he is also the holy One,
          and therefore he will refresh them; he is not more lofty than he is
          holy; besides, the argument of the immutability of his promise, and
          the might of his power, here is the holiness of his nature moving him
          to pity his drooping creature: his promise is ushered in with the name
          of power, “high and lofty One,” to bar their distrust of his strength,
          and with a declaration of his holiness, to check any despair of his
          will: there is no ground to think I should be false to my word, or
          misemploy my power, since that cannot be, because of the holiness of
          my name and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This renders him fit to be confided in for the maintenance of
          grace, and protection of us against our spiritual enemies. What our
          Saviour thought an argument in prayer, we may well take as a ground of
          our confidence. In the strength of this he puts up his suit, when in
          his mediatory capacity he intercedes for the preservation of his
          people (John xvii. 11); “Holy Father, keep through thy own name those
          that thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are.” “Holy
          Father,” not merciful Father, or powerful, or wise Father, but “holy;”
          and (ver. 25), “righteous Father.” Christ pleads that attribute for
          the performance of God’s word, which was laid to pawn when he passed
          his word: for it was by his holiness that he swore, that “his seed
          should endure forever, and his throne as the sun before him” (Ps.
          lxxxix. 36); which is meant of the perpetuity of the covenant which he
          made with Christ, and is also meant of the preservation of the
          mystical seed of David, and the perpetuating his loving‑kindness to
          them (ver. 32, 33). Grace is an image of God’s holiness, and,
          therefore, the holiness of God is most proper to be used as an
          argument to interest and engage him in the preservation of it. In the
          midst of church‑provocations, he will not utterly extinguish, because
          he is the “Holy One” in the midst of her (Hos. xi. 9): nor in the
          midst of judgments will he condemn his people to death, because he is
          “their Holy One” (Hab. i. 12); but their enemies shall be ordained for
          judgment, and established for correction. One prophet assures them in
          the name of the Lord, upon the strength of this perfection; and the
          other, upon the same ground, is confident of the protection of the
          church, because of God’s holiness engaged in an inviolable covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Comfort. Since holiness is a glorious perfection of the nature of
          God, “he will certainly value every holy soul.” It is of a greater
          value with him than the souls of all men in the world, that are
          destitute of it: “wicked men are the worst of vilenesses,” mere dross
          and dunghill.932 Purity, then, which is contrary to wickedness, must
          be the most precious thing in his esteem; he must needs love that
          quality which he is most pleased with in himself, as a father looks
          with most delight upon the child which is possessed with those
          dispositions he most values in his own nature. “His countenance doth
          behold the upright” (Ps. xi. 7). He looks upon them with a full and
          open face of favor, with a countenance clear, unmasked, and smiling
          with a face full of delight. Heaven itself is not such a pleasing
          object to him as the image of his own uncreated holiness in the
          created holiness of men and angels: as a man esteems that most which
          is most like him, of his own generation, more than a piece of art,
          which is merely the product of his wit or strength. And he must love
          holiness in the creature, he would not else love his own image, and,
          consequently, would undervalue himself. He despiseth the image the
          wicked bears (Ps. lxxiii. 20), but he cannot disesteem his own stamp
          on the godly; he cannot but delight in his own work, his choice work,
          the master‑piece of all his works, the new creation of things; that
          which is next to himself, as being a Divine nature like himself (2
          Pet. i. 4). When he overlooks strength, parts, knowledge, he cannot
          overlook this: he “sets apart him that is godly for himself” (Ps. iv.
          3), as a peculiar object to take pleasure in; he reserves such for his
          own complacency, when he leaves the rest of the world to the devil’s
          power; he is choice of them above all his other works, and will not
          let any have so great a propriety in them as himself. If it be so dear
          to him here in its imperfect and mixed condition, that he appropriates
          it as a peculiar object for his own delight, how much more will the
          unspotted purity of glorified saints be infinitely pleasing to him!
          so, that he will take less pleasure in the material heavens than in
          such a soul. Sin only is detestable to God; and when this is done
          away, the soul becomes as lovely in his account, as before it was
          loathsome.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is comfort, upon this account, that “God will perfect holiness
          in every upright soul.” We many times distrust God, and despond in
          ourselves, because of the infinite holiness of the Divine nature, and
          the dunghill corruption in our own; but the holiness of God engageth
          him to the preservation of it, and, consequently, to the perfection of
          it, as appears by our Saviour’s argument (John xvii. 11), “Holy
          Father, keep through thy own name, those whom thou hast given me;”—to
          what end?—“that they may be one as we are;” one with us, in the
          resemblances of purity. And the holiness of the soul is used as an
          argument by the Psalmist (Ps. lxxxvi. 2), “Preserve my soul, for I am
          holy;” that is, I have an ardent desire to holiness: thou hast
          separated me from the mass of the corrupted world, preserve and
          perfect me with the assembly of the glorified choir. The more holy any
          are, the more communicative they are; God being most holy, is most
          communicative of that which he most esteems in himself, and delights
          to see in his creature: he is, therefore, more ready to impart his
          holiness to them that beg for it, than to communicate his knowledge or
          his power. Though he were holy, yet he let Adam fall, who never
          petitioned his holiness to preserve him; he let him fall, to declare
          the holiness of his own nature, which had wanted its due manifestation
          without it: but since that cannot be declared in a higher manner than
          it hath been already in the death of the Surety, that bore our guilt,
          there is no fear he should cast the work out of his hands, since the
          design of the permission of man’s apostasy, in the discovery of the
          perfections of his nature, has been fully answered. The “finishing the
          good work he hath begun,” hath a relation to the glory of Christ; and
          his own glory in Christ to be manifested in the day of his appearing
          (Phil. i. 6), wherein the glory, both of his own holiness, and the
          holiness of the Mediator, are to receive their full manifestation. As
          it is a part of the holiness of Christ to “sanctify his church” (Eph.
          v. 26, 27) till not a wrinkle or spot be left, so it is the part of
          God not to leave that work imperfect which his holiness hath attempted
          a second time to beautify his creature with. He will not cease
          exalting this attribute, which is the believers’ by the new covenant,
          till he utters that applauding speech of his own work (Cant. iv. 7),
          “Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 3, is for Exhortation. Is holiness an eminent perfection of the
          Divine nature? then—
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 1. Let us get and preserve right and strong apprehensions of
          this Divine perfection. Without a due sense of it, we can never exalt
          God in our hearts; and the more distinct conceptions we have of this,
          and the rest of his attributes, the more we glorify him. When Moses
          considered God as “his strength and salvation,” he would exalt him
          (Exod. xv. 2); and he could never break out in so admirable a doxology
          as that in the text, without a deep sense of the glory of his purity,
          which he speaks of with so much admiration. Such a sense will be of
          use to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In promoting genuine convictions. A deep consideration of the
          holiness of God cannot but be followed with a deep consideration of
          our impure and miserable condition by reason of sin: we cannot glance
          upon it without reflections upon our own vileness. Adam no sooner
          heard the voice of a holy God in the garden, but he considered his own
          nakedness with shame and fear (Gen. iii. 10); much less can we fix our
          minds upon it, but we must be touched with a sense of our own
          uncleanness. The clear beams of the sun discover that filthiness in
          our garments and members, which was not visible in the darkness of the
          night. Impure metals are discerned by comparing them with that which
          is pure and perfect in its kind. The sense of guilt is the first
          natural result upon a sense of this excellent perfection; and the
          sense of the imperfection of our own righteousness is the next. Who
          can think of it, and reflect upon himself as an object fit for Divine
          love? Who can have a due thought of it, without regarding himself as
          stubble before a consuming fire? Who can, without a confusion of heart
          and face, glance upon that pure eye which beholds with detestation the
          foul motes, as well as the filthier and bigger spots? When Isaiah saw
          his glory, and heard how highly the angels exalted God for this
          perfection, he was in a cold sweat, ready to swoon, till a seraphim,
          with a coal from the altar, both purged and revived him (Isa. vi. 5,
          7). They are sound and genuine convictions, which have the prospect of
          Divine purity for their immediate spring, and not a foresight of our
          own misery; when it is not the punishment we have deserved, but the
          holiness we have offended, most grates our hearts. Such convictions
          are the first rude draughts of the Divine image in our spirits, and
          grateful to God, because they are an acknowledgment of the glory of
          this attribute, and the first mark of honor given to it by the
          creature. Those that never had a sense of their own vileness, were
          always destitute of a sense of God’s holiness. And, by the way, we may
          observe, that those that scoff at any for hanging down the head under
          the consideration and conviction of sin (as is too usual with the
          world), scoff at them for having deeper apprehensions of the purity of
          God than themselves, and consequently make a mock of the holiness of
          God which is the ground of those convictions; a sense of this would
          prevent such a damnable reproaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A sense of this will render us humble in the possession of the
          greatest holiness a creature were capable of. We are apt to be proud,
          with the Pharisee, when we look upon others wallowing in the mire of
          base and unnatural lusts: but let any clap their wings, if they can,
          in a vain boasting and exaltation, when they view the holiness of God.
          What torch, if it had reason, would be proud, and swagger in its own
          light, if it compared itself with the sun? “Who can stand before this
          holy Lord God?” is the just reflection of the holiest person, as it
          was of those (1 Sam. vi. 20) that had felt the marks of his jealousy
          after their looking into the ark, though likely out of affection to
          it, and triumphant joy at its return. When did the angels testify, by
          the covering of their faces, their weakness to bear the lustre of his
          majesty, but when they beheld his glory? When did they signify, by
          their covering their feet, the shame of their own vileness, but when
          their hearts were fullest of the applaudings of this perfection (Isa.
          vi. 2, 3)? Though they found themselves without spot, yet not with
          such a holiness that they could appear either with their faces or feet
          unvailed and unmasked in the presence of God. Doth the immense
          splendor of this attribute engender shaming reflections in those pure
          spirits? What will it, what should it, do in us, that dwell in houses
          of clay, and creep up and down with that clay upon our backs, and too
          much of it in our hearts? The stars themselves, which appear beautiful
          in the night, are masked at the awaking of the sun. What a dim light
          is that of a glow‑worm to that of the sun! The apprehensions of this
          made the elders humble themselves in the midst of their glory, by
          “casting down their crowns before his throne” (Rev. iv. 8, 10); a
          metaphor taken from the triumphing generals among the Romans, who hung
          up their victorious laurels in the Capitol, dedicating them to their
          gods, acknowledging them their superiors in strength, and authors of
          their victory. This self‑emptiness at the consideration of Divine
          purity, is the note of the true church, represented by the twenty‑four
          elders, and a note of a true member of the church; whereas boasting of
          perfection and merit is the property of the anti‑christian tribe, that
          have mean thoughts of this adorable perfection, and think themselves
          more righteous than the unspotted angels. What a self‑annihilation is
          there in a good man, when the sense of Divine purity is most lively in
          him! yea, how detestable is he to himself! There is as little
          proportion between the holiness of the Divine Majesty, and that of the
          most righteous creature, as there is between a nearness of a person
          that stands upon a mountain, to the sun, and of him that beholds him
          in a vale; one is nearer than the other, but it is an advantage not to
          be boasted of, in regard of the vast distance that is between the sun
          and the elevated spectator.

          3. This would make us full of an affectionate reverence in all our
          approaches to God. By this perfection God is rendered venerable, and
          fit to be reverenced by his creature; and magnificent thoughts of it
          in the creature would awaken him to an actual reverence of the Divine
          majesty (Ps. iii. 9): “Holy and reverend is his name;” a good opinion
          of this would engender in us a sincere respect towards him; we should
          then “serve the Lord with fear,” as the expression is (Ps. ii. 11),
          that is, be afraid to cast anything before him that may offend the
          eyes of his purity. Who would venture rashly and garishly into the
          presence of an eminent moralist, or of a righteous king upon his
          throne? The fixedness of the angels arose from the continual prospect
          of this. What if we had been with Isaiah when he saw the vision, and
          beheld him in the same glory, and the heavenly choir in their
          reverential posture in the service of God; would it not have barred
          our wanderings, and staked us down to our duty? Would not the
          fortifying an idea of it in our minds produce the same effect? It is
          for want of this we carry ourselves so loosely and unbecomingly in the
          Divine presence, with the same, or meaner, affections than those
          wherewith we stand before some vile creature that is our superior in
          the world; as though a piece of filthy flesh were more valuable than
          this perfection of the Divinity. How doth the Psalmist double his
          exhortation to men to sing praise to God (Ps. xlvii. 6): “Sing praises
          to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises;”
          because of his majesty, and the purity of his dominion! and (ver. 8),
          “God reigneth over the heathen, God sitteth upon the throne of his
          holiness.” How would this elevate us in praise, and prostrate us in
          prayer, when we praise and pray with an understanding and insight of
          that nature we bless or implore; as he speaks (ver. 7), “Sing ye
          praises with understanding.” The holiness of God in his government and
          dominion, the holiness of his nature, and the holiness of his
          precepts, should beget in us an humble respect in our approaches. The
          more we grow in a sense of this, the more shall we advance in the true
          performance of all our duties. Those nations which adored the sun, had
          they at first seen his brightness wrapped and masked in a cloud, and
          paid a veneration to it, how would their adorations have mounted to a
          greater point, after they had seen it in its full brightness, shaking
          off those vails, and chasing away the mists before it! what a profound
          reverence would they have paid it, when they beheld it in its glory
          and meridian brightness!933 Our reverence to God in all our addresses
          to him will arrive to greater degrees, if every act of duty be ushered
          in, and seasoned with the thoughts of God as sitting upon a throne of
          holiness; we shall have a more becoming sense of our own vileness, a
          greater ardor to his service, a deeper respect in his presence, if our
          understanding be more cleared, and possessed with notions of this
          perfection. Thus take a view of God in this part of his glory, before
          you fall down before his throne, and assure yourselves you will find
          your hearts and services quickened with a new and lively spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A due sense of this perfection in God would produce in us a fear of
          God, and arm us against temptation and sin. What made the heathen so
          wanton and loose, but the representations of their gods as vicious?
          Who would stick at adulteries, and more prodigious lusts, that can
          take a pattern for them from the person he adores for a deity? Upon
          which account Plato would have poets banished from his commonwealth,
          because, by dressing up their gods in wanton garbs in their poems,
          they encouraged wickedness in the people. But if the thoughts of God’s
          holiness were impressed upon us, we should regard sin with the same
          eye, mark it with the same detestation in our measures, as God himself
          doth. So far as we are sensible of the Divine purity, we should
          account sin vile as it deserves; we should hate it entirely, without a
          grain of love to it, and hate it perpetually (Ps. cxix. 104): “Through
          thy precepts I get understanding, therefore I hate every false way.”
          He looks into God’s statute‑book, and thereby arrives to an
          understanding of the purity of his nature, whence his hatred of
          iniquity commenced. This would govern our motion, check our vices; it
          would make us tremble at the hissing of a temptation: when a
          corruption did but peep out, and put forth its head, a look to the
          Divine Purity would be attended with a fresh convoy of strength to
          resist it. There is no such fortification, as to be wrapped up in the
          sense of this: this would fill us with an awe of God; we should be
          ashamed to admit any filthy thing into us, which we know is detestable
          to his pure eye. As the approach of a grave and serious man makes
          children hasten their trifles out of the way; so would a consideration
          of this attribute make us cast away our idols, and fling away our
          ridiculous thoughts and designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. A due sense of this perfection would inflame us with a vehement
          desire to be conformed to Him. All our desires would be ardent to
          regulate ourselves according to this pattern of holiness and goodness,
          which is not to be equalled; the contemplating it as it shines forth
          in the face of Christ, will “transform us into the same image” (2 Cor.
          iii. 19). Since our lapsed state, we cannot behold the holiness of God
          in itself without affrightment; nor is it an object of imitation, but
          as tempered in Christ to our view. When we cannot, without blinding
          ourselves, look upon the sun in its brightness, we may behold it
          through a colored glass, whereby the lustre of it is moderated,
          without dazzling our eyes. The sense of it will furnish us with a
          greatness of mind, that little things will be contemned by us; motives
          of a greater alloy would have little influence upon us; we should have
          the highest motives to every duty, and motives of the same strain
          which influence the angels above. It would change us, not only into an
          angelical nature, but a divine nature: we should act like men of
          another sphere; as if we had received our original in another world,
          and seen with angels the ravishing beauties of heaven. How little
          would the mean employments of the world sink us into dirt and mud! How
          often hath the meditation of the courage of a valiant man, or
          acuteness and industry of a learned person, spurred on some men to an
          imitation of them, and transformed them into the same nature! as the
          looking upon the sun imprints an image of the sun upon our eye, that
          we seem to behold nothing but the sun a while after. The view of the
          Divine purity would fill us with a holy generosity to imitate him,
          more than the examples of the best men upon earth. It was a saying of
          a heathen, that “if virtue were visible, it would kindle a noble flame
          of love to it in the heart, by its ravishing beauty.” Shall the
          infinite purity of the Author of all virtue come short of the strength
          of a creature? Can we not render that visible to us by frequent
          meditation, which, though it be invisible in his nature, is made
          visible in his law, in his ways, in his Son? It would make us ready to
          obey him, since we know he cannot command anything that is sinful, but
          what is holy, just, and good: it would put all our affections in their
          due place, elevate them above the creature, and subject them to the
          Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It would make us patient and contented under all God’s
          dispensations. All penal evils are the fruits of his holiness, as he
          is Judge and Governor of the world: he is not an arbitrary Judge, nor
          doth any sentence pronounced, nor warrant for execution issue from
          him, but what bears upon it a stamp of the righteousness of his
          nature; he doth nothing by passion or unrighteousness, but according
          to the eternal law of his own unstained nature, which is the rule to
          him in his works, the basis and foundation of his throne and sovereign
          dominion (Ps. lxxxix. 14): “Justice,” or righteousness, “and judgment
          are the habitation of thy throne;” upon these his sovereign power is
          established: so that there can be no just complaint or indictment
          brought against any of his proceedings with men. How doth our Saviour,
          who had the highest apprehensions of God’s holiness, justify God in
          his deepest distresses, when he cried, and was not answered in the
          particular he desired, in that prophetic Psalm of him (Ps. xxii. 2,
          3), “I cry day and night, but thou hearest not!” Thou seemest to be
          deaf to all my petitions, afar off “from the words of my roaring; but
          thou art holy;” I cast no blame upon thee: all thy dealings are
          squared by thy holiness: this is the only law to thee; in this I
          acquiesce. It is part of thy holiness to hide thy face from me, to
          show thereby thy detestation of sin. Our Saviour adores the Divine
          purity in his sharpest agony, and a like sense of it would guide us in
          the same steps to acknowledge and glorify it, in our greatest
          desertions and afflictions; especially since as they are the fruit of
          the holiness of his nature, so they are the means to impart to us
          clearer stamps of holiness, according to that in himself, which is the
          original copy (Heb. xii. 10). He melts us down as gold, to fit us for
          the receiving a new impression, to mortify the affections of the
          flesh, and clothe us with the graces of his Spirit. The due sense of
          this would make us to submit to his stroke, and to wait upon him for a
          good issue of his dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 2. Is holiness a perfection of the Divine nature? Is it the
          glory of the Deity? Then let us glorify this holiness of God. Moses
          glorifies it in the text, and glorifies it in a song, which was a copy
          for all ages. The whole corporation of seraphims have their mouths
          filled with the praises of it. The saints, whether militant on earth,
          or triumphant in heaven, are to continue the same acclamation, “Holy,
          holy, holy, Lord God of hosts” (Rev. iv. 8). Neither angels nor
          glorified spirits exalt at the same rate the power which formed them
          creatures, nor goodness which preserves them in a blessed immortality,
          as they do holiness, which they bear some beams of in their own
          nature, and whereby they are capacitated to stand before His throne.
          Upon the account of this, a debt of praise is demanded of all rational
          creatures by the Psalmist (Ps. xcix. 3), “Let them praise thy great
          and terrible name, for it is holy.” Not so much for the greatness of
          his Majesty, or the treasures of his justice; but as they are
          considered in conjunction with his holiness, which renders them
          beautiful; “for it is holy.” Grandeur and majesty, simply in
          themselves, are not objects of praise, nor do they merit the
          acclamations of men, when destitute of righteousness: this only
          renders everything else adorable; and this adorns the Divine greatness
          with an amiableness (Isa. xii. 6): “Great is the Holy One of Israel in
          the midst of thee;” and makes his might worthy of praise (Luke i. 49).
          In honoring this, which is the soul and spirit of all the rest, we
          give a glory to all the perfections which constitute and beautify his
          nature: and without the glorifying this we glorify nothing of them,
          though we should extol every other single attribute a thousand times.
          He values no other adoration of his creatures, unless this be
          interested, nor accepts anything as a glory from them (Lev. x. 3) “I
          will be sanctified in them that come near me, and I will be
          glorified:” as if he had said, In manifesting my name to be holy, you
          truly, you only honor me. And as the Scripture seldom speaks of this
          perfection without a particular emphasis, it teaches us not to think
          of it without a special elevation of heart: by this act only, while we
          are on earth, can we join consort with the angels in heaven; he that
          doth not honor it, delight in it, and in the meditation of it, hath no
          resemblance of it; he hath none of the image, that delights not in the
          original. Everything of God is glorious, but this most of all. If he
          built the world principally for anything, it was for the communication
          of his goodness, and display of his holiness. He formed the rational
          creature to manifest his holiness in that law whereby he was to be
          governed: then deprive not God of the design of his own glory. We
          honor this attribute,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. When we make it the ground of our love to God. Not because he is
          gracious to us, but holy in himself. As God honors it, in loving
          himself for it, we should honor it, by pitching our affections upon
          him chiefly for it. What renders God amiable to himself, should render
          him lovely to all his creatures (Isa. xlii. 21): “The Lord is well
          pleased for his righteousness’ sake.” If the hatred of evil be the
          immediate result of a love to God, then the peculiar object or term of
          our love to God, must be that perfection which stands in direct
          opposition to the hatred of evil (Ps. xcvii. 10): “Ye that love the
          Lord, hate evil.” When we honor his holiness in every stamp and
          impression of it: his law, not principally because of its usefulness
          to us, its accommodateness to the order of the world, but for its
          innate purity; and his people, not for our interest in them, so much
          as for bearing upon them this glittering mark of the Deity, we honor
          then the purity of the Lawgiver, and the excellency of the Sanctifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We honor it, when we regard chiefly the illustrious appearance of
          this in his judgments in the world. In a case of temporal judgment,
          Moses celebrates it in the text; in a case of spiritual judgments, the
          angels applaud it in Isaiah. All his severe proceedings are nothing
          but the strong breathings of this attribute. Purity is the flash of
          his revenging sword. If he did not hate evil, his vengeance would not
          reach the committers of it. He is a “refiner’s fire” in the day of his
          anger (Mal. iii. 2). By his separating judgments, “he takes away the
          wicked of the earth like dross” (Ps. cxix. 119). How is his holiness
          honored, when we take notice of his sweeping out the rubbish of the
          world; how he suits punishment to sin, and discovers his hatred of the
          matter and circumstances of the evil, in the matter and circumstances
          of the judgment. This perfection is legible in every stroke of his
          sword; we honor it when we read the syllables of it, and not by
          standing amazed only at the greatness and severity of the blow, when
          we read how holy he is in his most terrible dispensations: for as in
          them God magnifies the greatness of his power, so he sanctifies
          himself; that is, declares the purity of his nature as a revenger of
          all impiety (Ezek. xxxviii. 22, 23); “And I will plead against him
          with pestilence, and with blood: and I will rain upon him, and upon
          his bands, and upon the people that are with him, an overflowing rain
          and great hailstones; fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself,
          and sanctify myself.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We honor this attribute, when we take notice of it in every
          accomplishment of his promise, and every grant of a mercy. His truth
          is but a branch of his righteousness, a slip from this root. He is
          glorious in holiness in the account of Moses, because he “led forth
          his people whom he had redeemed” (Exod. xv. 13); his people by a
          covenant with their fathers, being the God of Moses, the God of
          Israel, and the God of their fathers (ver. 2). “My God, and my
          father’s God, I will exalt thee.” For what? for his faithfulness to
          his promise. The holiness of God, which Mary (Luke i. 49) magnifies,
          is summed up in this, the help he afforded his servant Israel in the
          “remembrance of his mercy, as he spake to our fathers, to Abraham and
          his seed forever” (ver. 54, 55). The certainty of his covenant mercy
          depends upon an unchangeableness of his holiness. What are “sure
          mercies,” (Isa. lv. 3), are holy mercies in the Septuagint, and in
          Acts xiii. 34, which makes that translation canonical. His nearness to
          answer us, when we call upon him for such mercies, is a fruit of the
          holiness of his name and nature (Ps. clxv. 17). “The Lord is holy in
          all his works; the Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him.”
          Hannah, after a return of prayer, sets a particular mark upon this, in
          her song (1 Sam. ii. 2); “There is none holy as the Lord;” separated
          from all dross, firm to his covenant, and righteous in it to his
          suppliants, that confide in him, and plead his word. When we observe
          the workings of this in every return of prayer, we honor it; it is a
          sign the mercy is really a return of prayer, and not a mercy of
          course, bearing upon it only the characters of a common providence.
          This was the perfection David would bless, for the catalogue of
          mercies in Ps. ciii. 1, &amp;c.; “Bless his holy name.” Certainly, one
          reason why sincere prayer is so delightful to him, is because it puts
          him upon the exercise of this his beloved perfection, which he so much
          delighteth to honor. Since God acts in all those as the governor of
          the world, we honor him not, unless we take notice of that
          righteousness which fits him for a governor, and is the inward spring
          of all his motions (Gen. xviii. 25). “Shall not the Judge of all the
          earth do right?” It was his design in his pity to Israel, as well as
          the calamities he intended against the heathens, to be “sanctified in
          them;” that is, declared holy in his merciful as well as his judicial
          procedure (Ezek. xxxvi. 21, 23). Hereby God credits his righteousness,
          which seemed to be forgotten by the one, and contemned by the
          other;934 he removes, by this, all suspicion of unfaithfulness in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We honor this attribute, when we trust his covenant, and promise
          against outward appearances. Thus our Saviour, in the prophecy of him
          (Ps. xxii. 2‒4), when God seemed to bar up the gates of his palace
          against the entry of any more petitions, this attribute proves the
          support of the Redeemer’s soul; “But thou art holy, O thou that
          inhabitest the praises of Israel:” as it refers to what goes before,
          it has been twice explained; as it refers to what follows, it is a
          ground of trust; “Thou inhabitest the praises of Israel:” thou hast
          had the praises of Israel for many ages, for thy holiness. How? “Our
          fathers trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them;” they honored
          thy holiness by their trust, and thou didst honor their faith by a
          deliverance; thou always hadst a purity that would not shame nor
          confound them. I will trust in thee as thou art holy, and expect the
          breaking out of this attribute for my good as well as my predecessors;
          “Our fathers trusted in thee,” &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We honor this attribute, when we show a greater affection to the
          marks of his holiness in times of the greatest contempt of it. As the
          Psalmist (Ps. cxix. 126, 127); “They have made void thy law, therefore
          I love thy commandments above gold;” while they spurn at the purity of
          thy law, I will value it above the gold they possess; I will esteem it
          as gold, because others count it as dross; by their scorn of it, my
          love to it shall be the warmer; and my hatred of iniquity shall be the
          sharper: the disdain of others should inflame us with a zeal and
          fortitude to appear in behalf of his despised honor. We honor this
          holiness many other ways; by preparation for our addresses to him, out
          of a sense of his purity; when we imitate it: as He honors us by
          “teaching us his statutes” (Ps. cxix. 135), so we honor him by
          learning and observing them. When we beg of him to show himself a
          refiner of us, to make us more conformable to him in holiness, and
          bless him for any communication of it to us, it renders us beautiful
          and lovely in his sight. To conclude: to honor it, is the way to
          engage it for us; to give it the glory of what it hath done, by the
          arm of power for our rescue from sin, and beating down our corruptions
          at his feet, is the way to see more of its marvellous works, and
          behold a clearer brightness. As unthankfulness makes him withdraw his
          grace (Rom. i. 21, 24), so glorifying him causes him to impart it. God
          honors men in the same way they honor him; when we honor him by
          acknowledging his purity, he will honor us by communicating of it to
          us. This is the way to derive a greater excellency to our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 3. Since holiness is an eminent perfection of the Divine
          nature, let us labor after a conformity to God in this perfection. The
          nature of God is presented to us in the Scripture, both as a pattern
          to imitate, and a motive to persuade the creature to holiness (1 John
          iii. 3; Matt. v. 48; Lev. xi. 44; 1 Pet. i. 15, 16). Since it is,
          therefore, the nature of God, the more our natures are beautified with
          it, the more like we are to the Divine nature. It is not the pattern
          of angels, or archangels, that our Saviour, or his apostle, proposeth
          for our imitation; but the original of all purity, God himself; the
          same that created us, to be imitated by us. Nor is an equal degree of
          purity enjoined us; though we are to be pure, and perfect, and
          merciful as God is, yet not essentially so; for that would be to
          command us an impossibility in itself; as much as to order us to cease
          to be creatures, and commence gods. No creature can be essentially
          holy but by participation from the chief Fountain of Holiness; but we
          must have the same kind of holiness, the same truth of holiness. As a
          short line may be as straight as another, though it parallel it not in
          the immense length of it; a copy may have the likeness of the
          original, though not the same perfection; we cannot be good, without
          eyeing some exemplar of goodness as the pattern. No pattern is so
          suitable as that which is the highest goodness and purity. That limner
          that would draw the most excellent piece, fixes his eyes upon the most
          perfect pattern. He that would be a good orator, or poet, or
          artificer, considers some person most excellent in each kind, as the
          object of his imitation. Who so fit as God to be viewed as the pattern
          of holiness, in our intendment of, and endeavor after holiness? The
          Stoics, one of the best sects of philosophers, advised their disciples
          to pitch upon some eminent example of virtue, according to which to
          form their lives; as Socrates, &amp;c. But true holiness doth not only
          endeavor to live the life of a good man, but chooses to live a divine
          life; as before the man was “alienated from the life of God” (Eph. iv.
          19), so, upon his return, he aspires after the life of God. To
          endeavor to be like a good man is to make one image like another; to
          set our clocks by other clocks, without regarding the sun: but true
          holiness consists in a likeness to the most exact sampler. God being
          the first purity, is the rule as well as the spring of all purity in
          the creature, the chief and first object of imitation. We disown
          ourselves to be his creatures, if we breathe not after a resemblance
          to him in what he is imitable. There was in man, as created according
          to God’s image, a natural appetite to resemble God: it was at first
          planted in him by the Author of his nature. The devil’s temptation of
          him by that motive to transgress the law, had been as an arrow shot
          against a brazen wall, had there not been a desire of some likeness to
          his Creator engraven upon him (Gen. iii. 5): it would have had no more
          influence upon him, than it could have had upon a mere animal. But man
          mistook the term; he would have been like God in knowledge, whereas,
          he should have affected a greater resemblance of him in purity. O that
          we could exemplify God in our nature! Precepts may instruct us more,
          but examples affect us more; one directs us, but the other attracts
          us. What can be more attractive of our imitation, than that which is
          the original of all purity, both in men and angels? This conformity to
          him consists in an imitation of him,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In his law. The purity of his nature was first visible in this
          glass; hence, it is called a “holy” law (Rom. vii. 12); a “pure” law
          (Ps. xix. 8). Holy and pure, as it is a ray of the pure nature of the
          Lawgiver. When our lives are a comment upon his law, they are
          expressive of his holiness: we conform to his holiness when we
          regulate ourselves by his law, as it is a transcript of his holiness:
          we do not imitate it, when we do a thing in the matter of it agreeable
          to that holy rule, but when we do it with respect to the purity of the
          Lawgiver beaming in it. If it be agreeable to God’s will, and
          convenient for some design of our own, and we do anything only with a
          respect to that design, we make not God’s holiness discovered in the
          law our rule, but our own conveniency: it is not a conformity to God,
          but a conformity of our actions to self. As in abstinence from
          intemperate courses, not because the holiness of God in his law hath
          prescribed it, but because the health of our bodies, or some noble
          contentments of life, require it; then it is not God’s holiness that
          is our rule, but our own security, conveniency, or something else
          which we make a God to ourselves. It must be a real conformity to the
          law: our holiness should shine as really in the practice, as God’s
          purity doth in the precept. God hath not a pretence of purity in his
          nature, but a reality: it is not only a sudden boiling up of an
          admiration of him, or a starting wish to be like him, from some sudden
          impression upon the fancy, which is a mere temporary blaze, but a
          settled temper of soul, loving everything that is like him, doing
          things out of a firm desire to resemble his purity in the copy he hath
          set; not a resting in negatives, but aspiring to positives; holy and
          harmless are distinct things: they were distinct qualifications in our
          High Priest in his obedience to the law (Heb. vii. 26), so they must
          be in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In his Christ. As the law is the transcript, so Christ is the image
          of his holiness: the glory of God is too dazzling to be beheld by us:
          the acute eye of an angel is too weak to look upon that bright sun
          without covering his face: we are much too weak to take our measures
          from that purity which is infinite in his nature. But he hath made his
          Son like us, that by the imitation of him in that temper, and shadow
          of human flesh, we may arrive to a resemblance of him (2 Cor. iii.
          18). Then there is a conformity to him, when that which Christ did is
          drawn in lively colors in the soul of a Christian; when, as he died
          upon the cross, we die to our sins; as he rose from the grave, we rise
          from our lusts; as he ascended on high, we mount our souls thither;
          when we express in our lives what shined in his, and exemplify in our
          hearts what he acted in the world, and become one with him, as he was
          separate from sinners. The holiness of God in Christ is our ultimate
          pattern: as we are not only to believe in Christ, but “by Christ in
          God” (John xiv. 1), so we are not only to imitate Christ, but the
          holiness of God as discovered in Christ. And, to enforce this upon us,
          let us consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is this only wherein he commands our imitation of him. We are
          not commanded to be mighty and wise, as God is mighty and wise: but
          “be holy, as I am holy.” The declarations of his power are to enforce
          our subjection; those of his wisdom, to encourage our direction by
          him; but this only to attract our imitation. When he saith, “I am
          holy,” the immediate inference he makes, is, “Be ye so too,” which is
          not the proper instruction from any other perfection.935 Man was
          created by Divine power, and harmonized by Divine wisdom, but not
          after them, or according to them, as the true image; this was the
          prerogative of Divine holiness, to be the pattern of his rational
          creature:936 wisdom and power were subservient to this, the one as the
          pencil, the other as the hand that moved it. The condition of a
          creature is too mean to have the communications of the Divine essence;
          the true impressions of his righteousness and goodness we are only
          capable of. It is only in those moral perfections we are said to
          resemble God. The devils, those impure and ruined spirits, are nearer
          to him in strength and knowledge than we are; yet in regard of that
          natural and intellectual perfection, never counted like him, but at
          the greatest distance from him, because at the greatest distance from
          his purity. God values not a natural might, nor an acute
          understanding, nor vouchsafes such perfections the glorious title of
          that of his image. Plutarch saith, God is angry with those that
          imitate his thunder or lightning, his works of majesty, but delighted
          with those that imitate his virtue.937 In this only we can never incur
          any reproof from him, but for falling short of him and his glory. Had
          Adam endeavored after an imitation of this, instead of that of Divine
          knowledge, he had escaped his fall, and preserved his standing; and
          had Lucifer wished himself like God in this, as well as his dominion,
          he had still been a glorious angel, instead of being now a ghastly
          devil: to reach after a union with the Supreme Being, in regard of
          holiness, is the only generous and commendable ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This is the prime way of honoring God. We do not so glorify God
          by elevated admirations, or eloquent expressions, or pompous services
          of him, as when we aspire to a conversing with him with unstained
          spirits, and live to him in living like him. The angels are not called
          holy for applauding his purity, but conforming to it. The more perfect
          any creature is in the rank of beings, the more is the Creator
          honored; as it is more for the honor of God to create an angel or man,
          than a mere animal; because there are in such clearer characters of
          Divine power and goodness, than in those that are inferior. The more
          perfect any creature is morally, the more is God glorified by that
          creature; it is a real declaration, that God is the best and most
          amiable Being; that nothing besides him is valuable, and worthy to be
          object of our imitation. It is a greater honoring of him, than the
          highest acts of devotion, and the most religious bodily exercise, or
          the singing this song of Moses in the text, with a triumphant spirit;
          as it is more the honor of a father to be imitated in his virtues by
          his son, than to have all the glavering commendations by the tongue or
          pen of a vicious and debauched child. By this we honor him in that
          perfection which is dearest to him, and counted by him as the chiefest
          glory of his nature. God seems to accept the glorifying this
          attribute, as if it were a real addition to that holiness which is
          infinite in his nature, and because infinite, cannot admit of any
          increase: and, therefore, the word sanctified is used instead of
          glorified. (Isa. viii. 13), “Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and
          let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.” And (Isa. xxix. 23),
          “They shall sanctify the holy One of Jacob, and fear the God of
          Israel.” This sanctification of God is by the fear of him, which
          signifies in the language of the Old Testament, a reverence of him,
          and a righteousness before him. He doth not say, when he would have
          his power or wisdom glorified, Empower me or make me wise; but when he
          would have his holiness glorified by the creature, it is, Sanctify me;
          that is, manifest the purity of my nature by the holiness of your
          lives: but he expresseth it in such a term, as if it were an addition
          to this infinite perfection; so acceptable it is to him, as if it were
          a contribution from his creature for the enlarging an attribute so
          pleasing to him, and so glorious in his eye. It is, as much as in the
          creature lies, a preserving the life of God, since this perfection is
          his life; and that he would as soon part with his life as part with
          his purity. It keeps up the reputation of God in the world, and
          attracts others to a love of him; whereas, unworthy carriages defame
          God in the eyes of men, and bring up an ill report of him, as if he
          were such an one as those that profess him, and walk unsuitably to
          their profession, appear to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This is the excellency and beauty of a creature. The title of
          “beauty” is given to it in Ps. cx. 3; “beauties,” in the plural
          number, as comprehending it in all other beauties whatsoever. What is
          a Divine excellency cannot be a creature’s deformity: the natural
          beauty of it is a representation of the Divinity; and a holy man ought
          to esteem himself excellent in being such in his measure as his God
          is, and puts his principal felicity in the possession of the same
          purity in truth. This is the refined complexion of the angels that
          stand before his throne. The devils lost their comeliness when they
          fell from it. It was the honor of the human nature of our Saviour, not
          only to be united to the Deity, but to be sanctified by it. He was
          “fairer than all the children of men,” because he had a holiness above
          the children of men: “grace was poured into his lips” (Ps. xlv. 2). It
          was the jewel of the reasonable nature in paradise: conformity to God
          was man’s original happiness in his created state; and what was
          naturally so, cannot but be immutably so in its own nature. The beauty
          of every copied thing consists in its likeness to the original;
          everything hath more of loveliness, as it hath greater impressions of
          its first pattern: in this regard holiness hath more of beauty on it
          than the whole creation, because it partakes of a greater excellency
          of God than the sun, moon, and stars. No greater glory can be, than to
          be a conspicuous and visible image of the invisible, and holy, and
          blessed God. As this is the splendor of all the Divine attributes, so
          it is the flower of all a christian’s graces, the crown of all
          religion: it is the glory of the Spirit. In this regard the king’s
          daughter is said to be “all glorious within” (Ps. xlv. 13). It is more
          excellent than the soul itself, since the greatest soul is but a
          deformed piece without it: a “diamond without lustre.”938 What are the
          noble faculties of the soul without it, but as a curious rusty watch,
          a delicate heap of disorder and confusion? It is impossible there can
          be beauty where there are a multitude of “spots and wrinkles” that
          blemish a countenance (Eph. v. 27). It can never be in its true
          brightness but when it is perfect in purity; when it regains what it
          was possessed of by creation, and dispossessed of by the fall, and
          recovers its primitive temper. We are not so beautiful by being the
          work of God, as by having a stamp of God upon us. Worldly greatness
          may make men honorable in the sight of creeping worms. Soft lives,
          ambitious reaches, luxurious pleasures, and a pompous religion, render
          no man excellent and noble in the sight of God: this is not the
          excellency and nobility of the Deity which we are bound to resemble;
          other lines of a Divine image must be drawn in us to render us truly
          excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It is our life. What is the life of God is truly the life of a
          rational creature.939 The life of the body consists not in the
          perfection of its members, and the integrity of its organs; these
          remain when the body becomes a carcass; but in the presence of the
          soul, and its vigorous animation of every part to perform the distinct
          offices belonging to each of them. The life of the soul consists not
          in its being, or spiritual substance, or the excellency of its
          faculties of understanding and will, but in the moral and becoming
          operations of them. The spirit is only “life because of righteousness”
          (Rom. viii. 10). The faculties are turned by it, to acquit themselves
          in their functions, according to the will of God; the absence of this
          doth not only deform the soul, but, in a sort, annihilate it, in
          regard of its true essence and end. Grace gives a Christian being, and
          a want of it is the want of a true being (1 Cor. xv. 10). When Adam
          divested himself of his original righteousness, he came under the
          force of the threatening, in regard of a spiritual death; every person
          is “morally dead while he lives” an unholy life (1 Tim. v. 6). What
          life is to the body, that is righteousness to the spirit; and the
          greater measure of holiness it hath, the more of life it hath, because
          it is in a greater nearness, and partakes more fully of the fountain
          of life. Is not that the most worthy life, which God makes most
          account of, without which his life could not be a pleasant and blessed
          life, but a life worse than death? What a miserable life is that of
          the men of the world, that are carried, with greedy inclinations, to
          all manner of unrighteousness, whither their interests or their lusts
          invite them! The most beautiful body is a carcass, and the most
          honorable person hath but a brutish life (Ps. xlix. 20); miserable
          creatures when their life shall be extinct without a Divine rectitude,
          when all other things will vanish as the shadows of the night at the
          appearance of the sun! Holiness is our life.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) It is this only fits us for communion with God. Since it is our
          beauty and our life, without it what communion can an excellent God
          have with deformed creatures; a living God with dead creatures?
          “Without holiness none shall see God” (Heb. xii. 14). The creature
          must be stripped of his unrighteousness, or God of his purity, before
          they can come together. Likeness is the ground of communion, and of
          delight in it: the opposition between God and unholy souls is as great
          as that between “light and darkness” (1 John i. 6). Divine fruition is
          not so much by a union of presence as a union of nature. Heaven is not
          so much an outward as an inward life; the foundation of glory is laid
          in grace; a resemblance to God is our vital happiness, without which
          the vision of God would not be so much as a cloudy and shadowy
          happiness, but rather a torment than a felicity; unless we be of a
          like nature to God, we cannot have a pleasing fruition of him. Some
          philosophers think that if our bodies were of the same nature with the
          heavens, of an ethereal substance, the nearness to the sun would
          cherish, not scorch us. Were we partakers of a Divine nature, we might
          enjoy God with delight; whereas, remaining in our unlikeness to him,
          we cannot think of him, and approach to him without terror. As soon as
          sin had stripped man of the image of God, he was an exile from the
          comfortable presence of God, unworthy for God to hold any
          correspondence with: he can no more delight in a defiled person than a
          man can take a toad into intimate converse with him; he would hereby
          discredit his own nature, and justify our impurity. The holiness of a
          creature only prepares him for an eternal conjunction with God in
          glory. Enoch’s walking with God was the cause of his being so soon
          wafted to the place of a full fruition of him; he hath as much delight
          in such as in heaven itself; one is his habitation as well as the
          other; the one is his habitation of glory, and the other is the house
          of his pleasure: if he dwell in Zion, it must be a “holy mountain”
          (Joel iii. 17), and the members of Zion must be upheld in their
          rectitude and integrity before they be “set before the face of God
          forever” (Ps. xli. 12). Such are styled his jewels, his portion, as if
          he lived upon them, as a man upon his inheritance. As God cannot
          delight in us, so neither can we delight in God without it. We must
          purify ourselves “as he is pure,” if we expect to “see him as he is,”
          in the comfortable glory and beauty of his nature (1 John iii. 2, 3),
          else the sight of God would be terrible and troublesome: we cannot be
          satisfied with the likeness of God at the resurrection, unless we have
          a righteousness wherewith to “behold his face” (Ps. xvii. 15). It is a
          vain imagination in any to think that heaven can be a place of
          happiness to him, in whose eye the beauty of holiness which fills and
          adorns it, is an unlovely thing; or that any can have a satisfaction
          in that Divine purity which is loathsome to him in the imitations of
          it. We cannot enjoy him, unless we resemble him; nor take any pleasure
          in him, if we were with him, without something of likeness to him.
          Holiness fits us for communion with God.
        </p>

          (6.) We can have no evidence of our election and adoption without it.
          Conformity to God, in purity, is the fruit of electing love (Eph. i.
          4); “He hath chosen us that we should be holy.” The goodness of the
          fruit evidenceth the nature of the root: this is the seal that assures
          us the patent is the authentic grant of the Prince. Whatsoever is
          holy, speaks itself to be from God; and whosoever is holy, speaks
          himself to belong to God. This is the only evidence that “we are born
          of God” (1 John ii. 29). The subduing our souls to him, the forming us
          into a resemblance to himself, is a more certain sign we belong to
          him, than if we had, with Isaiah, seen his glory in the vision, with
          all his train of angels about him. This justifies us to be the seed of
          God, when he hath, as it were, taken a slip from his own purity, and
          engrafted it in our spirits: he can never own us for his children
          without his mark, the stamp of holiness. The devil’s stamp is none of
          God’s badge. Our spiritual extraction from him is but pretended,
          unless we do things worthy of so illustrious a birth, and becoming the
          honor of so great a Father: what evidence can we else have of any
          child‑like love to God, since the proper act of love is to imitate the
          object of our affections? And that we may be in some measure like to
          God in this excellent perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Let us be often viewing and ruminating on the holiness of God,
          especially as discovered in Christ. It is by a believing meditation on
          him, that we are “changed into the same image” (2 Cor. iii. 18). We
          can think often of nothing that is excellent in the world, but it
          draws our faculties to some kind of suitable operation; and why should
          not such an excellent idea of the holiness of God in Christ perfect
          our understandings, and awaken all the powers of our souls to be
          formed to actions worthy of him? A painter employed in the limning
          some excellent piece, has not only his pattern before his eyes, but
          his eye frequently upon the pattern, to possess his fancy to draw
          forth an exact resemblance. He that would express the image of God,
          must imprint upon his mind the purity of his nature; cherish it in his
          thoughts, that the excellent beauty of it may pass from his
          understanding to his affections, and from his affections to his
          practice. How can we arise to a conformity to God in Christ, whose
          most holy nature we seldom glance upon, and more rarely sink our souls
          into the depths of it by meditation! Be frequent in the meditation of
          the holiness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. Let us often exercise ourselves in acts of love to God, because of
          this perfection. The more adoring thoughts we have of God, the more
          delightfully we shall aspire to, and more ravishingly catch after,
          anything that may promote the more full draught of his Divine image in
          our hearts. What we intensely affect, we desire to be as near to as we
          can, and to be that very thing, rather than ourselves. All imitations
          of others arise from an intense love to their persons or excellency.
          When the soul is ravished with this perfection of God, it will desire
          to be united with it; to have it drawn in it, more than to have its
          own being continued to it: it will desire and delight in its own
          being, in order to this heavenly and spiritual work. The impressions
          of the nature of God upon it, and the imitations of the nature of God
          by it, will be more desirable than any natural perfection whatsoever.
          The will in loving is rendered like the object beloved; is turned into
          its nature,940 and imbibes its qualities. The soul, by loving God,
          will find itself more and more transformed into the Divine image;
          whereas, slighted ensamples are never thought worthy of imitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. Let us make God our end. Every man’s mind forms itself to a
          likeness to that which it makes its chief end. An earthly soul is as
          drossy as the earth he gapes for; an ambitious soul is as elevated as
          the honor he reaches at; the same characters that are upon the thing
          aimed at, will be imprinted upon the spirit of him that aims at it.
          When God and his glory are made our end, we shall find a silent
          likeness pass in upon us; the beauty of God will by degrees enter upon
          our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. In every deliberate action, let us reflect upon the Divine purity
          as a pattern. Let us examine whether anything we are prompted unto
          bear an impression of God upon it; whether it looks like a thing that
          God himself would do in that case, were he in our natures and in our
          circumstances. See whether it hath the livery of God upon it, how
          congruous it is to his nature; whether, and in what manner, the
          holiness of God can be glorified thereby; and let us be industrious in
          all this; for can such an imitation be easy which is resisted by the
          constant assaults of the flesh, which is discouraged by our own
          ignorance, and depressed by our faint and languishing desires after
          it? O! happy we, if there were such a heart in us!
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 4. If holiness be a perfection belonging to the nature of God;
          then, where there is some weak conformity to the holiness of God, let
          us labor to grow up in it, and breathe after fuller measures of it.
          The more likeness we have to him, the more love we shall have from
          him. Communion will be suitable to our imitation; his love to himself
          in his essence, will cast out beams of love to himself in his image.
          If God loves holiness in a lower measure, much more will he love it in
          a higher degree, because then his image is more illustrious and
          beautiful, and comes nearer to the lively lineaments of his own
          infinite purity. Perfection in anything is more lovely and amiable
          than imperfection in any state; and the nearer anything arrives to
          perfection, the further are those things separated from it which might
          cool an affection to it. An increase in holiness is attended with a
          manifestation of his love (John xiv. 21): “He that hath my
          commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me, and he shall be
          loved of my Father, and I will love him, and I will manifest myself to
          him.” It is a testimony of love to God, and God will not be
          behind‑hand with the creature in kindness; he loves a holy man for
          some resemblance to him in his nature; but when there is an abounding
          in sanctified dispositions suitable to it, there is an increase of
          favor; the more we resemble the original, the more shall we enjoy the
          blessedness of that original: as any partake more of the Divine
          likeness, they partake more of the Divine happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 5. Let us carry ourselves holily, in a spiritual manner, in
          all our religious approaches to God (Ps. xciii. 5); “Holiness becomes
          thy house, O Lord, for ever.” This attribute should work in us a deep
          and reverential respect to God. This is the reason rendered why we
          should “worship at his footstool,” in the lowest posture of humility
          prostrate before him, because “he is holy” (Ps. xcix. 5). Shoes must
          be put off from our feet (Exod. iii. 5), that is, lusts from our
          affections, everything that our souls are clogged and bemired with, as
          the shoe is with dirt. He is not willing we should offer to him an
          impure soul, mired hearts, rotten carcasses, putrefied in vice, rotten
          in iniquity; our services are to be as free from profaneness, as the
          sacrifices of the law were to be free from sickliness or any blemish.
          Whatsoever is contrary to his purity, is abhorred by him, and unlovely
          in his sight; and can meet with no other success at his hands, but a
          disdainful turning away both of his eye and ear (Isa. i. 15). Since he
          is an immense purity, he will reject from his presence, and from
          having any communion with him, all that which is not conformable to
          him; as light chases away the darkness of the night, and will not mix
          with it. If we “stretch out” our “hands towards him,” we must “put
          iniquity far away from us” (Job xi. 13, 14); the fruits of all service
          will else drop off to nothing. “Then shall the offering of Judah and
          Jerusalem be pleasant to the Lord:” when? when the heart is purged by
          Christ sitting as a “purifier of silver” (Mal. iii. 3, 4). Not all the
          incense of the Indies yield him so sweet a savor, as one spiritual act
          of worship from a heart estranged from the vileness of the world, and
          ravished with an affection to, and a desire of imitating, the purity
          of his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 6. Let us address for holiness to God, the fountain of it. As
          he is the author of bodily life in the creature, so he is the author
          of his own life, the life of God in the soul. By his holiness he makes
          men holy, as the sun by his light enlightens the air. He is not only
          the Holy One, but our Holy One (Isa. xliii. 15); “The Lord that
          sanctifies us” (Levit. xx. 8). As he hath mercy to pardon us, so he
          hath holiness to purify us, the excellency of being a sun to comfort
          us, and a shield to protect us, giving “grace and glory” (Ps. lxxiv.
          11). Grace whereby we may have communion with him to our comfort, and
          strength against our spiritual enemies for our defence; grace as our
          preparatory to glory, and grace growing up till it ripen in glory. He
          only can mould us into a Divine frame; the great original can only
          derive the excellency of his own nature to us. We are too low, too
          lame, to lift up ourselves to it; too much in love with our own
          deformity, to admit of this beauty without a heavenly power inclining
          our desires for it, our affections to it, our willingness to be
          partakers of it. He can as soon set the beauty of holiness in a
          deformed heart, as the beauty of harmony in a confused mass, when he
          made the world. He can as soon cause the light of purity to rise out
          of the darkness of corruption, as frame glorious spirits out of the
          insufficiency of nothing. His beauty doth not decay; he hath as much
          in himself now as he had in his eternity; he is as ready to impart it,
          as he was at the creation; only we must wait upon him for it, and be
          content to have it by small measures and degrees. There is no fear of
          our sanctification, if we come to him as a God of holiness, since he
          is a God of peace, and the breach made by Adam is repaired by Christ
          (1 Thess. v. 23): “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly,”
          &amp;c. He restores the sanctifying Spirit which was withdrawn by the
          fall, as he is a God pacified, and his holiness righted by the
          Redeemer. The beauty of it appears in its smiles upon a man in Christ,
          and is as ready to impart itself to the reconciled creature, as before
          justice was to punish the rebellious one. He loves to send forth the
          streams of this perfection into created channels, more than any else.
          He did not design the making the creature so powerful as he might,
          because power is not such an excellency in his own nature, but as it
          is conducted and managed by some other excellency. Power is
          indifferent, and may be used well or ill, according as the possessor
          of it is righteous or unrighteous. God makes not the creature so
          powerful as he might, but he delights to make the creature that waits
          upon him as holy as it can be; beginning it in this world, and
          ripening it in the other. It is from him we must expect it, and from
          him that we must beg it, and draw arguments from the holiness of his
          nature, to move him to work holiness in our spirits; we cannot have a
          stronger plea. Purity is the favorite of his own nature, and delights
          itself in the resemblances of it in the creature. Let us also go to
          God, to preserve what he hath already wrought and imparted. As we
          cannot attain it, so we cannot maintain it without him. God gave it
          Adam, and he lost it; when God gives it us, we shall lose it without
          his influencing and preserving grace; the channel will be without a
          stream, if the fountain do not bubble it forth; and the streams will
          vanish, if the fountain doth not constantly supply them. Let us apply
          ourselves to him for holiness, as he is a God glorious in holiness; by
          this we honor God, and advantage ourselves.
