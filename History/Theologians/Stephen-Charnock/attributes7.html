        <h2>DISCOURSE VII.</h2>
        <p>ON GOD’S OMNIPRESENCE.</p>
        <p>
          Jeremiah xxiii. 24.—Can any hide himself in secret places, that I
          shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth?
          saith the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occasion of this discourse begins ver. 16, where God admonisheth
          the people, not to hearken to the words of the false prophets which
          spake a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the
          Lord. They made the people vain by their insinuations of peace, when
          God had proclaimed war and calamity; and uttered the dreams of their
          fancies, and not the visions of the Lord; and so turned the people
          from the expectation of the evil day which God had threatened (ver.
          17): “They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye
          shall have peace: and they say unto every one that walks after the
          imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.” And they
          invalidate the prophecies of those whom God had sent, ver. 18: “Who
          hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived and heard
          his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?” Who hath stood in
          the counsel of the Lord? Are they acquainted with the secrets of God
          more than we? Who have the word of the Lord, if we have not? Or, it
          may be a continuation of God’s admonition: believe not those prophets;
          for who of them have been acquainted with the secrets of God? or by
          what means should they learn his counsel? No; assure yourselves “a
          whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous
          whirlwind; it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked” (ver.
          19). A whirlwind shall come from Babylon; it is just at the door, and
          shall not be blown over; it shall fall with a witness upon the wicked
          people and the deceiving prophets, and sweep them together into
          captivity. For (ver. 20), “The anger of the Lord shall not return,
          until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his
          heart.” My fury shall not be a childish fury, that quickly
          languisheth, but shall accomplish whatsoever I threaten; and burn so
          hot, as not to be cool, till I have satisfied my vengeance; “in the
          latter days ye shall consider it perfectly” (ver. 20), when the storm
          shall beat upon you, you shall then know that the calamities shall
          answer the words you have heard. When the conqueror shall waste your
          grounds, demolish your houses, and manacle your hands, then shall you
          consider it, and have the wishes of fools, that you had had your eyes
          in your heads before; you shall then know the falseness of your
          guides, and the truth of my prophets, and discern who stood in the
          counsel of the Lord, and subscribe to the messages I have sent you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some understand this not only of the Babylonish captivity, but refer
          it to the time of Christ, and the false doctrine of men’s own
          righteousness in opposition to the righteousness of God; understanding
          this verse to be partly a threatening of wrath, which shall end in an
          advantage to the Jews, who shall in the latter time consider the
          falseness of their notions about a legal righteousness, and so make it
          a promise; they shall then know the intent of the Scripture, and in
          the latter days, the latter end of the world, when time shall be near
          the rolling up, they shall reflect upon themselves; they shall “look
          upon Him whom they have pierced;” and till these latter days, they
          shall be hardened, and believe nothing of evangelical truths. Now God
          denieth that he sent those prophets (ver. 21): “I have not sent these
          prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they
          prophesied.” They have intruded themselves without a commission from
          me, whatsoever their brags are. The reason to prove it is (ver. 22),
          “If they had stood in my counsel,” if they had been instructed, and
          inspired by me, “they would have caused my people to hear my words;”
          they would have regulated themselves according to my word, “and have
          turned them from their evil way;” i. e. endeavored to shake down their
          false confidences of peace, and make them sensible of their false
          notions of me, and my ways. Now because those false prophets could not
          be so impudent as to boast that they prophesied in the name of God,
          when they had not commission from him, unless they had some secret
          sentiment, that they and their intentions were hid from the knowledge
          and eye of God; he adds (ver. 33), “Am I a God at hand, and not a God
          afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see
          him?” Have I not the power of seeing and knowing what they do, what
          they design, what they think? Why should I not have such a power,
          since I fill heaven and earth by my essence? “Am I a God at hand, and
          not a God afar off?” He excludes here the doctrine of those that
          excluded the providence of God from extending itself to the inferior
          things of the earth; which error was ancient, as ancient as the time
          of Job, as appears by their opinion, that God’s eyes were hood‑winked
          and muffled by the thickness of the clouds, and could not pierce
          through their dark and dense body (Job xxii. 14): “Thick clouds are a
          covering to him, that he seeth not.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some refer it to time.633 Do you imagine me a God new framed like your
          idols, beginning a little time ago, and not existing before the
          foundation of the world; yea, from eternity? a God afar off, further
          than your acutest understandings can reach? I am of a longer standing,
          and you ought to know my majesty. But it rather refers to place than
          time. Do you think I do not behold everything in the earth, as well as
          in heaven? Am I locked up within the walls of my palace, and cannot
          peep out to behold the things done in the world? or that am I so
          linked to pleasure in the place of my glory, as earthly kings are in
          their courts, that I have no mind or leisure to take notice of the
          carriages of men upon earth? God doth not say, He was afar off, but
          only gives an account of the inward thoughts of their minds, or at
          least of the language expressed by their actions. The interrogation
          carries in it a strong affirmation, and assures us more of God’s care,
          and the folly of men in not considering it. “Am I a God at hand, and
          not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places?” (Heb.) In
          hiddenesses, in the deepest cells. What! are you besotted by your base
          lusts, that you think me a God careless, ignorant, blind, that I can
          see nothing, but as a purblind man, what is very near my eye? Are you
          so out of your wits, that you imagine you can deceive me? Do not all
          your behaviors speak such a sentiment to lie secret in your heart,
          though not formed into a full conception, yet testified by your
          actions? No, you are much mistaken; it is impossible but that I should
          see and know all things, since I am present with all things, and am
          not at a greater distance from the things on earth than from the
          things in heaven; for I fill all that vast fabric which is divided
          into those two parts of heaven and earth; and he that hath such an
          infinite essence, cannot be distant, cannot be ignorant; nothing can
          be far from his eyes, since everything is so near to his essence. So
          that it is an elegant expression of the omniscience of God, and a
          strong argument for it. He asserts, first, the universality of his
          knowledge; but lest they should mistake, and confine his presence only
          to heaven, he adds, That he “fills heaven and earth.” I do not see
          things so, as if I were in one place, and the things seen in another,
          as it is with man; but whatsoever I see, I see not without myself,
          because every corner of heaven and earth is filled by me. He that
          fills all, must needs see and know all. And indeed, men that question
          the knowledge of God, would be more convinced by the doctrine of his
          immediate presence with them. And this seems to be the design and
          manner of arguing in this place. Nothing is remote from my knowledge,
          because nothing is distant from my presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fill heaven and earth: he doth not say, “I am in heaven and earth,”
          but I fill heaven and earth; i. e. say some, with my knowledge,
          others, with my authority or my power.634 But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The word filling cannot properly be referred to the act of
          understanding and will. A presence by knowledge is to be granted, but
          to say such a presence fills a place is an improper speech: knowledge
          is not enough to constitute a presence. A man at London knows there is
          such a city as Paris, and knows many things in it; can he be
          concluded, therefore, to be present in Paris, or fill any place there,
          or be present with the things he knows there? If I know anything to be
          distant from me, how can it be present with me? For by knowing it to
          be distant, I know it not to be present. Besides, filling heaven and
          earth is distinguished here from knowing or seeing: his presence is
          rendered as an argument to prove his knowledge. Now a proposition, and
          the proof of that proposition, are distinct, and not the same. It
          cannot be imagined that God should prove idem per idem, as we say; for
          what would be the import of the speech then? I know all things, I see
          all things, because I know and see all things.635 The Holy Ghost here
          accommodates himself to the capacity of men; because we know that a
          man sees and knows that which is done, where he is corporally present;
          so he proves that God knows all things that are done in the most
          secret caverns of the heart, because he is everywhere in heaven and
          earth, as light is everywhere in the air, and air everywhere in the
          world. Hence the schools use the term repletive for the presence of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Nor by filling of heaven and earth is meant his authority and
          power. It would be improperly said of a king, that in regard of the
          government of his kingdom, is everywhere by his authority, that he
          fills all the cities and countries of his dominions. “I, do not I
          fill?”636 That “I” notes the essence of God, as distinguished
          according to our capacity, from the perfections pertaining to his
          essence, and is in reason better referred to the substance of God,
          than to those things we conceive as attributes in him. Besides, were
          it meant only of his authority or power, the argument would not run
          well. I see all things, because my authority and power fills heaven
          and earth. Power doth not always rightly infer knowledge, no, not in a
          rational agent. Many things in a kingdom are done by the authority of
          the king, that never arrive to the knowledge of the king. Many things
          in us are done by the power of our souls, which yet we have not a
          distinct knowledge of in our understandings. There are many motions in
          sleep, by the virtue of the soul informing the body, that we have not
          so much as a simple knowledge of in our minds. Knowledge is not
          rightly inferred from power, or power from knowledge. By filling
          heaven and earth is meant, therefore, a filling it with his essence.
          No place can be imagined that is deprived of the presence of God; and
          therefore when the Scripture anywhere speaks of the presence of God,
          it joins heaven and earth together: He so fills them, that there is no
          place without him. We do not say a vessel is full so long as there is
          any space to contain more. Not a part of heaven, nor a part of earth,
          but the whole heaven, the whole earth, at one and the same time. If he
          were only in one part of heaven, or one part of earth; nay, if there
          were any part of heaven, or any part of earth void of him, he could
          not be said to fill them. “I fill heaven and earth,” not a part of me
          fills one place, and another part of me fills another, but I, God,
          fill heaven and earth; I am whole God filling the heaven, and whole
          God, filling the earth. I fill heaven, and yet fill earth; I fill
          earth, and yet fill heaven, and fill heaven and earth at one and the
          same time. “God fills his own works,” a heathen philosopher saith.637
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Here is then a description of God’s presence. 1. By power, “Am I
          not a God afar off?” a God in the extension of his arm. 2. By
          knowledge, “Shall I not see them?” 3. By essence; as an undeniable
          ground for inferring the two former: “I fill heaven and earth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. God is essentially everywhere present in heaven and earth.
          If God be, he must be somewhere; that which is nowhere, is nothing.
          Since God is, he is in the world; not in one part of it; for then he
          were circumscribed by it: if in the world, and only there, though it
          be a great space, he were also limited. Some therefore said, “God was
          everywhere, and nowhere.”638 Nowhere, i. e. not bounded by any place,
          nor receiving from any place anything for his preservation or
          sustainment. He is everywhere, because no creature, either body or
          spirit, can exclude the presence of his essence; for he is not only
          near, but in everything (Acts xvii. 28): “In him we live, and move,
          and have our being.” Not absent from anything, but so present with
          them, that they live and move in him, and move more in God, than in
          the air or earth wherein they are; nearer to us than our flesh to our
          bones, than the air to our breath; he cannot be far from them that
          live, and have every motion in him. The apostle doth not say, By him,
          but in him, to show the inwardness of his presence. As eternity is the
          perfection whereby he hath neither beginning nor end, immutability is
          the perfection whereby he hath neither increase nor diminution, so
          immensity or omnipresence is that whereby he hath neither bounds nor
          limitation. As he is in all time, yet so as to be above time; so is he
          in all places, yet so as to be above limitation by any place. It was a
          good expression of a heathen to illustrate this, “That God is a sphere
          or circle, whose centre is everywhere, and circumference nowhere.” His
          meaning was, that the essence of God was indivisible; i. e. could not
          be divided. It cannot be said, here and there the lines of it
          terminate; it is like a line drawn out in infinite spaces, that no
          point can be conceived where its length and breadth ends. The sea is a
          vast mass of waters; yet to that it is said, “Hitherto shalt thou go,
          and no further.” But it cannot be said of God’s essence, hitherto it
          reaches, and no further; here it is, and there it is not. It is plain,
          that God is thus immense, because he is infinite; we have reason and
          Scripture to assent to it, though we cannot conceive it. We know that
          God is eternal, though eternity is too great to be measured by the
          short line of a created understanding. We cannot conceive the vastness
          and glory of the heavens, much less that which is so great, as to fill
          heaven and earth, yea (1 Kings viii. 27), “not to be contained in the
          heaven of Heavens.” Things are said to be present, or in a place,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Circumscriptive, as circumscribed. This belongs to things that have
          quantity, as bodies that are encompassed by that place wherein they
          are; and a body fills but one particular space wherein it is, and the
          space is commensurate to every part of it, and every member hath a
          distinct place. The hand is not in the same particular space that the
          foot or head is.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Definitive, which belongs to angels and spirits, which are said to
          be in a point, yet so as that they cannot be said to be in another at
          the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Repletive, filling all places. This belongs only to God: as he is
          not measured by time, so he is not limited by place. A body or spirit,
          because finite, fills but one space; God, because infinite, fills all,
          yet so as not to be contained in them, as wine and water is in a
          vessel. He is from the height of the heavens to the bottom of the
          deeps, in every point of the world, and in the whole circle of it, yet
          not limited by it, but beyond it. Now this hath been acknowledged by
          the wisest in the world. Some indeed had other notions of God. The
          more ignorant sort of the Jews confined him to the temple.639 And God
          intimates, that they had such a thought when he asserts his presence
          in heaven and earth, in opposition to the temple they built as his
          house, and the place of his rest.640 And the idolaters among them,
          thought their gods might be at a distance from them, which Elias
          intimates in the scoff he puts upon them (1 Kings xviii. 17), “Cry
          aloud, for he is a god,” meaning Baal; “either he is talking, or he is
          pursuing, or he is in a journey;” and they followed his advice, and
          cried louder (ver. 28), whereby it is evident, they looked not on it
          as a mock, but as a truth. And the Syrians called the God of Israel
          the God of the hills, as though his presence were fixed there, and not
          in the valleys (1 Kings xx. 23); and their own gods in the valleys,
          and not in the mountains; they fancied every god to have a particular
          dominion and presence in one place and not in another, and bounded the
          territories of their gods as they did those of their princes.641 And
          some thought him tied to and shut up in their temples and groves
          wherein they worshipped him.642 Some of them thought God to be
          confined to heaven, and therefore sacrificed upon the highest
          mountains, that the steam might ascend nearer heaven, and their
          praises be heard better in those places which were nearest to the
          habitation of God. But the wiser Jews acknowledged it, and therefore
          called God place,643 whereby they denoted his immensity; he was not
          contained in any place; every part of the world subsists by Him: he
          was a place to himself, greater than anything made by Him. And the
          wiser heathens acknowledged it also. One calls God a mind passing
          through the universal nature of things;644 another, that He was an
          infinite and immense air;645 another, that it is as natural to think
          God is everywhere, as to think that God is: hence they called God the
          soul of the world; that as the soul is in every part of the body to
          quicken it, so is God in every part of the world to support it. And
          there are some resemblances of this in the world, though no creature
          can fully resemble God in any one perfection; for then it would not be
          a creature, but God. But air and light are some resemblances of it:
          air is in all the spaces of the world, in the pores of all bodies, in
          the bowels of the earth, and extends itself from the lowest earth to
          the highest regions; and the heavens themselves are probably nothing
          else but a refined kind of air; and light diffuseth itself through the
          whole air, and every part of it is truly light, as every part of the
          air is truly air; and though they seem to be mingled together, yet
          they are distinct things, and not of the same essence; so is the
          essence of God in the whole world, not by diffusion as air or light,
          not mixed with any creature, but remaining distinct from the essence
          of any created being. Now, when this hath been owned by men instructed
          only in the school of nature, it is a greater shame to any acquainted
          with the Scripture to deny. For the understanding of this, there shall
          be some propositions premised in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. This is negatively to be understood. Our knowledge of God is
          most by withdrawing from him, or denying to him in our conceptions any
          weaknesses or imperfections in the creature. As the infiniteness of
          God is a denial of limitation of being, so immensity or omnipresence
          is a denial of limitation of place: and when we say, God is totus in
          every place, we must understand it thus; that he is not everywhere by
          parts, as bodies are, as air and light are; He is everywhere, i. e.
          his nature hath no bounds; he is not tied to any place, as the
          creature is, who, when he is present in one place, is absent from
          another. As no place can be without God, so no place can compass and
          contain him.
        </p>
        <p>Prop. II. There is an influential omnipresence of God.</p>
        <p>
          1. Universal with all creatures. He is present with all things by his
          authority, because all things are subject to him: by his power,
          because all things are sustained by him: by his knowledge, because all
          things are naked before him. He is present in the world, as a king is
          in all parts of his kingdom regally present: providentially present
          with all, since his care extends to the meanest of his creatures. His
          power reacheth all, and his knowledge pierceth all. As everything in
          the world was created by God, so everything in the world is preserved
          by God; and since preservation is not wholly distinct from creation,
          it is necessary God should be present with everything while he
          preserves it, as well as present with it when he created it. “Thou
          preservest man and beast” (Ps. xxxvi. 6). “He upholds all things by
          the word of his power” (Heb. i. 3). There is a virtue sustaining every
          creature, that it may not fall back into that nothing from whence it
          was elevated by the power of God. All those natural virtues we call
          the principles of operation, are fountains springing from his goodness
          and power; all things are acted and managed by him, as well as
          preserved by him; and in this sense God is present with all creatures;
          for whatsoever acts another, is present with that which it acts, by
          sending forth some virtue and influence whereby it acts: if free
          agents do not only live, but move in him and by him (Acts xvii. 28),
          much more are the motions of other natural agents by a virtue
          communicated to them, and upheld in them in the time of their acting.
          This virtual presence of God is evident to our sense, a presence we
          feel; his essential presence is evident in our reason. This
          influential presence may be compared to that of the sun, which though
          at so great a distance from the earth, is present in the air and earth
          by its light, and within the earth by its influence in concocting
          those metals which are in the bowels of it, without being
          substantially either of them. God is thus so intimate with every
          creature, that there is not the least particle of any creature, but
          the marks of his power and goodness are seen in it, and his goodness
          doth attend them, and is more swift in its effluxes than the breakings
          out of light from the sun, which yet are more swift than can be
          declared; but to say he is in the world only by his virtue, is to
          acknowledge only the effects of his power and wisdom in the world,
          that his eye sees all, his arm supports all, his goodness nourisheth
          all, but himself and his essence at a distance from them;646 and so
          the soul of man according to its measure would have in some kind a
          more excellent manner of presence in the body, than God according to
          the infiniteness of his Being with his creatures; for that doth not
          only communicate life to the body, but is actually present with it,
          and spreads its whole essence through the body and every member of it.
          All grant, that God is efficaciously in every creek of the world; but
          some say he is only substantially in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Limited to such subjects that are capacitated for this or that kind
          of presence. Yet it is an omnipresence, because it is a presence in
          all the subjects capacitated for it; thus there is a special
          providential presence of God with some in assisting them when he sets
          them on work as his instruments for some special service in the world.
          As with Cyrus (Isa. xlv. 2), “I will go before thee;” and with
          Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, whom he protected and directed to
          execute his counsels in the world; such a presence Judas and others647
          that shall not enjoy his glorious presence, had in the working of
          miracles in the world. Besides,648 as there is an effective presence
          of God with all creatures, because he produced them and preserves
          them, so there is an objective presence of God with rational
          creatures, because he offers himself to them to be known and loved by
          them. He is near to wicked men in the offers of his grace, “Call ye
          upon him while he is near” (Isa. lv. 6); besides, there is a gracious
          presence of God with his people in whom he dwells and makes his abode,
          as in a temple consecrated to him by the graces of the Spirit. “We
          will come” (John xiv. 23), i. e. the Father and the Son, and make our
          abode with him. He is present with all by the presence of his
          Divinity, but only in his saints by a presence of a gracious efficacy;
          he walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks, and hath dignified
          the congregation of his people with the title of Jehovah Shammah, “the
          Lord is there” (Ezek. xlviii. 35): “in Salem is his tabernacle, and
          his dwelling‑place in Sion” (Ps. lxxvi. 2). As he filled the
          tabernacle, so he doth the church with the signs of his presence; this
          is not the presence wherewith he fills heaven and earth. His Spirit is
          not bestowed upon all to reside in their hearts, enlighten their
          minds, and bedew them with refreshing comforts. When the Apostle
          speaks of God being “above all and through all” (Eph. iv. 6), above
          all in his majesty, through all in his providence; he doth not
          appropriate that as he doth what follows, “and in you all;” in you all
          by a special grace; as God was specially present with Christ by the
          grace of union, so he is specially present with his people by the
          grace of regeneration. So there are several manifestations of his
          presence; he hath a presence of glory in heaven, whereby he comforts
          the saints; a presence of wrath in hell, whereby he torments the
          damned; in heaven he is a God spreading his beams of light; in hell, a
          God distributing his strokes of justice; by the one he fills heaven;
          by the other he fills hell; by his providence and essence he fills
          both heaven and earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. III. There is an essential presence of God in the world. He is
          not only everywhere by his power upholding the creatures, by his
          wisdom understanding them, but by his essence containing them. That
          anything is essentially present anywhere, it hath from God; God is
          therefore much more present everywhere, for he cannot give that which
          he hath not.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He is essentially present in all places.649 It is as reasonable to
          think the essence of God to be everywhere as to be always. Immensity
          is as rational as eternity. That indivisible essence which reaches
          through all times may as well reach through all places. It is more
          excellent to be always than to be everywhere; for to be always in
          duration is intrinsical; to be everywhere is intrinsic. If the greater
          belongs to God, why not the less? As all times are a moment to his
          eternity, so all places are as a point to his essence. As he is larger
          than all time, so he is vaster than all place. The nations of the
          world are to him “as the dust of the balance” or “drop of a bucket”
          (Isa. xl. 15). “The nations are accounted as the small dust.” The
          essence of God may well be thought to be present everywhere with that
          which is no more than a grain of dust to him, and in all those isles,
          which, if put together, “are a very little thing” in his hand.
          Therefore, saith a learned Jew,650 if a man were set in the highest
          heavens he would not be nearer to the essence of God than if he were
          in the centre of the earth. Why may not the presence of God in the
          world be as noble as that of the soul in the body, which is generally
          granted to be essentially in every part of the body of man, which is
          but a little world, and animates every member by its actual presence,
          though it exerts not the same operation in every part?651 The world is
          less to the Creator than the body to the soul, and needs more the
          presence of God than the body needs the presence of the soul. That
          glorious body of the sun visits every part of the habitable earth in
          twenty‑four hours by its beams, which reaches the troughs of the
          lowest valleys as well as the pinnacles of the highest mountains; must
          we not acknowledge in the Creator of this sun an infinite greater
          proportion of presence? Is it not as easy, with the essence of God, to
          overspread the whole body of heaven and earth as it is for the sun to
          pierce and diffuse itself through the whole air, between it and the
          earth, and send up its light also as far to the regions above? Do we
          not see something like it in sounds and voices? Is not the same sound
          of a trumpet, or any other musical instrument, at the first breaking
          out of a blast, in several places within such a compass at the same
          time? Doth not every ear that hears it receive alike the whole sound
          of it? And fragrant odors, scented in several places at the same time,
          in the same manner; and the organ proper for smelling takes in the
          same in every person within the compass of it. How far is the noise of
          thunder heard alike to every ear in places something distant from one
          another! And do we daily find such a manner of presence in those
          things of so low a concern, and not imagine a kind of presence of God
          greater than all those? Is the sound of thunder, the voice of God as
          it is called, everywhere in such a compass? and shall not the essence
          of an infinite God be much more everywhere? Those that would confine
          the essence of God only to heaven, and exclude it from the earth, run
          into great inconveniences. It may be demanded whether he be in one
          part of the heavens or in the whole vast body of them. If in one part
          of them, his essence is bounded; if he moves from that part he is
          mutable, for he changes a place wherein he was, for another wherein he
          was not. If he be always fixed in one part of the heavens, such a
          notion would render him little better than a living statue.652 If he
          be in the whole heaven, why cannot his essence possess a greater space
          than the whole heavens, which are so vast? How comes he to be confined
          within the compass of that, since the whole heaven compasseth the
          earth? If he be in the whole heaven he is in places farther distant
          one from another than any part of the earth can be from the heavens;
          since the earth is like a centre in the midst of a circle, it must be
          nearer to every part of the circle than some parts of the circle can
          be to one another. If, therefore, his essence possesses the whole
          heavens, no reason can be rendered why he doth not also possess the
          earth, since also the earth is but a little point in comparison of the
          vastness of the heavens: if, therefore, he be in every part of the
          heavens, why not in every part of the earth? The Scripture is plain
          (Ps. cxxxix. 7‒9), “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither
          shall I fly from thy presence? If I ascend up to heaven, thou art
          there; if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there; if I take the
          wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
          even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall uphold
          me.” If he be in heaven, earth, hell, sea, he fills all places with
          his presence. His presence is here asserted in places the most distant
          from one another. All the places then between heaven and earth are
          possessed by his presence. It is not meant of his knowledge, for that
          the Psalmist had spoken of before (ver. 2, 3), “Thou understandest my
          thoughts afar off; thou art acquainted with all my ways:” besides,
          “thou art there;” not thy wisdom or knowledge, but thou, thy essence,
          not only thy virtue. For, having before spoken of his omniscience, he
          proves that such knowledge could not be in God, unless he were present
          in his essence in all places, so as to be excluded from none. He fills
          the depths of hell, the extension of the earth, and the heights of the
          heavens. When the Scripture mentions the power of God only, it
          expresseth it by hand or arm; but when it mentions the Spirit of God,
          and doth not intend the Third Person in the Trinity, it signifies the
          nature and essence of God. And so here, when he saith, “Whither shall
          I go from thy Spirit?” he adds, exegetically, “Whither shall I fly
          from thy presence?” or (Heb.) “face:” and the face of God in Scripture
          signifies the essence of God (Exod. xxxiii. 20, 23); “Thou canst not
          see my face,” and “My face shall not be seen.” The effects of his
          power, wisdom, and providence are seen, which are his back parts, but
          not his face. The effects of his power and wisdom are seen in the
          world, but his essence is invisible; and this the Psalmist elegantly
          expresseth, Had I wings endued with as much quickness as the first
          dawnings of the morning light, or the first darts of any sunbeam that
          spreads itself through the hemisphere, and passeth many miles in as
          short a space as I can think a thought, I should find thy presence in
          all places before me, and could not fly out of the infinite compass of
          thy essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. “He is essentially present with all creatures.” If he be in all
          places, it follows that he is with all creatures in those places; as
          he is in heaven, so he is with all angels; as he is in hell, so he is
          with all devils: as he is in the earth and sea, he is with all
          creatures inhabiting those elements; as his essential presence was the
          ground of the first being of things by creation, so it is the ground
          of the continued being of things by conservation; as his essential
          presence was the original, so it is the support of the existence of
          all the creatures. What are all those magnificent expressions of his
          creative virtue, but testimonies of his essential presence at the
          laying the foundation of the world (Isa. xl. 12), “when he measured
          the waters in the hollow of his hand, meted out heaven with the span,
          and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the
          mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?” He sets forth the
          power and majesty of God in the creation and preservation of things,
          and every expression testifies his presence with them. The waters that
          were upon the face of the earth at first were no more than a drop in
          the palm of a man’s hand, which in every part is touched by his hand;
          and thus he is equally present with the blackest devils, as well as
          the brightest angels; with the lowest dust, as well as with the most
          sparkling sun. He is equally present with the damned and the blessed,
          as he is an infinite Being, but not in regard of his goodness and
          grace. He is equally present with the good and the bad, with the
          scoffing Athenians, as well as the believing apostles, in regard of
          his essence, but not in regard of the breathing of his divine virtues
          upon them to make them like himself (Acts xvii. 27). “He is not far
          from every one of us; for in him we live, and move, and have our
          being.” The apostle includes all; he tells them they should seek the
          Lord; the Lord that they were to seek, is God essentially considered.
          We are, indeed, to seek the perfections of God, that glitter in his
          works, but to the end that they should direct us to the seeking of God
          himself in his own nature and essence;653 and, therefore, what
          follows, “In him we live,” is to be understood, not of his power and
          goodness, perfections of his nature, distinguished according to our
          manner of conception from his essence, but of the essential presence
          of God with his creatures. If he had meant it of his efficacy in
          preserving us, it had not been any proof of his nearness to us. Who
          would go about to prove the body or substance of the sun to be near us
          because it doth warm and enlighten us, when our sense evidenceth the
          distance of it? We live in the beams of the sun, but we cannot be said
          to live in the sun, which is so far distant from us. The expression
          seems to be more emphatical than to intend any less than his essential
          presence; but we live in him not only as the efficient cause of our
          life, but as the foundation sustaining our lives and motions, as if he
          were like air, diffused round about us; and we move in him, as Austin
          saith, as a sponge in the sea, not containing him, but being contained
          by him. He compasseth all, is encompassed by none; he fills all, is
          comprehended by none. The Creator contains the world, the world
          contains not the Creator; as the hollow of the hand contains the
          water, the water in the hollow of the hand contains not the hand; and
          therefore some have chose to say, rather, that the world is in God, it
          lives and moves in him, than that God is in the world. If all things
          thus live and move in him, then he is present with everything that
          hath life and motion; and as long as the devils and damned have life,
          and motion, and being, so long is he with them; for whatsoever lives
          and moves, lives and moves in him. This essential presence is,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Without any mixture. I fill heaven and earth; not, I am mixed
          with heaven and earth: his essence is not mixed with the creatures; it
          remains entire in itself. The sponge retains the nature of a sponge,
          though encompassed by the sea, and moving in it; and the sea still
          retains its own nature. God is most simple; his essence therefore is
          not mixed with anything. The light of the sun is present with the air,
          but not mixed with it; it remains light, and the air remains air; the
          light of the sun is diffused through all the hemisphere, it pierceth
          all transparent bodies, it seems to mix itself with all things, yet
          remains unmixed and undivided; the light remains light, and the air
          remains air; the air is not light, though it be enlightened. Or, take
          this similitude: When many candles are lighted up in a room, the light
          is all together, yet not mixed with one another; every candle hath a
          particular light belonging to it, which may be separated in a moment,
          by removing one candle from another; but if they were mixed, they
          could not be separated, at least so easily. God is not formally one
          with the world, or with any creature in the world by his presence in
          it; nor can any creature in the world, no, not the soul of man, or an
          angel, come to be essentially one with God, though God be essentially
          present with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The essential presence is without any division of himself. “I
          fill heaven and earth,” not part in heaven, and part in earth; I fill
          one as well as the other: one part of his essence is not in one place,
          and another part of his essence in another place, he would then be
          changeable; for that part of his essence which were now in this place,
          he might alter it to another, and place that part of his essence which
          were in another place to this; but he is undivided everywhere. As his
          eternity is one indivisible point, though in our conception we divide
          it into past, present, and to come, so the whole world is as a point
          to him, in regard of place, as before was said; it is as a small dust,
          and grain of dust: it is impossible that one part of his essence can
          be separated from another, for he is not a body, to have one part
          separable from another. The light of the sun cannot be cut into parts,
          it cannot be shut into any place and kept there, it is entire in every
          place. Shall not God, who gives the light that power, be much more
          present himself? Whatsoever hath parts is finite, but God is infinite,
          therefore hath no parts of his essence. Besides, if there were such a
          division of his being, he would not be the most simple and
          uncompounded being, but would be made up of various parts; he would
          not be a Spirit, for parts are evidences of composition; and it could
          not be said that God is here or there, but only a part of God here,
          and a part of God there. But he fills heaven and earth; he is as much
          a God in the earth beneath as in heaven above (Deut. iv. 39); entirely
          in all places, not by scraps and fragments of his essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This essential presence is not by multiplication. For that which
          is infinite cannot multiply itself, or make itself more or greater
          than it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) This essential presence is not by extension or diffusion, as a
          piece of gold may be beaten out to cover a large compass of ground;
          no, if God should create millions of worlds he would be in them all,
          not by stretching out his being, but by the infiniteness of his being;
          not by a new growth of his being, but by the same essence he had from
          eternity: upon the same reasons mentioned before, his simplicity and
          indivisibility.

          (5.) But totally. There is no space, not the least, wherein God is not
          wholly, according to his essence, and wherein his whole substance doth
          not exist; not a part of heaven can be designed wherein the Creator is
          not wholly; as he is in one part of heaven, he is in every part of
          heaven. Some kind of resemblance we may have from the water of the
          sea, which fills the great space of the world, and is diffused through
          all; yet the essence of water is in every drop of water in the sea, as
          much as the whole; and the same quality of water, though it comes
          short in quantity; and why shall we not allow God a nobler way of
          presence without diffusion, as is in that? or take this resemblance;
          since God likens himself to light in the Scripture, “he covereth
          himself with light.”654 A crystal globe hung up in the air hath light
          all about it, all within it, every part is pierced by it, wherever you
          see the crystal you see the light; the light in one part of the
          crystal cannot be distinguished from the light in the other part; and
          the whole essence of light is in every part; and shall not God be as
          much present with his creatures, as one creature can be with
          another?655 God is totally everywhere by his own simple substance.

          Prop. IV. God is present beyond the world. He is within and above all
          places, though places should be infinite in number; as he was before
          and beyond all time, so he is above and beyond all place; being from
          eternity before any real time, he must also be without as well as
          within any real space; if God were only confined to the world, he
          would be no more infinite in his essence than the world is in
          quantity; as a moment cannot be conceived from eternity, wherein God
          was not in being, so a space cannot be conceived in the mind of man,
          wherein God is not present; he is not contained in the world nor in
          the heavens (1 Kings viii. 27). “But will God indeed dwell on the
          earth? Behold, the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.” Solomon
          wonders that God should appoint a temple to be erected to him upon the
          earth, when he is not contained in the vast circuit of the heavens;
          his essence is not straitened in the limits of any created work; he is
          not contained in the heavens, i. e. in the manner that he is there;
          but he is there in his essence, and therefore cannot be contained
          there in his essence. If it should be meant only of his power and
          providence, it would conclude also for his essence; if his power and
          providence were infinite, his essence must be so too; for the
          infiniteness of his essence is the ground of the infiniteness of his
          power. It can never enter into any thought, that a finite essence can
          have an infinite power, and that an infinite power can be without an
          infinite essence; it cannot be meant of his providence, as if Solomon
          should say, the heaven of heavens cannot contain thy providence; for
          naming the heaven of heavens, that which encircles and bounds the
          other parts of the world, he could not suppose a providence to be
          exercised where there was no object to exercise it about; as no
          creature is mentioned to be beyond the uttermost heaven, which he
          calls here the heaven of heavens: besides, to understand it of his
          providence, doth not consist with Solomon’s admiration: he wonders
          that God, that hath so immense an essence, should dwell in a temple
          made with hands; he could not so much wonder at his providence in
          those things that immediately concern his worship. Solomon plainly
          asserts this of God, That he was so far from being bounded within the
          rich wall of the temple, which with so much cost he had framed for the
          glory of his name, that the richer palace of the heaven of heavens
          could not contain him; it is true, it could not contain his power and
          wisdom, because his wisdom could contrive other kind of worlds, and
          his power erect them. But doth the meaning of that wise king reach no
          farther than this? Will the power and wisdom of God reside on the
          earth? He was too wise to ask such a question, since every object that
          his eyes met with in the world resolved him, that the wisdom and power
          of God dwelt upon the earth, and glittered in everything he had
          created; and reason would assure him that the power that had framed
          this world, was able to frame any more; but Solomon, considering the
          immensity of God’s essence, wonders that God should order a house to
          be built for him, as if he wanted roofs and coverings, and habitation,
          as bodily creatures do. Will God indeed dwell in a temple, who hath an
          essence so immense as not to be contained in the heaven of heavens? It
          is not the heaven of heavens that can contain him, his substance. Here
          he asserts the immensity of his essence, and his presence not only in
          the heaven, but beyond the heavens; he that is not contained in the
          heavens, as a man is in a chamber, is without, and above, and beyond
          the heavens; it is not said, they do not contain him, but it is
          impossible they should contain him; they cannot contain him. It is
          impossible, then, but that he should be above them; he that is without
          the compass of the world, is not bounded by the limits of the world,
          as his power is not limited by the things he hath made, but can create
          innumerable worlds, so can his essence be in innumerable spaces; for
          as he hath power enough to make more worlds, so he hath essence enough
          to fill them, and therefore cannot be confined to what he hath already
          created; innumerable worlds cannot be a sufficient place to contain
          God; he can only be a sufficient place to himself;656 He that was
          before the world, and place, and all things, was to himself a world, a
          place, and everything:657 He is really out of the world in himself, as
          he was in himself before the creation of the world: as because God was
          before the foundation of the world, we conclude his eternity; so
          because he is without the bounds of the world, we conclude his
          immensity, and from thence his omnipresence. The world cannot be said
          to contain him, since it was created by him; it cannot contain him
          now, who was contained by nothing before the world was: as there was
          no place to contain him before the world was, there can be no place to
          contain him since the world was. God might create more worlds,
          circular and round as this, and those could not be so contiguous, but
          some spaces would be left between; as, take three round balls, lay
          them as close as you can to one another, there will be some spaces
          between; none would say but God would be in these spaces, as well as
          in the world he had created, though there were nothing real and
          positive in those spaces: why should we then exclude God from those
          imaginary spaces without the world? God might also create many worlds,
          and separate them by distances, that they might not touch one another,
          but be at a great distance from one another; and would not God fill
          them as well as he doth this? if so, he must also fill the spaces
          between them; for if he were in all those worlds, and not in the
          spaces between those worlds, his essence would be divided; there would
          be gaps in it, his essence would be cut into parts, and the distance
          between every part of his essence, would be as great as the space
          between each world. The essence of God may be conceived then well
          enough to be in all those infinite spaces where he can erect new
          worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall give one place more to prove both these propositions, viz.
          that God is essentially in every part of the world, and essentially
          above ours without the world (Isa. lxvi. 1): “The heaven is my throne,
          and the earth is my footstool.” He is essentially in every part of the
          world; he is in heaven and earth at the same time, as a man is upon
          his throne and his footstool. God describes himself in a human shape,
          accommodated to our capacity; as if he had his head in heaven, and his
          feet on earth. Doth not his essence then, fill all intermediate spaces
          between heaven and earth? As when the head of a man is in the upper
          part of a room, and his feet upon the floor, his body fills up the
          space between the head and his feet: this is meant of the essence of
          God; it is a similitude drawn from kings sitting upon the throne, and
          not their power and authority, but the feet of their persons are
          supported by the footstool; so here it is not meant only of the
          perfections of God, but the essence of God. Besides, God seems to tax
          them with an erroneous conceit they had, as though his essence were in
          the temple, and not in any part of the world; therefore God makes an
          opposition between heaven and earth, and the temple: “Where is the
          house that you built unto me? and where is the place of my rest?” Had
          he understood it only of his providence, it had not been anything
          against their mistake; for they granted his providence to be not only
          in the temple, but in all parts of the world. “Where is the house that
          you build to me;” to Me, not to my power or providence, but think to
          include Me within those walls. Again, it shows God to be above the
          heavens, if the heavens be his throne; he sits upon them, and is above
          them, as kings are above the thrones on which they sit. So it cannot
          be meant of his providence, because no creature being without the
          sphere of the heavens, there is nothing of the power and the
          providence of God visible there, for there is nothing for him to
          employ his providence about; for providence supposeth a creature in
          actual being; it must be therefore meant of his essence, which is
          above the world and in the world. And the like proof you may see (Job.
          xi. 7, 8), “It is as high as heaven, what canst thou do? deeper than
          hell, what canst thou know? the measure thereof is longer than the
          earth, and broader than the sea.” Where he intends the
          unsearchableness of God’s wisdom, but proves it by the infiniteness of
          his essence, (Heb.) “he is the height of the heavens,” he is the top
          of all the heavens; so that, when you have begun at the lowest part,
          and traced him through all the creatures, you will find his essence
          filling all the creatures, to be at the top of the world, and
          infinitely beyond it.

          Prop. V. This is the property of God, incommunicable to any creature.
          As no creature can be eternal and immutable, so no creature can be
          immense, because it cannot be infinite; nothing can be of an infinite
          nature, and therefore nothing of an immense presence but God. It
          cannot be communicated to the human nature of Christ, though in union
          with the Divine;658 some indeed argue, that Christ in regard of his
          human nature is everywhere, because he sits at the right hand of God,
          and the right hand of God is everywhere. His sitting at the right hand
          of God signifies his exaltation, and cannot with any reason, be
          extended to such a kind of arguing. “The hearts of kings are in the
          hand of God;” are the hearts of kings everywhere, because God’s hand
          is everywhere? The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God; is
          the soul, therefore, of every righteous man everywhere in the world?
          The right hand of God is from eternity; is the humanity of Christ,
          therefore, from eternity, because it sits at the right hand of God?
          The right hand of God made the world; did the humanity of Christ,
          therefore, make heaven and earth? the humanity of Christ must then be
          confounded with his divinity; be the same with it, not united to it.
          All creatures are distinct from their Creator, and cannot inherit the
          properties essential to his nature, as eternity, immensity,
          immutability, omnipresence, omniscience; no angel, no soul, no
          creature can be in all places at once; before they can be so they must
          be immense, and so must cease to be creatures, and commence God; this
          is impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Reasons to prove God’s essential presence. Reason I. Because he is
          infinite. As he is infinite, he is everywhere; as he is simple, his
          whole essence is everywhere: for, in regard of his infiniteness, he
          hath no bounds; in regard of his simplicity, he hath no parts: and,
          therefore, those that deny God’s omnipresence, though they pretend to
          own him infinite, must really conceive him finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God is infinite in his perfections. None can set bounds to
          terminate the greatness and excellency of God (Ps. cxlv. 3): “His
          greatness is unsearchable,” Sept. οὐκ ἔστι πέρας, there is no end, no
          limitation. What hath no end is infinite; his power is infinite (Job
          v. 9): “which doth great things and unsearchable;”—no end of those
          things he is able to do. His wisdom infinite (Ps. cxlvii. 5); he
          understands all things past, present, and to come; what is already
          made, what is possible to be made. His duration infinite (Job xxxvi.
          26): “The number of his years cannot be searched out,” ἀπέραντος. To
          make a finite thing of nothing is an argument of an infinite virtue.
          Infinite power can only extract something out of the barren womb of
          nothing; but all things were drawn forth by the word of God, the
          heavens, and all the host of them; the sun, moon, stars, the rich
          embellishments of the world, appeared in being “at the breath of his
          mouth” (Ps. xxxiii. 6). The author, therefore, must be infinite; and
          since nothing is the cause of God, or of any perfection in him,—since
          he derives not his being, or the least spark of his glorious nature,
          from anything without him,—he cannot be limited in any part of his
          nature by anything without him; and, indeed, the infiniteness of his
          power and his other perfections is asserted by the prophet, when he
          tells us that “the nations are as a drop of a bucket, or the dust of
          the balance, and less than nothing and vanity” (Isa. xl. 15, 17), they
          are all so in regard of his power, wisdom, &amp;c. Conceive what a
          little thing a grain of dust or sand is to all the dust that may be
          made by the rubbish of a house: what a little thing the heap of the
          rubbish of a house is to the vast heap of the rubbish of a whole city,
          such an one as London; how little that, also, would be to the dust of
          a whole empire; how inconsiderable that, also, to the dust of one
          quarter of the world, Europe or Asia; how much less that, still, to
          the dust of the whole world! The whole world is composed of an
          unconceivable number of atoms, and the sea of an unconceivable number
          of drops; now what a little grain of dust is in comparison to the dust
          of the whole world—a drop of water from the sea, to all the drops
          remaining in the sea—that is the whole world to God. Conceive it still
          less, a mere nothing, yet is it all less than this in comparison of
          God; there can be nothing more magnificently expressive of the
          infiniteness of God to a human conception, than this expression of God
          himself in the prophet. In the perfection of a creature, something
          still may be thought greater to be added to it; but God containing all
          perfections in himself formally, if they be mere perfections, and
          eminently, if they be but perfections in the creature, mixed with
          imperfection, nothing can be thought greater, and therefore every one
          of them is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If his perfections be infinite, his essence must be so. How God can
          have infinite perfections, and a finite essence, is unconceivable by a
          human or angelical understanding; an infinite power, an infinite
          wisdom, an infinite duration, must needs speak an infinite essence;
          since the infiniteness of his attributes is grounded upon the
          infiniteness of his essence: to own infinite perfections in a finite
          subject is contradictory. The manner of acting by his power, and
          knowing by his wisdom, cannot exceed the manner of being by his
          essence. His perfections flow from his essence, and the principle must
          be of the same rank with what flows from it; and, if we conceive his
          essence to be the cause of his perfections, it is utterly impossible
          that an infinite effect should arise from a finite cause: but, indeed,
          his perfections are his essence; for though we conceive the essence of
          God as the subject, and the attributes of God as faculties and
          qualities in that subject, according to our weak model, who cannot
          conceive of an infinite God without some manner of likeness to
          ourselves—who find understanding, and will, and power in us distinct
          from our substance; yet truly and really there is no distinction
          between his essence and attributes; one is inseparable from the other.
          His power and wisdom are his essence; and therefore to maintain God
          infinite in the one, and finite in the other, is to make a monstrous
          god, and have an unreasonable notion of the Deity; for there would be
          the greatest disproportion in his nature, since there is no greater
          disproportion can possibly be between one thing and another than there
          is between finite and infinite. God must not only then be compounded,
          but have parts of the greatest distance from one another in nature;
          but God, being the most simple being without the least composition,
          both must be equally infinite: if, then, his essence be not infinite,
          his power and wisdom cannot be infinite, which is both against
          scripture and reason. Again, how should his essence be finite, and his
          perfections be infinite, since nothing out of himself gave them either
          the one or the other?659 Again, either the essence can be infinite, or
          it cannot; if it cannot, there must be some cause of that
          impossibility; that can be nothing without him, because nothing
          without him can be as powerful as himself, much less too powerful for
          him; nothing within him can be an enemy to his highest perfection;
          since he is necessarily what he is, he must be necessarily the most
          perfect being, and therefore necessarily infinite, since to be
          something infinitely is a greater perfection than to be something
          thing finitely:660 if he can be infinite he is infinite, otherwise he
          could be greater than he is, and so more blessed and more perfect than
          he is, which is impossible: for being the most perfect Being, to whom
          nothing can be added, he must needs be infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, therefore, God have an infinite essence, he hath an infinite
          presence. An infinite essence cannot be contained in a finite place,
          as those things which are finite have a bounded space wherein they
          are; so that which is infinite hath an unbounded space; for, as
          finiteness speaks limitedness, so infiniteness speaks unboundedness;
          and if we grant to God an infinite duration, there is no difficulty in
          acknowledging an infinite presence: indeed, the infiniteness of God is
          a property belonging to him in regard of time and place; he is bounded
          by no place, and limited to no time. Again, infinite essence may as
          well be everywhere, as infinite power reaches everything; it may as
          well be present with every being, as infinite power in its working may
          be present with nothing to bring it into being. Where God works by his
          power, he is present in his essence; because his power and his essence
          cannot be separated; and therefore his power, wisdom, goodness, cannot
          be anywhere where his essence is not: his essence cannot be severed
          from his power, nor his power from his essence; for the power of God
          is nothing but God acting, and the wisdom of God nothing but God
          knowing. As the power of God is always, so is his essence—as the power
          of God is everywhere, so is his essence: whatsoever God is, he is
          alway, and everywhere. To confine him to a place, is to measure his
          essence; as to confine his actions, is to limit his power; his essence
          being no less infinite than his power and his wisdom, can be no more
          bounded than his power and wisdom; but they are not separable from his
          essence, yea, they are his essence. If God did not fill the whole
          world, he would be determined to some place, and excluded from others;
          and so his substance would have bounds and limits, and then something
          might be conceived greater than God; for we may conceive that a
          creature may be made by God of so vast a greatness as to fill the
          whole world, for the power of God is able to make a body that should
          take up the whole space between heaven and earth, and reach to every
          corner of it. But nothing can be conceived by any creature greater
          than God; he exceeds all things, and is exceeded by none. God,
          therefore, cannot be included in heaven, nor included in the earth;
          cannot be contained in either of them; for, if we should imagine them
          vaster than they are, yet still they would be finite; and if his
          essence were contained in them, it could be no more infinite than the
          world which contains it, as water is not of a larger compass than the
          vessel which contains it. If the essence of God were limited, either
          in the heavens or earth, it must needs be finite, as the heaven and
          earth are; but there is no proportion between finite and infinite;
          God, therefore, cannot be contained in them. If there were an infinite
          body, that must be everywhere; certainly, then, an infinite Spirit
          must be everywhere; unless we will account him finite, we can render
          no reason why he should not be in one creature as well as in another.
          If he be in heaven, which is his creature, why can he not be in the
          earth, which is as well his creature as the heavens?
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason II. Because of the continual operation of God in the world.
          This was one reason which made the heathen believe that there was an
          infinite Spirit in the vast body of the world, acting in everything,
          and producing those admirable motions which we see everywhere in
          nature: that cause which acts in the most perfect manner, is also in
          the most perfect manner present with its effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          God preserves all, and therefore is in all; the apostle thought it a
          good induction (Acts xvii. 27), “He is not far from us, for in him we
          live.” For being as much as because, shows, that from his operation he
          concluded his real presence with all: it is not, His virtue is not far
          from every one of us, but He, his substance, himself; for, none that
          acknowledge a God will deny the absence of the virtue of God from any
          part of the world. He works in everything, everything lives and works
          in him; therefore he is present with all:661 or rather, if things
          live, they are in God, who gives them life. If things live, God is in
          them, and gives them life; if things move, God is in them, and gives
          them motion; if things have any being, God is in them, and gives them
          being; if God withdraws himself, they presently lose their being, and
          therefore some have compared the creature to the impression of a seal
          upon the water, that cannot be preserved but by the presence of the
          seal. As his presence was actual with what he created, so his presence
          is actual with what preserves, since creation and preservation do so
          little differ; if God creates things by his essential presence, by the
          same he supports them; if his substance cannot be disjoined from his
          preserving power, his power and wisdom cannot be separated from his
          essence; where there are the marks of the one, there is the presence
          of the other; for it is by his essence that he is powerful and wise;
          no man can distinguish the one from the other in a simple being; God
          doth not preserve and act things by a virtue diffused from him. It may
          be demanded whether that virtue be distinct from God; if it be not, it
          is then the essence of God; if it be distinct it is a creature, and
          then it may be asked, how that virtue which preserves other things, is
          preserved itself; it must be ultimately resolved into the essence of
          God, or else there must be a running in infinitum: or else,662 is that
          virtue of God a substance, or not? Is it endued with understanding, or
          not? If it hath understanding, how doth it differ from God? If it
          wants understanding, can any imagine that the support of the world,
          the guidance of all creatures, the wonders of nature, can be wrought,
          preserved, managed by a virtue that hath nothing of understanding in
          it? If it be not a substance, it can much less be able to produce such
          excellent operations as the preserving all the kinds of things in the
          world, and ordering them to perform such excellent ends; this virtue
          is, therefore, God himself—the infinite power and wisdom of God; and
          therefore, wheresoever the effects of these are seen in the world, God
          is essentially present: some creatures, indeed, act at a distance by a
          virtue diffused. But such a manner of acting comes from a limitedness
          of nature, that such a nature cannot be everywhere present and extend
          its substance to all parts. To act by a virtue, speaks the subject
          finite, and it is a part of indigence: kings act in their kingdoms by
          ministers and messengers, because they cannot act otherwise; but God
          being infinitely perfect, works all things in all immediately (1 Cor.
          xii. 6). Illumination, sanctification, grace, &amp;c., are the
          immediate works of God in the heart, and immediate agents are present
          with what they do: it is an argument of the greater perfection of a
          being, to know things immediately, which are done in several places,
          than to know them at the second hand by instruments; it is no less a
          perfection to be everywhere, rather than to be tied to one place of
          action, and to act in other places by instruments, for want of a power
          to act immediately itself. God, indeed, acts by means and second
          causes in his providential dispensations in the world, but this is not
          out of any defect of power to work all immediately himself; but he
          thereby accommodates his way of acting to the nature of the creature,
          and the order of things which he hath settled in the world. And when
          he works by means, he acts with those means, in those means, sustains
          their faculties and virtues in them, concurs with them by his power;
          so that God’s acting by means doth rather strengthen his essential
          presence than weaken it, since there is a necessary dependence of the
          creatures upon the Creator in their being and acting; and what they
          are, they are by the power of God; what they act, they act in the
          power of God, concurring with them; they have their motion in him as
          well as their being: and where the power of God is, his essence is,
          because they are inseparable; and so this omnipresence ariseth from
          the simplicity of the nature of God; the more vast anything is, the
          less confined. All that will acknowledge God so great, as to be able
          to work all things by his will, without an essential presence, cannot
          imagine him upon the same reason, so little as to be contained in, and
          bounded by any place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason III. Because of his supreme perfection. No perfection is
          wanting to God; but an unbounded essence is a perfection; a limited
          one is an imperfection. Though it be a perfection in a man to be wise,
          yet it is an imperfection that his wisdom cannot rule all the things
          that concern him; though it be a perfection to be present in a place
          where his affairs lie, yet is it an imperfection that he cannot be
          present everywhere in the midst of all his concerns; if any man could
          be so, it would be universally owned as a prime perfection in him
          above others: is that which would be a perfection in man to be denied
          to God?663 as that which hath life is more perfect than that which
          hath not life; and that which hath sense is more perfect than that
          which hath only life as the plants have; and what hath reason, is more
          perfect than that which hath only life and sense, as the beasts have;
          so what is everywhere, is more perfect than that which is bounded in
          some narrow confines: if a power of motion be more excellent than to
          be bed‑rid, and swiftness in a creature be a more excellent endowment
          than to be slow and snail‑like, then to be everywhere without motion,
          is inconceivably a greater excellency than to be everywhere
          successively by motion. God sets forth his readiness to help his
          people and punish his enemies, or his omnipresence, by swiftness, or
          “flying upon the wings of the wind” (Ps. xviii. 10): the wind is in
          every part of the air, where it blows; it cannot be said that it is in
          this or that point of the air where you feel it, so as to exclude it
          from another part of the air where you are not; it seems to possess
          all at once. If the Divine essence had any bounds of place, it would
          be imperfect, as well as if it had bounds of time; where anything hath
          limitation, it hath some defect in being; and therefore if God were
          confined or concluded, he would be as good as nothing in regard of
          infiniteness. Whence should this restraint arise? there is no power
          above him to restrain him to a certain space; if so, then he would not
          be God, but that power which restrained him would be God: not from his
          own nature, for the being everywhere implies no contradiction to his
          nature; if his own nature determined him to a certain place, then if
          he removed from that place, he would act against his nature; to
          conceive any such thing of God is highly absurd. It cannot be thought
          God should voluntarily impose any such restraint or confinement upon
          himself; this would be to deny himself a perfection he might have; if
          God have not this perfection, it is either because it is inconsistent
          with his nature; or, because he cannot have it; or, because he will
          not. The former cannot be; for if he hath impressed upon air and light
          a resemblance of his excellency, to diffuse themselves and fill so
          vast a space, is such an excellency inconsistent with the Creator more
          than the creature? whatsoever perfection the creature hath, is
          eminently in God. “Understand, O ye brutish among the people: and ye
          fools, when will you be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not
          hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? he that teacheth man
          knowledge, shall not he know?” (Ps. xciv. 8, 9.) By the same reason he
          that hath given such a power to those creatures, air and light, shall
          not he be much more filling all spaces of the world? It is so clear a
          rule, that the Psalmist fixes a folly and brutishness upon those that
          deny it; it is not therefore inconsistent with his nature, it were not
          then a perfection but an imperfection; but whatsoever is an excellency
          in creatures, cannot in a way of eminency be an imperfection in God;
          if it be then a perfection, and God want it, it is because he cannot
          have it; where, then, is his power? How can he be then the fountain of
          his own Being? If he will not, where is his love to his own nature and
          glory? since no creature would deny that to itself which it can have,
          and is an excellency to it; God, therefore, hath not only a power or
          fitness to be everywhere, but he is actually everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason IV. Because of his immutability. If God did not fill all the
          spaces of heaven and earth, but only possess one, yet it must be
          acknowledged that God hath a power to move himself to another. It were
          absurd to fix God in a part of the heavens, like a star in an orb,
          without a power of motion to another place. If he be therefore
          essentially in heaven, may he not be upon the earth if he please, and
          transfer his substance from one place to another? to say he cannot, is
          to deny him a perfection which he hath bestowed upon his creatures;
          the angels, his messengers, are sometimes in heaven, sometimes on the
          earth; the eagles, meaner creatures, are sometimes in the air out of
          sight, sometimes upon the earth. If he doth move, therefore, and
          recede from one place and settle in another, doth he not declare
          himself mutable by changing places?—by being where he was not before,
          and in not being where he was before? He would not fill heaven and
          earth at once, but successively; no man can be said to fill a room,
          that moves from one part of a room to another; if therefore any in
          their imaginations stake God to the heavens, they render him less than
          his creatures; if they allow him a power of motion from one place to
          another, they conceive him changeable; and in either of them they own
          him no greater than a finite and limited Being; limited to heaven, if
          they fix him there; limited to that space to which they imagine him to
          move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason V. Because of his omnipotency. The Almightiness of God is a
          notion settled in the minds of all,—that God can do whatsoever he
          pleases, everything that is not against the purity of his nature, and
          doth not imply a contradiction in itself; he can therefore create
          millions of worlds greater than this; and millions of heavens greater
          than this heaven he hath already created; if so, he is then in
          inconceivable spaces beyond this world, for his essence is not less
          narrower than his power; and his power is not to be thought of a
          further extent than his essence; he cannot be excluded therefore from
          those vast spaces where his power may fix those worlds if he please;
          if so, it is no wonder that he should fill this world: and there is no
          reason to exclude God from the narrow space of this world, that is not
          contained in infinite spaces beyond the world. God is wheresoever he
          hath a power to act; but he hath a power to act everywhere in the
          world, everywhere out of the world; he is therefore everywhere in the
          world, everywhere out of the world. Before this world was made, he had
          a power to make it in the space where now it stands; was he not then
          unlimitedly where the world now is, before the world received a being
          by his powerful word? Why should he not then be in every part of the
          world now? Can it be thought that God who was immense before, should,
          after he had created the world, contract himself to the limits of one
          of his creatures, and tie himself to a particular place of his own
          creation, and be less after his creation than he was before? This
          might also be prosecuted by an argument from his eternity. What is
          eternal in duration, is immense in essence; the same reason which
          renders him eternal, renders him immense; that which proves him to be
          always, will prove him to be everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third thing is, Propositions for the further clearing this
          doctrine from any exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This truth is not weakened by the expressions in Scripture, where
          God is said to dwell in heaven and in the temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) He is indeed said to sit in heaven (Ps. ii. 4), and to dwell on
          high (Ps. cxiii. 5), but he is nowhere said to dwell only in the
          heavens, as confined to them. It is the court of his majestical
          presence, but not the prison of his essence: for when we are told that
          “the heaven is his throne,” we are told with the same breath that the
          “earth is his footstool” (Isa. lxvi. 1). He dwells on high, in regard
          of the excellency of his nature, but he is in all places, in regard of
          the diffusion of his presence. The soul is essentially in all parts of
          the body, but it doth not exert the same operations in all; the more
          noble discoveries of it are in the head and heart. In the head where
          it exerciseth the chiefest senses for the enriching the understanding;
          in the heart, where it vitally resides, and communicates life and
          motion to the rest of the body. It doth not understand with the foot
          or toe, though it be in all parts of the body it informs; and so God
          may be said to dwell in heaven, in regard of the more excellent and
          majestic representations of himself, both to the creatures that
          inhabit the place, as angels and blessed spirits, and also in those
          marks of his greatness which he hath planted before, those spiritual
          natures which have a nobler stamp of God upon them, and those
          excellent bodies, as sun and stars, which, as so many tapers, light us
          to behold his glory (Ps. xix. 1), and astonish the minds of men when
          they gaze upon them. It is his court, where he hath the most solemn
          worship from his creatures, all his courtiers attending there with a
          pure love and glowing zeal. He reigns there in a special manner,
          without any opposition to his government; it is, therefore, called his
          “holy dwelling place” (2 Chron. iii. 27). The earth hath not that
          title, since sin cast a stain and a ruining curse upon it. The earth
          is not his throne, because his government is opposed: but heaven is
          none of Satan’s precinct, and the rule of God is uncontradicted by the
          inhabitants of it. It is from thence also he hath given the greatest
          discoveries of himself; thence he sends the angels his messengers, his
          Son upon Redemption, his Spirit for sanctification. From heaven his
          gifts drop down upon our heads, and his grace upon our hearts (James
          iii. 17). From thence the chiefest blessings of earth descend. The
          motions of the heavens fatten the earth; and the heavenly bodies are
          but stewards to the earthly comforts for man by their influence.
          Heaven is the richest, vastest, most steadfast, and majestic part of
          the visible creation. It is there where he will at last manifest
          himself to his people in a full conjunction of grace and glory, and be
          forever open to his people in uninterrupted expressions of goodness,
          and discoveries of his presence, as a reward of their labor and
          service; and in these respects it may peculiarly be called his throne.
          And this doth no more hinder his essential presence in all parts of
          the earth, than it doth his gracious presence in all the hearts of his
          people. God is in heaven, in regard of the manifestation of his glory;
          in hell, by the expressions of his justice; in the earth, by the
          discoveries of his wisdom, power, patience, and compassion; in his
          people, by the monuments of his grace; and in all, in regard of his
          substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He is said also to dwell in the ark and temple. It is called (Ps.
          xxvi. 8) “the habitation of his house, and the place where his honor
          dwells;” and to dwell in Jerusalem as in his holy mountain, “The
          mountain of the Lord of Hosts” (Zech. viii. 3), in regard of
          publishing his oracles, answering their prayers, manifesting more of
          his goodness to the Israelites, than to any other nation in the world;
          erecting his true worship among them, which was not settled in any
          part of the world besides: and his worship is principally intended in
          that psalm. The ark is the place where his honor dwells. The worship
          of God is called the glory of God; “They changed the glory of God into
          an image made like to corruptible man” (Rom. i. 23), i. e., they
          changed the worship of God into idolatry; and to that also doth the
          place in Zechariah refer. Now, because he is said to dwell in heaven,
          is he essentially only there? Is he not as essentially in the temple
          and ark as he is in heaven, since there are as high expressions of his
          habitation there as of his dwelling in heaven? If he dwell only in
          heaven, how came he to dwell in the temple? both are asserted in
          Scripture, one as much as the other. If his dwelling in heaven did not
          hinder his dwelling in the ark, it could as little hinder the presence
          of his essence on the earth. To dwell in heaven, and in one part of
          the earth at the same time, is all one as to dwell in all parts of
          heaven, and all parts of earth. If he were in heaven, and in the ark
          and temple, it was the same essence in both, though not the same kind
          of manifestation of himself. If by his dwelling in heaven he meant his
          whole essence, why is it not also to be meant by his dwelling in the
          ark? It was not, sure, part of his essence that was in heaven, and
          part of his essence that was on earth; his essence would then be
          divided; and can it be imagined that he should be in heaven and the
          ark at the same time, and not in the spaces between? Could his essence
          be split into fragments, and a gap made in it, that two distant spaces
          should be filled by him, and all between be empty of him, so that
          God’s being said to dwell in heaven, and in the temple, is so far from
          impairing the truth of this doctrine, that it more confirms and
          evidences it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Nor do the expressions of God’s coming to us, or departing from us,
          impair this doctrine of his omnipresence. God is said to hide his face
          from his people (Ps. x. 1); to be far from the wicked; and the
          Gentiles are said to be afar off, viz. from God (Prov. xv. 29; Eph.
          ii. 17), and upon the manifestation of Christ made near. These must
          not be understood of any distance or nearness of his essence, for that
          is equally near to all persons and things; but of some other special
          way and manifestation of his presence. Thus, God is said to be in
          believers by love, as they are in him (1 John iv. 15); “He that abides
          in love, abides in God, and God in him.” He that loves, is in the
          thing beloved; and when two love one another, they are in one another.
          God is in a righteous man by a special grace, and far from the wicked
          in regard of such special works; and God is said to be in a place by a
          special manifestation, as when he was in the bush (Exod. iii.), or
          manifesting his glory upon Mount Sinai (Exod. xxiv. 16); “The glory of
          the Lord abode about Mount Sinai.” God is said to hide his face when
          he withdraws his comforting presence, disturbs the repose of our
          hearts, flasheth terror into our consciences, when he puts men under
          the smart of the cross; as though he had ordered his mercy utterly to
          depart from them, or when he doth withdraw his special assisting
          providence from us in our affairs; so he departed from Saul, when he
          withdrew his direction and protection from him in the concerns of his
          government (1 Sam. xvi. 14); “The Spirit of the Lord departed from
          Saul,” i. e. the spirit of government. God may be far from us in one
          respect, and near to us in another; far from us in regard of comfort,
          yet near to us in regard of support, when his essential presence
          continues the same: this is a necessary consequent upon the
          infiniteness of God, the other is an act of the will of God; so he was
          said to forsake Christ, in regard of his obscuring his glory from his
          human nature, and inflicting his wrath, though he was near to him in
          regard of his grace, and preserved him from contracting any spot in
          his sufferings. We do not say the sun is departed out of the heavens
          when it is bemisted; it remains in the same part of the heavens,
          passes on its course, though its beams do not reach us by reason of
          the bar between us and it. The soul is in every part of the body, in
          regard of its substance, and constantly in it, though it doth not act
          so sprightly and vigorously at one time as at another in one and the
          same member, and discover itself so sensibly in its operations; so all
          the various effects of God towards the sons of men, are but divers
          operations of one and the same essence. He is far from us, or near to
          us, as he is a judge or a benefactor. When he comes to punish, it
          notes not the approach of his essence, but the stroke of his justice;
          when he comes to benefit, it is not by a new access of his essence,
          but an efflux of his grace: he departs from us when he leaves us to
          the frowns of his justice; he comes to us when he encircles us in the
          arms of his mercy; but he was equally present with us in both
          dispensations, in regard of his essence. And, likewise, God is said to
          come down (Gen. xi. 5, “And the Lord came down to see the city”), when
          he doth some signal and wonderful works which attract the minds of men
          to the acknowledgment of a Supreme Power and Providence in the world,
          who judged God absent and careless before.

          3. Nor is the essential presence of God with all creatures any
          disparagement to him. Since it was no disparagement to create the
          heaven and the earth, it is no disparagement to him to fill them; if
          he were essentially present with them when he created them, it is no
          dishonor to him to be essentially present with them to support them;
          if it were his glory to create them by his essence, when they were
          nothing, can it be his disgrace to be present by his essence, since
          they are something, and something good, and very good in his eye (Gen.
          i. 31)? God saw every thing, and behold it was very good, or mighty
          good; all ordered to declare his goodness, wisdom, power, and to make
          him adorable to man, and therefore took complacency in them. There is
          a harmony in all things, a combination in them for those glorious ends
          for which God created them; and is it a disgrace for God to be present
          with his own harmonious composition? Is it not a musician’s glory to
          touch with his fingers the treble, the least and tenderest string, as
          well as the strongest and greatest bass? Hath not everything some
          stamp of God’s own being upon it, since he eminently contains in
          himself the perfections of all his works? Whatsoever hath being, hath
          a footstep of God upon it, who is all being; everything in the earth
          is his footstool, having a mark of his foot upon it; all declare the
          being of God, because they had their being from God; and will God
          account it any disparagement to him to be present with that which
          confirms his being, and the glorious perfections of his nature, to his
          intelligent creatures? The meanest things are not without their
          virtues, which may boast God’s being the Creator of them, and rank
          them in the midst of his works of wisdom as well as power. Doth God
          debase himself to be present by his essence, with the things he hath
          made, more than he doth to know them by his essence? Is not the least
          thing known by him? How? not by a faculty or act distinct from his
          essence, but by his essence itself. How is anything disgraceful to the
          essential presence of God, that is not disgraceful to his knowledge by
          his essence? Besides, would God make anything that should be an
          invincible reason to him to part with his own infiniteness, by a
          contraction of his own essence into a less compass than before? it was
          immense before, it had no bounds; and would God make a world that he
          would be ashamed to be present with, and continue it to the diminution
          and lessening of himself, rather than annihilate it to avoid the
          disparagement? This were to impeach the wisdom of God, and cast a
          blemish upon his infinite understanding, that he knows not the
          consequences of his work, or is well contented to be impaired in the
          immensity of his own essence by it. No man thinks it a dishonor to
          light, a most excellent creature, to be present with a toad or
          serpent; and though there be an infinite disproportion between light,
          a creature, and the Father of lights, the Creator: yet God, being a
          Spirit, knows how to be with bodies as if they were not bodies;664 and
          being jealous of his own honor, would not, could not do any thing that
          might impair it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Nor will it follow, That because God is essentially everywhere,
          that everything is God. God is not everywhere by any conjunction,
          composition or mixture with anything on earth. When light is in every
          part of a crystal globe, and encircles it close on every side, do they
          become one? No; the crystal remains what it is, and the light retains
          its own nature; God is not in us as a part of us, but as an efficient
          and preserving cause; it is not by his essential presence, but his
          efficacious presence, that he brings any person into a likeness to his
          own nature; God is so in his essence with things, as to be distinct
          from them, as a cause from the effect; as a Creator different from the
          creature, preserving their nature, not communicating his own; his
          essence touches all, is in conjunction with none; finite and infinite
          cannot be joined; he is not far from us, therefore near to us; so near
          that we live and move in him (Acts xvii. 28). Nothing is God because
          it moves in him, any more than a fish in the sea, is the sea, or a
          part of the sea, because it moves in it. Doth a man that holds a thing
          in the hollow of his hand, transform it by that action, and make it
          like his hand?665 The soul and body are more straitly united, than the
          essence of God is, by his presence, with any creature. The soul is in
          the body as a form in matter, and from their union doth arise a man;
          yet in this near conjunction, both body and soul remain distinct; the
          soul is not the body, nor the body the soul; they both have distinct
          natures and essences; the body can never be changed into a soul, nor
          the soul into a body; no more can God into the creature, or the
          creature into God. Fire is in heated iron in every part of it, so that
          it seems to be nothing but fire; yet is not fire and iron the same
          thing. But such a kind of arguing against God’s omnipresence, that if
          God were essentially present, everything would be God, would exclude
          him from heaven as well as from earth. By the same reason, since they
          acknowledge God essentially in heaven, the heaven where he is should
          be changed into the nature of God; and by arguing against his presence
          in earth, upon this ground they run such an inconvenience, that they
          must own him to be nowhere, and that which is nowhere is nothing. Doth
          the earth become God, because God is essentially there, any more than
          the heavens, where God is acknowledged by all to be essentially
          present? Again, if where God is essentially, that must be God; then if
          they place God in a point of the heavens, not only that point must be
          God, but all the world; because if that point be God, because God is
          there, then the point touched by that point must be God, and so
          consequently as far as there are any points, touched by one another.
          We live and move in God, so we live and move in the air; we are no
          more God by that, than we are mere air because we breathe in it, and
          it enters into all the pores of our body; nay, where there was a
          straiter union of the divine nature to the human in our Saviour, yet
          the nature of both was distinct, and the humanity was not changed into
          the divinity, nor the divinity into the humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Nor doth it follow, that because God is everywhere, therefore a
          creature may be worshipped without idolatry. Some of the heathens who
          acknowledged God’s omnipresence, abused it to the countenancing
          idolatry; because God was resident in everything, they thought
          everything might be worshipped; and some have used it as an argument
          against this doctrine; the best doctrines may by men’s corruption be
          drawn out into unreasonable and pernicious conclusions. Have you not
          met with any, that from the doctrine of God’s free mercy, and our
          Saviour’s satisfactory death, have drawn poison to feed their lusts,
          and consume their souls?—a poison composed by their own corruption,
          and not offered by those truths. The Apostle intimates to us, that
          some did, or at least were ready to be more lavish in sinning, because
          God was abundant in grace;666 “Shall we continue in sin, that grace
          may abound?” when he prevents an objection that he thought might be
          made by some: but as to this case, since though God be present in
          everything, yet everything retains its nature distinct from the nature
          of God; therefore it is not to have a worship due to the excellency of
          God. As long as anything remains a creature, it is only to have the
          respect from us, which is due to it in the rank of creatures. When a
          prince is present with his guard, or if he should go arm in arm with a
          peasant, is, therefore, the veneration and honor due to the prince to
          be paid to the peasant, or any of his guard? Would the presence of the
          prince excuse it, or would it not rather aggravate it? He acknowledged
          such a person equal to me, by giving him my rights, even in my sight.
          Though God dwelt in the temple, would not the Israelites have been
          accounted guilty of idolatry had they worshipped the images of the
          cherubims, or the ark, or the altar, as objects of worship, which were
          erected only as means for his service? Is there not as much reason to
          think God was as essentially present in the temple as in heaven, since
          the same expressions are used of the one and the other? The sanctuary
          is called the glorious high throne (Jer. xvii. 13); and he is said to
          dwell between the cherubims (Ps. lxxx. 1), i. e. the two cherubims
          that were at the two ends of the mercy seat, appointed by God as the
          two sides of his throne in the sanctuary (Exod. xxv. 18), where he was
          to dwell (ver. 8), and meet, and commune, with his people (ver. 22).
          Could this excuse Manasseh’s idolatry in bringing in a carved image
          into the house of God (1 Chron. xxxiii. 7)? had it been a good answer
          to the charge, God is present here, and therefore everything may be
          worshipped as God? If he be only essentially in heaven, would it not
          be idolatry to direct a worship to the heavens, or any part of it as a
          due object, because of the presence of God there? Though we look up to
          the heavens, where we pray and worship God, yet heaven is not the
          object of worship; the soul abstracts God from the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Nor is God denied by being present with those creatures which seem
          filthy to us. Nothing is filthy in the eye of God as his creature; he
          could never else have pronounced all good; whatsoever is filthy to us,
          yet, as it is a creature, it owes itself to the power of God: his
          essence is no more defiled by being present with it, than his power by
          producing it: no creature is foul in itself, though it may seem so to
          us. Doth not an infant lie in a womb of filthiness and rottenness? yet
          is not the power of God present with it, in working it curiously in
          the lower parts of the earth? Are his eyes defiled by seeing the
          substance when it is yet imperfect? or his hand defiled by writing
          every member in his book (Ps. cxxxix. 15, 16)? Have not the vilest and
          most noisome things excellent medicinal virtues? How are they endued
          with them? How are those qualities preserved in them? by anything
          without God, or no? Every artificer looks with pleasure upon the work
          he hath wrought with art and skill. Can his essence be defiled by
          being present with them, any more than it was in giving them such
          virtues, and preserving them in them? God measures the heavens and the
          earth with his hand; is his hand defiled by the evil influences of the
          planets, or the corporeal impurities of the earth? Nothing can be
          filthy in the eye of God but sin, since everything else owes its being
          to him. What may appear deformed and unworthy to us, is not so to the
          Creator; he sees beauty where we see deformity; finds goodness where
          we behold what is nauseous to us. All creatures being the effects of
          his power, may be the objects of his presence. Can any place be more
          foul than hell, if you take it either for the hell of the damned, or
          for the grave where there is rottenness? yet there he is (Ps. cxxxix.
          8). When Satan appeared before God, and God spake with him (Job i. 7),
          could God contract any impurity by being present where that filthy
          spirit was, more impure than any corporeal, noisome, and defiling
          thing can be? No; God is purity to himself in the midst of
          noisomeness; a heaven to himself in the midst of hell. Whoever heard
          of a sunbeam stained by shining upon a quagmire, any more than
          sweetened by breaking into a perfumed room?667 Though the light shines
          upon pure and impure things, yet it mixes not itself with either of
          them; so though God be present with devils and wicked men, yet without
          any mixture; he is present with their essence to sustain it and
          support it; not in their defection, wherein lies their defilement, and
          which is not a physical, but a moral evil; bodily filth can never
          touch an incorporeal substance. Spirits are not present with us in the
          same manner that one body is present with another; bodies can by a
          touch only, defile bodies. Is the glory of an angel stained by being
          in a coal‑mine? or could the angel that came into the lion’s den to
          deliver Daniel, be any more disturbed by the stench of the place, than
          he could be scratched by the paws, or torn by the teeth, of the beasts
          (Dan. vi. 22)? Their spiritual nature secures them against any
          infection when they are ministering spirits to persecuted believers in
          their nasty prisons (Acts xii. 7). The soul is straitly united with
          the body, but it is not made white or black by the whiteness or
          blackness of its habitation. Is it infected by the corporeal
          impurities of the body, while it continually dwells in a sea of filthy
          pollution? If the body be cast into a common shore, is the soul
          defiled by it? Can a diseased body derive a contagion to the spirit
          that animates it? Is it not often the purer by grace, the more the
          body is infected by nature? Hezekiah’s spirit was scarce ever more
          fervent with God, than when the sore, which some think to be a plague
          sore, was upon him (Isa. xxxviii. 3). How can any corporeal filth
          impair the purity of the divine essence? It may as well be said, that
          God is not present in battles and fights for his people (Joshua xxiii.
          10), because he would not be disturbed by the noise of cannons, and
          clashing of swords, as that he is not present in the world because of
          the ill scents. Let us therefore conclude this with the expression of
          a learned man of our own:668 “To deny the omnipresence of God, because
          of ill scented places, is to measure God rather by the nicety of
          sense, than by the sagacity of reason.”
        </p>
        <p>IV. Use. First, of information.</p>
        <p>
          1. Christ hath a divine nature. As eternity and immutability, two
          incommunicable properties of the divine nature, are ascribed to
          Christ, so also is this of omnipresence or immensity (John iii. 13):
          “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
          even the Son of Man which is in heaven.” Not which was, but which is.
          He comes from heaven by incarnation, and remains in heaven by his
          divinity. He was, while he spake to Nicodemus, locally on earth, in
          regard of his humanity; but in heaven according to his deity, as well
          as upon earth in the union of his divine and human nature. He
          descended upon earth, but he left not heaven; he was in the world
          before he came in the flesh (John i. 10): “He was in the world, and
          the world was made by him.” He was in the world, as the “light that
          enlightens every man that comes into the world.” In the world as God,
          before he was in the world as man. He was then in the world as man,
          while he discoursed with Nicodemus; yet so, that he was also in heaven
          as God. No creature but is bounded in place, either circumscribed as
          body, or determined as spirit to be in one space, so as not to be in
          another at the same time; to leave a place where they were, and
          possess a place where they were not. But Christ is so on earth, that
          at the same time he is in heaven; he is therefore infinite. To be in
          heaven and earth at the same moment of time, is a property solely
          belonging to the Deity, wherein no creature can be a partner with him.
          He was in the world before he came to the world, and “the world was
          made by him” (John i. 10). His coming was not as the coming of angels,
          that leave heaven, and begin to be on earth, where they were not
          before; but such a presence as can be ascribed only to God, who fills
          heaven and earth. Again, if all things were made by him, then he was
          present with all things which were made; for where there is a presence
          of power, there is also a presence of essence, and therefore he is
          still present; for the right and power of conservation follows the
          power of creation. And, according to this divine nature, he promiseth
          his presence with his church (Matt. xviii. 20): “There am I in the
          midst of them:” and (Matt. xxviii. 20), “I am with you alway, even to
          the end of the world,” i. e. by his divinity: for he had before told
          them (Matt. xxvi. 11), that they were not to have him alway with them,
          i. e. according to his humanity; but in his Divine nature he is
          present with, and walks in the midst of, the golden candlesticks. If
          we understand it of a presence by his Spirit in the midst of the
          church, doth it invalidate his essential presence? No; he is no less
          than the Spirit whom he sends; and therefore as little confined as the
          Spirit is, who dwells in every believer: and this may also be inferred
          from John x. 30: “My father and I are one;” not one by consent, though
          that be included, but one in power: for he speaks not of their
          consent, but of their joint power in keeping his people. Where there
          is a unity of essence, there is a unity of presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Here is a confirmation of the spiritual nature of God. If he were
          an infinite body, he could not fill heaven and earth, but with the
          exclusion of all creatures. Two bodies cannot be in the same space;
          they may be near one another, but not in any of the same points
          together. A body bounded he hath not, for that would destroy his
          immensity; he could not then fill heaven and earth, because a body
          cannot be at one and the same time in two different spaces; but God
          doth not fill heaven at one time, and the earth at another, but both
          at the same time. Besides a limited body cannot be said to fill the
          whole earth, but one particular space in the earth at a time. A body
          may fill the earth with its virtue, as the sun, but not with its
          substance. Nothing can be everywhere with a corporeal weight and mass;
          but God being infinite, is not tied to any part of the world, but
          penetrates all, and equally acts by his infinite power in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Here is an argument for providence. His presence is mentioned in
          the text, in order to his government of the affairs of the world. Is
          he everywhere, to be unconcerned with everything? Before the world had
          a being, God was present with himself; since the world hath a being,
          he is present with his creatures, to exercise his wisdom in the
          ordering, as he did his power in the production of them. As the
          knowledge of God is not a bare contemplation of a thing, so his
          presence is not a bare inspection into a thing. Were it an idle
          careless presence, it were a presence to no purpose, which cannot be
          imagined of God. Infinite power, goodness, and wisdom, being
          everywhere present with his essence, are never without their exercise.
          He never manifests any of his perfections, but the manifestation is
          full of some indulgence and benefit to his creatures. It cannot be
          supposed God should neglect those things, wherewith he is constantly
          present in a way of efficiency and operation. He is not everywhere
          without acting everywhere. “Wherever his essence is, there is a power
          and virtue worthy of God everywhere dispensed.”669 He governs by his
          presence what he made by his power; and is present as an agent with
          all his works. His power and essence are together, to preserve them
          while he pleases, as his power and his essence were together, to
          create them when he saw good to do it. Every creature hath a stamp of
          God, and his presence is necessary to keep the impression standing
          upon the creature. As all things are his works, they are the objects
          of his cares; and the wisdom he employed in framing them will not
          suffer him to be careless of them. His presence with them engageth him
          in honor not to be a negligent Governor. His immensity fits him for
          government; and where there is a fitness, there is an exercise of
          government, where there are objects for the exercise of it. He is
          worthy to have the universal rule of the world; he can be present in
          all places of his empire; there is nothing can be done by any of his
          subjects, but in his sight. As his eternity renders him King alway, so
          his immensity renders him King everywhere. If he were only present in
          heaven, it might occasion a suspicion that he minded only the things
          of heaven, and had no concern for things below that vast body; but if
          he be present here, his presence hath a tendency to the government of
          those things with which he is present. We are all in him as fish in
          the sea; and he bears all creatures in the womb of his providence, and
          the arms of his goodness. It is most certain that his presence with
          his people is far from being an idle one; for when he promises to be
          with them, he adds some special cordial, as, “I will be with thee, and
          bless thee” (Gen. xxvi. 3.) “I am with thee, and I will strengthen
          thee” (Jer. xv. 20.) “I will help thee, I will uphold thee” (Isa. xli.
          10, 14.) Infinite goodness will never countenance a negligent
          presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The omniscience of God is inferred from hence. If God be present
          everywhere, he must needs know what is done everywhere. It is for this
          end he proclaims himself a God filling heaven and earth, in the text,
          “Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him, saith
          the Lord? I have heard what the prophets say, that prophesy lies in my
          name: if I fill heaven and earth, the most secret thing cannot be hid
          from my sight.” An intelligent being cannot be everywhere present, and
          more intimate in everything, than it can be in itself; but he must
          know what is done without, what is thought within. Nothing can be
          obscure to Him who is in every part of the world, in every part of his
          creatures. Not a thought can start up but in his sight, who is present
          in the souls and minds of everything. How easy is it with him, to
          whose essence the world is but a point, to know and observe everything
          done in this world, as any of us can know what is done in one point of
          place where we are present! If light were an understanding being, it
          would behold and know everything done where it diffuseth itself. God
          is light (as light in a crystal glass all within it, all without it),
          and is not ignorant of what is done within and without; no ignorance
          can be fastened upon him who hath an universal presence. Hence, by the
          way, we may take notice of the wonderful patience of God, who bears
          with so many provocations; not from a principal of ignorance, for he
          bears with sins that are committed near him in his sight, sins that he
          sees, and cannot but see.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Hence may be inferred the incomprehensibility of God. He that fills
          heaven and earth cannot be contained in anything; he fills the
          understandings of men, the understandings of angels, but is
          comprehended by neither; it is a rashness to think to find out any
          bounds of God; there is no measuring of an infinite Being; if it were
          to be measured it were not infinite; but because it is infinite, it is
          not to be measured. God sits above the cherubims (Ezek. x. 1), above
          the fulness, above the brightness, not only of a human, but a created
          understanding. Nothing is more present than God, yet nothing more hid;
          he is light, and yet obscurity;670 his perfections are visible, yet
          unsearchable; we know there is an infinite God, but it surpasseth the
          compass of our minds; we know there is no number so great, but another
          may be added to it; but no man can put it in practice, without losing
          himself in a maze of figures. What is the reason we comprehend not
          many, nay, most things in the world? partly from the excellency of the
          object, and partly from the imperfection of our understandings. How
          can we then comprehend God, who exceeds all, and is exceeded by none;
          contains all, and is contained by none; is above our understanding, as
          well as above our sense? as considered in himself infinite; as
          considered in comparison with our understandings, incomprehensible;
          who can, with his eye, measure the breadth, length and depth of the
          sea, and at one cast, view every dimension of the heavens? God is
          greater, and we cannot know him (Job xxxvi. 26); he fills the
          understanding as he fills heaven and earth; yet is above the
          understanding as he is above heaven and earth. He is known by faith,
          enjoyed by love, but comprehended by no mind. God is not contained in
          that one syllable, God; by it we apprehend an excellent and unlimited
          nature; himself only understands himself, and can unveil himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. How wonderful is God, and how nothing are creatures! “Ascribe the
          greatness to our God” (Deut. xxxiii. 3); he is admirable in the
          consideration of his power, in the extent of his understanding, and no
          less wonderful in the immensity of his essence: that, as Austin saith,
          he is in the world, yet not confined to it; he is out of the world,
          yet not debarred from it; he is above the world, yet not elevated by
          it; he is below the world, yet not depressed by it; he is above all,
          equalled by none; he is in all, not because he needs them, but they
          stand in need of him; this, as well as eternity, makes a vast
          disproportion between God and the creature: the creature is bounded by
          a little space, and no space is so great as to bound the Creator. By
          this we may take a prospect of our own nothingness: as in the
          consideration of God’s holiness we are minded of our own impurity; and
          in the thoughts of his wisdom have a view of our own folly; and in the
          meditation of his power, have a sense of our weakness; so his
          immensity should make us, according to our own nature, appear little
          in our own eyes. What little, little, little things are we to God!
          less than an atom in the beams of the sun; poor drops to a God that
          fills heaven and earth, and yet dare we to strut against him, and dash
          ourselves against a rock? If the consideration of ourselves in
          comparison with others, be apt to puff us up, the consideration of
          ourselves in comparison with God, will be sufficient to pull us down.
          If we consider him in the greatness of his essence, there is but
          little more proportion between him and us, than between being and not
          being, than between a drop and the ocean. How should we never think of
          God without a holy admiration of his greatness, and a deep sense of
          our own littleness! and as the angels cover their faces before him,
          with what awe should creeping worms come into his sight! and since God
          fills heaven and earth with his presence, we should fill heaven and
          earth with his glory; for this end he created angels to praise him in
          heaven, and men to worship him on earth, that the places he fills with
          his presence may be filled with his praise: we should be swallowed up
          in admiration of the immensity of God, as men are at the first sight
          of the sea, when they behold a mass of waters, without beholding the
          bounds and immense depth of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. How much is this attribute of God forgotten or contemned! We
          pretend to believe him to be present everywhere, and yet many live as
          if he were present nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is commonly forgotten, or not believed. All the extravagances
          of men may be traced to the forgetfulness of this attribute as their
          spring. The first speech Adam spake in paradise after his fall,
          testified his unbelief of this (Gen. iii. 10); “I heard thy voice in
          the garden, and I hid myself;” his ear understood the voice of God,
          but his mind did not conclude the presence of God; he thought the
          trees could shelter him from Him whose eye was present in the minutest
          parts of the earth; he that thought after his sin, that he could hide
          himself from the presence of his justice, thought before that he could
          hide himself from the presence of his knowledge; and being deceived in
          the one, he would try what would be the fruit of the other. In both he
          forgets, if not denies, this attribute; either corrupt notions of God,
          or a slight belief of what in general men assent unto, gives birth to
          every sin. In all transgressions there is something of atheism; either
          denying the being of God, or a dash upon some perfection of God;—a not
          believing his holiness to hate it, his truth that threatens, his
          justice to punish it, and his presence to observe it. Though God be
          not afar off in his essence, he is “afar off in the apprehension of
          the sinner.”671 There is no wicked man, but if he be an atheist, he is
          a heretic; and to gratify his lust, will fancy himself to be out of
          the presence of his Judge. His reason tells him, God is present with
          him, his lust presseth him to embrace the season of sensual pleasure;
          he will forsake his reason, and prove a heretic, that he may be an
          undisturbed sinner; and sins doubly, both in the error of his mind,
          and the vileness of his practice; he will conceit God with those in
          Job, “veiled with thick clouds” (Job xxii. 14), and not able to pierce
          into the lower world, as if his presence and cares were confined to
          celestial things, and the earth were too low a sphere for his essence
          to reach, at least with any credit. It is forgotten by good men, when
          they fear too much the designs of their enemies; “Fear not, for I am
          with thee” (Isa. xliii. 5). If the presence of God be enough to
          strengthen against fear, then the prevailing of fear issues from our
          forgetfulness of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This attribute of God’s omnipresence is for the most part
          contemned. When men will commit that in the presence of God which they
          would be afraid or ashamed to do before the eye of man, men do not
          practice that modesty before God as before men. He that would restrain
          his tongue out of fear of men’s eye, will not restrain either tongue
          or hands out of fear of God’s. What is the language of this, but that
          God is not present with us, or his presence ought to be of less regard
          with us, and influence upon us, than that of a creature?672 Ask the
          thief why he dares to steal? will he not answer, “No eye sees him?”
          Ask the adulterer why he strips himself of his chastity, and invades
          the rights of another? will he not answer (Job xxiv. 15), “No eye sees
          me?” He disguiseth himself to be unseen by man, but slights the
          all‑seeing eye of God. If only a man know them, they are in terror of
          the shadow of death; they are planet‑struck, but stand unshaken at the
          presence of God (Job xxiv. 17). Is not this to account God as limited
          as man—as ignorant, as absenting, as if God were something less than
          those things which restrain us? ’Tis a debasing God below a creature.
          If we can forbear sin from an awe of the presence of man, to whom we
          are equal in regard of nature, or from the presence of a very mean
          man, to whom we are superior in regard of condition, and not forbear
          it because we are within the ken of God, we respect him not only as
          our inferior, but inferior to the meanest man or child of his
          creation, in whose sight we would not commit the like action: it is to
          represent him as a sleepy, negligent, or careless God; as though
          anything might be concealed from him, before whom the least fibres of
          the heart are anatomised and open, who sees as plainly midnight as
          noon‑day sins (Heb. iv. 13). Now this is a high aggravation of sin: to
          break a king’s laws, in his sight, is more bold than to violate them
          behind his back; as it was Haman’s offence when he lay upon Esther’s
          bed, to force the queen before the king’s face. The least iniquity
          receives a high tincture from this; and no sin can be little that is
          an affront in the face of God, and casting the filth of the creature
          before the eyes of his holiness: as if a wife should commit adultery
          before her husband’s face, or a slave dishonor his master, and disobey
          his commands in his presence. And hath it not often been thus with us?
          have we not been disloyal to God in his sight, before his eyes, those
          pure eyes that cannot behold iniquity without anger and grief? (Isa.
          lxv. 12), “Ye did evil before my eyes.” Nathan chargeth this home upon
          David (2 Sam. xii. 9), “Thou hast despised the commandment of the
          Lord, to do evil in his sight;” and David, in his repentance, reflects
          upon himself for it (Ps. li. 4); “Against thee, thee only, have I
          sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.” I observed not thy presence,
          I neglected thee while thy eye was upon me. And this consideration
          should sting our hearts in all our confessions of our crimes. Men will
          be afraid of the presence of others, whatsoever they think in their
          heart. How unworthily do we deal with God, in not giving him so much
          as an eye‑service, which we do man!
        </p>
        <p>
          8. How terrible should the thoughts of this attribute be to sinners!
          How foolish is it, to imagine any hiding‑place from the
          incomprehensible God, who fills and contains all things, and is
          present in every point of the world!673 When men have shut the door,
          and made all darkness within, to meditate or commit a crime, they
          cannot in the most intricate recesses be sheltered from the presence
          of God. If they could separate themselves from their own shadows, they
          could not avoid his company, or be obscured from his sight.674
          Hypocrites cannot disguise their sentiments from him; he is in the
          most secret nook of their hearts. No thought is hid, no lust is
          secret, but the eye of God beholds this, and that, and the other. He
          is present with our heart when we imagine, with our hands when we act.
          We may exclude the sun from peeping into our solitudes, but not the
          eyes of God from beholding our actions. “The eyes of the Lord are in
          every place, beholding the evil and good” (Prov. xv. 3). He lies in
          the depths of our souls, and sees afar off our designs before we have
          conceived them. He is in the greatest darkness, as well as the
          clearest light; in the closest thought of the mind, as well as the
          openest expressions. Nothing can be hid from him, no, not in the
          darkest cells or thickest walls. “He compasseth our path wherever we
          are” (Ps. cxxxix. 3), and “is acquainted with all our ways.” He is as
          much present with wicked men to observe their sins, as he is to detest
          them. Where he is present in his essence, he is present in his
          attributes: his holiness to hate, and his justice to punish, if he
          please to speak the word. It is strange men should not be mindful of
          this, when their very sins themselves might put them in mind of his
          presence. Whence hast thou the power to act? who preserves thy being,
          whereby thou art capable of committing that evil? Is it not his
          essential presence that sustains us, and his arm that supports us? and
          where can any man fly from his presence? Not the vast regions of
          heaven could shelter a sinning angel from his eye: how was Adam
          ferreted out of his hiding‑places in paradise? Nor can we find the
          depths of the sea a sufficient covering to us. If we were with Jonah,
          closeted up in the belly of a whale; if we had the “wings of the
          morning,” as quick a motion as the light at the dawning of the day,
          that doth in an instant surprise and overpower the regions of
          darkness, and could pass to the utmost parts of the earth or hell,
          there we should find him, there his eye would be upon us, there would
          his hand lay hold of us, and lead us as a conqueror triumphing over a
          captive (Ps. cxxxix. 8‒10). Nay, if we could leap out of the compass
          of heaven and earth, we should find as little reserves from him: he is
          without the world in those infinite spaces which the mind of man can
          imagine. In regard of his immensity, nothing in being can be distant
          from him, wheresoever it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, Use is for comfort. That God is present everywhere, is as much
          a comfort to a good man, as it is a terror to a wicked one. He is
          everywhere for his people, not only by a necessary perfection of his
          nature, but an immense diffusion of his goodness. He is in all
          creatures as their preserver: in the damned, as their terror; in his
          people, as their protector. He fills hell with his severity, heaven
          with his glory, his people with his grace. He is with his people as
          light in darkness, a fountain in a garden, as manna in the ark. God is
          in the world as a spring of preservation; in the church as his
          cabinet, his spring of grace and consolation. A man is present
          sometimes in his field, but more delightfully in his garden. A vine
          yard, as it hath more of cost, so more of care, and a watchful
          presence of the owner (Isa. xxvii. 3); “I, the Lord, do keep it,” viz.
          his vineyard; “I will water it every moment, lest any hurt it: I will
          keep it night and day.” As there is a presence of essence, which is
          natural, so there is a presence of grace, which is federal: a presence
          by covenant; “I will not leave thee, I will be with thee.” This latter
          depends upon the former; for, take away the immensity of God, and you
          leave no foundation for his universal gracious presence with his
          people in all their emergencies, in all their hearts. And, therefore,
          where he is present in his essence, he cannot be absent in his grace,
          from them that fear him. It is from his filling heaven and earth he
          proves his knowledge of the designs of the false prophets; and from
          the same topic may as well be inferred the employment of his power and
          grace for his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in all violent temptations. No
          fiery dart can be so present with us, as God is present both with that
          and the marksman. The most raging devils cannot be so near us, as God
          is to us and them. He is present with his people to relieve them, and
          present with the devil to manage him to his own holy purposes: so he
          was with Job, defeating his enemies, and bringing him triumphantly out
          of those pressing trials. This presence is such a terror, that
          whatsoever the devil can despoil us of, he must leave this untouched.
          He might scratch the apostle with a thorn (2 Cor. xii. 7, 9), but he
          could not rifle him of the presence of divine grace, which God
          promised him. He must prevail so far as to make God cease to be God,
          before he can make him to be distant from us; and while this cannot
          be, the devils and men can no more hinder the emanations of God to the
          soul, than a child can cut off the rays of the sun from embellishing
          the earth. It is no mean support for a good man, at any time, buffeted
          by a messenger of Satan, to think God stands near him, and behold how
          ill he is used. It would be a satisfaction to a king’s favorite, in
          the midst of the violence some enemies might use to him upon a
          surprise, to understand that the king who loves him stands behind a
          curtain, and through a hole sees the injuries he suffers: and were the
          devil as considering as he is malicious, he could not but be in great
          fear at God’s being in the generation of the righteous, as his
          serpentine seed is (Prov. iii. 6): “They were in great fear, for God
          is in the generation of the righteous.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in sharp afflictions. Good men
          have a comfort in this presence in their nasty prisons, oppressing
          tribunals; in the overflowing waters or scorching flames he is still
          with them (Isa. xliii. 2); and many times by his presence keeps the
          bush from consuming, when it seems to be all in a flame. In
          afflictions God shows himself most present, when friends are most
          absent: “When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord shall
          take me up” (Ps. xxvii. 10), then God will stoop and gather me into
          his protection; or, (Heb.) “shall gather me,” alluding to those tribes
          that were to bring up the rear in the Israelites’ march, to take care
          that none were left behind, and exposed to famine or wild beasts, by
          reason of some disease that disenabled them to keep pace with their
          brethren. He that is the sanctuary of his people in all calamities, is
          more present with them to support them, than their adversaries can be
          present with them to afflict them (Psal. xlvi. 2), a present help in
          the time of trouble; He is present with all things for this end;
          though his presence be a necessary presence in regard of the immensity
          of his nature, yet the end of this presence in regard that it is for
          the good of his people, is a voluntary presence. It is for the good of
          man he is present in the lower world, and principally for the good of
          his people, for whose sake he keeps up the world (2 Chron. xvi. 9).
          “His eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself
          strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him.” If
          he doth not deliver good men from afflictions, he will be so present
          as to manage them in them, as that his glory shall issue from them,
          and their grace be brightened by them.675 What a man was Paul when he
          was lodged in a prison, or dragged to the courts of judicature, when
          he was torn with rods, or laden with chains! then did he show the
          greatest miracles, made the judge tremble upon the bench, and brake
          the heart, though not the prison, of the jailor; so powerful is the
          presence of God in the pressures of his people. This presence
          outweighs all other comforts, and is more valuable to a Christian than
          barns of corn, or cellars of wine can be to a covetous man (Ps. iv.
          7): it was this presence was David’s cordial in the mutinying of his
          soldiers (1 Sam. xxx. 6). What a comfort is this in exile, or a forced
          desertion of our habitations! Good men may be banished from their
          country, but never from the presence of their Protector; ye cannot say
          of any corner of the earth, or of any dungeon in a prison, God is not
          here; if you were cast out of your country a thousand miles off, you
          are not out of God’s precinct; his arm is there to cherish the good,
          as well as to drag out the wicked; it is the same God, the same
          presence in every country, as well as the same sun, moon, and stars;
          and were not God everywhere, yet he could not be meaner than his
          creature the sun in the firmament, which visits every part of the
          habitable world in twenty‑four hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in all duties of worship. He
          is present to observe, and present to accept our petitions, and answer
          our suits. Good men have not only the essential presence, which is
          common to all, but his gracious presence; not only the presence that
          flows from his nature, but that which flows from his promise; his
          essential presence makes no difference between this and that man in
          regard of spirituals, without this in conjunction with it; his nature
          is the cause of the presence of his essence; his will engaged by his
          truth is the cause of the presence of his grace. He promised to meet
          the Israelites in the place where he should set his name, and in all
          places where he doth record it (Exod. xx. 4). “In all places where I
          record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee;” in
          every place where I shall manifest the special presence of my
          divinity. In all places, hands may be lifted up, without doubting of
          his ability to hear; he dwells in the contrite hearts, wherever it is
          most in the exercise of contrition; which is usually in times of
          special worship (Isa. lvii. 15), and that to revive and refresh them.
          Habitation notes a special presence, though he dwell in the highest
          heavens in the sparklings of his glory, he dwells also in the lowest
          hearts in the beams of his grace; as none can expel him from his
          dwelling in heaven, so none can reject him from his residence in the
          heart. The tabernacle had his peculiar presence fixed to it (Levit.
          xxvi. 11); his soul should not abhor them, as they are washed by
          Christ, though they are loathsome by sin: in a greater dispensation
          there cannot be a less presence, since the church under the New
          Testament is called the temple of the Lord, wherein he will both dwell
          and walk (2 Cor. vi. 6); or, I will indwell in them; as if he should
          say, I will dwell in and in them; I will dwell in them by grace, and
          walk in them by exciting their graces; he will be more intimate with
          them than their own souls, and converse with them as the living God,
          i. e. as a God that hath life in himself, and life to convey to them
          in their converse with him; and show his spiritual glory among them in
          a greater measure than in the temple, since that was but a heap of
          stones, and the figure of the Christian church the mystical body of
          his Son. His presence is not less in the substance than it was in the
          shadow; this presence of God in his ordinances, is the glory of a
          church, as the presence of a king is the glory of a court, the defence
          of it, too, as a wall of fire (Zech. ii. 5); alluding to the fire
          travellers in a wilderness made to fright away wild beasts. It is not
          the meanness of the place of worship can exclude him; the second
          temple was not so magnificent as the first of Solomon’s erecting, and
          the Jews seemed to despond of so glorious a presence of God in the
          second, as they had in the first, because they thought it not so good
          for the entertainment of Him that inhabits eternity; but God comforts
          them against this conceit again and again (Hag. ii. 3, 4): “be strong,
          be strong, be strong, I am with you;” the meanness of the place shall
          not hinder the grandeur of my presence, no matter what the room is, so
          it be the presence‑chamber of the king, wherein he will favor our
          suits; he can everywhere slide into our souls with a perpetual
          sweetness, since he is everywhere, and so, intimate with every one
          that fears him. If we should see God on earth in his amiableness, as
          Moses did, should we not be encouraged by his presence, to present our
          requests to him, to echo out our praises of him? and have we not as
          great a ground now to do it, since he is as really present with us, as
          if he were visible to us? he is in the same room with us, as near to
          us as our souls to our bodies, not a word but he hears, not a motion
          but he sees, not a breath but he perceives; he is through all, he is
          in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in all special services. God
          never puts any upon a hard task, but he makes promises to encourage
          them and assist them, and the matter of the promise is that of his
          presence; so he did assure the prophets of old when he set them
          difficult tasks, and strengthened Moses against the face of Pharaoh,
          by assuring him “he would be with his mouth” (Exod. iv. 12); and when
          Christ put his apostles upon a contest with the whole world, to preach
          a gospel that would be foolishness to the Greeks, and a stumbling
          block to the Jews, he gives them a cordial only composed of his
          presence (Matt. xxviii. 20), I will be with you; it is this presence
          scatters by its light the darkness of our spirits; it is this that is
          the cause of what is done for his glory in the world; it is this that
          mingles itself with all that is done for his honor; it is this from
          whence springs all the assistance of his creatures, marked out for
          special purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This presence is not without the special presence of all his
          attributes. Where his essence is, his perfections are, because they
          are one with his essence; yea, they are his essence, though they have
          their several degrees of manifestation. As in the covenant, he makes
          over himself, not a part of himself, but his whole deity; so in
          promising of his presence, he means not a part of it, but the whole,
          the presence of all the excellencies of his nature to be manifested
          for our good. It is not a piece of God is here and another parcel
          there, but God in his whole essence and perfections; in his wisdom to
          guide us, his power to protect and support us, his mercy to pity us,
          his fulness to refresh us, and his goodness to relieve us: he is ready
          to sparkle out in this or that perfection, as the necessities of his
          people require, and his own wisdom directs for his own honor; so that
          being not far from us in an excellency of his nature, we can quickly
          have recourse to him upon any emergency; so that if we are miserable,
          we have the presence of his goodness; if we want direction, we have
          the presence of his wisdom; if we are weak, we have the presence of
          his power; and should we not rejoice in it, as a man doth in the
          presence of a powerful, wealthy, and compassionate friend?
        </p>
        <p>Third, Use. Of Exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          1. Let us be much in the actual thoughts of this truth. How should we
          enrich our understandings with the knowledge of the excellency of God,
          whereof this is none of the least; nor hath less of honey in its
          bowels, though it be more terrible to the wicked than the presence of
          a lion; it is this that makes all other excellencies of the divine
          nature sweet. What would grace, wisdom, power, signify at a distance
          from us? Let us frame in our minds a strong idea of it; it is this
          makes so great a difference between the actions of one man and
          another; one maintains actual thoughts of it, another doth not: though
          all believe it as a perfection pertaining to the infiniteness of his
          essence. David, or rather a greater than David, had God always before
          him; there was no time, no occasion, wherein he did not stir up some
          lively thoughts of him (Ps. xvi. 8). Let us have right notions of it;
          imagine not God as a great King, sitting only in his majesty in
          heaven; acting all by his servants and ministers. This, saith one,676
          is a childish and unworthy conceit of God, and may in time bring such
          a conceiver by degrees to deny his providence; the denial of this
          perfection is an axe at the root of religion; if it be not deeply
          imprinted in the mind, personal religion grows faint and feeble. Who
          would fear that God that is not imagined to be a witness of his
          actions? Who would worship a God at a distance both from the worship
          and the worshipper?677 Let us believe this truth, but not with an idle
          faith, as if we did not believe it. Let us know, that as wheresoever
          the fish moves, it is in the water; wheresoever the bird moves, it is
          in the air; so wheresoever we move, we are in God. As there is not a
          moment but we are under his mercy, so there is not a moment that we
          are out of his presence. Let us therefore look upon nothing, without
          thinking who stands by, without reflecting upon him in whom it lives,
          moves and hath its being. When you view a man, you fix your eyes upon
          his body, but your mind upon that invisible part that acts every
          member by life and motion, and makes them fit for your converse. Let
          us not bound our thoughts to the creatures we see, but pierce through
          the creature to that boundless God we do not see: we have continual
          remembrances of his presence; the light, whereby we see, and the air,
          whereby we live, give us perpetual notices of it, and some weak
          resemblance; why should we forget it? yea, what a shame is our
          unmindfulness of it, when every cast of our eye, every motion of our
          lungs, jogs us to remember it? Light is in every part of the air, in
          every part of the world, yet not mixed with any, both remain entire in
          their own substance. Let us not be worse than some of the heathens,
          who pressed this notion upon themselves for the spiriting their
          actions with virtue, that all places were full of God. This was the
          means Basil used to prescribe, upon a question asked him, How shall we
          do to be serious? mind God’s presence. How shall we avoid distractions
          in service? think of God’s presence. How shall we resist temptation?
          oppose to them the presence of God.678
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) This will be a shield against all temptations. God is present, is
          enough to blunt the weapons of hell; this will secure us from a ready
          compliance with any base and vile attractives, and curb that
          headstrong principle in our nature, that would join hands with them;
          the thoughts of this would, like the powerful presence of God with the
          Israelites, take off the wheels from the chariots of our sensitive
          appetites, and make them perhaps move slower, at least, towards a
          temptation. How did Peter fling off the temptation which had worsted
          him, upon a look from Christ! The actuated faith of this would stifle
          the darts of Satan, and fire us with an anger against his
          solicitations, as strong as the fire that inflames the darts. Moses’
          sight of Him that was invisible, strengthened him against the costly
          pleasures and luxuries of a prince’s court (Heb. xi. 27). We are
          utterly senseless of a Deity, if we are not moved with this item from
          our consciences, God is present. Had our first parents actually
          considered the nearness of God to them, when they were tempted to eat
          of the forbidden fruit, they had not probably been so easily overcome
          by the temptation. What soldier would be so base as to revolt under
          the eye of a tender and obliging general? or what man so negligent of
          himself, as to rob a house in the sight of a judge? Let us consider
          that God is as near to observe us, as the devil to solicit us, yea,
          nearer; the devil stands by us, but God is in us; we may have a
          thought the devil knows not, but not a thought but God is actually
          present with, as our souls are with the thoughts they think; nor can
          any creature attract our heart, if our minds were fixed on that
          invisible presence that contributes to that excellency, and sustains
          it, and considered that no creature could be so present with us as the
          Creator is.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It will be a spur to holy actions. What man would do an unworthy
          action, or speak an unhandsome word, in the presence of his prince?
          The eye of the general inflames the spirit of a soldier. Why did David
          keep God’s testimonies (Ps. cxix. 168)? because he considered that all
          his ways were before him; because he was persuaded his ways were
          present with God; God’s precepts should be present with him. The same
          was the cause of Job’s integrity (Job xxxi. 4): “Doth he not see my
          ways?” To have God in our eye is the way to be sincere (Gen. xvii. 1);
          “walk before me” as in my sight, “and be thou perfect.” Communion with
          God consists chiefly in an ordering our ways as in the presence of him
          that is invisible. This would make us spiritual, raised and watchful
          in all our passions, if we considered that God is present with us in
          our shops, in our chambers, in our walks, and in our meetings, as
          present with us as with the angels in heaven; who, though they have a
          presence of glory above us, yet have not a greater measure of his
          essential presence than we have. What an awe had Jacob upon him when
          he considered God was present in Bethel (Gen. xxviii. 16, 17)! If God
          should appear visibly to us when we were alone, should we not be
          reverend and serious before him? God is everywhere about us, he doth
          encompass us with his presence. Should not God’s seeing us have the
          same influence upon us as our seeing God? He is not more essentially
          present if he should so manifest himself to us, than when he doth not.
          Who would appear besmeared in the presence of a great person? or not
          be ashamed to be found in his chamber in a nasty posture by some
          visitant? Would not a man blush to be catched about some mean action,
          though it were not an immoral crime? If this truth were impressed upon
          our spirits, we should more blush to have our souls daubed with some
          loathsome lust; swarms of sin, like Egyptian lice and frogs, creeping
          about our heart in his sight. If the most sensual man be ashamed to do
          a dishonest action in the sight of a grave and holy man, one of great
          reputation for wisdom and integrity, how much more should we lift up
          ourselves in the ways of God, who is infinite and immense, is
          everywhere, and infinitely superior to man, and more to be regarded!
          We could not seriously think of his presence but there would pass some
          intercourse between us; we should be putting up some petition upon the
          sense of our indigence, or sending up our praises to him upon the
          sense of his bounty. The actual thoughts of the presence of God is the
          life and spirit of all religion; we could not have sluggish spirits
          and a careless watch if we considered that his eye is upon us all the
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It will quell distractions in worship. The actual thoughts of
          this would establish our thoughts, and pull them back when they begin
          to rove: the mind could not boldly give God the slip if it had lively
          thoughts of it; the consideration of this would blow off all the froth
          that lies on the top of our spirits. An eye, taken up with the
          presence of one object, is not at leisure to be filled with another:
          he that looks intently upon the sun, shall have nothing for a while
          but the sun in his eye. Oppose to every intruding thought the idea of
          the Divine omnipresence, and put it to silence by the awe of his
          Majesty. When the master is present, scholars mind their books, keep
          their places, and run not over the forms to play with one another; the
          master’s eye keeps an idle servant to his work, that otherwise would
          be gazing at every straw, and prating to every passenger. How soon
          would the remembrance of this dash all extravagant fancies out of
          countenance, just as the news of the approach of a prince would make
          the courtiers bustle up themselves, huddle up their vain sports, and
          prepare themselves for a reverent behavior in his sight! We should not
          dare to give God a piece of our heart when we apprehended him present
          with the whole: we should not dare to mock one that we knew were more
          inwards with us than we are with ourselves, and that beheld every
          motion of our mind, as well as action of our body.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Let us endeavor for the more special and influential presence of
          God. Let the essential presence of God be the ground of our awe, and
          his gracious influential presence the object of our desire. The
          heathen thought themselves secure if they had their little petty
          household gods with them in their journeys: such seem to be the images
          Rachel stole from her father (Gen. xxxi. 19) to company her travel
          with their blessings: she might not at that time have cast off all
          respect to those idols, in the acknowledgment of which she had been
          educated from her infancy; and they seem to be kept by her till God
          called Jacob to Bethel, after the rape of Dinah (Gen. xxxv. 4), when
          Jacob called for the strange gods, and hid them under the oak. The
          gracious presence of God we should look after, in our actions, as
          travellers, that have a charge of money or jewels, desire to keep
          themselves in company that may protect them from highwaymen that would
          rifle them. Since we have the concerns of the eternal happiness of our
          souls upon our hands, we should endeavor to have God’s merciful and
          powerful presence with us in all our ways (Ps. xiv. 5); “In all thy
          ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths:” acknowledge him
          before any action, by imploring; acknowledge him after, by rendering
          him the glory; acknowledge his presence before worship, in worship,
          after worship: it is this presence makes a kind of heaven upon earth;
          causeth affliction to put off the nature of misery. How much will the
          presence of the sun outshine the stars of lesser comforts, and fully
          answer the want of them! The ark of God going before us, can only make
          all things successful. It was this led the Israelites over Jordan, and
          settled them in Canaan. Without this we signify nothing: though we
          live without this, we cannot be distinguished forever from devils; his
          essential presence they have; and if we have no more, we shall be no
          better. It is the enlivening fructifying presence of the sun that
          revives the languishing earth; and this only can repair our ruined
          soul. Let it be, therefore, our desire, that as he fills heaven and
          earth by his essence, he may fill our understandings and wills by his
          grace, that we may have another kind of presence with us than animals
          have in their brutish state, or devils in their chains: his essential
          presence maintains our beings, but his gracious presence confers and
          continues a happiness.
