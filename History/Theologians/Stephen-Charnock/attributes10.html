        <h2>DISCOURSE X.</h2>
        <p>ON THE POWER OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Job xxvi. 14.—Lo! these are parts of his ways: but how little a
          portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can
          understand?
        </p>
        <p>
          Bildad had, in the foregoing chapter, entertained Job with a discourse
          of the dominion and power of God, and the purity of his righteousness,
          whence he argues an impossibility of the justification of man in his
          presence, who is no better than a worm. Job, in this chapter,
          acknowledges the greatness of God’s power, and descants more largely
          upon it than Bildad had done; but doth preface it with a kind of
          ironical speech, as if he had not acted a friendly part, or spake
          little to the purpose, or the matter in hand: the subject of Job’s
          discourse was the worldly happiness of the wicked, and the calamities
          of the godly: and Bildad reads him a lecture, of the extent of God’s
          dominion, the number of his armies, and the unspotted rectitude of his
          nature, in comparison of which the purest creatures are foul and
          crooked. Job, therefore, from ver. 1‒4, taxeth him in a kind of
          scoffing manner, that he had not touched the point, but rambled from
          the subject in hand, and had not applied a salve proper to this sore
          (ver. 2): “How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest
          thou the arm of him that hath no strength?” &amp;c.; your discourse is
          so impertinent, that it will neither strengthen a weak person, nor
          instruct a simple one.810 But since Bildad would take up the argument
          of God’s power, and discourse so short of it, Job would show that he
          wanted not his instructions in that kind, and that he had more
          distinct conceptions of it than his antagonist had uttered: and
          therefore from ver. 5 to the end of the chapter, he doth magnificently
          treat of the power of God in several branches. And (ver. 5) he begins
          with the lowest. “Dead things are formed from under the waters, and
          the inhabitants thereof:” You read me a lecture of the power of God in
          the heavenly host: indeed it is visible there, yet of a larger extent;
          and monuments of it are found in the lower parts. What do you think of
          those dead things under the earth and waters, of the corn that dies,
          and by the moistening influences of the clouds, springs up again with
          a numerous progeny and increase for the nourishment of man? What do
          you think of those varieties of metals and minerals conceived in the
          bowels of the earth; those pearls and riches in the depths of the
          waters, midwifed by this power of God? Add to these those more
          prodigious creatures in the sea, the inhabitants of the waters, with
          their vastness and variety, which are all the births of God’s power;
          both in their first creation by his mighty voice, and their
          propagation by his cherishing providence. Stop not here, but consider
          also that his power extends to hell; either the graves the
          repositories of all the crumbled dust that hath yet been in the world
          (for so hell is sometimes taken in Scripture: ver. 6, “Hell is naked
          before him, and destruction hath no covering.”) The several lodgings
          of deceased men are known to him: no screen can obscure them from his
          sight, nor their dissolution be any bar to his power, when the time is
          come to compact those mouldered bodies to entertain again their
          departed souls, either for weal or woe. The grave, or hell, the place
          of punishment, is naked before him; as distinctly discerned by him, as
          a naked body in all its lineaments by us, or a dissected body is in
          all its parts by a skilful eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Destruction hath no covering; none can free himself from the power of
          his hand. Every person in the bowels of hell; every person punished
          there is known to him, and feels the power of his wrath. From the
          lower parts of the world he ascends to the consideration of the power
          of God in the creation of heaven and earth; “He stretches out the
          north over the empty places” (ver. 7). The north, or the north pole,
          over the air, which, by the Greeks, was called void or empty, because
          of the tenuity and thinness of that element; and he mentions here the
          north, or north pole, for the whole heaven, because it is more known
          and apparent than the southern pole. “And hangs the earth upon
          nothing:” the massy and weighty earth hangs like a thick globe in the
          midst of a thin air, that there is as much air on the one side of it,
          as on the other. The heavens have no prop to sustain them in their
          height, and the earth hath no basis to support it in its place. The
          heavens are as if you saw a curtain stretched smooth in the air
          without any hand to hold it; and the earth is as if you saw a ball
          hanging in the air without any solid body to under‑prop it, or any
          line to hinder it from falling; both standing monuments of the
          omnipotence of God. He then takes notice of his daily power in the
          clouds; “He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is
          not rent under them” (ver. 8). He compacts the waters together in
          clouds, and keeps them by his power in the air against the force of
          their natural gravity and heaviness, till they are fit to flow down
          upon the earth, and perform his pleasure in the places for which he
          designs them. “The cloud is not rent under them;” the thin air is not
          split asunder by the weight of the waters contained in the cloud above
          it. He causes them to distil by drops, and strains them, as it were,
          through a thin lawn, for the refreshment of the earth; and suffers
          them not to fall in the whole lump, with a violent torrent, to waste
          the industry of man, and bring famine upon the world, by destroying
          the fruits of the earth. What a wonder it would be to see but one
          entire drop of water hang itself but one inch above the ground, unless
          it be a bubble which is preserved by the air enclosed within it! What
          a wonder would it be to see a gallon of water contained in a thin
          cobweb as strongly as in a vessel of brass! Greater is the wonder of
          Divine power in those thin bottles of heaven, as they are called (Job
          xxxviii. 37); and therefore called his clouds here, as being daily
          instances of his omnipotence: that the air should sustain those
          rolling vessels, as it should seem, weightier than itself; that the
          force of this mass of waters should not break so thin a prison, and
          hasten to its proper place, which is below the air: that they should
          be daily confined against their natural inclination, and held by so
          slight a chain; that there should be such a gradual and successive
          falling of them, as if the air were pierced with holes like a
          gardener’s watering‑pot, and not fall in one entire body to drown or
          drench some parts of the earth. These are hourly miracles of Divine
          power, as little regarded as clearly visible. He proceeds (ver. 9),
          “He holds back the face of his throne, and spreads the clouds upon
          it.” The clouds are designed as curtains to cover the heavens, as well
          as vessels to water the earth (Ps. cxlvii. 8). As a tapestry curtain
          between the heavens, the throne of God (Isa. lxvi. 1), and the earth
          his footstool: the heavens are called his throne, because his power
          doth most shine forth there, and magnificently declare the glory of
          God; and the clouds are as a screen between the scorching heat of the
          sun, and the tender plants of the earth, and the weak bodies of men.
          From hence he descends to the sea, and considers the Divine power
          apparent in the bounding of it (ver. 10); “He hath compassed the
          waters with bounds, till the day and night come to an end.” This is
          several times mentioned in Scripture as a signal mark of Divine
          strength (Job xxxviii. 8; Prov. viii. 27). He hath measured a place
          for the sea, and struck the limits of it as with a compass, that it
          might not mount above the surface of the land, and ruin the ends of
          the earth’s creation; and this, while day and night have their mutual
          turns, till he shall make an end of time by removing the measures of
          it. The bounds of the tumultuous sea are, in many places, as weak as
          the bottles of the upper waters; the one is contained in thin air, and
          the other restrained by weak sands, in many places, as well as by
          stubborn rocks in others; that, though it swells, foams, roars, and
          the waves, encouraged and egged on by strong winds, come like
          mountains against the shore; they overflow it not, but humble
          themselves when they come near to those sands, which are set as their
          lists and limits, and retire back to the womb that brought them forth,
          as if they were ashamed and repented of their proud invasion: or else
          it may be meant of the tides of the sea, and the stated time God hath
          set it for its ebbing and flowing, till night and day come to an
          end;811 both that the fluid waters should contain themselves within
          due bounds, and keep their perpetually orderly motion, are amazing
          arguments of Divine power. He passes on to the consideration of the
          commotions in the air and earth, raised and stilled by the power of
          God; “The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astonished at his
          reproof.” By pillars of heaven are not meant angels, as some think,
          but either the air, called the pillars of heaven in regard of place,
          as it continues and knits together the parts of the world, as pillars
          do the upper and nether parts of a building: as the lowest parts of
          the earth are called the foundations of the earth, so the lowest parts
          of the heaven may be called the pillars of heaven:812 or else by that
          phrase may be meant mountains, which seem, at a distance, to touch the
          sky, as pillars do the top of a structure; and so it may be spoken,
          according to vulgar capacity, which imagines the heavens to be
          sustained by the two extreme parts of the earth, as a convex body, or
          to be arched by pillars; whence the Scripture, according to common
          apprehensions, mentions the ends of the earth, and the utmost parts of
          the heavens, though they have properly no end, as being round. The
          power of God is seen in those commotions in the air and earth, by
          thunders, lightnings, storms, earthquakes, which rack the air, and
          make the mountains and hills tremble as servants before a frowning and
          rebuking master. And as he makes motions in the earth and air, so is
          his power seen in their influences upon the sea; “He judges the sea
          with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud”
          (ver. 12). At the creation he put the waters into several channels,
          and caused the dry land to appear barefaced for a habitation for man
          and beasts; or rather, he splits the sea by storms, as though he would
          make the bottom of the deep visible, and rakes up the sands to the
          surface of the waters, and marshals the waves into mountains and
          valleys. After that, “he smites through the proud,” that is, humbles
          the proud waves, and, by allaying the storm, reduceth them to their
          former level: the power of God is visible, as well in rebuking, as in
          awakening the winds; he makes them sensible of his voice, and,
          according to his pleasure, exasperates or calms them. The “striking
          through the proud” here, is not, probably, meant of the destruction of
          the Egyptian army, for some guess that Job died that year,813 or about
          the time of the Israelites coming out of Egypt; so that this discourse
          here, being in the time of his affliction, could not point at that
          which was done after his restoration to his temporal prosperity. And
          now, at last, he sums up the power of God, in the chiefest of his
          works above, and the greatest wonder of his works below (ver. 13); “By
          his Spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the
          crooked serpent,” &amp;c. The greater and lesser lights, sun, moon,
          and stars, the ornaments and furniture of heaven; and the whale, a
          prodigious monument of God’s power, often mentioned in Scripture to
          this purpose, and, in particular, in this book of Job (ch. xli.); and
          called by the same name of crooked serpent (Isa. xxvii. 1), where it
          is applied, by way of metaphor, to the king of Assyria or Egypt, or
          all oppressors of the church. Various interpretations there are of
          this crooked serpent: some understanding that constellation in heaven
          which astronomers call the dragon; some that combination of weaker
          stars, which they call the galaxia, which winds about the heavens: but
          it is most probable that Job, drawing near to a conclusion of his
          discourse, joins the two greatest testimonies of God’s power in the
          world, the highest heavens, and the lowest leviathan, which is here
          called a bar serpent,814 in regard of his strength and hardness, as
          mighty men are called bars in Scripture (Jer. li. 30); “Her bars are
          broken things.” And in regard of this power of God in the creation of
          this creature, it is particularly mentioned in the catalogue of God’s
          works (Gen. i. 21); “And God created great whales;” all the other
          creatures being put into one sum, and not particularly expressed. And
          now he makes use of this lecture in the text, “Lo, these are parts of
          his ways; but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of
          his power who can understand?” This is but a small landscape of some
          of his works of power; the outsides and extremities of it; more
          glorious things are within his palaces: though those things argue a
          stupendous power of the Creator, in his works of creation and
          providence, yet they are nothing to what may be declared of his power.
          And what may be declared, is nothing to what may be conceived; and
          what may be conceived, is nothing to what is above the conceptions of
          any creature. These are but little crumbs and fragments of that
          Infinite Power, which is, in his nature, like a drop in comparison of
          the mighty ocean; a hiss or whisper in comparison of a mighty voice of
          thunder.815 This, which I have spoken, is but like a spark to the
          fiery region, a few lines, by the by, a drop of speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thunder of his power. Some understand it of thunder literally, for
          material thunder in the air: “The thunder of his power,” that is,
          according to the Hebrew dialect, “his powerful thunder.” This is not
          the sense; the nature of thunder in the air doth not so much exceed
          the capacity of human understanding; it is, therefore, rather to be
          understood metaphorically, “the thunder of his power,” that is, the
          greatness and immensity of his power, manifested in the magnificent
          miracles of nature, in the consideration whereof men are astonished,
          as if they had heard an unusual clap of thunder. So thunder is used
          (Job xxxix. 25), “The thunder of the captains;” that is, strength and
          force of the captains of an army: and (ver. 19), God, speaking to Job
          of a horse, saith, “Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?” that is,
          strength: and thunder being a mark of the power of God, some of the
          heathen have called God by the name of a Thunderer.816 As thunder
          pierceth the lowest places, and alters the state of things, so doth
          the power of God penetrate into all things whatsoever; the thunder of
          his power, that is, the greatness of his power; as “the strength of
          salvation” (Ps. xx. 6), that is, a mighty salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who can understand? Who is able to count all the monuments of his
          power? How doth this little, which I have spoken of, exceed the
          capacity of our understanding, and is rather the matter of our
          astonishment, than the object of our comprehensive knowledge. The
          power of the greatest potentate, or the mightiest creature, is but of
          small extent: none but have their limits; it may be understood how far
          they can act, in what sphere their activity is bounded: but when I
          have spoken all of Divine power that I can, when you have thought all
          that you can think of it, your souls will prompt you to conceive
          something more beyond what I have spoken, and what you have thought.
          His power shines in everything, and is beyond everything. There is
          infinitely more power lodged in his nature, not expressed to the
          world. The understanding of men and angels, centred in one creature,
          would fall short of the perception of the infiniteness of it. All that
          can be comprehended of it, are but little fringes of it, a small
          portion. No man ever discoursed, or can, of God’s power, according to
          the magnificence of it. No creature can conceive it; God himself only
          comprehends it; God himself is only able to express it. Man’s power
          being limited, his line is too short to measure the incomprehensible
          omnipotence of God. “The thunder of his power who can understand?”
          that is, none can. The text is a lofty declaration of the Divine
          power, with a particular note of attention, Lo! I. In the expressions
          of it, in the works of creation and providence, Lo, these are his
          ways; ways and works excelling any created strength, referring to the
          little summary of them he had made before. II. In the insufficiency of
          these ways to measure his power, But how little a portion is heard of
          him. III. In the incomprehensibleness of it, The thunder of his power,
          who can understand? Doctrine. Infinite and incomprehensible power
          pertains to the nature of God, and is expressed, in part, in his
          works; or, though there be a mighty expression of Divine power in his
          works, yet an incomprehensible power pertains to his nature. “The
          thunder of his power, who can understand?”
        </p>
        <p>
          His power glitters in all his works, as well as his wisdom (Ps. lxii.
          11): “Twice have I heard this, that power belongs unto God.” In the
          law and in the prophets, say some; but why power twice, and not mercy,
          which he speaks of in the following verse? he had heard of power
          twice, from the voice of creation, and from the voice of government.
          Mercy was heard in government after man’s fall, not creation; innocent
          man was an object of God’s goodness, not of his mercy, till he made
          himself miserable; power was expressed in both; or, twice have I heard
          that power belongs to God, that is, it is a certain and undoubted
          truth, that power is essential to the Divine nature. It is true, mercy
          is essential, justice is essential; but power more apparently
          essential, because no acts of mercy, or justice, or wisdom, can be
          exercised by him without power; the repetition of a thing confirms the
          certainty of it. Some observe, that God is called Almighty seventy
          times in Scripture.817 Though his power be evident in all his works,
          yet he hath a power beyond the expression of it in his works, which,
          as it is the glory of his nature, so it is the comfort of a believer.
          To which purpose the apostle expresseth it by an excellent paraphrasis
          for the honor of the Divine nature (Eph. iii. 20): “Now unto him that
          is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think,
          unto him be glory in the churches.” We have reason to acknowledge him
          Almighty, who hath a power of acting above our power of understanding.
          Who could have imagined such a powerful operation in the propagation
          of the gospel, and the conversion of the Gentiles, which the apostle
          seems to hint at in that place? His power is expressed by “horns in
          his hands” (Hab. iii. 4); because all the works of his hands are
          wrought with Almighty strength. Power is also used as a name of God
          (Mark xiv. 62): “The Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power,”
          that is, at the right hand of God; God and power are so inseparable,
          that they are reciprocated. As his essence is immense, not to be
          confined in place; as it is eternal, not to be measured by time; so it
          is Almighty, not to be limited in regard of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is ingenuously illustrated by some by a unit;818 all numbers
          depend upon it; it makes numbers by addition, multiplies them
          unexpressibly; when one unit is removed from a number, how vastly doth
          it diminish it! It gives perfection to all other numbers, it receives
          perfection from none. If you add a unit before 100, how doth it
          multiply it to 1,100! If you set a unit before 20,000,000, it
          presently makes the number swell up to 120,000,000; and so powerful is
          a unit, by adding it to numbers, that it will infinitely enlarge them
          to such a vastness, that shall transcend the capacity of the best
          arithmetician to count them. By such a meditation as this, you may
          have some prospect of the power of that God who is only unity; the
          beginning of all things, as a unit is the beginning of all numbers;
          and can perform as many things really, as a unit can numerically; that
          is, can do as much in the making of creatures, as a unit can do in the
          multiplying of numbers. The omnipotence of God was scarce denied by
          any heathen that did not deny the being of a God; and that was Pliny,
          and that upon weak arguments.

          2. Indeed we cannot have a conception of God, if we conceive him not
          most powerful, as well as most wise; he is not a God that cannot do
          what he will, and perform all his pleasure. If we imagine him
          restrained in his power, we imagine him limited in his essence; as he
          hath an infinite knowledge to know what is possible, he cannot be
          without an infinite power to do what is possible; as he hath a will to
          resolve what he sees good, so he cannot want a power to effect what he
          sees good to decree; as the essence of a creature cannot be conceived
          without that activity that belongs to his nature; as when you conceive
          fire, you cannot conceive it without a power of burning and warming;
          and when you conceive water, you cannot conceive it without a power of
          moistening and cleansing: so you cannot conceive an infinite essence
          without an infinite power of activity; and therefore a heathen could
          say, “If you know God, you know he can do all things;” and therefore,
          saith Austin, “Give me not only a Christian, but a Jew; not only a
          Jew, but a heathen, that will deny God to be Almighty.” A Jew, a
          heathen, may deny Christ to be omnipotent, but no heathen will deny
          God to be omnipotent, and no devil will deny either to be so: God
          cannot be conceived without some power, for then he must be conceived
          without action. Whose, then, are those products and effects of power,
          which are visible to us in the world? to whom do they belong? who is
          the Father of them? God cannot be conceived without a power suitable
          to his nature and essence. If we imagine him to be of an infinite
          essence, we must imagine him to be of an infinite power and strength.

          In particular, I shall show—I. The nature of God’s power. II. Reasons
          to prove that God must needs be powerful. III. How his power appears
          in creation, in government, in redemption. IV. The Use.
        </p>
        <p>I. What this power is; or the nature of it.</p>
        <p>
          1. Power sometimes signifies authority: and a man is said to be mighty
          and powerful in regard of his dominion, and the right he hath to
          command multitudes of other persons to take his part; but power taken
          for strength, and power taken for authority, are distinct things, and
          may be separated from one another. Power may be without authority; as
          in successful invasions, that have no just foundation. Authority may
          be without power; as in a just prince, expelled by an unjust
          rebellion, the authority resides in him, though he be overpowered, and
          is destitute of strength to support and exercise that authority. The
          power of God is not to be understood of his authority and dominion,
          but his strength to act; and the word in the text properly signifies
          strength.819
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This power is divided ordinarily into absolute and ordinate.
          Absolute, is that power whereby God is able to do that which he will
          not do, but is possible to be done; ordinate, is that power whereby
          God doth that which he hath decreed to do, that is, which he hath
          ordained or appointed to be exercised;820 which are not distinct
          powers, but one and the same power. His ordinate power is a part of
          his absolute; for if he had not a power to do every thing that he
          could will, he might not have the power to do everything that he doth
          will. The object of his absolute power is all things possible; such
          things that imply not a contradiction, such that are not repugnant in
          their own nature to be done, and such as are not contrary to the
          nature and perfections of God to be done. Those things that are
          repugnant in their own nature to be done are several, as to make a
          thing which is past not to be past. As, for example, the world is
          created; God could have chose whether he would create the world, and
          after it is created he hath power to dissolve it; but after it was
          created, and when it is dissolved, it will be eternally true, that the
          world was created, and that it was dissolved; for it is impossible,
          that that which was once true, should ever be false: if it be true
          that the world was created, it will forever be true that it was
          created, and cannot be otherwise. And also, if it be once true that
          God hath decreed, it is impossible in its own nature to be true that
          God hath not decreed. Some things are repugnant to the nature and
          perfections of God; as it is impossible for his nature to die and
          perish; impossible for him, in regard of truth, to lie and deceive.
          But of this hereafter; only at present to understand the object of
          God’s absolute power to be things possible, that is, possible in
          nature; not by any strength in themselves, or of themselves; for
          nothing hath no strength, and everything is nothing before it comes
          into being;821 so God, by his absolute power, might have prevented the
          sin of the fallen angels, and so have preserved them in their first
          habitation. He might, by his absolute power, have restrained the devil
          from tempting of Eve, or restrained her and Adam from swallowing the
          bait, and joining hands with the temptation. By his absolute power,
          God might have given the reins to Peter to betray his Master, as well
          as to deny him; and employed Judas in the same glorious and successful
          service, wherein he employed Paul. By his absolute power, he might
          have created the world millions of years before he did create it, and
          can reduce it into its empty nothing this moment. This the Baptist
          affirms, when he tells us, “That God is able of these stones (meaning
          the stones in the wilderness, and not the people which came out to him
          out of Judea, which were children of Abraham) to raise up children to
          Abraham” (Matt. iii. 9); that is, there is a possibility of such a
          thing there is no contradiction in it, but that God is able to do it
          if he please. But now the object of his ordinate power, is all things
          ordained by him to be done, all things decreed by him; and because of
          the Divine ordination of things, this power is called ordinate; and
          what is thus ordained by him he cannot but do, because of his
          unchangeableness. Both those powers are expressed (Matt. xxvi. 53,
          54), “My Father can send twelve legions of angels,” there is his
          absolute power; “but how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that
          thus it must be?” there is his ordinate power. As his power is free
          from any act of his will, it is called absolute; as it is joined with
          an act of his will, it is called ordinate. His absolute power is
          necessary, and belongs to his nature; his ordinate power is free, and
          belongs to his will;—a power guided by his will,—not, as I said
          before, that they are two distinct powers, both belonging to his
          nature, but the latter is the same with the former, only it is guided
          by his will and wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It follows, then, that the power of God is that ability and
          strength, whereby he can bring to pass whatsoever he please;
          whatsoever his infinite wisdom can direct, and whatsoever the infinite
          purity of his will can resolve. Power, in the primary notion of it,
          doth not signify an act, but an ability to bring a thing into act; it
          is power, as able to act before it doth actually produce a thing: as
          God had an ability to create before he did create, he had power before
          he acted that power without. Power notes the principle of the action,
          and, therefore, is greater than the act itself. Power exercised and
          diffused, in bringing forth and nursing in its particular objects
          without, is inconceivably less than that strength which is infinite in
          himself, the same with his essence, and is indeed himself: by his
          power exercised he doth whatsoever he actually wills; but by the power
          in his nature, he is able to do whatsoever he is able to will. The
          will of creatures may be, and is more extensive than their power; and
          their power more contracted and shortened than their will: but, as the
          prophet saith, “His counsel shall stand, and he will do all his
          pleasure” (Isa. xlvi. 10). His power is as great as his will, that is,
          whatsoever can fall within the verge of his will, falls within the
          compass of his power. Though he will never actually will this or that,
          yet supposing he should will it, he is able to perform it: so that you
          must, in your notion of Divine power, enlarge it further than to think
          God can only do what he hath resolved to do; but that he hath as
          infinite a capacity of power to act, as he hath an infinite capacity
          of will to resolve. Besides, this power is of that nature, that he can
          do whatsoever he pleases without difficulty, without resistance; it
          cannot be checked, restrained, frustrated.822 As he can do all things
          possible in regard of the object, he can do all things easily in
          regard of the manner of acting: what in human artificers is knowledge,
          labor, industry, that in God is his will; his will works without
          labor; his works stand forth as he wills them. Hands and arms are
          ascribed to him for our conceptions, because our power of acting is
          distinct from our will; but God’s power of acting is not really
          distinct from his will; it is sufficient to the existence of a thing
          that God wills it to exist; he can act what he will only by his will,
          without any instruments. He needs no matter to work upon, because he
          can make something from nothing; all matter owes itself to his
          creative power: he needs no time to work in, for he can make time when
          he pleases to begin to work: he needs no copy to work by; himself is
          his own pattern and copy in his works. All created agents want matter
          to work upon, instruments to work with, copies to work by; time to
          bring either the births of their minds, or the works of their hands,
          to perfection: but the power of God needs none of these things, but is
          of a vast and incomprehensible nature, beyond all these. As nothing
          can be done without the compass of it, so itself is without the
          compass of every created understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This power is of a distinct conception from the wisdom and will of
          God. They are not really distinct, but according to our conceptions.
          We cannot discourse of Divine things, without observing some
          proportion of them with human, ascribing unto God the perfections,
          sifted from the imperfections of our nature. In us there are three
          orders—of understanding, will, power; and, accordingly, three acts,
          counsel, resolution, execution; which, though they are distinct in us,
          are not really distinct in God. In our conceptions, the apprehension
          of a thing belongs to the understanding of God; determination, to the
          will of God; direction, to the wisdom of God; execution, to the power
          of God. The knowledge of God regards a thing as possible, and as it
          may be done; the wisdom of God regards a thing as fit, and convenient
          to be done; the will of God resolves that it shall be done; the power
          of God is the application of his will to effect what it hath resolved.
          Wisdom is a fixing the being of things, the measures and perfections
          of their several beings; power is a conferring those perfections and
          beings upon them. His power is his ability to act, and his wisdom is
          the director of his action: his will orders, his wisdom guides, and
          his power effects. His will as the spring, and his power as the
          worker, are expressed (Ps. cxv. 3). “He hath done whatsoever he
          pleased. He commanded, and they were created” (Ps. cxl. 5); and all
          three expressed (Eph. i. 11), “Who works all things according to the
          counsel of his own will:” so that the power of God is a perfection, as
          it were, subordinate to his understanding and will, to execute the
          results of his wisdom, and the orders of his will; to his wisdom as
          directing, because he works skilfully; to his will as moving and
          applying, because he works voluntarily and freely. The exercise of his
          power depends upon his will: his will is the supreme cause of
          everything that stands up in time, and all things receive a being as
          he wills them. His power is but will perpetually working, and
          diffusing itself in the season his will hath fixed from eternity; it
          is his eternal will in perpetual and successive springs and streams in
          the creatures; it is nothing else but the constant efficacy of his
          omnipotent will. This must be understood of his ordinate power; but
          his absolute power is larger than his resolving will: for though the
          Scripture tells us, “He hath done whatsoever he will,” yet it tells us
          not, that he hath done whatsoever he could: he can do things that he
          will never do. Again, his power is distinguished from his will in
          regard of the exercise of it, which is after the act of his will: his
          will was conversant about objects, when his power was not exercised
          about them. Creatures were the objects of his will from eternity, but
          they were not from eternity the effects of his power. His purpose to
          create was from eternity, but the execution of his purpose was in
          time. Now this execution of his will we call his ordinate power: his
          wisdom and his will are supposed antecedent to his power, as the
          counsel and resolve; as the cause precedes the performance of the
          purpose as the effect. Some823 distinguish his power from his
          understanding and will, in regard that his understanding and will are
          larger than his absolute power; for God understands sins, and wills to
          permit them, but he cannot himself do any evil or unjust action, nor
          have a power of doing it. But this is not to distinguish that Divine
          power, but impotence; for to be unable to do evil is the perfection of
          power; and to be able to do things unjust and evil, is a weakness,
          imperfection, and inability. Man indeed wills many things that he is
          not able to perform, and understands many things that he is not able
          to effect; he understands much of the creatures, something of sun,
          moon, and stars; he can conceive many suns, many moons, yet is not
          able to create the least atom: but there is nothing that belongs to
          power but God understands, and is able to effect. To sum this up, the
          will of God is the root of all, the wisdom of God is the copy of all,
          and the power of God is the framer of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The power of God gives activity to all the other perfections of his
          nature, and is of a larger extent and efficacy, in regard of its
          objects, than some perfections of his nature. I put them both
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It contributes life and activity to all the other perfections of
          his nature. How vain would be his eternal counsels, if power did not
          step in to execute them! His mercy would be a feeble pity, if he were
          destitute of power to relieve; and his justice a slighted scarecrow,
          without power to punish; his promises an empty sound, without power to
          accomplish them. As holiness is the beauty, so power is the life of
          all his attributes in their exercise; and as holiness, so power, is an
          adjunct belonging to all, a term that may be given to all. God hath a
          powerful wisdom to attain his ends without interruption: he hath a
          powerful mercy to remove our misery; a powerful justice to lay all
          misery upon offenders: he hath a powerful truth to perform his
          promises; an infinite power to bestow rewards, and inflict penalties.
          It is to this purpose power is first put in the two things which the
          Psalmist had heard (Ps. lxii. 11, 12). “Twice have I heard,” or two
          things have I heard; first power, then mercy and justice, included in
          that expression, “Thou renderest to every man according to his work:”
          in every perfection of God he heard of power. This is the arm, the
          hand of the Deity, which all his other attributes lay hold on, when
          they would appear in their glory; this hands them to the world: by
          this they act, in this they triumph. Power framed every stage for
          their appearance in creation, providence, redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is of a larger extent, in regard of its objects, than some
          other attributes. Power doth not alway suppose an object, but
          constitutes an object. It supposeth an object in the act of
          preservation, but it makes an object in the act of creation; but mercy
          supposeth an object miserable, yet doth not make it so. Justice
          supposeth an object criminal, but doth not constitute it so: mercy
          supposeth him miserable, to relieve him; justice supposeth him
          criminal, to punish him: but power supposeth not a thing in real
          existence, but as possible; or rather, it is from power that any thing
          hath a possibility, if there be no repugnancy in the nature of the
          thing. Again, power extends further than either mercy or justice.
          Mercy hath particular objects, which justice shall not at last be
          willing to punish; and justice hath particular objects, which mercy at
          last shall not be willing to refresh: but power doth, and alway will,
          extend to the objects of both mercy and justice. A creature, as a
          creature, is neither the object of mercy nor justice, nor of rewarding
          goodness: a creature, as innocent, is the object of rewarding
          goodness; a creature, as miserable, is the object of compassionate
          mercy; a creature, as criminal, is the object of revenging justice:
          but all of them the objects of power, in conjunction with those
          attributes of goodness, mercy, and justice, to which they belong. All
          the objects that mercy, and justice, and truth, and wisdom, exercise
          themselves about, hath a possibility and an actual being from this
          perfection of Divine power. It is power first frames a creature in a
          capacity of nature for mercy or justice, though it doth not give an
          immediate qualification for the exercise of either. Power makes man a
          rational creature, and so confers upon him a nature mutable, which may
          be miserable by its own fault, and punishable by God’s justice; or
          pitiable by God’s compassion, and relievable by God’s mercy: but it
          doth not make him sinful, whereby he becomes miserable and punishable.
          Again, power runs through all the degrees of the states of a creature.
          As a thing is possible, or may be made, it is the object of absolute
          power; as it is factibile, or ordered to be made, it is the object of
          ordinate power: as a thing is actually made, and brought into being,
          it is the object of preserving power. So that power doth stretch out
          its arms to all the works of God, in all their circumstances, and at
          all times. When mercy ceaseth to relieve a creature, when justice
          ceaseth to punish a creature, power ceaseth not to preserve a
          creature. The blessed in heaven, that are out of the reach of
          punishing justice, are forever maintained by power in that blessed
          condition: the damned in hell, that are cast out of the bosom of
          entreating mercy, are forever sustained in those remediless torments
          by the Arm of Power.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This power is originally and essentially in the nature of God, and
          not distinct from his essence. It is originally and essentially in
          God. The strength and power of great kings is originally in their
          people, and managed and ordered by the authority of the prince for the
          common good. Though a prince hath authority in his person to command,
          yet he hath not sufficient strength in his person, without the
          assistance of others, to make his commands to be obeyed. He hath not a
          single strength in his own person to conquer countries and kingdoms,
          and increase the number of his subjects: he must make use of the arms
          of his own subjects, to overrun other places, and yoke them under his
          dominion: but the power of all things that ever were, are, or shall
          be, is originally and essentially in God. It is not derived from any
          thing without him, as the power of the greatest potentates in the
          world is: therefore (Ps. lxii. 11) it is said, “Power belongs unto
          God,” that is, solely and to none else. He hath a power to make his
          subjects, and as many as he pleases; to create worlds, to enjoin
          precepts, to execute penalties, without calling in the strength of his
          creatures to his aid. The strength that the subjects of a mortal
          prince have, is not derived to them from the prince, though the
          exercise of it for this or that end, is ordered and directed by the
          authority of the prince: but what strength soever any thing hath to
          act as a means, it hath from the power of God as Creator, as well as
          whatsoever authority it hath to act is from God, as a Rector and
          Governor of the world. God hath a strength to act without means, and
          no means can act any thing without his power and strength communicated
          to them. As the clouds, in ver. 8, before the text, are called God’s
          clouds, “his clouds:” so all the strength of creatures may be called,
          and truly is, God’s strength and power in them: a drop of power shot
          down from heaven, originally only in God. Creatures have but a little
          mite of power; somewhat communicated to them, somewhat kept and
          reserved from them, of what they are capable to possess. They have
          limited natures, and therefore a limited sphere of activity. Clothes
          can warm us, but not feed us; bread can nourish us, but not clothe us.
          One plant hath a medicinal quality against one disease, another
          against another; but God is the possessor of universal power, the
          common exchequer of this mighty treasure. He acts by creatures, as not
          needing their power, but deriving power to them: what he acts by them,
          he could act himself without them: and what they act as from
          themselves, is derived to them from him through invisible channels.
          And hence it will follow, that because power is essentially in God,
          more operations of God are possible than are exerted. And as power is
          essentially in God, so it is not distinct from his essence. It belongs
          to God in regard of the inconceivable excellency and activity of his
          essence.824 And omnipotent is nothing but the Divine essence
          efficacious ad extra. It is his essence as operative, and the
          immediate principle of operation: as the power of enlightening in the
          sun, and the power of heating in the fire, are not things distinct
          from the nature of them; but the nature of the sun bringing forth
          light, and the nature of the fire bringeth forth heat. The power of
          acting is the same with the substance of God, though the action from
          that power be terminated in the creature. If the power of God were
          distinct from his essence, he were then compounded of substance and
          power, and would not be the most simple being. As when the
          understanding is informed in several parts of knowledge, it is skilled
          in the government of cities and countries, it knows this or that art:
          it learns mathematics, philosophy; this, or that science. The
          understanding hath a power to do this; but this power, whereby it
          learns those excellent things, and brings forth excellent births, is
          not a thing distinct from the understanding itself; we may rather call
          it the understanding powerful, than the power of the understanding;
          and so we may rather say, God powerful, than say, the power of God;
          because his power is not distinct from his essence. From both these,
          it will follow, that this omnipotence is incommunicable to any
          creature; no creature can inherit it, because it is a contradiction
          for any creature to have the essence of God. This omnipotence is a
          peculiar right of God, wherein no creature can share with him. To be
          omnipotent is to be essentially God. And for a creature to be
          omnipotent, is for a creature to be its own Creator. It being
          therefore the same with the essence of the Godhead, it cannot be
          communicated to the humanity of Christ, as the Lutherans say it is,
          without the communication of the essence of the Godhead; for then the
          humanity of Christ would not be humanity, but Deity. If omnipotence
          were communicated to the humanity of Christ, the essence of God were
          also communicated to his humanity, and then eternity would be
          communicated. His humanity then was not given him in time; his
          humanity would be uncompounded, that is, his body would be no body,
          his soul no soul. Omnipotence is essentially in God; it is not
          distinct from the essence of God, it is his essence, omnipotent, able
          to do all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Hence it follows, that this power is infinite (Eph. i. 19); “What
          is the exceeding greatness of his power,” &amp;c. “according to the
          working of his mighty power.” God were not omnipotent, unless his
          power were infinite; for a finite power is a limited power, and a
          limited power cannot effect everything that is possible. Nothing can
          be too difficult for the Divine power to effect; he hath a fullness of
          power, an exceeding strength, above all human capacities; it is a
          “mighty power” (Eph. i. 19), “able to do above all that we can ask or
          think” (Eph. iii. 20): that which he acts, is above the power of any
          creature to act. Infinite power consists in the bringing things forth
          from nothing. No creature can imitate God in this prerogative of
          power. Man indeed can carve various forms, and erect various pieces of
          art, but from pre‑existent matter. Every artificer hath the matter
          brought to his hand, he only brings it forth in a new figure. Chemists
          separate one thing from another, but create nothing, but sever those
          things which were before compacted and crudled together: but when God
          speaks a powerful word, nothing begins to be something: things stand
          forth from the womb of nothing, and obey his mighty command, and take
          what forms he is pleased to give them. The creating one thing, though
          never so small and minute, as the least fly, cannot be but by an
          infinite power; much less can the producing of such variety we see in
          the world. His power is infinite, in regard it cannot be resisted by
          anything that he hath made; nor can it be confined by anything he can
          will to make. “His greatness is unsearchable” (Ps. cxlv. 3). It is a
          greatness, not of quantity, but quality. The greatness of his power
          hath no end: it is a vanity to imagine any limits can be affixed to
          it, or that any creature can say, “Hitherto it can go, and no
          further.” It is above all conception, all inquisition of any created
          understanding. No creature ever had, nor ever can have, that strength
          of wit and understanding, to conceive the extent of his power, and how
          magnificently he can work.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, His essence is infinite. As in a finite subject there is a
          finite virtue, so in an infinite subject there must be an infinite
          virtue. Where the essence is limited, the power is so:825 where the
          essence is unlimited, the power knows no bounds.826 Among creatures,
          the more excellency of being and form anything hath, the more
          activity, vigor, and power it hath, to work according to its nature.
          The sun hath a mighty power to warm, enlighten, and fructify, above
          what the stars have; because it hath a vaster body, more intense
          degrees of light, heat, and vigor. Now, if you conceive the sun made
          much greater than it is, it would proportionably have greater degrees
          of power to heat and enlighten than it hath now: and were it possible
          to have an infinite heat and light, it would infinitely heat and
          enlighten other things; for everything is able to act according to the
          measures of its being: therefore, since the essence of God is
          unquestionably infinite, his power of acting must be so also. His
          power (as was said before) is one and the same with his essence: and
          though the knowledge of God extends to more objects than his power,
          because he knows all evils of sin, which because of his holiness he
          cannot commit, yet it is as infinite as his knowledge, because it is
          as much one with his essence, as his knowledge and wisdom is: for as
          the wisdom or knowledge of God is nothing but the essence of God,
          knowing, so the power of God is nothing but the essence of God, able.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objects of Divine power are innumerable. The objects of Divine
          power are not essentially infinite; and therefore we must not measure
          the infiniteness of Divine power by an ability to make an infinite
          being; because there is an incapacity in any created thing to be
          infinite; for to be a creature and to be infinite; to be infinite and
          yet made, is a contradiction. To be infinite, and to be God, is one
          and the same thing. Nothing can be infinite but God; nothing but God
          is infinite. But the power of God is infinite, because it can produce
          infinite effects, or innumerable things, such as surpass the
          arithmetic of a creature; nor yet doth the infiniteness consist simply
          in producing innumerable effects; for that a finite cause can produce.
          Fire can, by its finite and limited heat, burn numberless combustible
          things and parcels; and the understanding of man hath an infinite
          number of thoughts and acts of intellection, and thoughts different
          from one another. Who can number the imaginations of his fancy, and
          thoughts of his mind, the space of one month or year? much less of
          forty or an hundred years; yet all these thoughts are about things
          that are in being, or have a foundation in things that are in being.
          But the infiniteness of God’s power consists in an ability to produce
          infinite effects, formally distinct, and diverse from one another;
          such as never had being, such as the mind of man cannot conceive:
          “Able to do above what we can think” (Eph. iii. 20). And whatsoever
          God hath made, or is able to make, he is able to make in an infinite
          manner, by calling them to stand forth from nothing. To produce
          innumerable effects of distinct natures, and from so distant a term as
          nothing, is an argument of infinite power. Now, that the objects of
          Divine power are innumerable, appears, because God can do infinitely
          more than he hath done, or will do. Nothing that God hath done can
          enfeeble or dull his power; there still resides in him an ability
          beyond all the settled contrivances of his understanding and resolves
          of his will, which no effects which he hath wrought can drain and put
          to a stand. As he can raise stones to be children to Abraham (Matt.
          iii. 9); so with the same mighty word, whereby he made one world, he
          can make infinite numbers of worlds to be the monuments of his glory.
          After the prophet Jeremiah (ch. xxxii. 17), had spoke of God’s power
          in creation, he adds, “And there is nothing too hard for thee.” For
          one world that he hath made, he can create millions: for one star
          which he hath beautified the heavens with, he could have garnished it
          with a thousand, and multiplied, if he had pleased, every one of those
          into millions, “for he can call things that are not” (Rom. iv. 17);
          not some things, but all things possible. The barren womb of nothing
          can no more resist his power now to educe a world from it, than it
          could at first: no doubt, but for one angel which he hath made, he
          could make many worlds of angels. He that made one with so much ease,
          as by a word, cannot want power to make many more, till he wants a
          word. The word that was not too weak to make one, cannot be too weak
          to make multitudes. If from one man he hath, in a way of nature,
          multiplied so many in all ages of the world, and covered with them the
          whole face of the earth; he could, in a supernatural way, by one word,
          multiply as many more. “It is the breath of the Almighty that gives
          life” (Job. xxxiii. 4). He can create infinite species and kinds of
          creatures more than he hath created, more variety of forms: for since
          there is no searching of his greatness, there is no conceiving the
          numberless possible effects of his power. The understanding of man can
          conceive numberless things possible to be, more than have been or
          shall be. And shall we imagine, that a finite understanding of a
          creature hath a greater omnipotency to conceive things possible, than
          God hath to produce things possible? When the understanding of man is
          tired in its conceptions, it must still be concluded, that the power
          of God extends, not only to what can be conceived, but infinitely
          beyond the measures of a finite faculty. “Touching the Almighty, we
          cannot find him out; he is excellent in power and in judgment” (Job
          xxxvi. 23). For the understanding of man, in its conceptions of more
          kind of creatures, is limited to those creatures which are: it cannot,
          in its own imagination, conceive anything but what hath some
          foundation in and from something already in being. It may frame a new
          kind of creature, made up of a lion, a horse, an ox; but all those
          parts whereof its conception is made, have distinct beings in the
          world, though not in that composition as his mind mixes and joins
          them; but no question but God can create creatures that have no
          resemblance with any kind of creatures yet in being. It is certain
          that if God only knows those things which he hath done, and will do,
          and not all things possible to be done by him, his knowledge were
          finite; so if he could do no more than what he hath done, his power
          would be finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Creatures have a power to act about more objects than they do.
          The understanding of man can frame from one principle of truth, many
          conclusions and inferences more than it doth. Why cannot, then, the
          power of God frame from one first matter, an infinite number of
          creatures more than have been created? The Almightiness of God in
          producing real effects, is not inferior to the understanding of man in
          drawing out real truths. An artificer that makes a watch, supposing
          his life and health, can make many more of a different form and
          motion; and a limner can draw many draughts, and frame many pictures
          with a new variety of colors, according to the richness of his fancy.
          If these can do so, that require a pre‑existent matter framed to their
          hands, God can much more, who can raise beautiful structures from
          nothing. As long as men have matter, they can diversify the matter,
          and make new figures from it; so long as there is nothing, God can
          produce out of that nothing whatsoever he pleases. We see the same in
          inanimate creatures. A spark of fire hath a vast power in it: it will
          kindle other things, increase and enlarge itself; nothing can be
          exempt from the active force of it. It will alter, by consuming or
          refining, whatsoever you offer to it. It will reach all, and refuse
          none; and by the efficacious power of it, all those new figures which
          we see in metals, are brought forth; when you have exposed to it a
          multitude of things, still add more, it will exert the same strength;
          yea, the vigor is increased rather than diminished. The more it
          catcheth, the more fiercely and irresistibly it will act; you cannot
          suppose an end of its operation, or a decrease of its strength, as
          long as you can conceive its duration and continuance: this must be
          but a weak shadow of that infinite power which is in God. Take another
          instance, in the sun: it hath power every year to produce flowers and
          plants from the earth; and is as able to produce them now, as it was
          at the first lighting it and rearing it in that sphere wherein it
          moves. And if there were no kind of flowers and plants now created,
          the sun hath a power residing in it, ever since its first creation, to
          afford the same warmth to them for the nourishing and bringing them
          forth. Whatsoever you can conceive the sun to be able to do in regard
          of plants, that can God do in regard of worlds; produce more worlds
          than the sun doth plants every year, without weariness, without
          languishment. The sun is able to influence more things than it doth,
          and produce numberless effects; but it doth not do so much as it is
          able to do, because it wants matter to work upon. God, therefore, who
          wants no matter, can do much more than he doth; he can either act by
          second causes if there were more, or make more second causes if he
          pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) God is the most free agent. Every free agent can do more than he
          will do. Man being a free creature, can do more than ordinarily he
          doth will to do. God is most free, as being the spring of liberty in
          other creatures; he acts not by a necessity of nature, as the waves of
          the sea, or the motions of the wind; and, therefore, is not determined
          to those things which he hath already called forth into the world. If
          God be infinitely wise in contrivance, he could contrive more than he
          hath, and therefore, can effect more than he hath effected. He doth
          not act to the extent of his power upon all occasions. It is according
          to his will that he works (Eph. i.). It is not according to his work
          that he wills; his work is an evidence of his will, but not the rule
          of his will. His power is not the rule of his will, but his will is
          the disposer of his power, according to the light of his infinite
          wisdom, and other attributes that direct his will; and therefore his
          power is not to be measured by his actual will. No doubt, but he could
          in a moment have produced that world which he took six days’ time to
          frame; he could have drowned the old world at once, without prolonging
          the time till the revolution of forty days; he was not limited to such
          a term of time by any weakness, but by the determination of his own
          will. God doth not do the hundred thousandth part of what he is able
          to do, but what is convenient to do, according to the end which he
          hath proposed to himself. Jesus Christ, as man, could have asked
          legions of angels; and God, as a sovereign, could have sent them
          (Matt. xxvi. 53). God could raise the dead every day if he pleased,
          but he doth not: he could heal every diseased person in a moment, but
          he doth not. As God can will more than he doth actually will, so he
          can do more than he hath actually done; he can do whatsoever he can
          will; he can will more worlds, and therefore can create more worlds.
          If God hath not ability to do more than he will do, he then can do no
          more than what he actually hath done; and then it will follow, that he
          is not a free, but a natural and necessary agent, which cannot be
          supposed of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second. This power is infinite in regard of action. As he can produce
          numberless objects above what he hath produced, so he could produce
          them more magnificently than he hath made them. As he never works to
          the extent of his power in regard of things, so neither in regard of
          the manner of acting; for he never acts so but he could act in a
          higher and perfecter manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) His power is infinite in regard of the independency of action: he
          wants no instrument to act. When there was nothing but God, there was
          no cause of action but God; when there was nothing in being but God,
          there could be no instrumental cause of the being of anything. God can
          perfect his action without dependence on any thing;827 and to be
          simply independent, is to be simply infinite. In this respect it is a
          power incommunicable to any creature, though you conceive a creature
          in higher degrees of perfection than it is. A creature cannot cease to
          be dependent, but it must cease to be a creature; to be a creature and
          independent, are terms repugnant to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) But the infiniteness of Divine power consists in an ability to
          give higher degrees of perfection to everything which he hath made. As
          his power is infinite extensive, in regard of the multitude of objects
          he can bring into being, so it is infinite intensive, in regard of the
          manner of operation, and the endowments he can bestow upon them.828
          Some things, indeed, God doth so perfect, that higher degrees of
          perfection cannot be imagined to be added to them.829 As the humanity
          of Christ cannot be united more gloriously than to the person of the
          Son of God, a greater degree of perfection cannot be conferred upon
          it. Nor can the souls of the blessed have a nobler object of vision
          and fruition than God himself, the infinite Being: no higher than the
          enjoyment of himself can be conferred upon a creature, respectu
          termini. This is not want of power; he cannot be greater, because he
          is greatest; not better, because he is best; nothing can be more than
          infinite. But as to the things which God hath made in the world, he
          could have given them other manner of being than they have. A human
          understanding may improve a thought or conclusion; strengthen it with
          more and more force of reason; and adorn it with richer and richer
          elegancy of language: why, then, may not the Divine providence produce
          a world more perfect and excellent than this? He that makes a plain
          vessel, can embellish it more, engrave more figures upon it, according
          to the capacity of the subject: and cannot God do so much more with
          his works? Could not God have made this world of a larger quantity,
          and the sun of a greater bulk and proportionable strength, to
          influence a bigger world? so that this world would have been to
          another that God might have made, as a ball or a mount, this sun as a
          star to another sun that he might have kindled. He could have made
          every star a sun, every spire of grass a star, every grain of dust a
          flower, every soul an angel. And though the angels be perfect
          creatures, and inexpressibly more glorious than a visible creature,
          yet who can imagine God so confined, that he cannot create a more
          excellent kind, and endow those which he hath made with excellency of
          a higher rank than he invested them with at the first moment of their
          creation? Without question God might have given the meaner creatures
          more excellent endowments, put them into another order of nature for
          their own good and more diffusive usefulness in the world. What is
          made use of by the prophet (Mal. ii. 15) in another case, may be used
          in this: “Yet had he a residue of Spirit.” The capacity of every
          creature might have been enlarged by God; for no work of his in the
          world doth equal his power, as nothing that he hath framed doth equal
          his wisdom. The same matter which is the matter of the body of a
          beast, is the matter of a plant and flower; is the matter of the body
          of a man; and so was capable of a higher form and higher perfections,
          than God hath been pleased to bestow upon it. And he had power to
          bestow that perfection on one part of matter which he denied to it,
          and bestowed on another part. If God cannot make things in a greater
          perfection, there must be some limitation of him: he cannot be limited
          by another, because nothing is superior to God. If limited by himself,
          that limitation is not from a want of power, but a want of will. He
          can, by his own power, raise stones to be children to Abraham (Matt.
          iii. 9): he could alter the nature of the stones, form them into human
          bodies, dignify them with rational souls, inspire those souls with
          such graces that may render them the children of Abraham. But for the
          more fully understanding the nature of this power, we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] That though God can make everything with a higher degree of
          perfection, yet still within the limits of a finite being. No creature
          can be made infinite, because no creature can be made God. No creature
          can be so improved as to equal the goodness and perfection of God;830
          yet there is no creature but we may conceive a possibility of its
          being made more perfect in that rank of a creature than it is: as we
          may imagine a flower or plant to have greater beauty and richer
          qualities imparted to it by Divine power, without rearing it so high
          as to the dignity of a rational or sensitive creature. Whatsoever
          perfections may be added by God to a creature, are still finite
          perfections; and a multitude of finite excellences can never amount to
          the value and honor of infinite: as if you add one number to another
          as high as you can, as much as a large piece of paper can contain, you
          can never make the numbers really infinite, though they may be
          infinite in regard of the inability of any human understanding to
          count them. The finite condition of the creature suffers it not to be
          capable of an infinite perfection. God is so great, so excellent, that
          it is his perfection not to have any equal; the defect is in the
          creature, which cannot be elevated to such a pitch; as you can never
          make a gallon measure to hold the quantity of a butt, or a butt the
          quantity of a river, or a river the fulness of the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] Though God hath a power to furnish every creature with greater
          and nobler perfections than he hath bestowed upon it, yet he hath
          framed all things in the perfectest manner, and most convenient to
          that end for which he intended them. Everything is endowed with the
          best nature and quality suitable to God’s end in creation, though not
          in the best manner for itself.831 In regard of the universal end,
          there cannot be a better; for God himself is the end of all things,
          who is the Supreme Goodness. Nothing can be better than God, who could
          not be God if he were not superlatively best, or optimus; and he hath
          ordered all things for the declaration of his goodness or justice,
          according to the behaviors of his creatures. Man doth not consider
          what strength or power he can put forth in the means he useth to
          attain such an end, but the suitableness of them to his main design,
          and so fits and marshals them to his grand purpose. Had God only
          created things that are most excellent, he had created only angels and
          men; how, then, would his wisdom have been conspicuous in other works
          in the subordination and subserviency of them to one another? God
          therefore determined his power by his wisdom: and though his absolute
          power could have made every creature better, yet his ordinate power,
          which in every step was regulated by his wisdom, made everything best
          for his designed intention.832 A musician hath a power to wind up a
          string on a lute to a higher and more perfect note in itself, but in
          wisdom he will not do it, because the intended melody would be
          disturbed thereby if it were not suited to the other strings on the
          instrument; a discord would mar and taint the harmony which the
          lutenist designed. God, in creation, observed the proportions of
          nature: he can make a spider as strong as a lion; but according to the
          order of nature which he hath settled, it is not convenient that a
          creature of so small a compass should be as strong as one of a greater
          bulk. The absolute power of God could have prepared a body for Christ
          as glorious as that he had after his resurrection; but that had not
          been agreeable to the end designed in his humiliation: and, therefore,
          God acted most perfectly by his ordinate power, in giving him a body
          that wore the livery of our infirmities. God’s power is alway
          regulated by his wisdom and will; and though it produceth not what is
          most perfect in itself, yet what is most perfect and decent in
          relation to the end he fixed. And so in his providence, though he
          could rack the whole frame of nature to bring about his ends in a more
          miraculous way and astonishment to mortals, yet his power is usually
          and ordinarily confined by his will to act in concurrence with the
          nature of the creatures, and direct them according to the laws of
          their being, to such ends which he aims at in their conduct, without
          violencing their nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] Though God hath an absolute power to make more worlds, and
          infinite numbers of other creatures, and to render every creature a
          higher mark of his power, yet in regard of his decree to the contrary,
          he cannot do it. He hath a physical power, but after his resolve to
          the contrary, not a moral power: the exercise of his power is
          subordinate to his decree, but not the essence of his power. The
          decree of God takes not away any power from God, because the power of
          God is his own essence, and incapable of change; and is as great
          physically and essentially after his decree, as it was before; only
          his will hath put in a bar to the demonstration of all that power
          which he is able to exercise.833 As a prince that can raise 100,000
          men for an invasion, raises only 20 or 30,000; he here, by his order,
          limits his power, but doth not divest himself of his authority and
          power to raise the whole number of the forces of his dominions if he
          pleases: the power of God hath more objects than his decree hath; but
          since it is his perfection to be immutable, and not to change his
          decree, he cannot morally put forth his power upon all those objects,
          which, as it is essentially in him, he hath ability to do. God hath
          decreed to save those that believe in Christ, and to judge unbelievers
          to everlasting perdition: he cannot morally damn the first, or save
          the latter; yet he hath not divested himself of his absolute power to
          save all or damn all.834 Or suppose God hath decreed not to create
          more worlds than this we are now in, doth his decree weaken his
          strength to create more if he pleased? His not creating more is not a
          want of strength, but a want of will: it is an act of liberty, not an
          act of impotency. As when a man solemnly resolves not to walk in such
          a way, or come at such a place, his resolution deprives him not of his
          natural strength to walk thither, but fortifies his will against using
          his strength in any such motion to that place. The will of God hath
          set bounds to the exercise of his power, but doth not infringe that
          absolute power which still resides in his nature: he is girded about
          with more power than he puts forth (Ps. lxv. 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] As the power of God is infinite in regard of his essence, in
          regard of the objects, in regard of action, so, fourthly, in regard of
          duration. The apostle calls it “an eternal power” (Rom. i. 20). His
          eternal power is collected and concluded from the things that are
          made: they must needs be the products of some Being which contains
          truly in itself all power, who wrought them without engines, without
          instruments; and, therefore, this power must be infinite, and
          possessed of an unalterable virtue of acting. If it be eternal, it
          must be infinite, and hath neither beginning nor end; what is eternal
          hath no bounds. If it be eternal, and not limited by time, it must be
          infinite, and not to be restrained by any finite object: his power
          never begun to be, nor ever ceaseth to be; it cannot languish; men are
          fain to unbend themselves, and must have some time to recruit their
          tired spirits: but the power of God is perpetually vigorous, without
          any interrupting qualm (Isa. xl. 28): “Hast thou not known, hast thou
          not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends
          of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?” That might which
          suffered no diminution from eternity, but hatched so great a world by
          brooding upon nothing, will not suffer any dimness or decrease to
          eternity. This power being the same with his essence, is as durable as
          his essence, and resides for ever in his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The eighth consideration, for the right understanding of this
          attribute, the impossibility of God’s doing some things, is no
          infringing of his almightiness, but rather a strengthening of it. It
          is granted that some things God cannot do; or, rather, as Aquinas and
          others, it is better to say, such things cannot be done, than to say
          that God cannot do them; to remove all kind of imputation or
          reflection of weakness on God,835 and because the reason of the
          impossibility of those things is in the nature of the things
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Some things are impossible in their own nature. Such are all those
          things which imply a contradiction; as for a thing to be, and not to
          be at the same time; for the sun to shine, and not to shine at the
          same moment of time; for a creature to act, and not to act at the same
          instant: one of those parts must be false; for if it be true that the
          sun shines this moment, it must be false to say it doth not shine. So
          it is impossible that a rational creature can be without reason: ’Tis
          a contradiction to be a rational creature, and yet want that which is
          essential to a rational creature. So it is impossible that the will of
          man can be compelled, because liberty is the essence of the will;
          while it is will it cannot be constrained; and if it be constrained,
          it ceaseth to be will. God cannot at one time act as the author of the
          will and the destroyer of the will.836 It is impossible that vice and
          virtue, light and darkness, life and death, should be the same thing.
          Those things admit not of a conception in any understanding. Some
          things are impossible to be done, because of the incapability of the
          subject; as for a creature to be made infinite, independent, to
          preserve itself without the Divine concourse and assistance. So a
          brute cannot be taken into communion with God, and to everlasting
          spiritual blessedness, because the nature of a brute is incapable of
          such an elevation: a rational creature only can understand and relish
          spiritual delights, and is capable to enjoy God, and have communion
          with him. Indeed, God may change the nature of a brute, and bestow
          such faculties of understanding and will upon it, as to render it
          capable of such a blessedness; but then it is no more a brute, but a
          rational creature: but, while it remains a brute, the excellency of
          the nature of God doth not admit of communion with such a subject; so
          that this is not for want of power in God, but because of a deficiency
          in the creature: to suppose that God could make a contradiction true,
          is to make himself false, and to do just nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Some things are impossible to the nature and being of God. As to
          die, implies a flat repugnance to the nature of God; to be able to
          die, is to be able to be cashiered out of being. If God were able to
          deprive himself of life, he might then cease to be: he were not then a
          necessary, but an uncertain, contingent being, and could not be said
          only to have immortality, as he is (1 Tim. vi. 16). He cannot die who
          is life itself, and necessarily existent; he cannot grow old or decay,
          because he cannot be measured by time: and this is no part of
          weakness, but the perfection of power. His power is that whereby he
          remains forever fixed in his own everlasting being. That cannot be
          reckoned as necessary to the omnipotence of God which all mankind
          count a part of weakness in themselves: God is omnipotent, because he
          is not impotent; and if he could die, he would be impotent, not
          omnipotent: death is the feebleness of nature. It is undoubtedly the
          greatest impotence to cease to be: who would count it a part of
          omnipotency to disenable himself, and sink into nothing and not being?
          The impossibility for God to die is not a fit article to impeach his
          omnipotence; this would be a strange way of arguing: a thing is not
          powerful, because it is not feeble, and cannot cease to be powerful,
          for death is a cessation of all power. God is almighty in doing what
          he will, not in suffering what he will not.837 To die is not an
          active, but a passive power; a defect of a power: God is of too noble
          a nature to perish. Some things are impossible to that eminency of
          nature which he hath above all creatures; as to walk, sleep, feed,
          these are imperfections belonging to bodies and compounded natures. If
          he could walk, he were not everywhere present: motion speaks
          succession. If he could increase, he would not have been perfect
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Some things are impossible to the glorious perfections of God. God
          cannot do anything unbecoming his holiness and goodness; any thing
          unworthy of himself, and against the perfections of his nature. God
          can do whatsoever he can will. As he doth actually do whatsoever he
          doth actually will, so it is possible for him to do whatsoever it is
          possible for him to will. He doth whatsoever he will, and can do
          whatsoever he can will; but he cannot do what he cannot will: he
          cannot will any unrighteous thing, and therefore cannot do any
          unrighteous thing. God cannot love sin, this is contrary to his
          holiness; he cannot violate his word, this is a denial of his truth;
          he cannot punish an innocent, this is contrary to his goodness; he
          cannot cherish an impenitent sinner, this is an injury to his justice;
          he cannot forget what is done in the world, this is a disgrace to his
          omniscience; he cannot deceive his creature, this is contrary to his
          faithfulness: none of these things can be done by him, because of the
          perfection of his nature. Would it not be an imperfection in God to
          absolve the guilty, and condemn the innocent? Is it congruous to the
          righteous and holy nature of God, to command murder and adultery; to
          command men not to worship him, but to be base and unthankful? These
          things would be against the rules of righteousness; as, when we say of
          a good man, he cannot rob or fight a duel, we do not mean that he
          wants a courage for such an act, or that he hath not a natural
          strength and knowledge to manage his weapon as well as another, but he
          hath a righteous principle strong in him which will not suffer him to
          do it; his will is settled against it: no power can pass into act
          unless applied by the will; but the will of God cannot will anything
          but what is worthy of him, and decent for his goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The Scripture saith it is impossible for God to lie (Heb. vi.
          18); and God cannot deny himself because of his faithfulness (2 Tim.
          ii. 13). As he cannot die, because he is life itself; as he cannot
          deceive, because he is goodness itself; as he cannot do an unwise
          action, because he is wisdom itself, so he cannot speak a false word,
          because he is truth itself. If he should speak anything as true, and
          not know it, where is his infinite knowledge and comprehensiveness of
          understanding? If he should speak anything as true, which he knows to
          be false, where is his infinite righteousness? If he should deceive
          any creature, there is an end of his perfection of fidelity and
          veracity. If he should be deceived himself, there is an end of his
          omniscience; we must then fancy him to be a deceitful God, an ignorant
          God, that is, no God at all. If he should lie, he would be God and no
          God; God upon supposition, and no God, because not the first truth.838
          All unrighteousness is weakness, not power; it is a defection from
          right reason, a deviation from moral principles, and the rule of
          perfect action, and ariseth from a defect of goodness and power: it is
          a weakness, and not omnipotence, to lose goodness: God is light; it is
          the perfection of light not to become darkness, and a want of power in
          light, if it should become darkness:839 his power is infinitely
          strong, so is his wisdom infinitely clear, and his will infinitely
          pure: would it not be a part of weakness to have a disorder in
          himself, and these perfections shock one against another? Since all
          perfections are in God, in the most sovereign height of perfection,
          nothing can be done by the infiniteness of one against the
          infiniteness of the other. He would then be unstable in his own
          perfections, and depart from the infinite rectitude of his own will,
          if he should do an evil action. Again,840 what is an argument of
          greater strength, than to be utterly ignorant of infirmity? God is
          omnipotent because he cannot do evil, and would not be omnipotent if
          he could; those things would be marks of weakness, and not characters
          of majesty. Would you count a sweet fountain impotent because it
          cannot send forth bitter streams? or the sun weak, because it cannot
          diffuse darkness as well as light in the air? There is an inability
          arising from weakness, and an ability arising from perfection: it is
          the perfection of angels and blessed spirits, that they cannot sin;
          and it would be the imperfection of God, if he could do evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Hence it follows, that it is impossible that a thing past should
          not be past. If we ascribe a power to God, to make a thing that is
          past not to be past, we do not truly ascribe power to him, but a
          weakness; for it is to make God to lie, as though God might not have
          created man, yet, after he had created Adam, though he should
          presently have reduced Adam to his first nothing, yet it would be
          forever true that Adam was created, and it would forever be false that
          Adam never was created: so, though God may prevent sin, yet when sin
          hath been committed, it will alway be true that sin was committed; it
          will never be true to say such a creature that did sin, did not sin;
          his sin cannot be recalled: though God, by pardon, take off the guilt
          of Peter’s denying our Saviour, yet it will be eternally true that
          Peter did deny him. It is repugnant to the righteousness and truth of
          God to make that which was once true to become false, and not true;
          that is, to make a truth to become a lie, and a lie to become a truth.
          This is well argued from Heb. vi. 18: “It is impossible for God to
          lie.” The apostle argues, that what God had promised and sworn will
          come to pass, and cannot but come to pass.841 Now, if God could make a
          thing past not to be past, this consequence would not be good, for
          then he might make himself not to have promised, not to have sworn,
          after he hath promised and sworn; and so, if there were a power to
          undo that which is past, there would be no foundation for faith, no
          certainty of revelation. It cannot be asserted, that God hath created
          the world; that God hath sent his Son to die; that God hath accepted
          his death for man. These might not be true, if it were possible, that
          that which hath been done, might be said never to have been done: so
          that what any may imagine to be a want of power in God, is the highest
          perfection of God, and the greatest security to a believing creature
          that hath to do with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Some things are impossible to be done, because of God’s ordination.
          Some things are impossible, not in their own nature, but in regard of
          the determined will of God: so God might have destroyed the world
          after Adam’s fall, but it was impossible; not that God wanted power to
          do it, but because he did not only decree from eternity to create the
          world, but did also decree to redeem the world by Jesus Christ, and
          erected the world in order to the manifestation of his “glory in
          Christ” (Eph. i. 4, 5). The choice of some in Christ was “before the
          foundation of the world.” Supposing that there was no hindrance in the
          justice of God to pardon the sin of Adam after his fall, and to
          execute no punishment on him, yet in regard of God’s threatening, that
          in the day he eat of the forbidden fruit he should die, it was
          impossible: so, though it was possible that the cup should pass from
          our blessed Saviour, that is, possible in its own nature, yet it was
          not possible in regard of the determination of God’s will, since he
          had both decreed and published his will to redeem man by the passion
          and blood of his Son. These things God, by his absolute power, might
          have done; but upon the account of his decree, they were impossible,
          because it is repugnant to the nature of God to be mutable: it is to
          deny his own wisdom which contrived them, and his own will which
          resolved them, not to do that which he had decreed to do. This would
          be a diffidence in his wisdom, and a change of his will. The
          impossibility of them is no result of a want of power, no mark of an
          imperfection, of feebleness and impotence; but the perfection of
          immutability and unchangeableness. Thus have I endeavored to give you
          a right notion of this excellent attribute of the power of God, in as
          plain terms as I could, which may serve us for a matter of meditation,
          admiration, fear of him, trust in him, which are the proper uses we
          should make of this doctrine of Divine power. The want of a right
          understanding of this doctrine of the Divine power hath caused many to
          run into mighty absurdities; I have, therefore, taken the more pains
          to explain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thing I proposed, is the reasons to prove God to be
          omnipotent. The Scripture describes God by this attribute of power
          (Ps. cxv. 3): “He hath done whatsoever he pleased.” It sometimes sets
          forth his power in a way of derision of those that seem to doubt of
          it. When Sarah doubted of his ability to give her a child in her old
          age (Gen. xviii. 14), “Is anything too hard for the Lord?” They
          deserve to be scoffed, that will despoil God of his strength, and
          measure him by their shallow models. And when Moses uttered something
          of unbelief of this attribute, as if God were not able to feed 600,000
          Israelites, besides women and children, which he aggravates by a kind
          of imperious scoff; “Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them
          to suffice them? Or, shall all the fish of the sea be gathered
          together for them?” &amp;c. (Numb. xi. 22). God takes him up short
          (ver. 23): “Is the Lord’s hand waxed short?” What! can any weakness
          seize upon my hand? Can I draw out of my own treasures what is needful
          for a supply? The hand of God is not at one time strong, and another
          time feeble. Hence it is that we read of the hand and arm of God, an
          outstretched arm; because the strength of a man is exerted by his hand
          and arm; the power of God is called the arm of his power, and the
          right hand of his strength. Sometimes, according to the different
          manifestation of it, it is expressed by finger, when a less power is
          evidenced; by hand, when something greater; by arm, when more mighty
          than the former. Since God is eternal, without limits of time, he is
          also Almighty, without limits of strength. As he cannot be said to be
          more in being now than he was before, so he is neither more nor less
          in strength than he was before: as he cannot cease to be so, so he
          cannot cease to be powerful, because he is eternal. His eternity and
          power are linked together as equally demonstrable (Rom. i. 20); God is
          called the God of gods El Elohim (Dan. xi. 36); the Mighty of
          mighties, whence all mighty persons have their activity and vigor: he
          is called the Lord of Hosts, as being the Creator and Conductor of the
          heavenly militia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 1. The power that is in creatures demonstrates a greater and an
          unconceivable power in God. Nothing in the world is without a power of
          activity according to its nature: no creature but can act something.
          The sun warms and enlightens everything: it sends its influences upon
          the earth, into the bowels of the earth, into the depths of the sea:
          all generations owe themselves to its instrumental virtue. How
          powerful is a small seed to rise into a mighty tree with a lofty top,
          and extensive branches, and send forth other seeds, which can still
          multiply into numberless plants! How wonderful is the power of the
          Creator, who hath endowed so small a creature as a seed, with so
          fruitful an activity! Yet this is but the virtue of a limited nature.
          God is both the producing and preserving cause of all the virtue in
          any creature, in every creature. The power of every creature belongs
          to him as the Fountain, and is truly his power in the creature. As he
          is the first Being, he is the original of all being; as he is the
          first Good, he is the spring of all goodness; as he is the first
          Truth, he is the source of all truth; so, as he is the first Power, he
          is the fountain of all power.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He, therefore, that communicates to the creature what power it
          hath, contains eminently much more power in himself. (Ps. xciv. 10),
          “He that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?” So he that gives
          created beings power, shall not he be powerful? The first Being must
          have as much power as he hath given to others: he could not transfer
          that upon another, which he did not transcendently possess himself.
          The sole cause of created power cannot be destitute of any power in
          himself. We see that the power of one creature transcends the power of
          another. Beasts can do the things that plants cannot do; besides the
          power of growth, they have a power of sense and progressive motion.
          Men can do more than beasts; they have rational souls to measure the
          earth and heavens, and to be repositories of multitudes of things,
          notions, and conclusions. We may well imagine angels to be far
          superior to man: the power of the Creator must far surmount the power
          of the creature, and must needs be infinite: for if it be limited, it
          is limited by himself or by some other; if by some other, he is no
          longer a Creator, but a creature; for that which limits him in his
          nature, did communicate that nature to him; not by himself, for he
          would not deny himself any necessary perfection: we must still
          conclude a reserve of power in him, that he that made these can make
          many more of the same kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. All the power which is distinct in the creatures, must be united in
          God. One creature hath a strength to do this, another to do that;
          every creature is as a cistern filled with a particular and limited
          power, according to the capacity of its nature, from this fountain;
          all are distinct streams from God. But the strength of every creature,
          though distinct in the rank of creatures, is united in God the centre,
          whence those lines were drawn, the fountain whence those streams were
          derived. If the power of one creature be admirable, as the power of an
          angel, which the Psalmist saith (Ps. ciii. 20), “excelleth in
          strength;” how much greater must the power of a legion of angels be!
          How inconceivably superior the power of all those numbers of spiritual
          natures, which are the excellent works of God! Now, if all this
          particular power, which is in every angel distinct, were compacted in
          one angel, how would it exceed our understanding, and be above our
          power to form a distinct conception of it! What is thus divided in
          every angel, must be thought united in the Creator of angels, and far
          more excellent in him. Everything is in a more noble manner in the
          fountain, than in the streams which distil and descend from it. He
          that is the Original of all those distinct powers, must be the seat of
          all power without distinction: in him is the union of all without
          division; what is in them as a quality, is in him as his essence.
          Again, if all the powers of several creatures, with all their
          principal qualities and vigors, both of beasts, plants, and rational
          creatures, were united in one subject; as if one lion had the strength
          of all the lions that ever were; or, if one elephant had the strength
          of all the elephants that ever were; nay, if one bee had all the power
          of motion and stinging that all bees ever had, it would have a vast
          strength; but if the strength of all those thus gathered into one of
          every kind should be lodged in one sole creature, one man, would it
          not be a strength too big for our conception? Or, suppose one cannon
          had all the force of all the cannons that ever were in the world, what
          a battery would it make, and, as it were, shake the whole frame of
          heaven and earth! All this strength must be much more incomprehensible
          in God; all is united in him. If it were in one individual created
          nature, it would still be but a finite power in a finite nature: but
          in God it is infinite and immense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 2. If there were not an incomprehensible power in God, he would
          not be infinitely perfect. God is the first Being; it can only be said
          of him, Est, he is. All other things are nothing to him; “less than
          nothing and vanity” (Isa. xl. 17), and “reputed as nothing” (Dan. iv.
          35). All the inhabitants of the earth, with all their wit and
          strength, are counted as if they were not; just in comparison with Him
          and his being, as a little mote in the sun‑beams: God, therefore, is a
          pure Being. Any kind of weakness whatsoever is a defect, a degree of
          not being; so far as anything wants this or that power, it may be said
          not to be. Were there anything of weakness in God, any want of
          strength which belonged to the perfection of a nature, it might be
          said of God, He is not this or that, he wants this or that perfection
          of Being, and so he would not be a pure Being, there would be
          something of not being in him. But God being the first Being, the only
          original Being, he is infinitely distant from not being, and therefore
          infinitely distant from anything of weakness. Again, if God can know
          whatsoever is possible to be done by him, and cannot do it, there
          would be something more in his knowledge than in his power.842 What
          would then follow? That the essence of God would be in some regard
          greater than itself, and less than itself, because his knowledge and
          his power are his essence; his power as much his essence as his
          knowledge: and therefore, in regard of his knowledge, his essence
          would be greater; in regard of his power, his essence would be less;
          which is a thing impossible to be conceived in a most perfect Being.
          We must understand this of those things which are properly and in
          their own nature subjected to the Divine knowledge; for otherwise God
          knows more than he can do, for he knows sin, but he cannot act it,
          because sin belongs not to power but weakness; and sin comes under the
          knowledge of God, not in itself and its own nature, but as it is a
          defect from God, and contrary to good, which is the proper object of
          Divine knowledge. He knows it also not as possible to be done by
          himself, but as possible to be done by the creature. Again, if God
          were not omnipotent, we might imagine something more perfect than
          God:843 for if we bar God from any one thing which in its own nature
          is possible, we may imagine a being that can do that thing, one that
          is able to effect it; and so imagine an agent greater than God, a
          being able to do more than God is able to do, and consequently a being
          more perfect than God: but no being more perfect than God can be
          imagined by any creature. Nothing can be called most perfect, if
          anything of activity be wanting to it. Active power follows the
          perfection of a thing, and all things are counted more noble by how
          much more of efficacy and virtue they possess. We count those the best
          and most perfect plants, that have the greatest medicinal virtue in
          them, and power of working upon the body for the cure of distempers.
          God is perfect of himself, and therefore most powerful of himself. If
          his perfection in wisdom and goodness be unsearchable, his power,
          which belongs to perfection, and without which all the other
          excellencies of his nature were insignificant, and could not show
          themselves, (as was before evidenced,) must be unsearchable also. It
          is by the title of Almighty he is denominated, when declared to be
          unsearchable to perfection (Job xi. 7): “Canst thou by searching find
          out God, canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?” This would
          be limited and searched out, if he were destitute of an active ability
          to do whatsoever he pleased to do, whatsoever was possible to be done.
          As he hath not a perfect liberty of will, if he could not will what he
          pleased; so he would not have a perfect activity, if he could not do
          what he willed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 3. The simplicity of God manifests it. Every substance, the
          more spiritual it is, the more powerful it is. All perfections are
          more united in a simple, than in a compounded being. Angels, being
          spirits, are more powerful than bodies. Where there is the greatest
          simplicity, there is the greatest unity; and where there is the
          greatest unity, there is the greatest power. Where there is a
          composition of a faculty and a member, the member or organ may be
          weakened and rendered unable to act, though the power doth still
          reside in the faculty. As a man, when his arm or hand is cut off or
          broke, he hath the faculty of motion still; but he hath lost that
          instrument that part whereby he did manifest and put forth that
          motion: but God being a pure spiritual nature, hath no members, no
          organs to be defaced or impaired. All impediments of actions arise
          either from the nature of the thing that acts, or from something
          without it. There can be no hindrance to God to do whatsoever he
          pleases; not in himself, because he is the most simple being, hath no
          contrariety in himself, is not composed of divers things; and it
          cannot be from anything without himself, because nothing is equal to
          him, much less superior. He is the greatest, the Supreme: all things
          were made by him, depend upon him, nothing can disappoint his
          intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 4. The miracles that have been in the world evidence the power
          of God. Extraordinary productions have awakened men from their
          stupidity, to the acknowledgment of the immensity of Divine power.
          Miracles are such effects as have been wrought without the assistance
          and co‑operation of natural causes, yea, contrary and besides the
          ordinary course of nature, above the reach of any created power.
          Miracles have been; and saith Bradwardine,844 to deny that ever such
          things were, is uncivil: it is inhuman to deny all the histories of
          Jews and Christians; whosoever denies miracles, must deny all
          possibility of miracles, and so must imagine himself fully skilled in
          the extent of Divine power. How was the sun suspended from its motion
          for some hours (Josh. x. 13); “the dead raised from the grave;” those
          reduced from the brink of it, that had been brought near to it by
          prevailing diseases; and this by a word speaking? How were the
          famished lions bridled from exercising their rage upon Daniel, exposed
          to them for a prey (Dan. vi. 22)? the activity of the fire curbed for
          the preservation of the three children (Dan. iii. 15)? which proves a
          Deity more powerful than all creatures. No power upon earth can hinder
          the operation of the fire upon combustible matter, when they are
          united, unless by quenching the fire, or removing the matter: but no
          created power can restrain the fire, so long as it remains so, from
          acting according to its nature. This was done by God in the case of
          the three children, and that of the burning bush (Exod. iii. 2). It
          was as much miraculous that the bush should not consume, as it was
          natural that it should burn by the efficacy of the fire upon it. No
          element is so obstinate and deaf, but it hears and obeys his voice,
          and performs his orders, though contrary to its own nature: all the
          violence of the creature is suspended as soon as it receives his
          command. He that gave the original to nature, can take away the
          necessity of nature;845 he presides over creatures, but is not
          confined to those laws he hath prescribed to creatures. He framed
          nature, and can turn the channels of nature according to his own
          pleasure. Men dig into the bowels of nature, search into all the
          treasures of it, to find medicines to cure a disease, and after all
          their attempts it may prove labor in vain: but God, by one act of his
          will, one word of his mouth, overturns the victory of death, and
          rescues from the most desperate diseases.846 All the miracles which
          were wrought by the apostles, either speaking some words or touching
          with the hand, were not effected by any virtue inherent in their words
          or in their touches; for such virtue inherent in any created finite
          subject would be created and finite itself, and consequently were
          incapable to produce effects which required an infinite virtue, as
          miracles do which are above the power of nature. So when our Saviour
          wrought miracles, it was not by any quality resident in his human
          nature, but by the sole power of his Divinity. The flesh could only do
          what was proper to the flesh; but the Deity did what was proper to the
          Deity. “God alone doth wonders” (Ps. cxxxvi. 4): excluding every other
          cause from producing those things. He only doth those things which are
          above the power of nature, and cannot be wrought by any natural causes
          whatsoever. He doth not hereby put his omnipotence to any stress: it
          is as easy with him to turn nature out of its settled course, as it
          was to place it in that station it holds, and appoint it that course
          it runs. All the works of nature are indeed miracles and testimonies
          of the power of God producing them, and sustaining them: but works
          above the power of nature, being novelties and unusual, strike men
          with a greater admiration upon their appearance, because they are not
          the products of nature, but the convulsions of it. I might also add as
          an argument, the power of the mind of man to conceive more than hath
          been wrought by God in the world. And God can work whatsoever
          perfection the mind of man can conceive: otherwise the reaches of a
          created imagination and fancy would be more extensive than the power
          of God. His power, therefore, is far greater than the conception of
          any intellectual creature; else the creature would be of a greater
          capacity to conceive than God is to effect. The creature would have a
          power of conception above God’s power of activity; and consequently a
          creature, in some respect greater than himself. Now whatsoever a
          creature can conceive possible to be done, is but finite in its own
          nature; and if God could not produce what being a created
          understanding can conceive possible to be done, he would be less than
          infinite in power, nay, he could not go to the extent of what is
          finite. But I have touched this before; that God can create more than
          he hath created, and in a more perfect way of being, as considered
          simply in themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third general thing is to declare, how the power of God
          appears in Creation, in Government, in Redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, In Creation. With what majestic lines doth God set for his
          power, in the giving being and endowments to all the creatures in the
          world (Job xxxviii.)! All that is in heaven and earth is his, and
          shows the greatness of his power, glory, victory, and majesty (1
          Chron. xxix. 11). The heaven being so magnificent a piece of work, is
          called emphatically, “the firmament of his power” (Ps. cl. 1); his
          power being more conspicuous and unavailed in that glorious arch of
          the world. Indeed, “God exalts by his power” (Job xxxvi. 22), that is,
          exalts himself by his power in all the works of his hands; in the
          smallest shrub, as well as the most glorious sun. All his works of
          nature are truly miracles, though we consider them not, being blinded
          with two frequent and customary a sight of them; yet, in the neglect
          of all the rest, the view of the heavens doth more affect us with
          astonishment at the might of God’s arm: these declare his glory, and
          “the firmament showeth his handy work” (Ps. xix. 1). And the Psalmist
          peculiarly calls them his heavens, and the work of his fingers (Ps.
          viii. 3): these were immediately created by God, whereas many other
          things in the world were brought into being by the power of God, yet
          by the means of the influence of the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. His power is the first thing evident in the story of the creation.
          “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen. i. 1).
          There is no appearance of anything in this declaratory preface, but of
          power: the characters of wisdom march after in the distinct formation
          of things, and animating them with suitable qualities for an universal
          good. By heaven and earth, is meant the whole mass of the creatures:
          by heaven, all the airy region, with all the host of it; by the earth,
          is meant, all that which makes the entire inferior globe.847 The Jews
          observe, that in the first of Genesis, in the whole chapter, unto the
          finishing the work in six days, God is called אלהים, which is a name
          of Power, and that thirty‑two times in that chapter; but after the
          finishing the six days’ work, he is called האלהים, which, according to
          their notion, is a name of goodness and kindness: his power is first
          visible in framing the world, before his goodness is visible in the
          sustaining and preserving it. It was by this name of Power and
          Almighty that he was known in the first ages of the world, not by his
          name, Jehovah (Exod. vi. 3): “And I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and
          Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not
          known to them.” Not but that they were acquainted with the name, but
          did not experience the intent of the name, which signified his truth
          in the performance of his promises; they knew him by that name as
          promising, but they knew him not by that name, as performing. He would
          be known by his name Jehovah, true to his word, when he was about to
          effect the deliverance from Egypt; a type of the eternal redemption,
          wherein the truth of God, in performing of his first promise, is
          gloriously magnified. And hence it is that God is called Almighty more
          in the book of Job than in all the Scripture besides, I think about
          thirty‑two times, and Jehovah but once, which is Job xii. 9, unless in
          Job xxxviii. when God is introduced speaking himself; which is an
          argument of Job’s living before the deliverance from Egypt, when God
          was known more by his works of creation than by the performance of his
          promises, before the name Jehovah was formally published. Indeed, this
          attribute of his eternal power, is the first thing visible and
          intelligible upon the first glance of the eye upon the creatures (Rom.
          i. 20). Bring a man out of the cave where he hath been nursed, without
          seeing anything out of the confines of it, and let him lift up his
          eyes to the heavens, and take a prospect of that glorious body, the
          sun, then cast them down to the earth, and behold the surface of it,
          with its green clothing; the first notion which will start up in his
          mind from that spring of wonders, is that of power, which he will at
          first adore with a religious astonishment. The wisdom of God in them
          is not so presently apparent, till after a more exquisite
          consideration of his works and knowledge of the properties of their
          natures, the conveniency of their situations, and the usefulness of
          their functions, and the order wherein they are linked together for
          the good of the universe.

          2. By this creative power God is often distinguished from all the
          idols and false gods in the world. And by this title he sets forth
          himself when he would act any great and wonderful work in the world
          (Ps. cxxxv. 5, 6): “He is great above all gods,” for “he hath done
          whatsoever he pleased in heaven and in earth.” Upon this is founded
          all the worship he challengeth in the world, as his peculiar, glory
          (Rev. iv. 11): “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honor, and
          power, for thou hast created all things.” And (Rev. x. 6) “I have made
          the earth, and created man upon it.” “I, even my hands, have stretched
          out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded” (Isa. xlv. 12).
          What is the issue (ver. 16)? “They shall be ashamed and confounded,
          all of them, that are makers of idols.” And the weakness of idols is
          expressed by this title. “The gods that have not made the heavens and
          the earth” (Jer. x. 11). “The portion of Jacob is not like them, for
          he is the former of all things” (ver. 16). What is not that God able
          to do, that hath created so great a world? How doth the power of God
          appear in creation?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. In making the world of nothing. When we say, the world was made
          of nothing, we mean, that there was no matter existent for God to work
          upon, but what he raised himself in the first act of creation. In this
          regard, the power of God in creation surmounts his power in
          providence. Creation supposeth nothing, providence supposeth something
          in being. Creation intimates a creature making, providence speaks a
          thing already made, and capable of government, and in government. God
          uses second causes to bring about his purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The world was made of nothing. The earth which is described as the
          first matter, without any form or ornament, without any distinction or
          figures, was of God’s forming in the bulk, before he did adorn it with
          his pencil (Gen. i. 1, 2). God, in the beginning, creating the heaven
          and the earth, includes two things: First. That those were created in
          the beginning of time, and before all other things. Secondly. That God
          begun the creation of the world from those things.848 Therefore before
          the heavens and the earth there was nothing absolutely created, and
          therefore no matter in being before an act of creation passed upon it.
          It could not be eternal, because nothing can be eternal but God; it
          must therefore have a beginning. If it had a beginning from itself,
          then it was before it was. If it acted in the making itself before it
          was made, then it had a being before it had a being; for that which is
          nothing, can act nothing: the action of anything supposeth the
          existence of the thing which acts. It being made, it was not before it
          was made; for to be made is to be brought into being. It was made,
          then, by another, and that Maker is God. It is necessary that the
          First Original of things was from nothing: when we see one thing to
          arise from another, we must suppose an original of the first of each
          kind; as, when we see a tree spring up from a seed, we know that seed
          came out of the bowels of another tree; it had a parent, it had a
          master; we must come to some first, or else we run into an endless
          maze: we must come to some first tree, some first seed that had no
          cause of the same kind, no matter of it, but was mere nothing.
          Creation doth suppose a production from nothing; because, if you
          suppose a thing without any real or actual existence, it is not
          capable of any other production than from nothing: nothing must be
          supposed before the world, or we must suppose it eternal, and that is
          to deny it to be a creature, and make it God.849 The creation of
          spiritual substances, such as angels and souls, evince this; those
          things that are purely spiritual, and consist not of matter, cannot
          pretend to any original from matter, and therefore they rose up from
          nothing. If spiritual things arose from nothing, much more may
          corporeal, because they are of a lower nature than spiritual; and he
          that can create a higher nature of nothing, can create an inferior
          nature of nothing. As bodily things are more imperfect than spiritual,
          so their creation may be supposed easier than that of spiritual. There
          was as little need of any matter to be wrought to his hands, to
          contrive into this visible fabric, as there was to erect such an
          excellent order as the glorious cherubims.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This creation of things from nothing speaks an infinite power. The
          distance between nothing and being hath been alway counted so great,
          that nothing but an Infinite Power can make such distances meet
          together, either for nothing to pass into being, or being to return to
          nothing. To have a thing arise from nothing, was so difficult a text
          to those that were ignorant of the Scripture, that they knew not how
          to fathom it, and therefore laid it down as a certain rule, that of
          nothing, nothing is made; which is true of a created power, but not of
          an uncreated and Almighty Power. A greater distance cannot be imagined
          than that which is between nothing and something; that which hath no
          being, and that which hath; and a greater power cannot be imagined
          than that which brings something out of nothing. We know not how to
          conceive a nothing, and afterwards a being from that nothing; but we
          must remain swallowed up in admiration of the Cause that gives it
          being, and acknowledge it to be without any bounds and measures of
          greatness and power.850 The further anything is from being, the more
          immense must that power be which brings it into being: it is not
          conceivable that the power of all the angels in one can give being to
          the smallest spire of grass. To imagine, therefore, so small a thing
          as a bee, a fly, a grain of corn, or an atom of dust, to be made of
          nothing, would stupefy any creature in the consideration of it, much
          more to behold the heavens, with all the troop of stars; the earth,
          with all its embroidery; and the sea, with all her inhabitants of
          fish; and man, the noblest creature of all, to arise out of the womb
          of mere emptiness. Indeed, God had not acted as an almighty Creator,
          if he had stood in need of any materials but of his own framing: it
          had been as much as his Deity was worth, if he had not had all within
          the compass of his own power that was necessary to operation; if he
          must have been beholden to something without himself, and above
          himself, for matter to work upon: had there been such a necessity, we
          could not have imagined him to be omnipotent, and, consequently, not
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In this the power of God exceeds the power of all natural and
          rational agents. Nature, or the order of second causes, hath a vast
          power; the sun generates flies and other insects, but of some matter,
          the slime of the earth or a dunghill; the sun and the earth bring
          forth harvests of corn, but from seed first sown in the earth; fruits
          are brought forth, but from the sap of the plant; were there no seed
          or plants in the earth, the power of the earth would be idle, and the
          influence of the sun insignificant; whatsoever strength either of them
          had in their nature, must be useless without matter to work upon. All
          the united strength of nature cannot produce the least thing out of
          nothing; it may multiply and increase things, by the powerful blessing
          God gave it at the first erecting of the world, but it cannot create.
          The word which signifies creation, used in Gen. i. 1, is not ascribed
          to any second cause, but only to God; a word, in that sense, as
          incommunicable to anything else as the action it signifies. Rational
          creatures can produce admirable pieces of art from small things, yet
          still out of matter created to their hands. Excellent garments may be
          woven, but from the entrails of a small silkworm. Delightful and
          medicinal spirits and essences may be extracted, by ingenious
          chemists, but out of the bodies of plants and minerals. No picture can
          be drawn without colors; no statue engraven without stone; no building
          erected without timber, stones, and other materials: nor can any man
          raise a thought without some matter framed to his hands, or cast into
          him. Matter is, by nature, formed to the hands of all artificers; they
          bestow a new figure upon it, by the help of instruments, and the
          product of their own wit and skill, but they create not the least
          particle of matter; when they want it, they must be supplied or else
          stand still, as well as nature, for none of them, or all together, can
          make the least mite or atom: and when they have wrought all that they
          can, they will not want some to find a flaw and defect in their work.
          God, as a Creator, hath the only prerogative to draw what he pleases
          from nothing, without any defect, without any imperfection: he can
          raise what matter he please; ennoble it with what form he pleases. Of
          nothing, nothing can be made, by any created agent: but the omnipotent
          Architect of the world is not under the same necessity, nor is limited
          to the same rule, and tied by so short a tedder as created nature, or
          an ingenious, yet feeble artificer.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. It appears, in raising such variety of creatures from this barren
          womb of nothing, or from the matter which he first commanded to appear
          out of nothing. Had there been any pre‑existent matter, yet the
          bringing forth such varieties and diversities of excellent creatures,
          some with life, some with sense, and others with reason superadded to
          the rest, and those out of indisposed and undigested matter, would
          argue an infinite power resident in the first Author of this
          variegated fabric. From this matter he formed that glorious sun, which
          every day displays its glory, scatters its beams, clears the air,
          ripens our fruits, and maintains the propagation of creatures in the
          world. From this matter he lighted those torches which he set in the
          heaven to qualify the darkness of the night: from this he compacted
          those bodies of light, which, though they seem to us as little sparks,
          as if they were the glow‑worms of heaven, yet some of them exceed in
          greatness this globe of the earth on which we live: and the highest of
          them hath so quick a motion, that some tell us they run, in the space
          of every hour, 42,000,000 of leagues. From the same matter he drew the
          earth on which we walk; from thence he extracted the flowers to adorn
          it, the hills to secure the valleys, and the rocks to fortify it
          against the inundations of the sea; and on this dull and sluggish
          element he bestowed so great a fruitfulness, to maintain, feed, and
          multiply so many seeds of different kinds, and conferred upon those
          little bodies of seeds a power to multiply their kinds, in conjunction
          with the fruitfulness of the earth, to many thousands. From this rude
          matter, the slime or dust of the earth, he kneaded the body of man,
          and wrought so curious a fabric, fit to entertain a soul of a heavenly
          extraction, formed by the breath of God (Gen. ii. 7). He brought light
          out of thick darkness, and living creatures, fish and fowl, out of
          inanimate waters (Gen. i. 20), and gave a power of spontaneous motion
          to things arising from that matter which had no living motion. To
          convert one thing into another, is an evidence of infinite power, as
          well as creating things of nothing; for the distance between life and
          not life is next to that which is between being and not being. God
          first forms matter out of nothing, and then draws upon, and from this
          indisposed chaos, many excellent portraitures. Neither earth nor sea
          were capable of producing living creatures without an infinite power
          working upon it, and bringing into it such variety and multitude of
          forms; and this is called, by some, mediate creation, as the producing
          the chaos, which was without form and void, is called immediate
          creation. Is not the power of the potter admirable in forming, out of
          tempered clay, such varieties of neat and curious vessels, that, after
          they are fashioned and past the furnace, look as if they were not of
          any kin to the matter they are formed of? and is it not the same with
          the glass‑maker, that, from a little melted jelly of sand and ashes,
          or the dust of flint, can blow up so pure a body as glass, and in such
          varieties of shapes? and is not the power of God more admirable,
          because infinite in speaking out so beautiful a world out of nothing,
          and such varieties of living creatures from matter utterly indisposed,
          in its own nature, for such forms?
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. And this conducts to a third thing, wherein the power of God
          appears, in that he did all this with the greatest ease and facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Without instruments. As God made the world without the advice, so
          without the assistance, of any other: “He stretched forth the heavens
          alone, and spread abroad the earth by himself” (Isa. xliv. 24). He had
          no engine, but his word; no pattern or model, but himself. What need
          can he have of instruments, that is able to create what instruments he
          pleases? Where there is no resistance in the object, where no need of
          preparation or instrumental advantage in the agent; there the actual
          determination of the will is sufficient to a production. What
          instrument need we to the thinking of a thought, or an act of our
          will? Men, indeed, cannot act anything without tools; the best
          artificer must be beholden to something else for his noblest works of
          art. The carpenter cannot work without his rule, and axe, and saw, and
          other instruments; the watch‑maker cannot act without his file and
          pliers; but in creation, there is nothing necessary to God’s bringing
          forth a world, but a simple act of his will, which is both the
          principal cause, and instrumental. He had no scaffolds to rear it, no
          engines to polish it, no hammers or mattocks to clod and work it
          together. It is a miserable error to measure the actions of an
          Infinite Cause by the imperfect model of a finite, since, by his own
          “power and out‑stretched arm, he made the heaven and the earth” (Jer.
          xxxii. 17). What excellency would God have in his work above others,
          if he needed instruments, as feeble men do?851 Every artificer is
          counted more admirable, that can frame curious works with the less
          matter, fewer tools, and assistances. God uses instruments in his
          works of providence, not for necessity, but for the display of his
          wisdom in the management of them; yet those instruments were
          originally framed by him without instruments. Indeed, some of the Jews
          thought the angels were the instruments of God in creating man, and
          that those words, “Let us make man in our own image” (Gen. i. 26),
          were spoken to angels. But certainly the Scripture, which denies God
          any counsellor in the model of creation (Isa. xl. 12‒14), doth not
          join any instrument with him in the operation, which is everywhere
          ascribed to himself “without created assistance” (Isa. xlv. 18). It
          was not to angels God spake in that affair; if so, man was made after
          the image of angels, if they were companions with God in that work;
          but it is everywhere said, that “Man was made after the image of God”
          (Gen. i. 27). Again, the image wherein man was created, was that of
          dominion over the lower creatures, as appears ver. 26, which we find
          not conferred upon angels; and it is not likely that Moses should
          introduce the angels, as God’s privy counsel, of whose creation he had
          not mentioned one syllable. “Let us make man,” rather signifies the
          Trinity, and not spoken in a royal style, as some think. Which of the
          Jewish kings wrote in the style, We? That was the custom of later
          times; and we must not measure the language of Scripture by the style
          of Europe, of a far later date than the penning the history of the
          creation. If angels were his counsellors in the creation of the
          material world, what instrument had he in the creation of angels? If
          his own wisdom were the director, and his own will the producer of the
          one; why should we not think, that he acted by his sole power in the
          other? It is concluded by most, that the power of creation cannot be
          derived to any creature, it being a work of omnipotency; the drawing
          something out from nothing, cannot be communicated without a
          communication of the Deity itself. The educing things from nothing
          exceeds the capacity of any creature, and the creature is of too
          feeble a nature to be elevated to so high a degree. It is very
          unreasonable to think, that God needed any such aid. If an instrument
          were necessary for God to create the world, then he could not do it
          without that instrument: if he could not, he were not then
          all‑sufficient in himself, if he depended upon anything without
          himself, for the production or consummation of his works. And it might
          be inquired, how that instrument came into being; if it begun to be,
          and there was a time when it was not, it must have its being from the
          power of God; and then, why could not God as well create all things
          without an instrument, as create that instrument without an
          instrument? For there was no more power necessary to a producing the
          whole without instruments, than to produce one creature without an
          instrument. No creature can, in its own nature, be an instrument of
          creation. If any such instrument were used by God, it must be elevated
          in a miraculous and supernatural way; and what is so an instrument,
          is, in effect, no instrument; for it works nothing by its own nature,
          but from an elevation by a superior nature, and beyond its own nature.
          All that power in the instrument is truly the power of God, and not
          the power of the instrument; and, therefore, what God doth by an
          instrument, he could do as well without. If you should see one apply
          straw to iron, for the cutting of it, and effect it, you would not
          call the straw an instrument in that action, because there was nothing
          in the nature of the straw to do it. It was done wholly by some other
          force, which might have done it as well without the straw as with it.
          The narrative of the creation in Genesis, removes any instrument from
          God. The plants which are preserved and propagated by the influence of
          the sun, were created the day before the sun, viz. on the “third day,”
          whereas, the light was collected into the body of the sun on the
          “fourth day” (Gen. i. 11, 16); to show, that though the plants do
          instrumentally owe their yearly beauty and preservation to the sun,
          yet they did not in any manner owe their creation to the instrumental
          heat and vigor of it.

        <p>
          2. God created the world by a word, by a simple act of his will. The
          whole creation is wrought by a word; “God said, Let there be light;”
          and “God said, Let there be a firmament.”852 Not that we should
          understand it of a sensible word, but understand it of a powerful
          order of his own will, which is expressed by the Psalmist in the
          nature of a command (Ps. xxxiii. 9): “He spake, and it was done; he
          commanded, and it stood fast;” and (Ps. cxlviii. 5), “He commanded,
          and they were created.” At the same instant that he willed them to
          stand forth, they did stand forth. The efficacious command of the
          Creator was the original of all things: the insensibility of nothing
          obeyed the act of his will. Creation is therefore entitled a calling
          (Rom. iv. 17): “He calls those things which are not, as if they were.”
          To create is no more with God, than to call; and what he calls,
          presents itself before him in the same posture that he calls it. He
          did with more ease make a world, than we can form a thought. It is the
          same ease to him to create worlds, as to decree them; there needs no
          more than a resolve to have things wrought at such a time, and they
          will be, according to his pleasure. This will is his power; “Let there
          be light,” is the precept of his will; and “there was light,” is the
          effect of his precept. By a word, was the matter of the heavens and
          the earth framed; by a word, things separate themselves from the rude
          mass into their proper forms; by a word, light associates itself into
          one body, and forms a sun; by a word, are the heavens, as it were,
          bespangled with stars, and the earth dressed with flowers; by a word,
          is the world both ceiled and floored: one act of his will, formed the
          world, and perfected its beauty. All the variety and several exploits
          of his power were not caused by distinct words or acts of power. God
          uttered not distinct words for distinct species; as, let there be an
          elephant, and let there be a lion; but as he produced those various
          creatures out of one matter, so by one word. By one single command,
          those varieties of creatures, with their clothing, ornaments, distinct
          notes, qualities, functions, were brought forth (Gen. i. 11): by one
          word, all the seeds of the earth, with their various virtues: by one
          word, all the fish of the sea, and fowls of the air, in their distinct
          natures, instincts, colors (Gen. i. 20): by one word, all the beasts
          of the field, with their varieties (Gen. i. 24). Heaven and earth,
          spiritual and corporeal creatures, mortal and immortal, the greater
          and the less, visible and invisible, were formed with the same
          ease:853 a word made the least, and a word made the greatest. It is as
          little difficulty to him to produce the highest angel, as the lightest
          atom. It is enough for the existence of the stateliest cherubim, for
          God only to will his being. It was enough for the forming and fixing
          the sun, to will the compacting of light into one body. The creation
          of the soul of man is expressed by inspiration (Gen. ii. 7); to show,
          that it is as easy with God to create a rational soul, as for man to
          breathe.854 Breathing is natural to man, by a communication of God’s
          goodness; and the creation of the soul is as easy to God, by virtue of
          his Almighty word. As there was no proportion between nothing and
          being, so there was as little proportion between a word and such
          glorious effects. A mere voice, coming from an Omnipotent will, was
          capable to produce such varieties, which angels and men have seen in
          all ages of the world, and this without weariness. What labor is there
          in willing? what pain could there be in speaking a word? (Isa. xl.
          28), “The Creator of the ends of the earth is not weary.” And though
          he be said to rest after the creation, it is to be meant a rest from
          work, not a repose from weariness. So great is the power of God, that
          without any matter, without any instruments, he could create many
          worlds, and with the same ease as he made this.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. I might add also, the appearance of this power in the
          instantaneous production of things. The ending of his word was not
          only the beginning, but the perfection of every thing he spake into
          being; not several words to several parts and members, but one word,
          one breath of his mouth, one act of his will, to the whole species of
          the creatures, and to every member in each individual. Heaven and
          earth were created in a moment; six days went to their disposal; and
          that comely order we observe in the world was the work of a week: the
          matter was formed as soon as God had spoken the word; and in every
          part of the creation, as soon as God spake the word, “Let it be so”
          (Gen. i.), the answer immediately is, “It was so;” which notes the
          present standing up of the creature according to the act of his will:
          and, therefore,855 one observes, that “Let there be light, and there
          was light;” in the Hebrew are the same words, without any alteration
          of letter or point, only the conjunctive particle added, יהי אור ויהי
          אור, “Let there be light, and let there be light,” to show, that the
          same instant of the speaking the Divine word, was the appearance of
          the creature: so great was the authority of his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, We are to show God’s power in the Government of the world.
          As God decreed from eternity the creation of things in time, so he
          decreed from eternity the particular ends of creatures, and their
          operation respecting those ends. Now, as there was need of his power
          to execute his decree of creation, there is also need of his power to
          execute his decree about the manner of government.856 All government
          is an act of the understanding, will, and power. Prudence to design
          belongs to the understanding; the election of the means belongs to the
          will; and the accomplishment of the whole is an act of power. It is a
          hard matter to determine which is most necessary: wisdom stands in as
          much need of power to perfect, as power doth of wisdom, to model and
          draw out a scheme; though wisdom directs, power must effect. Wisdom
          and power are distinct things among men: a poor man in a cottage may
          have more prudence to advise, than a privy counsellor; and a prince
          more power to act, than wisdom to conduct. A pilot may direct though
          he be lame, and cannot climb the masts, and spread the sails: but God
          is wanting in nothing; neither in wisdom to design, nor in will to
          determine, nor in power to accomplish. His wisdom is not feeble, nor
          his power foolish: a feeble wisdom could not act what it would, and a
          foolish power would act more than it should. The power expressed in
          his government is shadowed forth in the living creatures, which are
          God’s instruments in it. It is said, “Every one of them had four
          faces” (Ezek. i. 10); that of a man to signify wisdom; of a lion,
          eagle, the strongest among birds, to signify their courage and
          strength to perform their offices. This power is evident in the
          natural, moral, gracious government. There is a natural providence,
          which consists in the preservation of all things, propagation of them
          by corruptions and generations, and in a co‑operation with them in
          their motions to attain their ends. Moral government is of the hearts
          and actions of men. Gracious government, as respecting the Church.
        </p>
        <p>First, His power is evident in natural government.</p>
        <p>
          1. In preservation. God is the great Father of the world, to nourish
          it as well as create it.857 Man and beast would perish if there were
          not herbs for their food; and herbs would wither and perish, if the
          earth were not watered with fruitful showers. This some of the
          heathens acknowledged, in their worshipping God under the image of an
          ox, a useful creature, by reason of its strength, to which we owe so
          much of our food in corn. Hence, God is styled the “Preserver of man
          and beast” (Ps. xxxvi. 6). Hence, the Jews called God,858 Place;
          because he is the subsistence of all things. By the same word whereby
          he gave being to things, he gives to them continuance and duration in
          being so much a term of time. As they were “created by his word,” they
          are supported by his word (Heb. i. 3). The same powerful fiat, “Let
          the earth bring forth grass” (Gen. i. 11), when the plants peeped upon
          man out of nothing, is expressed every spring, when they begin to lift
          up their heads from their naked roots and winter graves. The
          resurrection of light every morning, the reviving the pleasure of all
          things to the eye; the watering the valleys from the mountain springs;
          the curbing the natural appetite of the waters from covering the
          earth; every draught that the beasts drink, every lodging the fowls
          have, every bit of food for the sustenance of man and beast, is
          ascribed to the “opening of his hand,” the diffusing of his power (Ps.
          civ. 27, &amp;c.), as much as the first creation of things, and
          endowing them with their particular nature: whence the plants, which
          are so serviceable, are called “the trees of the Lord” (ver. 16), of
          Jehovah, that hath only being and power in himself. The whole Psalm is
          but the description of his preserving, as the first of Genesis is of
          his creating power. It is by this power angels have so many thousand
          years remained in the power of understanding and willing. By this
          power things distant in their natures have been joined together; a
          spiritual soul and a dusty body knit in a marriage knot. By this power
          the heavenly bodies have for so many ages rolled in their spheres, and
          the tumultuous elements have persisted in their order: by this hath
          the matter of the world been to this day continued, and as capable of
          entertaining forms as it was at the first creation. What an amazing
          sight would it be to see a man hold a pillar of the Exchange upon one
          of his fingers? What is this to the power of God, “who holds the
          waters in the hollow of his hand, metes out the heaven with a span,
          and weighs the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance” (Isa.
          xl. 12)? The preserving the earth from the violence of the sea is a
          plain instance of this power.859 How is that raging element kept pent
          within those lists where he first lodged it; continues its course in
          its channel without overflowing the earth, and dashing in pieces the
          lower part of the creation? The natural situation of the water is to
          be above the earth, because it is lighter; and to be immediately under
          the air, because it is heavier than that thinner element. Who
          restrains this natural quality of it, but that God that first formed
          it? The word of command at first, “Hitherto shalt thou go, and no
          further,” keeps those waters linked together in their den, that they
          may not ravage the earth, but be useful to the inhabitants of it. And
          when once it finds a gap to enter, what power of earth can hinder its
          passage? How fruitless sometimes is all the art of man to send it to
          its proper channel, when once it hath spread its mighty waves over
          some countries, and trampled part of the inhabited earth under its
          feet? It hath triumphed in its victory, and withstood all the power of
          man to conquer its force. It is only the power of God that doth bridle
          it from spreading itself over the whole earth. And that his power
          might be more manifest, he hath set but a weak and small bank against
          it. Though he hath bounded it in some places by mighty rocks, which
          lift up their heads above it, yet in most places by feeble sand. How
          often is it seen in every stormy motion, when the waves boil high and
          roll furiously, as if they would swallow up all the neighboring houses
          upon the shore; when they come to touch those sandy limits, they bow
          their heads, fall flat, and sink into the lap whence they were raised,
          and seem to foam with anger that they can march no further, but must
          split themselves at so weak an obstacle! Can the sand be thought to be
          the cause of this? The weakness of it gives no footing to such a
          thought. Who can apprehend, that an enraged army should retire upon
          the opposition of a straw in an infant’s hand? Is it the nature of the
          water? Its retirement is against the natural quality of it; pour but a
          little upon the ground, and you always see it spread itself. No cause
          can be rendered in nature; it is a standing monument of the power of
          God in the preservation of the world, and ought to be more taken
          notice of by us in this island, surrounded with it, than by some other
          countries in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) We find nothing hath power to preserve itself. Doth not every
          creature upon earth require the assistance of some other for its
          maintenance? “Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow up
          without water” (Job viii. 11)? Can man or beast maintain itself
          without grain from the bowels of the earth? Would not every man tumble
          into the grave, without the aid of other creatures to nourish him?
          Whence do these creatures receive that virtue of supplying him
          nourishment, but from the sun and earth? and whence do they derive
          that virtue, but from the Creator of all things? And should he but
          slack his hand, how soon would they and all their qualities perish,
          and the links of the world fall in pieces, and dash one another into
          their first chaos and confusion! All creatures indeed have an appetite
          to preserve themselves; they have some knowledge of the outward means
          for their preservation; so have irrational animals a natural instinct,
          as well as men have some skill to avoid things that are hurtful, and
          apply things that are helpful. But what thing in the world can
          preserve itself by an inward influx into its own being? All things
          want such a power without God’s fiat, “Let it be so:” nothing but is
          destitute of such a power for its own preservation, as much as it is
          of a power for its own creation. Were there any true power for such a
          work, what need of so many external helps from things of an inferior
          nature to that which is preserved by them? No created thing hath a
          power to preserve any decayed being. Who can lay claim to such a
          virtue, as to recall a withering flower to its former beauty, to raise
          the head of a drooping plant, or put life into a gasping worm when it
          is expiring; or put impaired vitals into their former posture? Not a
          man upon earth, nor an angel in heaven, can pretend to such a virtue;
          they may be spectators, but not assisters, and are, in this case,
          physicians of no value.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is, therefore, the same Power preserves things which at first
          created them. The creature doth as much depend upon God, in the first
          instant of its being, for its preservation, as it did, when it was
          nothing, for its production and creation into being: as the
          continuance of a thought of our mind depends upon the power of our
          mind, as well as the first framing of that thought.860 There is a
          little difference between creating and preserving power, as there is
          between the power of mine eye to begin an act of vision and continue
          that act of vision, as to cast my eye upon an object and continue it
          upon that object: as the first act is caused by the eye, so the
          duration of the act is preserved by the eye; shut the eye, and the act
          of vision perishes; divert the eye from that object, and that act of
          vision is exchanged for another. And, therefore, the preservation of
          things is commonly called a continual creation: and certainly it is no
          less, if we understand it of a preservation by an inward influence
          into the being of things. It is one and the same action invariably
          continued, and obtaining its force every moment; the same action
          whereby he created them of nothing, and which every moment hath a
          virtue to produce a thing out of nothing, if it were not yet extant in
          the world: it remains the same without any diminution throughout the
          whole time wherein anything doth remain in the world.861 For all
          things would return to nothing, if God did not keep them up in the
          elevation and state to which he at first raised them by his creative
          power (Acts xvii. 28): “In him we live, and move, and have our being.”
          By him, or by the same Power whence we derived our being, are our
          lives maintained: as it was his Almighty Power whereby we were, after
          we had been nothing, so it is the same power whereby we now are, after
          he hath made us something. Certainly all things have no less a
          dependence on God than light upon the sun, which vanisheth and hides
          its head upon the withdrawing of the sun. And should God suspend that
          powerful Word, whereby he erected the frame of the world, it would
          sink down to what it was, before he commanded it to stand up. There
          needs no new act of power to reduce things to nothing, but the
          cessation of that Omnipotent influx. When the appointed time set them
          for their being comes to a period, they faint and bend down their
          heads to their dissolution; they return to their elements, and perish
          (Ps. civ. 29): “Thou hidest thy face, and they are troubled: thou
          takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.” That
          which was nothing cannot remain on this side nothing, but by the same
          Power that first called it out of nothing. As when God withdrew his
          concurring power from the fire, its quality ceased to act upon the
          three children: so if he withdraws his sustaining power from the
          creature, its nature will cease to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It appears in propagation. That powerful word (Gen. i. 22, 23),
          “Increase and multiply,” pronounced at the first creation, hath spread
          itself over every part of the world; every animal in the world, in the
          formation of every one of them. From two of a kind, how great a number
          of individuals and single creatures have been multiplied, to cover the
          face of the earth in their continued successions! What a world of
          plants spring up from the womb of a dry earth, moistened by the
          influence of a cloud, and hatched by the beams of the sun! How
          admirable an instance of his propagating power is it, that from a
          little seed a massy root should strike into the bowels of the earth, a
          tall body and thick branches, with leaves and flowers of various
          colors, should break through the surface of the earth, and mount up
          towards heaven, when in the seed you neither smell the scent, nor see
          any firmness of a tree, nor behold any of those colors which you view
          in the flowers that the ears produce! A power not to be imitated by
          any creature. How astonishing is it, that a small seed, whereof many
          will not amount to the weight of a grain, should spread itself into
          leaves, bark, fruit of a vast weight, and multiply itself into
          millions of seeds! What power is that, that from one man and woman
          hath multiplied families, and from families, stocked the world with
          people! Consider the living creatures, as formed in the womb of their
          several kinds; every one is a wonder of power. The Psalmist instanceth
          in the forming and propagation of man (Ps. cxxxix. 14): “I am
          fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works.” The forming
          of the parts distinctly in the womb, the bringing forth into the world
          every particular member, is a roll of wonders, of power. That so fine
          a structure as the body of man should be polished in “the lower parts
          of the earth,” as he calls the womb (ver. 15), in so short a time,
          with members of a various form and usefulness, each laboring in their
          several functions! Can any man give an exact account of the manner
          “how the bones do grow in the womb” (Eccles. xi. 5)? It is unknown to
          the father, and no less hid from the mother, and the wisest men cannot
          search out the depth of it. It is one of the secret works of an
          Omnipotent Power, secret in the manner, though open in the effect. So
          that we must ascribe it to God, as Job doth, “Thine hands have made me
          and fashioned me together round about” (Job x. 8). Thy hands which
          formed heaven, have formed every part, every member, and wrought me
          like a mighty workman. The heavens are said to be the “work of God’s
          hands,” and man is here said to be no less. The forming and
          propagation of man from that earthy matter, is no less a wonder of
          power than the structure of the world from a rude and indisposed
          matter. A heathen philosopher descants elegantly upon it: “Dost thou
          understand (my son) the forming of man in the womb; who erected that
          noble fabric? who carved the eyes, the crystal windows of light, and
          the conductors of the body; who bored the nostrils and ears, those
          loopholes of scents and sounds; who stretched out and knit the sinews
          and ligaments for the fastening of every member; who cast the hollow
          veins, the channels of blood; set and strengthened the bones, the
          pillars and rafters of the body; who digged the pores, the sinks to
          expel the filth; who made the heart, the repository of the soul, and
          formed the lungs like a pipe? What mother, what father, wrought these
          things? No, none but the Almighty God, who made all things according
          to his pleasure; it is He who propagates this noble piece from a pile
          of dust. Who is born by his own advice; who gives stature, features,
          sense, wit, strength, speech, but God?”862 It is no less a wonder,
          that a little infant can live so long in a dark sink, in the midst of
          filth, without breathing; and the eduction of it out of the womb is no
          less a wonder than the forming, increase, nourishment of it in that
          cell. A wonder, that the life of the infant is not the death of the
          mother, or the life of the mother the death of the infant. This little
          creature when it springs up from such small beginnings by the power of
          God, grows up to be one of the lords of the world, to have a dominion
          over the creatures, and propagates its kind in the same manner: all
          this is unaccountable without having recourse to the power of God in
          the government of the creatures. And to add to this wonder, consider
          also what multitudes of formations and births there are at one time
          all over the world, in every of which the finger of God is at work;
          and it will speak an unwearied power. It is admirable in one man, more
          in a town of men, still more in a greater and larger kingdom, a vaster
          world; there is a birth for every hour in this city, were but 168 born
          in a week, though the weekly bills mention more: what is this city to
          three kingdoms? what three kingdoms to a populous world? Eleven
          thousand and eighty will make one for every minute in the week; what
          is this to the weekly propagation in all the nations of the universe,
          besides the generation of all the living creatures in that space,
          which are the works of God’s fingers as well as man? What will be the
          result of this, but the notion of an unconceivable, unwearied
          Almightiness, always active, always operating?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It appears in the motions of all creatures. “All things live and
          move in him” (Acts xvii. 28); by the same power that creatures have
          their beings, they have their motions: they have not only a being by
          his powerful command, but they have their minutely motion by his
          powerful concurrence. Nothing can act without the almighty influx of
          God, no more than it can exist without the creative word of God. It is
          true indeed, the ordering of all motions to his holy ends, is an act
          of wisdom; but the motion itself, whereby those ends are attained, is
          a work of his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God, as the first cause, hath an influence into the motions of
          all second causes. As all the wheels in a clock are moved in their
          different motions by the force and strength of the principal and
          primary wheel; if there be any defect in that, or if that stand still,
          all the rest languish and stand idle the same moment. All creatures
          are his instruments, his engines, and have no spirit, but what he
          gives, and what he assists. Whatsoever nature works, God works in
          nature; nature is the instrument, God is the supporter, director,
          mover of nature; that which the prophet saith in another case, may be
          the language of universal nature: “Lord, thou hast wrought all our
          work in us” (Isa. xxvi. 12). They are works subjectively, efficiently,
          as second causes; God’s works originally, concurrently. The sun moved
          not in the valley of Ajalon for the space of many hours, in the time
          of Joshua (Josh. x. 13); nor did the fire exercise its consuming
          quality upon the three children, in Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace (Dan.
          iii. 25): he withdrew not his supporting power from their being, for
          then they had vanished, but his influencing power from their
          qualities, whereby their motion ceased, till he returned his
          influential concurrence to them; which evidenceth, that without a
          perpetual derivation of Divine power, the sun could not run one stride
          or inch of its race, nor the fire devour one grain of light chaff, or
          an inch of straw. Nothing without his sustaining power can continue in
          being; nothing without his co‑working power can exercise one mite of
          those qualities it is possessed of. All creatures are wound up by him,
          and his hand is constantly upon them, to keep them in perpetual
          motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Consider the variety of motions in a single creature. How many
          motions are there in the vital parts of a man, or in any other animal,
          which a man knows not, and is unable to number! The renewed motion of
          the lungs, the systoles and diastoles of the heart; the contractions
          and dilations of the heart, whereby it spouts out and takes in blood;
          the power of concoction in the stomach; the motion of the blood in the
          veins, &amp;c., all which were not only settled by the powerful hand
          of God, but are upheld by the same, preserved and influenced in every
          distinct motion by that power that stamped them with that nature. To
          every one of those there is not only the sustaining power of God
          holding up their natures, but the motive power of God concurring to
          every motion; for if we move in him as well as we live in him, then
          every particle of our motion is exercised by his concurring power, as
          well as every moment of our life supported by his preserving power.
          What an infinite variety of motions is there in the whole world in
          universal nature, to all which God concurs, all which he conducts,
          even the motions of the meanest as well as the greatest creatures,
          which demonstrate the indefatigable power of the governor! It is an
          Infinite Power which doth act in so many varieties, whereby the soul
          forms every thought, the tongue speaks every word, the body exerts
          every action. What an Infinite Power is that which presides over the
          birth of all things, concurs with the motion of the sap in the tree,
          rivers on the earth, clouds in the air, every drop of rain, fleece of
          snow, crack of thunder! Not the least motion in the world, but is
          under an actual influence of this Almighty Mover. And lest any should
          scruple the concurrence of God to so many varieties of the creature’s
          motion, as a thing utterly inconceivable, let them consider the sun, a
          natural image and shadow of the perfections of God; doth not the power
          of that finite creature extend itself to various objects at the same
          moment of time? How many insects doth it animate, as flies, &amp;c.,
          at the same moment throughout the world! How many several plants doth
          it erect at its appearance in the spring, whose roots lay mourning in
          the earth all the foregoing winter! What multitudes of spires of
          grass, and nobler flowers, doth it midwife in the same hour! It warms
          the air, melts the blood, cherishes living creatures of various kinds,
          in distinct places, without tiring: and shall the God of this sun be
          less than his creature?
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) And since I speak of the sun, consider the power of God in the
          motion of it. The vastness of the sun is computed to be, at the least,
          166 times bigger than the earth, and its distance from the earth, some
          tell us, to be about 4,000,000 of miles;863 whence it follows, that it
          is whirled about the world with that swiftness, that in the space of
          an hour it runs 1,000,000 of miles, which is as much as if it should
          move round about the surface of the earth fifty times in one hour;
          which vastness exceeds the swiftness of a bullet shot out of a cannon,
          which is computed to fly not above three miles in a minute:864 so that
          the sun runs further in one hour’s space, than a bullet can in 5,000,
          if it were kept in motion; so that if it were near the earth, the
          swiftness of its motion would shatter the whole frame of the world,
          and dash it in pieces; so that the Psalmist may well say, “It runs a
          race like a strong man” (Ps. xix. 5). What an incomprehensible Power
          is that which hath communicated such a strength and swiftness to the
          sun, and doth daily influence its motion; especially since after all
          those years of its motion, wherein one would think it should have
          spent itself, we behold it every day as vigorous as Adam did in
          Paradise, without limping, without shattering itself, or losing any
          thing of its natural spirits in its unwearied motion. How great must
          that power be, which hath kept this great body so entire, and thus
          swiftly moves it every day! Is it not now an argument of omnipotency,
          to keep all the strings of nature in tune; to wind them up to a due
          pitch for the harmony he intended by them; to keep things that are
          contrary from that confusion they would naturally fall into; to
          prevent those jarrings which would naturally result from their various
          and snarling qualities; to preserve every being in its true nature; to
          propagate every kind of creature; order all the operations, even the
          meanest of them, when there are such innumerable varieties? But let us
          consider, that this power of preserving things in their station and
          motion, and the renewing of them, is more stupendous than that which
          we commonly call miraculous. We call those miracles, which are wrought
          out of the track of nature, and contrary to the usual stream and
          current of it; which men wonder at, because they seldom see them, and
          hear of them as things rarely brought forth in the world; when the
          truth is, there is more of power expressed in the ordinary station and
          motion of natural causes than in those extraordinary exertings of
          power. Is not more power signalized in that whirling motion of the sun
          every hour for so many ages, than in the suspending of its motion one
          day, as it was in the days of Joshua? That fire should continually
          ravage and consume, and greedily swallow up every thing that is
          offered to it, seems to be the effect of as admirable a power, as the
          stopping of its appetite a few moments, as in the case of the three
          children. Is not the rising of some small seeds from the ground, with
          a multiplication of their numerous posterity, an effect of as great a
          power, as our Saviour’s feeding many thousands with a few loaves, by a
          secret augmentation of them?865 Is not the chemical producing so
          pleasant and delicious a fruit as the grape, from a dry earth, insipid
          rain, and a sour vine, as admirable a token of Divine power, as our
          Saviour’s turning water into wine? Is not the cure of diseases by the
          application of a simple inconsiderable weed, or a slight infusion, as
          wonderful in itself, as the cure of it by a powerful weed? What if it
          be naturally designed to heal; what is that nature, who gave that
          nature, who maintains that nature, who conducts it, co‑operates with
          it? Doth it work of itself, and by its own strength? why not then
          equally in all, in one as well as another? Miracles, indeed, affect
          more, because they testify the immediate operation of God, without the
          concurrence of second causes; not that there is more of the power of
          God shining in them than in the other.
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, This power is evident in moral government.</p>
        <p>
          1. In the restraint of the malicious nature of the devil. Since Satan
          hath the power of an angel, and the malice of a devil, what safety
          would there be for our persons from destruction, what security for our
          goods from rifling, by this invisible, potent, and envious spirit, if
          his power were not restrained, and his malice curbed, by One more
          mighty than himself? How much doth he envy God the glory of his
          creation; and man, the use and benefit of it! How desirous would he
          be, in regard of his passion, how able in regard of his strength and
          subtlety, to overthrow or infect all worship, but what was directed to
          himself; to manage all things according to his lusts, turn all things
          topsy‑turvy, plague the world, burn cities, houses, plunder us of the
          supports of nature, waste kingdoms, &amp;c.; if he were not held in a
          chain, as a ravenous lion, or a furious wild horse, by the Creator and
          Governor of the world! What remedy could be used by man against the
          activity of this unseen and swift spirit? The world could not subsist
          under his malice; he would practise the same things upon all as he did
          upon Job, when he had got leave from his Governor; turn the swords of
          men into one another’s bowels; send fire from heaven upon the fruits
          of the earth and the cattle intended for the use of man; raise winds,
          to shake and tear our houses upon our heads; daub our bodies with
          scalbs and boils, and let all the humors in our blood loose upon us.
          He that envied Adam a paradise, doth envy us the pleasure of enjoying
          its out‑works. If we were not destroyed by him, we should live in a
          continued vexation by spectrums and apparitions, affrighting sounds
          and noise, as some think the Egyptians did in that three days’
          darkness: he would be alway winnowing us, as he desired to winnow
          Peter (Luke xxii. 31). But God over‑masters his strength, that he
          cannot move a hair’s breadth beyond his tedder; not only is he unable
          to touch an upright Job, but to lay his fingers upon one of the
          unbelieving Gadarenes forbidden and filthy swine without special
          license (Matt. viii. 31). When he is cast out of one place, he walks
          “through dry places seeking rest” (Luke xi. 24), new objects for his
          malicious designs,—but finding none, till God lets loose the reins
          upon him for a new employment. Though Satan’s power be great, yet God
          suffers him not to tempt as much as his diabolical appetite would, but
          as much as Divine wisdom thinks fit; and the Divine power tempers the
          other’s active malice, and gives the creature victory, where the enemy
          intended spoil and captivity. How much stronger is God, than all the
          legions of hell; as he that holds a “strong man” (Luke xi. 22) from
          effecting his purpose, testifies more ability than his adversary! How
          doth he lock him up for a “thousand years” (Rev. xx. 3) in a pound,
          which he cannot leap over! and this restraint is wrought partly by
          blinding the devil in his designs, partly by denying him concourse to
          his motion; as he hindered the active quality of the fire upon the
          three children, by withdrawing his power, which was necessary to the
          motion of it; and his power is as necessary for the motion of the
          devil, as for that of any other creature: sometimes he makes him to
          confess him against his own interest, as Apollo’s oracle confessed.866
          And though when the devil was cast out of the possessed person, he
          publicly owned Christ to be the “Holy one of God” (Mark i. 24), to
          render him suspected by the people of having commerce with the unclean
          spirits; yet this he could not do without the leave and permission of
          God, that the power of Christ, in stopping his mouth and imposing
          silence upon him, might be evidenced; and that it reaches to the gates
          of hell, as well as to the quieting of winds and waves. This is a part
          of the strength, as well as the wisdom of God, that “the deceived and
          the deceiver are his” (Job xii. 16): wisdom to defeat, and power to
          overrule his most malicious designs, to his own glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the restraint of the natural corruption of men. Since the
          impetus of original corruption runs in the blood, conveyed down from
          Adam to the veins of all his posterity, and universally diffused in
          all mankind; what wreck and havoc would it make in the world, if it
          were not suppressed by this Divine power which presides over the
          hearts of men! Man is so wretched by nature, that nothing but what is
          vile and pernicious can drop from him. Man “drinks iniquity like
          water,” being, by nature, “abominable and filthy” (Job xv. 16). He
          greedily swallows all matter for iniquity, everything suitable to the
          mire and poison in his nature, and would sprout it out with all
          fierceness and insolence. God himself gives us the description of
          man’s nature (Gen. vi. 5), that he hath not one good imagination at
          any time; and the apostle from the Psalmist dilates and comments upon
          it (Rom. iii. 10, &amp;c.) “There is none righteous; no, not one;
          their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to
          shed blood,” &amp;c. This corruption is equal in all, natural in all;
          it is not more poisonous or more fierce in one man, than in another.
          The root of all men is the same; all the branches therefore do equally
          possess the villanous nature of the root. No child of Adam can, by
          natural descent, be better than Adam, or have less of baseness, and
          vileness, and venom, than Adam. How fruitful would this loathsome lake
          be in all kind of streams! What unbridled licentiousness and
          headstrong fury would triumph in the world, if the power of God did
          not interpose itself to lock down the flood‑gates of it! What rooting
          up of human society would there be! how would the world be drenched in
          blood, the number of malefactors be greater than that of apprehenders
          and punishers! How would the prints of natural laws be rased out of
          the heart, if God should leave human nature to itself! Who can read
          the first chapter of Romans, (verses 24 to 29), without acknowledging
          this truth? where there is a catalogue of those villanies which
          followed upon God’s pulling up the sluices, and letting the malignity
          of their inward corruption have its natural course! If God did not
          hold back the fury of man, his garden would be overrun, his vine
          rooted up; the inclinations of men would hurry them to the worst of
          wickedness. How great is that Power that curbs, bridles, or changes as
          many headstrong horses at once, and every minute, as there are sons of
          Adam upon the earth? The “floods lift up their waves; the Lord on high
          is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves
          of the sea” (Ps. xciii. 3, 4); that doth hush and pen in the turbulent
          passions of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In the ordering and framing the hearts of men to his own ends. That
          must be an Omnipotent hand that grasps and contains the hearts of all
          men; the heart of the meanest person, as well as of the most towering
          angel, and turns them as he pleases, and makes them sometime
          ignorantly, sometime knowingly, concur to the accomplishment of his
          own purposes! When the hearts of men are so numerous, their thoughts
          so various and different from one another, yet he hath a key to those
          millions of hearts, and with infinite power, guided by as infinite
          wisdom, he draws them into what channels he pleases, for the gaining
          his own ends. Though the Jews had imbrued their hands in the blood of
          our Saviour, and their rage was yet reeking‑hot against his followers,
          God bridled their fury in the church’s infancy, till it had got some
          strength, and cast a terror upon them by the wonders wrought by the
          apostles (Acts ii. 43): “And fear came upon every soul, and many
          wonders and signs were done by the apostles.” Was there not the same
          reason in the nature of the works our Saviour wrought, to point them
          to the finger of God, and calm their rage? Yet did not the power of
          God work upon their passions in those miracles, nor stop the
          impetuousness of the corruption resident in their hearts. Yet now
          those who had the boldness to attack the Son of God and nail him to
          the cross, are frighted at the appearance of twelve unarmed apostles;
          as the sea seems to be afraid when it approacheth the bounds of the
          feeble sand. How did God bend the hearts of the Egyptians to the
          Israelites, and turn them to that point, as to lend their most costly
          vessels, their precious jewels, and rich garments, to supply those
          whom they had just before tyranically loaded with their chains (Exod.
          iii. 21, 22)! When a great part of an army came upon Jehoshaphat, to
          dispatch him into another world, how doth God, in a trice, touch their
          hearts, and move them, by a secret instinct, at once to depart from
          him (1 Chron. xviii. 31)! as if you should see a numerous sight of
          birds in a moment turn wing another way, by a sudden and joint
          consent. When he gave Saul a kingdom, he gave him a spirit fit for
          government, “and gave him another heart” (1 Sam. x. 9); and brought
          the people to submit to his yoke, who, a little before, wandered about
          the land upon no nobler employment than the seeking of asses. It is no
          small remark of the power of God, to make a number of strong and
          discontented persons, and desirous enough of liberty, to bend their
          necks under the yoke of government, and submit to the authority of
          one, and that of their own nature, often weaker and unwiser than the
          most of them, and many times an oppressor and invader of their rights.
          Upon this account David calls God “his fortress, tower, shield” (Ps.
          cxliv. 2); all terms of strength in subduing the people under him. It
          is the mighty hand of God that links princes and people together in
          the bands of government. The same hand that assuageth the waves of the
          sea, suppresseth the tumults of the people.
        </p>
        <p>Thirdly, It appears in his gracious and judicial government.</p>
        <p>
          1. In his gracious government. In the deliverance of his church: he is
          the “strength of Israel” (1 Sam. xv. 29), and hath protected his
          little flock in the midst of wolves; and maintained their standing,
          when the strongest kingdoms have sunk, and the best jointed states
          have been broken in pieces; when judgments have ravaged countries, and
          torn up the mighty, as a tempestuous wind hath often done the tallest
          trees, which seemed to threaten heaven with their tops, and dare the
          storm with the depth of their roots, when yet the vine and rose‑bushes
          have stood firm, and been seen in their beauty next morning. The state
          of the church hath outlived the most flourishing monarchies, when
          there hath been a mighty knot of adversaries against her; when the
          bulls of Bashan have pushed her, and the whole tribe of the dragon
          have sharpened their weapons, and edged their malice; when the voice
          was strong, and the hopes high to rase her foundation even with the
          ground; when hell hath roared; when the wit of the world hath
          contrived, and the strength of the world hath attempted her ruin; when
          decrees have been passed against her, and the powers of the world
          armed for the execution of them; when her friends have drooped and
          skulked in corners; when there was no eye to pity, and no hand to
          assist, help hath come from heaven; her enemies have been defeated;
          kings have brought gifts to her, and reared her; tears have been wiped
          off her cheeks, and her very enemies, by an unseen power, have been
          forced to court her whom before they would have devoured quick. The
          devil and his armies have sneaked into their den, and the church hath
          triumphed when she hath been upon the brink of the grave. Thus did God
          send a mighty angel to be the executioner of Sennacherib’s army, and
          the protector of Jerusalem, who run his sword into the hearts of
          eighty thousand (2 Kings xix. 35), when they were ready to swallow up
          his beloved city. When the knife was at the throats of the Jews, in
          Shushan (Esther viii.), by a powerful hand it was turned into the
          hearts of their enemies. With what an out‑stretched arm were the
          Israelites freed from the Egyptian yoke (Deut. iv. 34)! When Pharaoh
          had mustered a great army to pursue them, assisted with six hundred
          chariots of war, the Red Sea obstructed their passage before, and an
          enraged enemy trod on their rear; when the fearful Israelites
          despaired of deliverance, and the insolent Egyptian assured himself of
          his revenge, God stretches out his irresistible arm to defeat the
          enemy, and assist his people; he strikes down the wolves, and
          preserves the flock. God restrained the Egyptian enmity against the
          Israelites till they were at the brink of the Red Sea, and then lets
          them follow their humor, and pursue the fugitives, that his power
          might more gloriously shine forth in the deliverance of the one, and
          the destruction of the other. God might have brought Israel out of
          Egypt in the time of those kings that had remembered the good service
          of Joseph to their country, but he leaves them till the reign of a
          cruel tyrant, suffers them to be slaves, that they might by his sole
          power, be conquerors, which had had no appearance had there been a
          willing dismission of them at the first summons (Exod. ix. 16); “In
          very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew my power,
          and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.” I have
          permitted thee to rise up against my people, and keep them in
          captivity, that thou mightest be an occasion for the manifestation of
          my power in their rescue; and whilst thou art obstinate to enslave
          them, I will stretch out my arm to deliver them, and make my name
          famous among the Gentiles, in the wreck of thee and thy host in the
          Red Sea. The deliverance of the church hath not been in one age, or in
          one part of the world, but God hath signalized his power in all
          kingdoms where she hath had a footing: as he hath guided her in all
          places by one rule, animated her by one spirit, so he hath protected
          her by the same arm of power. When the Roman emperors bandied all
          their force against her, for about three hundred years, they were
          further from effecting her ruin at the end than when they first
          attempted it; the church grew under their sword, and was hatched under
          the wings of the Roman eagle, which were spread to destroy her. The
          ark was elevated by the deluge, and the waters the devil poured out to
          drown her did but slime the earth for a new increase of her. She hath
          sometimes been beaten down, and, like Lazarus, hath seemed to be in
          the grave for some days, that the power of God might be more visible
          in her sudden resurrection, and lifting up her head above the throne
          of her persecutors.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In his judicial proceedings. The deluge was no small testimony of
          his power, in opening the cisterns of heaven, and pulling up the
          sluices of the sea. He doth but call for the waters of the sea, and
          they “pour themselves upon the face of the earth” (Amos ix. 6.) In
          forty days’ time the waters overtopped the highest mountains fifteen
          cubits (Gen. vii. 17‒20); and by the same power he afterwards reduced
          the sea to its proper channel, as a roaring lion into his den. A
          shower of fire from heaven, upon Sodom, and the cities of the plain,
          was a signal display of his power, either in creating it on the
          sudden, for the execution of his righteous sentence, or sending down
          the element of fire, contrary to its nature, which affects ascent, for
          the punishment of rebels against the light of nature. How often hath
          he ruined the most flourishing monarchies, led princes away spoiled,
          and overthrown the mighty, which Job makes an argument of his strength
          (Job xii. 13, 14). Troops of unknown people, the Goths and Vandals,
          broke the Romans, a warlike people, and hurled down all before them.
          They could not have had the thought to succeed in such an attempt,
          unless God had given them strength and motion for the executing his
          judicial vengeance upon the people of his wrath. How did he evidence
          his power, by daubing the throne of Pharaoh, and his chamber of
          presence, as well as the houses of his subjects, with the slime of
          frogs (Exod. viii. 3); turning their waters into blood, and their dust
          into biting lice (Exod. vii. 20); raising his militia of locusts
          against them; causing a three days’ darkness without stopping the
          motion of the sun; taking off their first‑born, the excellency of
          their strength, in a night, by the stroke of the angel’s sword! He
          takes off the chariot wheels of Pharaoh, and presents him with a
          destruction where he expected a victory; brings those waves over the
          heads of him and his host, which stood firm as marble walls for the
          safety of his people; the sea is made to swallow them up, that durst
          not, by the order of their Governor, touch the Israelites: it only
          sprinkled the one as a type of baptism, and drowned the other as an
          image of hell. Thus he made it both a deliverer and a revenger, the
          instrument of an offensive and defensive war (Isa. xl. 23, 24); “He
          brings princes to nothing, and makes the judges of the earth as
          vanity.” Great monarchs have, by his power, been hurled from their
          thrones and their sceptres, like Venice‑glasses, broken before their
          faces, and they been advanced that have had the least hopes of
          grandeur. He hath plucked up cedars by the roots, lopped off the
          branches, and set a shrub to grow up in the place; dissolved rocks,
          and established bubbles (Luke i. 52): “He hath showed strength with
          his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their
          hearts; he hath put down the mighty from their seat, and exalted them
          of low degree.”—And these things he doth magnify his power in:—
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) By ordering the nature of creatures as he pleases. By restraining
          their force, or guiding their motions. The restraint of the
          destructive qualities of the creatures argues as great a power as the
          change of their natures, yea, and a greater. The qualities of
          creatures may be changed by art and composition, as in the preparing
          of medicines; but what but a Divine Power could restrain the operation
          of the fire from the three children, while it retained its heat and
          burning quality in Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace? The operation was curbed
          while its nature was preserved. All creatures are called his host,
          because he marshals and ranks them as an army to serve his purposes.
          The whole scheme of nature is ready to favor men when God orders it,
          and ready to punish men when God commissions it. He gave the Red Sea
          but a check, and it obeyed his voice (Ps. cvi. 9): “He rebuked the Red
          Sea also, and it was dried up;” the motion of it ceased, and the
          waters of it were ranged as defensive walls, to secure the march of
          his people: and at the motion of the hand of Moses, the servant of the
          Lord, the sea recovered its violence, and the walls that were framed
          came tumbling down upon the Egyptian’s heads (Exod. xiv. 27). The
          Creator of nature is not led by the necessity of nature: he that
          settled the order of nature, can change or restrain the order of
          nature according to his sovereign pleasure. The most necessary and
          useful creatures he can use as instruments of his vengeance: water is
          necessary to cleanse, and by that he can deface a world; fire is
          necessary to warm, and by that he can burn a Sodom: from the water he
          formed the fowl (Gen. i. 21), and by that he dissolves them in the
          deluge; fire or heat is necessary to the generation of creatures, and
          by that he ruins the cities of the plain. He orders all as he pleases,
          to perform every tittle and punctilio of his purpose. The sea observed
          him so exactly, that it drowned not one Israelite, nor saved one
          Egyptian (Ps. cvi. 11). There was not one of them left. And to perfect
          the Israelites’ deliverance, he followed them with testimonies of his
          power above the strength of nature. When they wanted drink, he orders
          Moses to strike a rock, and the rock spouts a river, and a channel is
          formed for it to attend them in their journey. When they wanted bread,
          he dressed manna for them in the heavens, and sent it to their tables
          in the desert. When he would declare his strength, he calls to the
          heavens to pour down righteousness, and to the earth to bring forth
          salvation (Isa. xlv. 8). Though God had created righteousness or
          deliverance for the Jews in Babylon, yet he calls to the heavens and
          the earth to be assistant to the design of Cyrus, whom he had raised
          for that purpose, as he speaks in the beginning of the chapter (verses
          1‒4). As God created man for a supernatural end, and all creatures for
          man as their immediate end, so he makes them, according to
          opportunities, subservient to that supernatural end of man, for which
          he created him. He that spans the heavens with his fist, can shoot all
          creatures like an arrow, to hit what mark he pleases. He that spread
          the heavens and the earth by a word, and can by a word fold them up
          more easily than a man can a garment (Heb. i. 12), can order the
          streams of nature; cannot he work without nature as well as with it,
          beyond nature, contrary to nature, that can, as it were, fillip nature
          with his finger into that nothing whence he drew it; who can cast down
          the sun from his throne, clap the distinguished parts of the world
          together, and make them march in the same order to their confusion, as
          they did in their creation: who can jumble the whole frame together,
          and, by a word, dissolve the pillars of the world, and make the fabric
          lie in a ruinous heap?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) In effecting his purposes by small means: in making use of the
          meanest creatures. As the power of God is seen in the creation of the
          smallest creatures, and assembling so many perfections in the little
          body of an insect, as an ant, or spider, so his power is not less
          magnified in the use he makes of them. As he magnifies his wisdom, by
          using ignorant instruments, so he exalts his power, by employing weak
          instruments in his service: the meanness and imperfection of the
          matter sets off the excellency of the workman; so the weakness of the
          instrument is no foil to the power of the principal Agent. When God
          hath effected things by means in the Scripture, he hath usually
          brought about his purposes by weak instruments. Moses, a fugitive from
          Egypt, and Aaron a captive in it, are the instruments of the
          Israelites’ deliverance. By the motion of Moses’ rod, he works wonders
          in the court of Pharaoh, and summons up his judgments against him. He
          brought down Pharaoh’s stomach for a while, by a squadron of lice and
          locusts, wherein Divine power was more seen, than if Moses had brought
          him to his own articles by a multitude of warlike troops. The fall of
          the walls of Jericho by the sound of rams’ horns, was a more glorious
          character of God’s power, than if Joshua had battered it down with a
          hundred of warlike engines (Josh vi. 20). Thus the great army of the
          Midianites, which lay as grasshoppers upon the ground, were routed by
          Gideon in the head of three hundred men; and Goliath, a giant, laid
          level with the ground by David, a stripling, by the force of a sling:
          a thousand Philistines dispatched out of the world by the jaw‑bone of
          an ass in the hand of Samson. He can master a stout nation by an army
          of locusts, and render the teeth of those little insects as
          destructive as the teeth, yea, the strongest teeth, the cheek‑teeth,
          of a great lion (Joel i. 6, 7). The thunderbolt, which produces
          sometimes dreadful effects, is compacted of little atoms which fly in
          the air, small vapors drawn up by the sun, and mixed with other
          sulphurous matter and petrifying juice. Nothing is so weak, but his
          strength can make victorious; nothing so small, but by his power he
          can accomplish his great ends by it; nothing so vile, but his might
          can conduct to his glory; and no nation so mighty, but he can waste
          and enfeeble by the meanest creatures. God is great in power in the
          greatest things, and not little in the smallest; his power in the
          minutest creatures which he uses for his service, surmounts the force
          of our understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. The power of God appears in Redemption. As our Saviour is
          called the Wisdom of God, so he is called the Power of God (1 Cor. i.
          24). The arm of Power was lifted up as high as the designs of Wisdom
          were laid deep: as this way of redemption could not be contrived but
          by an Infinite Wisdom, so it could not be accomplished but by an
          Infinite Power. None but God could shape such a design, and none but
          God could effect it. The Divine Power in temporal deliverances, and
          freedom from the slavery of human oppressors, vails to that which
          glitters in redemption; whereby the devil is defeated in his designs,
          stripped of his spoils, and yoked in his strength. The power of God in
          creation requires not those degrees of admiration, as in redemption.
          In creation, the world was erected from nothing; as there was nothing
          to act, so there was nothing to oppose; no victorious devil was in
          that to be subdued; no thundering law to be silenced; no death to be
          conquered; no transgression to be pardoned and rooted out; no hell to
          be shut; no ignominious death upon the cross to be suffered. It had
          been, in the nature of the thing, an easier thing to Divine Power to
          have created a new world than repaired a broken, and purified a
          polluted one. This is the most admirable work that ever God brought
          forth in the world, greater than all the marks of his power in the
          first creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this will appear, I. In the Person redeeming. II. In the
          publication and propagation of the doctrine of redemption. III. In the
          application of redemption.
        </p>
        <p>I. In the Person redeeming. First, In his conception.</p>
        <p>
          1. He was conceived by the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin (Luke
          i. 35): “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
          Highest shall overshadow thee:” which act is expressed to be the
          effect of the infinite power of God; and it expresses the supernatural
          manner of the forming the humanity of our Saviour, and signifies not
          the Divine nature of Christ infusing itself into the womb of the
          virgin; for the angel refers it to the manner of the operation of the
          Holy Ghost in the producing the human nature of Christ, and not to the
          nature assuming that humanity into union with itself. The Holy Ghost,
          or the Third Person in the Trinity, overshadowed the virgin, and by a
          creative act framed the humanity of Christ, and united it to the
          Divinity. It is, therefore, expressed by a word of the same import
          with that used in Gen. i. 2, “The Spirit moved upon the face of the
          waters,” which signifies (as it were) a brooding upon the chaos,
          shadowing it with his wings, as hens sit upon their eggs, to form them
          and hatch them into animals; or else it is an allusion to the “cloud
          which covered the tent of the congregation, when the glory of the Lord
          filled the tabernacle” (Exod. xl. 34). It was not such a creative act
          as we call immediate, which is a production out of nothing; but a
          mediate creation, such as God’s bringing things into form out of the
          first matter, which had nothing but an obediential or passive
          disposition to whatsoever stamp the powerful wisdom of God should
          imprint upon it. So the substance of the Virgin had no active, but
          only a passive disposition to this work: the matter of the body was
          earthy, the substance of the virgin; the forming of it was heavenly,
          the Holy Ghost working upon that matter. And therefore when it is
          said, that “she was found with child of the Holy Ghost” (Matt. i. 18),
          it is to be understood of the efficacy of the Holy Ghost, not of the
          substance of the Holy Ghost. The matter was natural, but the manner of
          conceiving was in a supernatural way, above the methods of nature. In
          reference to the active principle the Redeemer is called in the
          prophecy (Isa. iv. 2), “The branch of the Lord,” in regard of the
          Divine hand that planted him: in respect to the passive principle, the
          fruit of the earth, in regard of the womb that bare him; and therefore
          said to be “made of a woman” (Gal. iv. 4). That part of the flesh of
          the virgin whereof the human nature of Christ was made, was refined
          and purified from corruption by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost,
          as a skilful workman separates the dross from the gold: our Saviour is
          therefore called, “that holy thing” (Luke i. 35), though born of the
          virgin: he was necessarily some way to descend from Adam. God, indeed,
          might have created his body out of nothing, or have formed it (as he
          did Adam’s) out of the dust of the ground: but had he been thus
          extraordinarily formed, and not propagated from Adam, though he had
          been a man like one of us, yet he would not have been of kin to us,
          because it would not have been a nature derived from Adam, the common
          parent of us all. It was therefore necessary to an affinity with us,
          not only that he should have the same human nature, but that it should
          flow from the same principle, and be propagated to him.867 But now, by
          this way of producing the humanity of Christ of the substance of the
          virgin, he was in Adam (say some) corporally, but not seminally; of
          the substance of Adam, or a daughter of Adam, but not of the seed of
          Adam: and so he is of the same nature that had sinned, and so what he
          did and suffered may be imputed to us; which, had he been created as
          Adam, could not be claimed in a legal and judicial way.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It was not convenient he should be born in the common order of
          nature, of father and mother: for whosoever is so born is polluted. “A
          clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean” (Job xiv. 4). And our
          Saviour had been incapable of being a redeemer, had he been tainted
          with the least spot of our nature, but would have stood in need of
          redemption himself. Besides, it had been inconsistent with the
          holiness of the Divine nature, to have assumed a tainted and defiled
          body. He that was the fountain of blessedness to all nations, was not
          to be subject to the curse of the law for himself; which he would have
          been, had he been conceived in an ordinary way. He that was to
          overturn the devil’s empire, was not to be any way captive under the
          devil’s power, as a creature under the curse; nor could he be able to
          break the serpent’s head, had he been tainted with the serpent’s
          breath. Again, supposing that Almighty God by his divine power had so
          ordered the matter, and so perfectly sanctified an earthly father and
          mother from all original spot, that the human nature might have been
          transmitted immaculate to him, as well as the Holy Ghost did purge
          that part of the flesh of the virgin of which the body of Christ was
          made, yet it was not convenient that that person, that was God blessed
          for ever as well as man, partaking of our nature, should have a
          conception in the same manner as ours, but different, and in some
          measure conformable to the infinite dignity of his person: which could
          not have been, had not a supernatural power and a Divine person been
          concerned as an active principle in it; besides, such a birth had not
          been agreeable to the first promise, which calls him “the Seed of the
          woman” (Gen. i. 15), not of the man; and so the veracity of God had
          suffered some detriment: the Seed of the woman only is set in
          opposition to the seed of the serpent.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. By this manner of conception the holiness of his nature is secured,
          and his fitness for his office is assured to us. It is now a pure and
          unpolluted humanity that is the temple and tabernacle of the Divinity:
          the fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily, and dwells in him
          holily. His humanity is supernaturalized and elevated by the activity
          of the Holy Ghost, hatching the flesh of the virgin into man, as the
          chaos into a world. Though we read of some sanctified from the womb,
          it was not a pure and perfect holiness; it was like the light of fire
          mixed with smoke, an infused holiness accompanied with a natural
          taint: but the holiness of the Redeemer by this conception, is like
          the light of the sun, pure, and without spot. The Spirit of holiness
          supplying the place of a father in the way of creation. His fitness
          for his office is also assured to us; for being born of the virgin,
          one of our nature, but conceived by the Spirit of a Divine person, the
          guilt of our sins may be imputed to him because of our nature, without
          the stain of sin inherent in him; because of his supernatural
          conception he is capable, as one of kin to us, to bear our curse
          without being touched by our taint. By this means our sinful nature is
          assumed without sin in that nature which was assumed by him: “flesh he
          hath, but not sinful flesh” (Rom. viii. 3). Real flesh, but not really
          sinful, only by way of imputation. Nothing but the power of God is
          evident in this whole work: by ordinary laws and the course of nature
          a virgin could not bear a son: nothing but a supernatural and almighty
          grace could intervene to make so holy and perfect a conjunction. The
          generation of others, in an ordinary way, is by male and female: but
          the virgin is overshadowed by the Spirit and power of the Highest.868
          Man only is the product of natural generation; this which is born of
          the virgin is the holy thing, the Son of God. In other generations, a
          rational soul is only united to a material body: but in this, the
          Divine nature is united with the human in one person by an
          indissoluble union.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Second act of power in the person redeeming, is the union of the
          two natures, the Divine and human. The designing indeed of this was an
          act of wisdom; but the accomplishing it was an act of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is in this redeeming person a union of two natures. He is God
          and man in one person (Heb. i. 8, 9). “Thy throne, O God, is for ever
          and ever: God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
          gladness,” &amp;c. The Son is called God, having a throne for ever and
          ever, and the unction speaks him man: the Godhead cannot be anointed,
          nor hath any fellows. Humanity and Divinity are ascribed to him (Rom.
          i. 3, 4). “He was of the seed of David according to the flesh, and
          declared to be the Son of God, by his resurrection from the dead.” The
          Divinity and humanity are both prophetically joined (Zech. xii. 10),
          “I will pour out my Spirit;” the pouring forth the Spirit is an act
          only of Divine grace and power. “And they shall look upon me whom they
          have pierced;” the same person pours forth the Spirit as God, and is
          pierced as man. “The Word was made flesh” (John i. 14). Word from
          eternity was made flesh in time; Word and flesh in one person; a great
          God, and a little infant.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The terms of this union were infinitely distant. What greater
          distance can there be than between the Deity and humanity, between the
          Creator and a creature? Can you imagine the distance between eternity
          and time, Infinite Power and miserable infirmity, an immortal spirit
          and dying flesh, the highest Being and nothing? yet these are
          espoused. A God of unmixed blessedness is linked personally with a man
          of perpetual sorrows: life incapable to die, joined to a body in that
          economy incapable to live without dying first; infinite purity, and a
          reputed sinner; eternal blessedness with a cursed nature, Almightiness
          and weakness, omniscience and ignorance, immutability and
          changeableness, incomprehensibleness and comprehensibility; that which
          cannot be comprehended, and that which can be comprehended; that which
          is entirely independent, and that which is totally dependent; the
          Creator forming all things, and the creature made, met together to a
          personal union; “The word made flesh” (John i. 14), the eternal Son,
          the “Seed of Abraham” (Heb. ii. 16). What more miraculous, than for
          God to become man, and man to become God? That a person possessed of
          all the perfections of the Godhead, should inherit all the
          imperfections of the manhood in one person, sin only excepted: a
          holiness incapable of sinning to be made sin; God blessed forever,
          taking the properties of human nature, and human nature admitted to a
          union with the properties of the Creator: the fulness of the Deity,
          and the emptiness of man united together (Col. ii. 9); not by a
          shining of the Deity upon the humanity, as the light of the sun upon
          the earth, but by an inhabitation or indwelling of the Deity in the
          humanity. Was there not need of an Infinite Power to bring together
          terms so far asunder, to elevate the humanity to be capable of, and
          disposed for, a conjunction with the Deity? If a clod of earth should
          be advanced to, and united with the body of the sun, such an advance
          would evidence itself to be a work of Almighty power: the clod hath
          nothing in its own nature to render it so glorious, no power to climb
          up to so high a dignity: how little would such a union be, to that we
          are speaking of! Nothing less than an Incomprehensible Power could
          effect what an Incomprehensible Wisdom did project in this affair.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Especially since the union is so strait. It is not such a union as
          is between a man and his house he dwells in, whence he goes out and to
          which he returns, without any alteration of himself or his house; nor
          such a union as is between a man and his garment, which both
          communicate and receive warmth from one another; nor such as is
          between an artificer and his instrument wherewith he works; nor such a
          union as one friend hath with another: all these are distant things,
          not one in nature, but have distinct substances. Two friends, though
          united by love, are distinct persons; a man and his clothes, an
          artificer and his instruments, have distinct subsistencies; but the
          humanity of Christ hath no subsistence, but in the person of Christ.
          The straitness of this union is expressed, and may be somewhat
          conceived, by the union of fire with iron; “fire pierceth through all
          the parts of iron, it unites itself with every particle, bestows a
          light, heat, purity, upon all of it; you cannot distinguish the iron
          from the fire, or the fire from the iron, yet they are distinct
          natures; so the Deity is united to the whole humanity, seasons it, and
          bestows an excellency upon it, yet the natures still remain distinct.
          And as during that union of fire with iron, the iron is incapable of
          rust or blackness, so is the humanity incapable of sin: and as the
          operation of fire is attributed to the red‑hot iron (as the iron may
          be said to heat, burn, and the fire may be said to cut and pierce),
          yet the imperfections of the iron do not affect the fire; so in this
          mystery, those things which belong to the Divinity are ascribed to the
          humanity, and those things which belong to the humanity, are ascribed
          to the Divinity, in regard of the person in whom those natures are
          united: yet the imperfections of the humanity do not hurt the
          Divinity.”869 The Divinity of Christ is as really united with the
          humanity, as the soul with the body; the person was one, though the
          natures were two; so united, that the sufferings of the human nature
          were the sufferings of that person, and the dignity of the Divine was
          imputed to the human, by reason of that unity of both in one person;
          hence the blood of the human nature is said to be the “blood of God”
          (Acts xx. 28). All things ascribed to the Son of God, may be ascribed
          to this man; and the things ascribed to this man, may be ascribed to
          the Son of God, as this man is the Son of God, eternal, Almighty; and
          it may be said, “God suffered, was crucified,” &amp;c., for the person
          of Christ is but one, most simple; the person suffered, that was God
          and Man united, making one person.870
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And though the union be so strait, yet without confusion of the
          natures, or change of them into one another. The two natures of Christ
          are not mixed, as liquors that incorporate with one another when they
          are poured into a vessel; the Divine nature is not turned into the
          human, nor the human into the Divine; one nature doth not swallow up
          another, and make a third nature distinct from each of them.871 The
          Deity is not turned into the humanity, as air (which is next to a
          spirit) may be thickened and turned into water, and water may be
          rarified into air by the power of heat boiling it. The Deity cannot be
          changed, because the nature of it is to be unchangeable; it would not
          be Deity, if it were mortal and capable of suffering. The humanity is
          not changed into the Deity, for then Christ could not have been a
          sufferer; if the humanity had been swallowed up into the Deity, it had
          lost its own distinct nature, and put on the nature of the Deity, and,
          consequently, been incapable of suffering; finite can never, by any
          mixture, be changed into infinite, nor infinite into finite. This
          union, in this regard, may be resembled to the union of light and air,
          which are strictly joined; for the light passes through all parts of
          the air, but they are not confounded, but remain in their distinct
          essences as before the union, without the least confusion with one
          another. The Divine nature remains as it was before the union, entire
          in itself; only the Divine person assumes another nature to
          himself.872 The human nature remains, as it would have done, had it
          existed separately from the Λόγος, except that then it would have had
          a proper subsistence by itself, which now it borrows from its union
          with the Λόγος, or, word; but that doth not belong to the constitution
          of its nature. Now let us consider, what a wonder of power is all
          this: the knitting a noble soul to a body of clay, was not so great an
          exploit of Almightiness, as the espousing infinite and finite
          together. Man is further distant from God, than man from nothing. What
          a wonder is it, that two natures infinitely distant, should be more
          intimately united than anything in the world; and yet without any
          confusion! that the same person should have both a glory and a grief;
          an infinite joy in the Deity, and an inexpressible sorrow in the
          humanity! That a God upon a throne should be an infant in a cradle;
          the thundering Creator be a weeping babe and a suffering man, are such
          expressions of mighty power, as well as condescending love, that they
          astonish men upon earth, and angels in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Power was evident in the progress of his life; in the
          miracles he wrought. How often did he expel malicious and powerful
          devils from their habitations; hurl them from their thrones, and make
          them fall from heaven like lightning! How many wonders were wrought by
          his bare word, or a single touch! Sight restored to the blind, and
          hearing to the deaf; palsy members restored to the exercise of their
          functions; a dismiss given to many deplorable maladies; impure
          leprosies chased from the persons they had infected, and bodies
          beginning to putrefy raised from the grave. But the mightiest argument
          of power was his patience; that He who was, in his Divine nature,
          elevated above the world, should so long continue upon a dunghill,
          endure the contradiction of sinners against himself, be patiently
          subject to the reproaches and indignities of men, without displaying
          that justice which was essential to the Deity; and, in especial
          manner, daily merited by their provoking crimes. The patience of man
          under great affronts, is a greater argument of power, than the
          brawniness of his arm; a strength employed in the revenge of every
          injury, signifies a greater infirmity in the soul, than there can be
          ability in the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, Divine power was apparent in his resurrection. The unlocking
          the belly of the whale for the deliverance of Jonas; the rescue of
          Daniel from the den of lions; and the restraining the fire from
          burning the three children, were signal declarations of his power, and
          types of the resurrection of our Saviour. But what are those to that
          which was represented by them? That was a power over natural causes, a
          curbing of beasts, and restraining of elements; but in the
          resurrection of Christ, God exercised a power over himself, and
          quenched the flames of his own wrath, hotter than millions of
          Nebuchadnezzar’s furnaces; unlocked the prison doors, wherein the
          curses of the law had lodged our Saviour, stronger than the belly and
          ribs of a leviathan. In the rescue of Daniel and Jonas, God
          overpowered beasts; and in this tore up the strength of the old
          serpent, and plucked the sceptre from the hand of the enemy of
          mankind. The work of resurrection, indeed, considered in itself,
          requires the efficacy of an Almighty power; neither man nor angel can
          create new dispositions in a dead body, to render it capable of
          lodging a spiritual soul; nor can they restore a dislodged soul, by
          their own power, to such a body. The restoring a dead body to life
          requires an infinite power, as well as the creation of the world; but
          there was in the resurrection of Christ, something more difficult than
          this; while he lay in the grave he was under the curse of the law,
          under the execution of that dreadful sentence, “Thou shalt die the
          death.” His resurrection was not only the re‑tying the marriage knot
          between his soul and body, or the rolling the stone from the grave;
          but a taking off an infinite weight, the sin of mankind, which lay
          upon him. So vast a weight could not be removed without the strength
          of an Almighty arm. It is, therefore, not to an ordinary operation,
          but an operation with power (Rom. i. 4), and such a power wherein the
          glory of the Father did appear (Rom. vi. 4); “Raised up from the dead
          by the glory of the Father,” that is, the glorious power of God. As
          the Eternal generation is stupendous, so is his resurrection, which is
          called, a new begetting of him (Acts xiii. 33). It is a wonder of
          power, that the Divine and human nature should be joined; and no less
          wonder that his person should surmount and rise up from the curse of
          God, under which he lay. The apostle, therefore, adds one expression
          to another, and heaps up a variety, signifying thereby that one was
          not enough to represent it (Eph. i. 19); “Exceeding greatness of
          power, and working of mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he
          raised him from the dead.” It was an hyperbole of power, the
          excellency of the mightiness of his strength: the loftiness of the
          expressions seems to come short of the apprehension he had of it in
          his soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This power appears in the publication and propagation of the
          doctrine of redemption. The Divine power will appear, if you consider,
          1. The nature of the doctrine. 2. The instruments employed in it. 3.
          The means they used to propagate it. 4. The success they had.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The nature of the doctrine. (1.) It was contrary to the common
          received reason of the world. The philosophers, the masters of
          knowledge among the Gentiles, had maxims of a different stamp from it.
          Though they agreed in the being of a God, yet their notions of his
          nature were confused and embroiled with many errors; the unity of God
          was not commonly assented unto; they had multiplied deities according
          to the fancies they had received from some of a more elevated wit and
          refined brain than others. Though they had some notion of mediators,
          yet they placed in those seats their public benefactors, men that had
          been useful to the world, or their particular countries, in imparting
          to them some profitable invention. To discard those, was to charge
          themselves with ingratitude to them, from whom they had received
          signal benefits, and to whose mediation, conduct, or protection, they
          ascribed all the success they had been blessed with in their several
          provinces, and to charge themselves with folly for rendering an honor
          and worship to them so long. Could the doctrine of a crucified
          Mediator, whom they had never seen, that had conquered no country for
          them, never enlarged their territories, brought to light no new
          profitable invention for the increase of their earthly welfare, as the
          rest had done, be thought sufficient to balance so many of their
          reputed heroes? How ignorant were they in the foundations of the true
          religion! The belief of a Providence was staggering; nor had they a
          true prospect of the nature of virtue and vice; yet they had a fond
          opinion of the strength of their own reason, and the maxims that had
          been handed down to them by their predecessors, which Paul (1 Tim. vi.
          20) entitles, a “science falsely so called,” either meant of the
          philosophers or the Gnostics. They presumed that they were able to
          measure all things by their own reason; whence, when the apostle came
          to preach the doctrine of the Gospel at Athens, the great school of
          reason in that age, they gave him no better a title than that of a
          babbler (Acts xvii. 18), and openly mocked him (ver. 32); a seed
          gatherer,873 one that hath no more brain or sense than a fellow that
          gathers up seeds that are spilled in a market, or one that hath a vain
          and empty sound, without sense or reason, like a foolish mountebank;
          so slightly did those rationalists of the world think of the wisdom of
          heaven. That the Son of God should veil himself in a mortal body, and
          suffer a disgraceful death in it, were things above the ken of reason.
          Besides, the world had a general disesteem of the religion of the
          Jews, and were prejudiced against anything that came from them; whence
          the Romans, that used to incorporate the gods of other conquered
          nations in their capital, never moved to have the God of Israel
          worshipped among them. Again, they might argue against it with much
          fleshly reason: here is a crucified God, preached by a company of mean
          and ignorant persons, what reason can we have to entertain this
          doctrine, since the Jews, who, as they tell us, had the prophecies of
          him, did not acknowledge him? Surely, had there been such predictions,
          they would not have crucified, but crowned their King, and expected
          from him the conquest of the earth under their power. What reason have
          we to entertain him, whom his own nation, among whom he lived, with
          whom he conversed so unanimously, by the vote of the rulers as well as
          the rout, rejected? It was impossible to conquer minds possessed with
          so many errors, and applauding themselves in their own reason, and to
          render them capable of receiving revealed truths without the influence
          of a Divine power.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It was contrary to the customs of the world. The strength of
          custom in most men, surmounts the strength of reason, and men commonly
          are so wedded to it, that they will be sooner divorced from anything
          than the modes and patterns received from their ancestors. The
          endeavoring to change customs of an ancient standing, hath begotten
          tumults and furious mutinies among nations, though the change would
          have been much for their advantage. This doctrine struck at the root
          of the religion of the world, and the ceremonies, wherein they had
          been educated from their infancy, delivered to them from their
          ancestors, confirmed by the customary observance of many ages, rooted
          in their minds and established by their laws (Acts xviii. 13); “This
          fellow persuadeth us to worship God contrary to the law;” against
          customs, to which they ascribed the happiness of their states, and the
          prosperity of their people, and would put, in the place of this
          religion they would abolish, a new one instituted by a man, whom the
          Jews had condemned, and put to death upon a cross, as an impostor,
          blasphemer, and seditious person. It was a doctrine that would change
          the customs of the Jews, who were intrusted with the oracles of God.
          It would bury forever their ceremonial rites, delivered to them by
          Moses, from that God, who had, with a mighty hand, brought them out of
          Egypt, consecrated their law with thunders and lightnings from Mount
          Sinai, at the time of its publication, backed it with severe
          sanctions, confirmed it by many miracles, both in the wilderness and
          their Canaan, and had continued it for so many hundred years. They
          could not but remember how they had been ravaged by other nations, and
          judgments sent upon them when they neglected and slighted it; and with
          what great success they were followed when they valued and observed
          it; and how they had abhorred the Author of this new religion, who had
          spoken slightly of their traditions, till they put him to death with
          infamy. Was it an easy matter to divorce them from that worship, upon
          which were entailed, as they imagined, their peace, plenty, and glory,
          things of the dearest regard with mankind? The Jews were no less
          devoted to their ceremonial traditions than the heathen were to their
          vain superstitions. This doctrine of the gospel was of that nature,
          that the state of religion, all over the earth, must be overturned by
          it; the wisdom of the Greeks must vail to it, the idolatry of the
          people must stoop to it, and the profane customs of men must moulder
          under the weight of it. Was it an easy matter for the pride of nature
          to deny a customary wisdom, to entertain a new doctrine against the
          authority of their ancestors, to inscribe folly upon that which hath
          made them admired by the rest of the world? Nothing can be of greater
          esteem with men, than the credit of their lawgivers and founders, the
          religion of their fathers, and prosperity of themselves: hence the
          minds of men were sharpened against it. The Greeks, the wisest nation,
          slighted it as foolish; the Jews, the religious nation, stumbled at
          it, as contrary to the received interpretations of ancient prophecies
          and carnal conceits of an earthly glory. The dimmest eye may behold
          the difficulty to change custom, a second nature: it is as hard as to
          change a wolf into a lamb, to level a mountain, stop the course of the
          sun, or change the inhabitants of Africa into the color of Europe.
          Custom dips men in as durable a dye as nature. The difficulties of
          carrying it on against the Divine religion of the Jew, and rooted
          custom of the Gentiles, were unconquerable by any but an Almighty
          power. And in this the power of God hath appeared wonderfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It was contrary to the sensuality of the world, and the lusts of
          the flesh. How much the Gentiles were overgrown with base and unworthy
          lusts at the time of the publication of the gospel, needs no other
          memento than the apostle’s discourse (Rom. i.). As there was no error
          but prevailed upon their minds, so there was no brutish affection but
          was wedded to their hearts. The doctrine proposed to them was not
          easy; it flattered not the sense, but checked the stream of nature. It
          thundered down those three great engines whereby the devil had subdued
          the world to himself: “the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
          the pride of life:” not only the most sordid affections of the flesh,
          but the more refined gratifications of the mind: it stripped nature
          both of devil and man; of what was commonly esteemed great and
          virtuous. That which was the root of their fame, and the satisfaction
          of their ambition, was struck at by this axe of the gospel. The first
          article of it ordered them to deny themselves, not to presume upon
          their own worth; to lay their understandings and wills at the foot of
          the cross, and resign them up to one newly crucified at Jerusalem:
          honors and wealth were to be despised, flesh to be tamed, the cross to
          be borne, enemies to be loved, revenge not to be satisfied, blood to
          be spilled, and torments to be endured for the honor of One they never
          saw, nor ever before heard of; who was preached with the circumstances
          of a shameful death, enough to affright them from the entertainment:
          and the report of a resurrection and glorious ascension were things
          never heard of by them before, and unknown in the world, that would
          not easily enter into the belief of men: the cross, disgrace,
          self‑denial, were only discoursed of in order to the attainment of an
          invisible world, and an unseen reward, which none of their
          predecessors ever returned to acquaint them with; a patient death,
          contrary to the pride of nature, was published as the way to happiness
          and a blessed immortality: the dearest lusts were to be pierced to
          death for the honor of this new Lord. Other religions brought wealth
          and honor; this struck them off from such expectations, and presented
          them with no promise of anything in this life, but a prospect of
          misery; except those inward consolations to which before they had been
          utter strangers, and had never experimented. It made them to depend
          not upon themselves, but upon the sole grace of God. It decried all
          natural, all moral idolatry, things as dear to men as the apple of
          their eyes. It despoiled them of whatsoever the mind, will, and
          affections of men, naturally lay claim to, and glory in. It pulled
          self up by the roots, unmanned carnal man, and debased the principle
          of honor and self‑satisfaction, which the world counted at that time
          noble and brave. In a word, it took them off from themselves, to act
          like creatures of God’s framing; to know no more than he would admit
          them, and do no more than he did command them. How difficult must it
          needs be to reduce men, that placed all their happiness in the
          pleasures of this life, from their pompous idolatry and brutish
          affections, to this mortifying religion! What might the world say?
          Here is a doctrine will render us a company of puling animals:
          farewell generosity, bravery, sense of honor, courage in enlarging the
          bounds of our country, for an ardent charity to the bitterest of our
          enemies. Here is a religion will rust our swords, canker our arms,
          dispirit what we have hitherto called virtue, and annihilate what hath
          been esteemed worthy and comely among mankind. Must we change conquest
          for suffering, the increase of our reputation for self‑denial, the
          natural sentiment of self‑preservation for affecting a dreadful death?
          How impossible was it that a crucified Lord, and a crucifying doctrine
          should be received in the world without the mighty operation of a
          divine power upon the hearts of men! And in this also the almighty
          power of God did notably shine forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Divine power appeared in the instruments employed for the
          publishing and propagating the gospel; who were (1.) Mean and
          worthless in themselves: not noble and dignified with an earthly
          grandeur, but of a low condition, meanly bred: so far from any
          splendid estates, that they possessed nothing but their nets; without
          any credit and reputation in the world; without comeliness and
          strength; as unfit to subdue the world by preaching, as an army of
          hares were to conquer it by war: not learned doctors, bred up at the
          feet of the famous Rabbins at Jerusalem, whom Paul calls “the princes
          of the world” (1 Cor. ii. 8); nor nursed up in the school of Athens,
          under the philosophers and orators of the time: not the wise men of
          Greece, but the fishermen of Galilee; naturally skilled in no language
          but their own, and no more exact in that than those of the same
          condition in any other nation: ignorant of everything but the language
          of their lakes, and their fishing trade; except Paul, called some time
          after the rest to that employment: and after the descent of the
          Spirit, they were ignorant and unlearned in everything but the
          doctrine they were commanded to publish; for the council, before whom
          they were summoned, proved them to be so, which increased their wonder
          at them (Acts iv. 13). Had it been published by a voice from heaven,
          that twelve poor men, taken out of boats and creeks, without any help
          of learning, should conquer the world to the cross, it might have been
          thought an illusion against all the reason of men; yet we know it was
          undertaken and accomplished by them. They published this doctrine in
          Jerusalem, and quickly spread it over the greatest part of the world.
          Folly outwitted wisdom, and weakness overpowered strength. The
          conquest of the east by Alexander was not so admirable as the
          enterprise of these poor men. He attempted his conquest with the hands
          of a warlike nation, though, indeed, but a small number of thirty
          thousand against multitudes, many hundred thousands of the enemies;
          yet an effeminate enemy; a people inured to slaughter and victory
          attacked great numbers, but enfeebled by luxury and voluptuousness.
          Besides, he was bred up to such enterprises, had a learned education
          under the best philosopher, and a military education under the best
          commander, and a natural courage to animate him. These instruments had
          no such advantage from nature; the heavenly treasure was placed in
          those earthen vessels, as Gideon’s lamps in empty pitchers (Judges
          vii. 16), that the excellency, or hyperbole, of the power, might be of
          God (2 Cor. iv. 7), and the strength of his arm be displayed in the
          infirmity of the instruments. They were destitute of earthly wisdom,
          and therefore despised by the Jews, and derided by the Gentiles; the
          publishers were accounted madmen, and the embracers fools. Had they
          been men of known natural endowments, the power of God had been veiled
          under the gifts of the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Therefore a Divine power suddenly spirited them, and fitted them
          for so great a work. Instead of ignorance, they had the knowledge of
          the tongues; and they that were scarce well skilled in their own
          dialect, were instructed on the sudden to speak the most flourishing
          languages in the world, and discourse to the people of several nations
          the great things of God (Acts ii. 11). Though they were not enriched
          with any worldly wealth, and possessed nothing, yet they were so
          sustained that they wanted nothing in any place where they came; a
          table was spread for them in the midst of their bitterest enemies.
          Their fearfulness was changed into courage, and they that a few days
          before skulked in corners for fear of the Jews (John xx. 19), speak
          boldly in the name of that Jesus, whom they had seen put to death by
          the power of the rulers and the fury of the people: they reproach them
          with the murder of their Master, and outbrave that great people in the
          midst of their temple, with the glory of that person they had so
          lately crucified (Acts ii. 23; iii. 13). Peter, that was not long
          before qualmed at the presence of a maid, was not daunted at the
          presence of the council, that had their hands yet reeking with the
          blood of his Master; but being filled with the Holy Ghost, seems to
          dare the power of the priests and Jewish governors, and is as
          confident in the council chamber, as he had been cowardly in the
          high‑priest’s hall (Acts iv. 9), &amp;c., the efficacy of grace
          triumphing over the fearfulness of nature. Whence should this ardor
          and zeal, to propagate a doctrine that had already borne the scars of
          the peoples’ fury be, but from a mighty Power, which changed those
          hares into lions, and stripped them of their natural cowardice to
          clothe them with a Divine courage; making them in a moment both wise
          and magnanimous, alienating them from any consultations with flesh and
          blood? As soon as ever the Holy Ghost came upon them as a mighty
          rushing wind, they move up and down for the interest of God; as fish,
          after a great clap of thunder, are roused, and move more nimbly on the
          top of the water; therefore, that which did so fit them for this
          undertaking, is called by the title of “power from on high” (Luke
          xxiv. 49).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Divine power appears in the means whereby it was propagated.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) By means different from the methods of the world. Not by force of
          arms, as some religions have taken root in the world. Mahomet’s horse
          hath trampled upon the heads of men, to imprint an Alcoran in their
          brains, and robbed men of their goods to plant their religion. But the
          apostles bore not this doctrine through the world upon the points of
          their swords; they presented a bodily death where they would bestow an
          immortal life. They employed not troops of men in a warlike posture,
          which had been possible for them after the gospel was once spread;
          they had no ambition to subdue men unto themselves, but to God; they
          coveted not the possessions of others; designed not to enrich
          themselves; invaded not the rights of princes, nor the liberties and
          properties of the people: they rifled them not of their estates, nor
          scared them into this religion by a fear of losing their worldly
          happiness. The arguments they used would naturally drive them from an
          entertainment of this doctrine, rather than allure them to be
          proselytes to it: their design was to change their hearts, not their
          government; to wean them from the love of the world, to a love of a
          Redeemer; to remove that which would ruin their souls. It was not to
          enslave them, but ransom them; they had a warfare, but not with carnal
          weapons, but such as were “mighty through God for the pulling down
          strongholds” (2 Cor. x. 4); they used no weapons but the doctrine they
          preached. Others that have not gained conquests by the edge of the
          sword and the stratagems of war, have extended their opinions to
          others by the strength of human reason, and the insinuations of
          eloquence. But the apostles had as little flourish in their tongues,
          as edge upon their swords: their preaching was “not with the enticing
          words of man’s wisdom” (1 Cor. ii. 4); their presence was mean, and
          their discourses without varnish; their doctrine was plain, a
          “crucified Christ;” a doctrine unlaced, ungarnished, untoothsome to
          the world; but they had the demonstration of the Spirit, and a mighty
          power for their companion in the work. The doctrine they preached,
          viz. the death, resurrection and ascension of Christ, are called the
          powers, not of this world, but “of the world to come” (Heb. vi. 5). No
          less than a supernatural power could conduct them in this attempt,
          with such weak methods in human appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Against all the force, power, and wit of the world. The division
          in the eastern empire, and the feeble and consuming state of the
          western, contributed to Mahomet’s success.874 But never was Rome in a
          more flourishing condition: learning, eloquence, wisdom, strength,
          were at the highest pitch. Never was there a more diligent watch
          against any innovations; never was that state governed by more severe
          and suspicious princes, than at the time when Tiberius and Nero held
          the reins. No time seemed to be more unfit for the entrance of a new
          doctrine than that age, wherein it begun to be first published; never
          did any religion meet with that opposition from men. Idolatry hath
          been often settled without any contest; but this hath suffered the
          same fate with the institutor of it, and endured the contradictions of
          sinners against itself: and those that published it, were not only
          without any worldly prop, but exposed themselves to the hatred and
          fury, to the racks and tortures, of the strongest powers on earth. It
          never set foot in any place, but the country was in an uproar (Acts
          xix. 28); swords were drawn to destroy it; laws made to suppress it;
          prisons provided for the professors of it; fires kindled to consume
          them, and executioners had a perpetual employment to stifle the
          progress of it. Rome, in its conquest of countries, changed not the
          religion, rites, and modes of their worship: they altered their civil
          government, but left them to the liberty of their religion, and many
          times joined with them in the worship of their peculiar gods; and
          sometime imitated them at Rome, instead of abolishing them in the
          cities they had subdued. But all their councils were assembled, and
          their force was bandied “against the Lord, and against his Christ;”
          and that city that kindly received all manner of superstitions, hated
          this doctrine with an irreconcileable hatred. It met with reproaches
          from the wise, and fury from the potentates; it was derided by the one
          as the greatest folly, and persecuted by the other as contrary to God
          and mankind; the one were afraid to lose their esteems by the
          doctrine, and the other to lose their authority by a sedition they
          thought a change of religion would introduce. The Romans, that had
          been conquerors of the earth, feared intestine commotions, and the
          falling asunder the links of their empire: scarce any of their first
          emperors, but had their swords dyed red in the blood of the
          Christians. The flesh with all its lusts, the world with all its
          flatteries, the statesmen with all their craft, and the mighty with
          all their strength, joined together to extirpate it: though many
          members were taken off by the fires, yet the church not only lived,
          but flourished, in the furnace. Converts were made by the death of
          martyrs; and the flames which consumed their bodies, were the occasion
          of firing men’s hearts with a zeal for the profession of it. Instead
          of being extinguished, the doctrine shone more bright, and multiplied
          under the sickles that were employed to cut it down. God ordered every
          circumstance so, both in the persons that published it, the means
          whereby, and the time when, that nothing but his power might appear in
          it, without anything to dim and darken it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Divine power was conspicuous in the great success it had under
          all these difficulties. Multitudes were prophesied of to embrace it;
          whence the prophet Isaiah, after the prophecy of the death of Christ
          (Isa. liii.), calls upon the church to enlarge her tents, and
          “lengthen out her cords” to receive those multitudes of children that
          should call her mother (Isa. liv. 2, 3); for she should “break forth
          on the right hand and on the left, and her seed should inherit the
          Gentiles!” the idolaters and persecutors should list their names in
          the muster‑roll of the church. Presently, after the descent of the
          Holy Ghost from heaven upon the apostles, you find the hearts of three
          thousand melted by a plain declaration of this doctrine; who were a
          little before so far from having a favorable thought of it, that some
          of them at least, if not all, had expressed their rage against it, in
          voting for the condemning and crucifying the Author of it (Acts ii.
          41, 42): but in a moment they were so altered, that they breathe out
          affections instead of fury; neither the respect they had to their
          rulers, nor the honor they bore to their priests; not the derisions of
          the people, nor the threatening of punishment, could stop them from
          owning it in the face of multitudes of discouragements. How wonderful
          is it that they should so soon, and by such small means, pay a
          reverence to the servants, who had none for the Master! that they
          should hear them with patience, without the same clamor against them
          as against Christ, “Crucify them, crucify them!” but, that their
          hearts should so suddenly be inflamed with devotion to him dead, whom
          they so much abhorred when living. It had gained footing not in a
          corner of the world, but in the most famous cities; in Jerusalem,
          where Christ had been crucified; in Antioch, where the name of
          Christians first began; in Corinth, a place of ingenious arts; and
          Ephesus, the seat of a noted idol. In less than twenty years, there
          was never a province of the Roman empire, and scarce any part of the
          known world, but was stored with the professors of it. Rome, that was
          the metropolis of the idolatrous world, had multitudes of them
          sprinkled in every corner, whose “faith was spoken of throughout the
          world” (Rom. i. 8). The court of Nero, that monster of mankind, and
          the cruelest and sordidest tyrant that ever breathed, was not empty of
          sincere votaries to it; there were “saints in Cæsar’s house” while
          Paul was under Nero’s chain (Phil. iv.): and it maintained its
          standing, and flourished in spite of all the force of hell, two
          hundred and fifty years before any sovereign prince espoused it. The
          potentates of the earth had conquered the lands of men, and subdued
          their bodies; these vanquished hearts and wills, and brought the most
          beloved thoughts under the yoke of Christ: so much did this doctrine
          overmaster the consciences of its followers, that they rejoiced more
          at their yoke, than others at their liberty; and counted it more a
          glory to die for the honor of it, than to live in the profession of
          it. Thus did our Saviour reign and gather subjects in the midst of his
          enemies; in which respect, in the first discovery of the gospel, he is
          described as “a mighty Conqueror” (Rev. vi. 2), and still conquering
          in the greatness of his strength. How great a testimony of his power
          is it, that from so small a cloud should rise so glorious a sun, that
          should chase before it the darkness and power of hell; triumph over
          the idolatry, superstition, and profaneness of the world! This plain
          doctrine vanquished the obstinacy of the Jews, baffled the
          understanding of the Greeks, humbled the pride of the grandees, threw
          the devil not only out of bodies, but hearts; tore up the foundation
          of his empire, and planted the cross, where the devil had for many
          ages before established his standard. How much more than a human force
          is illustrious in this whole conduct! Nothing in any age of the world
          can parallel it: it being so much against the methods of nature, the
          disposition of the world, and (considering the resistance against it)
          seems to surmount even the works of creation. Never were there, in any
          profession, such multitudes, not of bedlams, but men of sobriety,
          acuteness, and wisdom, that exposed themselves to the fury of the
          flames, and challenged death in the most terrifying shapes for the
          honor of this doctrine. To conclude, this should be often meditated
          upon to form our understandings to a full assent to the gospel, and
          the truth of it; the want of which consideration of power, and the
          customariness of an education in the outward profession of it, is the
          ground of all the profaneness under it, and apostasy from it; the
          disesteem of the truth it declares, and the neglect of the duties it
          enjoins. The more we have a prospect and sense of the impressions of
          Divine power in it, the more we shall have a reverence of the Divine
          precepts.

          III. The third thing is, the power of God appears in the application
          of redemption, as well as in the Person redeeming, and the publication
          and propagation of the doctrine of redemption: 1. In the planting
          grace. 2. In the pardon of sin. 3. In the preserving grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, In the planting grace. There is no expression which the Spirit
          of God hath thought fit in Scripture to resemble this work to, but
          argues the exerting of a Divine power for the effecting of it. When it
          is expressed by light, it is as much as the power of God in the
          creating the sun; when by regeneration, it is as much as the power of
          God in forming an infant, and fashioning all the parts of a man; when
          it is called resurrection, it is as much as the rearing of a body
          again out of putrified matter; when it is called creation, it is as
          much as erecting a comely world out of mere nothing, or an inform and
          uncomely mass. As we could not contrive the death of Christ for our
          redemption, so we cannot form our souls to the acceptation of it; the
          infinite efficacy of grace is as necessary for the one, as the
          infinite wisdom of God was for laying the platform of the other. It is
          by his power we have whatsoever pertains to godliness as well as life
          (2 Pet. i. 3); he puts his fingers upon the handle of the lock, and
          turns the heart to what point he pleases; the action whereby he
          performs this, is expressed by a word of force; “He hath snatched us
          from the power of darkness:”875 the action whereby it is performed
          manifests it. In reference to this power, it is called creation, which
          is a production from nothing; and conversion is a production from
          something more incapable of that state, than mere nothing is of being.
          There is greater distance between the terms of sin and righteousness,
          corruption and grace, than between the terms of nothing and being; the
          greater the distance is, the more power is required to the producing
          any thing. As in miracles, the miracle is the greater, where the
          change is the greater; and the change is the greater, where the
          distance is the greater. As it was a more signal mark of power to
          change a dead man to life, than to change a sick man to health; so
          that the change here being from a term of a greater distance, is more
          powerful than the creation of heaven and earth. Therefore, whereas
          creation is said to be wrought by his hands, and the heavens by his
          fingers, or his word; conversion is said to be wrought by his arm
          (Isa. liii. 1). In creation, we had an earthly; by conversion, a
          heavenly state: in creation, nothing is changed into something; in
          conversion, hell is transformed into heaven, which is more than the
          turning nothing into a glorious angel. In that thanksgiving of our
          Saviour, for the revelation of the knowledge of himself to babes, the
          simple of the world, he gives the title to his Father, of “Lord of
          heaven and earth” (Matt. xi. 5); intimating it to be an act of his
          creative and preserving power; that power whereby he formed heaven and
          earth, hath preserved the standing, and governed the motions of all
          creatures from the beginning of the world. It is resembled to the most
          magnificent act of divine power that God ever put forth, viz. that “in
          the resurrection of our Saviour” (Eph. i. 19); wherein there was more
          than an ordinary impression of might. It is not so small a power as
          that whereby we speak with tongues, or whereby Christ opened the
          mouths of the dumb, and the ears of the deaf, or unloosed the cords of
          death from a person. It is not that power whereby our Saviour wrought
          those stupendous miracles when he was in the world: but that power
          which wrought a miracle that amazed the most knowing angels, as well
          as ignorant man; the taking off the weight of the sin of the world
          from our Saviour, and advancing him in his human nature to rule over
          the angelic host, making him head of principalities and powers; as
          much as to say, as great as all that power which is displayed in our
          redemption, from the first foundation to the last line in the
          superstructure. It is, therefore, often set forth with an emphasis, as
          “Excellency of power” (2 Cor. iv. 7), and “Glorious power” (2 Pet. i.
          3): “to glory and virtue,” we translate it, but it is διὰ δόξης,
          through glory and virtue, that is, by a glorious virtue or strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instrument whereby it is wrought, is dignified with the title of
          power. The gospel which God useth in this great affair is called “The
          power of God to salvation” (Rom. i. 16), and the “Rod of his strength”
          (Ps. cx. 2); and the day of the gospel’s appearance in the heart is
          emphatically called, “The day of power” (ver. 3); wherein he brings
          down strong‑holds and towering imaginations. And, therefore, the angel
          Gabriel, which name signifies the power of God, was always sent upon
          those messages which concerned the gospel, as to Daniel, Zacharias,
          Mary.876 The gospel is the power of God in a way of instrumentality,
          but the almightiness of God is the principal in a way of efficiency.
          The gospel is the sceptre of Christ; but the power of Christ is the
          mover of that sceptre. The gospel is not as a bare word spoken, and
          proposing the thing; but as backed with a higher efficacy of grace; as
          the sword doth instrumentally cut, but the arm that wields it gives
          the blow, and makes it successful in the stroke. But this gospel is
          the power of God, because he edgeth this by his own power, to surmount
          all resistance, and vanquish the greatest malice of that man he
          designs to work upon. The power of God is conspicuous,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In turning the heart of man against the strength of the
          inclinations of nature. In the forming of man of the dust of the
          ground; as the matter contributed nothing to the action whereby God
          formed it, so it had no principle of resistance contrary to the design
          of God; but in converting the heart, there is not only wanting a
          principle of assistance from him in this work, but the whole strength
          of corrupt nature is alarmed to combat against the power of his grace.
          When the gospel is presented, the understanding is not only ignorant
          of it, but the will perverse against it; the one doth not relish, and
          the other doth not esteem, the excellency of the object. The carnal
          wisdom in the mind contrives against it, and the rebellious will puts
          the orders in execution against the counsel of God, which requires the
          invincible power of God to enlighten the dark mind, to know what it
          slights; and the fierce will, to embrace what it loathes. The stream
          of nature cannot be turned, but by a power above nature; it is not all
          the created power in heaven and earth can change a swine into a man,
          or a venomous toad into an holy and illustrious angel. Yet this work
          is not so great, in some respect, as the stilling the fierceness of
          nature, the silencing the swelling waves in the heart, and the casting
          out those brutish affections which are born and grow up with us. There
          would be no, or far less, resistance in a mere animal, to be changed
          into a creature of a higher rank, than there is in a natural man to be
          turned into a serious Christian. There is in every natural man a
          stoutness of heart, a stiff neck, unwillingness to good, forwardness
          to evil; Infinite Power quells this stoutness, demolisheth these
          strongholds, turns this wild ass in her course, and routs those armies
          of turbulent nature against the grace of God. To stop the floods of
          the sea is not such an act of power, as to turn the tide of the heart.
          This power hath been employed upon every convert in the world; what
          would you say, then, if you knew all the channels in which it hath run
          since the days of Adam? If the alteration of one rocky heart into a
          pool of water be a wonder of power, what then is the calming and
          sweetening by his word those 144,000 of the tribes of Israel, and that
          numberless multitude of all nations and people that shall stand
          “before the throne” (Rev. vii. 9), which were all naturally so many
          raging seas? Not one converted soul from Adam to the last that shall
          be in the end of the world, but is a trophy of the Divine conquest.
          None were pure volunteers, nor listed themselves in his service, till
          he put forth his strong arm to draw them to him. No man’s
          understanding, but was chained with darkness, and fond of it; no man
          but had corruption in his will, which was dearer to him than anything
          else which could be proposed for his true happiness. These things are
          most evident in Scripture and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As it is wrought against the inclinations of nature, so against a
          multitude of corrupt habits rooted in the souls of men. A distemper in
          its first invasion may more easily be cured, than when it becomes
          chronical and inveterate. The strength of a disease, or the
          complication of many, magnifies the power of the physician, and
          efficacy of the medicine that tames and expels it. What power is that
          which hath made men stoop, when natural habits have been grown giants
          by custom; when the putrefaction of nature hath engendered a multitude
          of worms; when the ulcers are many and deplorable; when many cords,
          wherewith God would have bound the sinner, have been broken, and (like
          Sampson) the wicked heart hath gloried in its strength, and grown more
          proud, that it hath stood like a strong fort against those batteries,
          under which others have fallen flat; every proud thought, every evil
          habit captivated, serves for matter of triumph to the “power of God”
          (2 Cor. x. 5). What resistance will a multitude of them make, when one
          of them is enough to hold the faculty under its dominion, and
          intercept its operations? So many customary habits, so many old
          natures, so many different strengths added to nature, every one of
          them standing as a barricado against the way of grace; all the errors
          the understanding is possessed with, think the gospel folly; all the
          vices the will is filled with, count it the fetter and band. Nothing
          so contrary to man, as to be thought a fool; nothing so contrary to
          man, as to enter into slavery. It is no easy matter to plant the cross
          of Christ upon a heart guided by many principles against the truth of
          it, and biased by a world of wickedness against the holiness of it.
          Nature renders a man too feeble and indisposed, and custom renders a
          man more weak and unwilling to change his hue (Jer. xiii. 23). To
          dispossess man then of his self‑esteem and self‑excellency; to make
          room for God in the heart, where there was none but for sin, as dear
          to him as himself; to hurl down the pride of nature; to make stout
          imaginations stoop to the cross; to make desires of self‑advancement
          sink into a zeal for the glorifying of God, and an overruling design
          for his honor, is not to be ascribed to any but an outstretched arm
          wielding the sword of the Spirit. To have a heart full of the fear of
          God, that was just before filled with a contempt of him; to have a
          sense of his power, an eye to his glory, admiring thoughts of his
          wisdom, a faith in his truth, that had lower thoughts of him and all
          his perfections, than he had of a creature; to have a hatred of his
          habitual lusts, that had brought him in much sensitive pleasure; to
          loath them as much as he loved them; to cherish the duties he hated;
          to live by faith in, and obedience to, the Redeemer, who was before so
          heartily under the conduct of Satan and self; to chase the acts of sin
          from his members, and the pleasing thoughts of sin from his mind; to
          make a stout wretch willingly fall down, crawl upon the ground, and
          adore that Saviour whom before he out‑dared, is a triumphant act of
          Infinite Power that can subdue all things to itself, and break those
          multitudes of locks and bolts that were upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Against a multitude of temptations and interests. The temptations
          rich men have in this world are so numerous and strong, that the
          entrance of one of them into the kingdom of heaven, that is, the
          entertainment of the gospel, is made by our Saviour an impossible
          thing with men, and procurable only by the power of God (Luke xviii.
          24‒26). The Divine strength only can separate the world from the
          heart, and the heart from the world. There must be an incomprehensible
          power to chase away the devil, that had so long, so strong a footing
          in the affections; to render the soil he had sown with so many tares
          and weeds, capable of good grain; to make spirits, that had found the
          sweetness of worldly prosperity, wrapt up all their happiness in it,
          and not only bent down, but—as it were—buried in earth and mud, to be
          loosened from those beloved cords, to disrelish the earth for a
          crucified Christ; I say, this must be the effect of an almighty power.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The manner of conversion shews no less the power of God. There is
          not only an irresistible force used in it, but an agreeable sweetness.
          The power is so efficacious, that nothing can vanquish it; and so
          sweet, that none did ever complain of it. The Almighty virtue displays
          itself invincibly, yet without constraint; compelling the will without
          offering violence to it, and making it cease to be will: not forcing
          it, but changing it: not dragging it, but drawing it; making it will
          where before it nilled; removing the corrupt nature of the will,
          without invading the created nature and rights of the faculty; not
          working in us against the physical nature of the will, but working it
          “to will” (Phil. ii. 13). This work is therefore called creation,
          resurrection, to shew its irresistible power; it is called
          illumination, persuasion, drawing, to shew the suitableness of its
          efficacy to the nature of the human faculties: it is a drawing with
          cords, which testifies an invincible strength; but, with cords of
          love, which testifies a delightful conquest. It is hard to determine
          whether it be more powerful than sweet, or more sweet than powerful.
          It is no mean part of the power of God to twist together victory and
          pleasure; to give a blow as delightful as strong, as pleasing to the
          sufferer, as it is sharp to the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, The power of God, in the application of redemption, is
          evident in the pardoning a sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the pardon itself. The power of God is made the ground of his
          patience; or the reason why he is patient, is, because he would “shew
          his power” (Rom. ix. 22). It is a part of magnanimity to pass by
          injuries: as weaker stomachs cannot concoct the tougher food, so weak
          minds cannot digest the harder injuries: he that passes over a wrong
          is superior to his adversary that does it. When God speaks of his own
          name as merciful, he speaks first of himself as powerful (Exod. xxxiv.
          6), “The Lord, The Lord God,” that is, The Lord, the strong Lord,
          Jehovah, the strong Jehovah. Let the power of my Lord be great, saith
          Moses, when he prays for the forgiveness of the people:877 the word
          jigdal is written with a great jod, or a jod above the other letters.
          The power of God in pardoning is advanced beyond an ordinary strain,
          beyond the creative strength. In the creation, he had power over the
          creatures; in this, power over himself: in creation, not himself, but
          the creatures were the object of his power; in that, no attribute of
          his nature could article against his design. In the pardon of a
          sinner, after many overtures made to him and refused by him, God
          exerciseth a power over himself; for the sinner hath dishonored God,
          provoked his justice, abused his goodness, done injury to all those
          attributes which are necessary to his relief: it was not so in
          creation, nothing was incapable of disobliging God from bringing it
          into being. The dust, which was the matter of Adam’s body, needed only
          the extrinsic power of God to form it into a man, and inspire it with
          a living soul: it had not rendered itself obnoxious to Divine justice,
          nor was capable to excite any disputes between his perfections. But
          after the entrance of sin, and the merit of death, thereby there was a
          resistance in justice to the free remission of man: God was to
          exercise a power over himself, to answer his justice, and pardon the
          sinner; as well as a power over the creature, to reduce the run away
          and rebel. Unless we have recourse to the infiniteness of God’s power,
          the infiniteness of our guilt will weigh us down: we must consider not
          only that we have a mighty guilt to press us, but a mighty God to
          relieve us. In the same act of his being our righteousness, he is our
          strength: “In the Lord have I righteousness and strength” (Isa. xlv.
          24).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the sense of pardon. When the soul hath been wounded with the
          sense of sin, and its iniquities have stared it in the face, the
          raising the soul from a despairing condition, and lifting it above
          those waters which terrified it, to cast the light of comfort, as well
          as the light of grace, into a heart covered with more than an Egyptian
          darkness, is an act of his infinite and creating power (Isa. lvii.
          19); “I create the fruit of the lips; Peace.” Men may wear out their
          lips with numbering up the promises of grace and arguments of peace,
          but all will signify no more, without a creative power, than if all
          men and angels should call to that white upon the wall to shine as
          splendidly as the sun. God only can create Jerusalem, and every child
          of Jerusalem a rejoicing (Isa. xlv. 18). A man is no more able to
          apply to himself any word of comfort, under the sense of sin, than he
          is able to convert himself, and turn the proposals of the word into
          gracious affections in his heart. To restore the joy of salvation, is,
          in David’s judgment, an act of sovereign power, equal to that of
          creating a clean heart (Ps. li. 10, 12). Alas! it is a state like to
          that of death; as infinite power can only raise from natural death, so
          from a spiritual death; also from a comfortless death: “In his favor
          there is life;” in the want of his favor there is death. The power of
          God hath so placed light in the sun, that all creatures in the world,
          all the torches upon earth, kindled together, cannot make it day, if
          that doth not rise; so all the angels in heaven, and men upon earth,
          are not competent chirurgeons for a wounded spirit. The cure of our
          spiritual ulcers, and the pouring in balm, is an act of sovereign
          creative power: it is more visible in silencing a tempestuous
          conscience than the power of our Saviour was in the stilling the
          stormy winds and the roaring waves. As none but infinite power can
          remove the guilt of sin, so none but infinite power can remove the
          despairing sense of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, This power is evident in the preserving grace. As the
          providence of God is a manifestation of his power in a continued
          creation, so the preservation of grace is a manifestation of his power
          in a continued regeneration. To keep a nation under the yoke, is an
          act of the same power that subdued it. It is this that strengthens men
          in suffering against the fury of hell (Col. i. 13); it is this that
          keeps them from falling against the force of hell—the Father’s hand
          (John x. 29). His strength abates and moderates the violence of
          temptations; his staff sustains his people under them; his might
          defeats the power of Satan, and bruiseth him under a believer’s feet.
          The counter‑workings of indwelling corruption, the reluctances of the
          flesh against the breathings of the spirit, the fallacy of the senses,
          and the rovings of the mind, have ability quickly to stifle and
          extinguish grace, if it were not maintained by that powerful blast
          that first imbreathed it. No less power is seen in perfecting it, than
          was in planting it (2 Pet. i. 3); no less in fulfilling the work of
          faith, than in engrafting the word of faith (2 Thess. i. 11). The
          apostle well understood the necessity and efficacy of it in the
          preservation of faith, as well as in the first infusion, when he
          expresses himself in those terms of a greatness or hyperbole of power,
          “His mighty power,” or the power of his might (Eph. i. 19). The
          salvation he bestows, and the strength whereby he effects it, are
          joined together in the prophet’s song (Isa. xii. 2): “The Lord is my
          strength and my salvation.” And indeed, God doth more magnify his
          power in continuing a believer in the world, a weak and half‑rigged
          vessel, in the midst of so many sands whereon it might split, so many
          rocks whereon it might dash, so many corruptions within, and so many
          temptations without, than if he did immediately transport him into
          heaven, and clothe him with a perfect sanctified nature.—To conclude,
          what is there, then, in the world which is destitute of notices of
          Divine power? Every creature affords us the lesson; all acts of Divine
          government are the marks of it. Look into the word, and the manner of
          its propagation instructs us in it; your changed natures, your
          pardoned guilt, your shining comfort, your quelled corruptions, the
          standing of your staggering graces, are sufficient to preserve a
          sense, and to prevent a forgetfulness, of this great attribute, so
          necessary for your support, and conducing so much to your comfort.

          Instruct. 1. If incomprehensible and infinite power belongs to the
          nature of God, then Jesus Christ hath a divine nature, because the
          acts of power proper to God are ascribed to him. This perfection of
          omnipotence doth unquestionably pertain to the Deity, and is an
          incommunicable property, and the same with the essence of God: he,
          therefore, to whom this attribute is ascribed, is essentially God.
          This is challenged by Christ, in conjunction with eternity (Rev. i.
          8); “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
          Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”
          This the Lord Christ speaks of himself. He who was equal with God,
          proclaims himself by the essential title of the Godhead, part of which
          he repeats again (ver. 11), and this is the person which “walks in the
          midst of the seven golden candlesticks,” the person that “was dead and
          now lives” (ver. 17, 18), which cannot possibly be meant of the
          Father, the First Person, who can never come under the denomination of
          having been dead. Being, therefore, adorned with the same title, he
          hath the same Deity; and though his omnipotence be only positively
          asserted (ver. 8), yet, his eternity being asserted (ver. 11, 17), it
          inferreth his immense power; for he that is eternal, without limits of
          time, must needs be conceived powerful, without any dash of infirmity.
          Again, when he is said to be a child born, and a son given, in the
          same breath he is called the Mighty God (Isa. ix. 6). It is introduced
          as a ground of comfort to the church, to preserve their hopes in the
          accomplishment of the promises made to them before. They should not
          imagine him to have only the infirmity of a man, though he was veiled
          in the appearance of a man. No, they should look through the disguise
          of his flesh, to the might of his Godhead. The attribute of mighty is
          added to the title of God, because the consideration of power is most
          capable to sustain the drooping church in such a condition, and to
          prop up her hopes. It is upon this account he saith of himself,
          “Whatsoever things the Father doth, those also doth the Son likewise”
          (John v. 19). In the creation of heaven, earth, sea, and the
          preservation of all creatures, the Son works with the same will,
          wisdom, virtue, power, as the Father works: not as two may concur in
          an action in a different manner, as an agent and an instrument, a
          carpenter and his tools, but in the same manner of operation, ὁμοίως,
          which we translate likeness, which doth not express so well the
          emphasis of the word. There is no diversity of action between us; what
          the Father doth, that I do by the same power, with the same easiness
          in every respect; there is the same creative, productive, conservative
          power in both of us; and that not in one work that is done, ad extra,
          but in all, in whatsoever the Father doth. In the same manner, not by
          a delegated, but natural and essential power, by one undivided
          operation and manner of working.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The creation, which is a work of Omnipotence, is more than once
          ascribed to him. This he doth own himself; the creation of the earth,
          and of man upon it; the stretching out the heavens by his hands, and
          the forming of “all the hosts of them by his command” (Isa. xlv. 12).
          He is not only the Creator of Israel, the church (ver. 12), but of the
          whole world, and every creature on the face of the earth, and in the
          glories of the heavens; which is repeated also ver. 18, where, in this
          act of creation, he is called God himself, and speaks of himself in
          the term Jehovah; and swears by himself (ver. 23). What doth he swear?
          “That unto me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear.” Is
          this Christ? Yes, if the apostle may be believed, who applies it to
          him (Rom. xiv. 11) to prove the appearance of all men before the
          judgment‑seat of Christ, whom the prophet calls (ver. 15) “a God that
          hides himself;” and so he was a hidden God when obscured in our
          fleshly infirmities. He was in conjunction with the Father when the
          sea received his decree, and the foundations of the earth were
          appointed; not as a spectator, but as an artificer, for so the word in
          Prov. viii. 30, signifies, “as one brought up with him;” it signifies
          also, “a cunning workman” (Cant. vii. 1). He was the east, or the sun,
          from whence sprang all the light of life and being to the creature; so
          the word קדם (ver. 22), which is translated, “before his works of
          old,” is rendered by some, and signifies the east as well as before:
          but if it notes only his existence before, it is enough to prove his
          Deity. The Scripture doth not only allow him an existence before the
          world, but exalts him as the cause of the world: a thing may precede
          another that is not the cause of that which follows; a precedency in
          age doth not entitle one brother, or thing, the cause of another: but
          our Saviour is not only ancienter than the world, but is the Creator
          of the world (Heb. i. 10, 11). “Who laid the foundations of the earth,
          and the heavens are the work of his hands.” So great an eulogy cannot
          be given to one destitute of omnipotence; since the distance between
          being and not being is so vast a gulf that cannot be surmounted and
          stepped over, but by an Infinite Power: he is the first and the last,
          that called the “generations from the beginning” (Isa. xli. 4), and
          had an almighty voice to call them out of nothing. In which regard he
          is called the “everlasting Father” (Isa. ix. 6), as being the
          efficient of creation; as God is called the Father of the rain, or as
          father is taken for the inventor of an art; as Jubal, the first framer
          and inventor of music, is called “the father of such as handle the
          harp” (Gen. iv. 21). And that Person is said to “make the sea, and
          form the dry land by his hands” (Ps. xcv. 5, 6) against whom we are
          exhorted not to harden our hearts, which is applied to Christ by the
          apostle (Heb. iii. 8); in ver. 6, he is called “a great King,” and “a
          great God our Maker.” The places wherein the creation is attributed to
          Christ, those that are the antagonists of his Deity, would evade by
          understanding them of the new, or evangelical, not of the first, old
          material creation: but what appearance is there for such a sense?
          Consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) That of Heb. i. 10, 11, it is spoken of that earth and heavens
          which were in the beginning of time; it is that earth shall perish,
          that heaven that shall be folded up, that creation that shall grow old
          towards a decay; that is, only the visible and material creation: the
          spiritual shall endure forever; it grows not old to decay, but grows
          up to a perfection; it sprouts up to its happiness, not to its
          detriment. The same Person creates that shall destroy, and the same
          world is created by him that shall be destroyed by him, as well as it
          subsisted by virtue of his omnipotency.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Can that also (Heb. i. 2), “By whom also he made the worlds,”
          speaking of Christ, bear the same plea? It was the same Person by whom
          “God spake to us in these last times,” the same Person which he hath
          constituted “Heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds:” and
          the particle also, intimates it to be a distinct act from his speaking
          or prophetical office, whereby he restored and new created the world,
          as well as the rightful foundation God had to make him “Heir of all
          things.” It refers likewise, not to the time of Christ’s speaking upon
          earth, but to something past, and something different from the
          publication of the gospel: it is not “doth make,” which had been more
          likely if the apostle had meant only the new creation; but “hath
          made,”878 referring to time long since past, something done before his
          appearance upon earth as a Prophet: “By whom also he made the worlds,”
          or ages, all things subjected to, or measured by time; which must be
          meant according to the Jewish phrase of this material visible world:
          so they entitle God in their Liturgy, the “Lord of Ages,” that is, the
          Lord of the world, and all ages and revolutions of the world, from the
          creation to the last period of time. If anything were in being before
          this frame of heaven and earth, and within the compass of time, it
          received being and duration from the Son of God. The apostle would
          give an argument to prove the equity of making him Heir of all things
          as Mediator, because he was the framer of all things as God. He may
          well be the Heir or Lord of angels as well as men, who created angels
          as well as men: all things were justly under his power as Mediator,
          since they derived their existence from him as Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) But what evasion can there be for that (Col. i. 16)? “By him were
          all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, whether
          they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all
          things were created by him and for him.” He is said to be the Creator
          of material and visible things, as well as spiritual and invisible; of
          things in heaven, which needed no restoration, as well as things on
          earth, which were polluted by sin, and stood in need of a new
          creation. How could the angels belong to the new creation, who had
          never put off the honor and purity of the first? Since they never
          divested themselves of their original integrity, they could not be
          reinvested with that which they never lost. Besides, suppose the holy
          angels be one way or other reduced as parts of the new creation, as
          being under the mediatory government of our Saviour, as their Head,
          and in regard of their confirmation by him in that happy state. In
          what manner shall the devils be ranked among new creatures? They are
          called principalities and powers as well as the angels, and may come
          under the title of things invisible: that they are called
          principalities and powers is plain (Eph. vi. 12): “For we wrestle not
          against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and
          the rulers of the darkness of this world; against spiritual wickedness
          in high places.” Good angels are not there meant, for what war have
          believers with them, or they with believers? They are the guardians of
          them, since Christ hath taken away the enmity between our Lord and
          theirs, in whose quarrel they were engaged against us: and since the
          apostle, speaking of “all things created by him,” expresseth it so,
          that it cannot be conceived he should except anything; how come the
          finally impenitent and unbelievers, which are things in earth, and
          visible, to be listed here in the roll of new creatures? None of these
          can be called new creatures, because they are subjected to the
          government of Christ; no more than the earth and sea, and the animals
          in it, are made new creatures, because they are all under the dominion
          of Christ and his providential government. Again, the apostle
          manifestly makes the creation he here speaks of, to be the material,
          and not the new creation; for that he speaks of afterwards as a
          distinct act of our Lord Jesus, under the title of Reconciliation
          (Col. i. 20, 21), which was the restoration of the world, and the
          satisfying for that curse that lay upon it. His intent is here to show
          that not an angel in heaven, nor a creature upon earth, but was placed
          in their several degrees of excellency by the power of the Son of God,
          who, after that act of creation, and the entrance of sin, was the
          “reconciler” of the world through the blood of his cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) There is another place as clear (John i. 3): “All things were
          made by him, and without him was nothing made that was made.” The
          creation is here ascribed to him; affirmatively, “All things were made
          by him;” negatively, there was nothing made without him: and the words
          are emphatical, οὐδὲ ἕν, not one thing; excepting nothing; including
          invisible things, as well as things conspicuous to sense only,
          mentioned in the story of the creation (Gen. i.); not only the entire
          mass, but the distinct parcels, the smallest worm and the highest
          angel, owe their original to him. And if not one thing, then the
          matter was not created to his hands; and his work consisted not only
          in the forming things from that matter: if that one thing of matter
          were excepted, a chief thing were excepted; if not one thing were
          excepted, then he created something of nothing, because spirits, as
          angels and souls, are not made of any pre‑existing or fore‑created
          matter. How could the evangelist phrase it more extensively and
          comprehensively? This is a character of Omnipotency; to create the
          world, and everything in it, of nothing, requires an infinite virtue
          and power. If all things were created by Him, they were not created by
          him as man, because himself, as man, was not in being before the
          creation; if all things were made by him, then himself was not made,
          himself was not created; and to be existent without being made,
          without being created, is to be unboundedly omnipotent. And if we
          understand it of the new creation, as they do that will not allow him
          an existence in his Deity before his humanity, it cannot be true of
          that; for how could he regenerate Abraham, make Simeon and Anna new
          creatures, who “waited for the salvation of Israel,” and form John
          Baptist, and fill him with the Holy Ghost, even from the womb (Luke i.
          15), who belonged to the new creation, and was to prepare the way, if
          Christ had not a being before him? The evangelist alludes to, and
          explains the history of the creation, in the beginning, and acquaints
          us what was meant by God, said so often, viz. the eternal Word, and
          describes him in his creative power, manifested in the framing the
          world, before he describes him in his incarnation, when he came to lay
          the foundation of the restoration of the world (John i. 14), “The Word
          was made flesh;” this Word who was “with God, who was God, who made
          all things,” and gave being to the most glorious angels and the
          meanest creature without exception; this Word, in time, “was made
          flesh.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) The creation of things mentioned in these Scriptures cannot be
          attributed to him as an instrument. As if when it is said, “God
          created all things by him, and by him made the worlds,” we were to
          understand the Father to be the agent, and the Son to be a tool in his
          Father’s hand, as an axe in the hand of a carpenter, or a file in the
          hand of a smith, or a servant acting by command as the organ of his
          master. The preposition per, or διά, doth not always signify an
          instrumental cause: when it is said, that the apostle gave the
          Thessalonians a command “by Jesus Christ” (1 Thess. iv. 2), was Christ
          the instrument, and not the Lord of that command the apostle gave? The
          immediate operation of Christ dwelling in the apostles, was that
          whereby they gave the commands to their disciples. When we are called
          “by God” (1 Cor. i. 9), is he the instrumental, or principal cause of
          our effectual vocation? And can the will of God be the instrument of
          putting Paul into the apostleship, or the sovereign cause of investing
          him with that dignity, when he calls himself an “Apostle by the will
          of God” (Eph. i. 3)? And when all things are said to be through God,
          as well as of him, must he be counted the instrumental cause of his
          own creation, counsels, and judgments (Rom. xi. 36)? When we “mortify
          the deeds of the body through the Spirit” (Rom. viii. 13), or keep the
          “treasure of the word by the Holy Ghost” (2 Tim. i. 14), is the Holy
          Ghost of no more dignity in such acts than an instrument? Nor doth the
          gaining a thing by a person make him a mere instrument or inferior; as
          when a man gains his right in a way of justice against his adversary
          by the magistrate, is the judge inferior to the suppliant? If the Word
          were an instrument in creation, it must be a created or uncreated
          instrument: if created, it could not be true what the Evangelist
          saith, that “all things were made by him,” since himself, the
          principal thing, could not be made by himself: if uncreated, he was
          God, and so acted by a Divine omnipotency, which surmounts an
          instrumental cause. But, indeed, an instrument is impossible in
          creation, since it is wrought only by an act of the Divine will. Do we
          need any organ to an act of volition? The efficacious will of the
          Creator is the cause of the original of the body of the world, with
          its particular members and exact harmony. It was formed “by a word,
          and established by a command” (Ps. xxxiii. 9); the beauty of the
          creation stood up at the precept of his will. Nor was the Son a
          partial cause; as when many are said to build a house, one works one
          part, and another frames another part: God created all things by the
          immediate operation of the Son, in the unity of essence, goodness,
          power, wisdom; not an extrinsic, but a connatural instrument. As the
          sun doth illustrate all things by his light, and quickens all things
          by his heat, so God created the worlds by Christ, as he was the
          “brightness or splendor of his glory, the exact image of his person;”
          which follows the declaration of his making the worlds by him (Heb. i.
          3, 4), to show, that he acted not as an instrument, but one in
          essential conjunction with him, as light and brightness with the sun.
          But suppose he did make the world as a kind of instrument, he was then
          before the world, not bounded by time; and eternity cannot well be
          conceived belonging to a Being without omnipotency. He is the End, as
          well as the Author, of the creatures (Col. i. 16); not only the
          principle which gave them being, but the sea, into whose glory they
          run and dissolve themselves, which consists not with the meanness of
          an instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. As creation, so preservation, is ascribed to Him (Col. i. 17). “By
          him all things consist.” As he preceded all things in his eternity, so
          he establishes all things by his omnipotency, and fixes them in their
          several centres, that they sink not into that nothing from whence he
          fetched them. By him they flourish in their several beings, and
          observe the laws and orders he first appointed: that power of his
          which extracted them from insensible nothing, upholds them in their
          several beings with the same facility as he spake being into them,
          even “by the word of his power” (Heb. i. 3), and by one creative
          continued voice, called all generations, from the beginning to the
          period of the world (Isa. xli. 4), and causes them to flourish in
          their several seasons. It is “by him kings reign, and princes decree
          justice,” and all things are confined within the limits of government.
          All which are acts of an Infinite Power.

          3d. Resurrection is also ascribed to Him. The body crumbled to dust,
          and that dust blown to several quarters of the world, cannot be
          gathered in its distinct parts, and new formed for the entertainment
          of the soul, without the strength of an infinite arm. This he will do,
          and more; change the vileness of an earthly body into the glory of an
          heavenly one; a dusty flesh into a spiritual body, which is an
          argument of a power invincible, to which all things cannot but stoop;
          for it is by such an operation, which testifies an ability “to subdue
          all things to himself” (Phil. iii. 21), especially when he works it
          with the same ease as he did the creation, by the power of his voice.
          (John v. 28), “All that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and
          shall come forth:” speaking them into a restored life from insensible
          dust, as he did into being from an empty nothing. The greatest acts of
          power are owned to belong to creation, preservation, resurrection.
          Omnipotence, therefore, is his right; and, therefore, a Deity cannot
          be denied to him that inherits a perfection essential to none but God,
          and impossible to be entrusted in, or managed by the hands of any
          creatures. And this is no mean comfort to those that believe in him:
          he is, in regard of his power, “the horn of salvation;” so Zacharias
          sings of him (Luke i. 69). Nor could there be any more mighty found
          out upon whom God could have “laid our help” (Ps. lxxxix. 19). No
          reason, therefore, to doubt his ability to save to the utmost, who
          hath the power of creation, preservation, and resurrection in his
          hands. His promises must be accomplished, since nothing can resist
          him: he hath power to fulfil his word, and bring all things to a final
          issue, because he is Almighty: by his outstretched arm in the
          deliverance of his Israel from Egypt, (for it was his arm, 1 Cor. x.)
          he showed that he was able to deliver us from spiritual Egypt. The
          charge of Mediator to expiate sin, vanquish hell, form a church,
          conduct and perfect it, are not to be effected by a person of less
          ability than infinite. Let this almightiness of His be the bottom,
          wherein to cast and fix the anchor of our hopes.

          Instruct. 2. Hence may be inferred the Deity of the Holy Ghost. Works
          of omnipotency are ascribed to the Spirit of God: by the motion of the
          wings of this Spirit, as a bird over her eggs, was that rude and
          unshapen mass hatched into a comely world.879 The stars,—or perhaps
          the angels, are meant by the “garnishing of the heavens” in the verse
          before the text,—were brought forth in their comeliness and dignity,
          as the ornaments of the upper world, by this Spirit; “By his Spirit he
          hath garnished the heavens.” To this Spirit Job ascribes the formation
          both of the body and soul, under the title of Almighty (Job xxxiii.
          4), “The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
          hath given me life.” Resurrection, another work of omnipotency, is
          attributed to him (Rom. viii. 11). The conception of our Saviour in
          the womb; the miracles that he wrought, were by the power of the
          Spirit in him. Power is a title belonging to him, and sometimes both
          are put together (1 Thess. i. 5, and other places). And that great
          power of changing the heart, and sanctifying a polluted nature, a work
          greater than creation, is frequently acknowledged in the Scripture to
          be the peculiar act of the Holy Ghost. The Father, Son, Spirit, are
          one principle in creation, resurrection, and all the works of
          omnipotence.

          Instruct. 3. Inference from the doctrine. The blessedness of God is
          hence evidenced. If God be Almighty, he can want nothing; all want
          speaks weakness. If he doth what he will, he cannot be miserable; all
          misery consists in those things which happen contrary to our will.
          There is nothing can hinder his happiness, because nothing can resist
          his power. Since he is omnipotent, nothing can hurt him, nothing can
          strip him of what he hath, of what he is.880 If he can do whatsoever
          he will, he cannot want anything that he wills. He is as happy, as
          great, as glorious, as he will; for he hath a perfect liberty of will
          to will, and a perfect power to attain what he will; his will cannot
          be restrained, nor his power meted. It would be a defect in
          blessedness, to will what he were not able to do: sorrow is the result
          of a want of power, with a presence of will. If he could will anything
          which he could not effect, he would be miserable, and no longer God:
          he can do whatsoever he pleases, and therefore can want nothing that
          pleases him.881 He cannot be happy, the original of whose happiness is
          not in himself: nothing can be infinitely happy, that is limited and
          bounded.

          Instruct. 4. Hence is the ground for the immutability of God. As he is
          incapable of changing his resolves, because of his infinite wisdom, so
          he is incapable of being forced to any change, because of his infinite
          power. Being almighty, he can be no more changed from power to
          weakness; than, being all‑wise, he can be changed from wisdom to
          folly; or, being omniscient, from knowledge to ignorance. He cannot be
          altered in his purposes, because of his wisdom; nor in the manner and
          method of his actions, because of his infinite strength. Men, indeed,
          when their designs are laid deepest, and their purposes stand firmest,
          yet are forced to stand still, or change the manner of the execution
          of their resolves, by reason of some outward accidents that obstruct
          them in their course; for, having not wisdom to foresee future
          hindrances, they have not power to prevent them, or strength to remove
          them, when they unexpectedly interpose themselves between their desire
          and performance; but no created power has strength enough to be a bar
          against God. By the same act of his will that he resolves a thing, he
          can puff away any impediments that seem to rise up against him. He
          that wants no means to effect his purposes, cannot be checked by
          anything that riseth up to stand in his way; heaven, earth, sea, the
          deepest places, are too weak to resist his will (Ps. cxxxv. 6). The
          purity of the angels will not, and the devil’s malice cannot,
          frustrate his will; the one voluntarily obeys the beck of his hand,
          and the other is vanquished by the power of it. What can make him
          change his purposes; who (if he please) can dash the earth against the
          heavens in the twinkling of an eye, untying the world from its centre,
          clap the stars and elements together into one mass, and blow the whole
          creation of men and devils into nothing? Because he is almighty,
          therefore he is immutable.

          Instruct. 5. Hence is inferred the providence of God, and his
          government of the world. His power, as well as his wisdom, gives him a
          right to govern: nothing can equal him, therefore nothing can share
          the command with him; since all things are his works, it is fittest
          they should be under his order: he that frames a work, is fittest to
          guide and govern it. God hath the most right to govern, because he
          hath knowledge to direct his power, and power to execute the results
          of his wisdom: he knows what is convenient to order, and hath strength
          to effect what he orders. As his power would be oppressive without
          goodness and wisdom, so his goodness and wisdom would be fruitless
          without power. An artificer that hath lost his hands may direct, but
          cannot make an engine: a pilot that hath lost his arms may advise the
          way of steerage, but cannot hold the helm; something is wanting in him
          to be a complete governor: but since both counsel and power are
          infinite in God, hence results an infinite right to govern, and an
          infinite fitness, because his will cannot be resisted, his power
          cannot be enfeebled or diminished; he can quicken and increase the
          strength of all means as he pleases. He can hold all things in the
          world together, and preserve them in those functions wherein he
          settled them, and conduct them to those ends for which he designed
          them. Every artificer, the more excellent he is, and the more
          excellency of power appears in his work, is the more careful to
          maintain and cherish it. Those that deny Providence, do not only
          ravish from him the bowels of his goodness, but strip him of a main
          exercise of his power, and engender in men a suspicion of weariness
          and feebleness in him; as though his strength had been spent in making
          them, that none is left to guide them. They would make him headless in
          regard of his wisdom, and bowelless in regard of his goodness, and
          armless in regard of his strength. If he did not, or were not able to
          preserve and provide for his creatures, his power in making them would
          be, in a great part, an invisible power; if he did not preserve what
          he made, and govern what he preserves, it would be a kind of strange
          and rude power, to make, and suffer it to be dashed in pieces at the
          pleasure of others. If the power of God should relinquish the world,
          the life of things would be extinguished, the fabric would be
          confounded, and fall into a deplorable chaos. That which is composed
          of so many various pieces, could not maintain its union, if there were
          not a secret virtue binding them together and maintaining those
          varieties of links. Well, then, since God is not only so good, that he
          cannot will anything but what is good; so wise, that he cannot err or
          mistake; but also so able, that he cannot be defeated or mated; he
          hath every way a full ability to govern the world: where those three
          are infinite, the right and fitness resulting from thence is
          unquestionable: and, indeed, to deny God this active part of his
          power, is to render him weak, foolish, cruel, or all.

          Instruct. 6. Here is a ground for the worship of God. Wisdom and power
          are the grounds of the respect we give to men; they being both
          infinite in God, are the foundation of a solemn honor to be returned
          to him by his creatures. If a man makes a curious engine, we honor him
          for his skill; if another vanquish a vigorous enemy, we admire him for
          his strength: and shall not the efficacy of God’s power in creation,
          government, redemption, enflame us with a sense of the honor of his
          name and perfections? We admire those princes that have vast empires,
          numerous armies, that have a power to conquer their enemies, and
          preserve their own people in peace. How much more ground have we to
          pay a mighty reverence to God, who, without trouble and weariness,
          made and manages this vast empire of the world by a word and beck!
          What sensible thoughts have we of the noise of thunder, the power of
          the sun, the storms of the sea! These things that have no
          understanding have struck men with such a reverence, that many have
          adored them as gods. What reverence and adoration doth this mighty
          power, joined with an infinite wisdom in God, demand at our hands! All
          religion and worship stands especially upon two pillars, goodness, and
          power in God; if either of these were defective, all religion would
          faint away. We can expect no entertainment with him without goodness,
          nor any benefit from him without power. This God prefaceth to the
          command to worship him, the benefit his goodness had conferred upon
          them, and the powerful manner of conveyance of it to them (2 Kings
          xvii. 36): “The Lord brought you up from the land of Egypt with great
          power, and an out‑stretched arm; him shall you fear, and him shall you
          worship, and to him shall you do sacrifice.” Because this attribute is
          a main foundation of prayer, the Lord’s Prayer is concluded with a
          doxology of it, “For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory.”
          As he is rich, possessing all blessings; so he is powerful, to confer
          all blessings on us, and make them efficacious to us. The Jews repeat
          many times in their prayers, some say an hundred times, מלך העולם,
          “The King of the world;” it is both an awe and an encouragement.882 We
          could not, without consideration of it, pray in faith of success; nay,
          we could not pray at all, if his power were defective to help us, and
          his mercy too weak to relieve us. Who would solicit a lifeless, or lie
          a prostrate suppliant, to a feeble arm? Upon this ability of God, our
          Saviour built his petitions (Heb. v. 7): “He offered up strong cries
          unto Him that was able to save him from death.” Abraham’s faith hung
          upon the same string (Rom. iv. 21), and the captived church
          supplicates God to act according to the greatness of his power (Ps.
          lxxix. 11). In all our addresses this is to be eyed and considered;
          God is able to help, to relieve, to ease me, let my misery be never so
          great, and my strength never so weak (Matt. viii. 2): “If thou wilt,
          thou canst make me clean,” was the consideration the leper had when he
          came to worship Christ; he was clear in his power, and therefore
          worshipped him, though he was not equally clear in his will. All
          worship is shot wrong that is not directed to, and conducted by, the
          thoughts of this attribute, whose assistance we need. When we beg the
          pardon of our sins, we should eye mercy and power; when we beg his
          righting us in any case where we are unjustly oppressed, we do not eye
          righteousness without power; when we plead the performance of his
          promise, we do not regard his faithfulness only without the prop of
          his power. As power ushers in all the attributes of God in their
          exercise and manifestation in the world, so should it be the butt our
          eyes should be fixed upon in all our acts of worship: as without his
          power his other attributes would be useless, so without due
          apprehensions of his power our prayers will be faithless and
          comfortless. The title in the Lord’s prayer directs us to a prospect
          both of his goodness and power; his goodness in the word Father, his
          greatness, excellency, and power, in the word Heaven. The heedless
          consideration of the infiniteness of this perfection roots up piety in
          the midst of us, and makes us so careless in worship. Did we more
          think of that Power that raised the world out of nothing, that orders
          all creatures by an act of his will, that performed so great an
          exploit as that of our redemption, when masterless sin had triumphed
          over the world, we should give God the honor and adoration which so
          great an excellency challengeth and deserves at our hands, though we
          ourselves had not been the work of his hands, or the monuments of his
          strength; how could any creature engross to itself that reverence from
          us which is due to the powerful Creator, of whom it comes infinitely
          short in strength as well as wisdom?

          resurrection. God aims at the glory of his power, as well as the glory
          of any other attribute. Moses else would not have culled out this as
          the main argument, in his pleading with God, for the sheathing the
          sword which he began to draw out against them in the wilderness (Numb.
          xiv. 16): “The nations will say, Because the Lord was not able to
          bring these people into the land which he sware to them,” &amp;c. As
          the finding out the particulars of the dust of our bodies discovers
          the vastness of his knowledge, so to raise them will manifest the
          glory of his power as much as creation; bodies that have mouldered
          away into multitudes of atoms, been resolved into the elements, passed
          through varieties of changes, been sometimes the matter to lodge the
          form of a plant, or been turned into the substance of a fish or fowl,
          or vapored up into a cloud, and been part of that matter which hath
          compacted a thunder‑bolt, disposed of in places far distant, scattered
          by the winds, swallowed and concocted by beasts; for these to be
          called out from their different places of abode, to meet in one body,
          and be restored to their former consistency, in a marriage union, in
          the “twinkling of an eye” (1 Cor. xv. 22), it is a consideration that
          may justly amaze us, and our shallow understandings are too feeble to
          comprehend it. But is it not credible, since all the disputes against
          it may be silenced by reflections on Infinite Power, which nothing can
          oppose, for which nothing can be esteemed too difficult to effect,
          which doth not imply a contradiction in itself? It was no less amazing
          to the blessed virgin to hear a message that she should conceive a Son
          without knowing a man; but she is quickly answered, by the angel, with
          a “Nothing is impossible to God” (Luke i. 34, 37). The distinct parts
          off our bodies cannot be hid from his all‑seeing eye, wherever they
          are lodged, and in all the changes they pass through, as was
          discoursed when the Omniscience of God was handled; shall, then, the
          collection of them together be too hard for his invincible power and
          strength, and the uniting all those parts into a body, with new
          dispositions to receive their several souls, be too big and bulky for
          that Power which never yet was acquainted with any bar? Was not the
          miracle of our Saviour’s multiplying the loaves, suppose it had not
          been by a new creation, but a collection of grain from several parts,
          very near as stupendous as this? Had any one of us been the only
          creatures made just before the matter of the world, and beheld that
          inform chaos covered with a thick darkness, mentioned Gen. i. 2, would
          not the report, that from this dark deep, next to nothing, should be
          raised such a multitude of comely creatures, with such innumerable
          varieties of members, voices, colors, motions, and such numbers of
          shining stars, a bright sun, one uniform body of light from this
          darkness, that should, like a giant, rejoice to run a race, for many
          thousands of years together, without stop or weariness; would not all
          these have seemed as incredible as the collection of scattered dust?
          What was it that erected the innumerable host of heaven, the glorious
          angels, and glittering stars, for aught we know more numerous than the
          bodies of men, but an act of the Divine will? and shall the power that
          wrought this sink under the charge of gathering some dispersed atoms,
          and compacting them into a human body? Can you tell how the dust of
          the ground was kneaded by God into the body of man, and changed into
          flesh, skin, hair, bones, sinews, veins, arteries, and blood, and
          fitted for so many several activities, when a human soul was breathed
          into it?883 Can you imagine how a rib, taken from Adam’s side, a
          lifeless bone, was formed into head, hands, feet, eyes? Why may not
          the matter of men, which have been, be restored, as well as that which
          was not, be first erected? Is it harder to repair those things which
          were, than to create those things which were not? Is there not the
          same Artificer? Hath any disease or sickliness abated his power? Is
          the Ancient of Days grown feeble? or shall the elements, and other
          creatures, that alway yet obeyed his command, ruffle against his
          raising voice, and refuse to disgorge those remains of human bodies
          they have swallowed up in their several bowels? Did the whole world,
          and all the parts of it, rise at his word? and shall not some parts of
          the world, the dust of the dead, stand up out of the graves at a word
          of the same mighty efficacy? Do we not annually see those marks of
          power which may stun our incredulity in this concern? Do you see in a
          small acorn, or little seed, any such sights, as a tree with body,
          bark, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit—where can you find them? Do you
          know the invisible corners where they lurk in that little body? And
          yet these you afterwards view rising up from this little body, when
          sown in the ground, that you could not possibly have any prospect of
          when you rolled it in your hand, or opened its bowels. And why may not
          all the particulars of our bodies, however disposed as to their
          distinct natures invisibly to us, remain distinct, as well as if you
          mingle a thousand seeds together? they will come up in their distinct
          kinds, and preserve their distinct virtues. Again, is not the making
          heaven and earth, the union of the Divine and human nature, eternity
          and infirmity, to make a virgin conceive a Son, bear the Creator, and
          bring forth the Redeemer, to form the blood of God of the flesh of a
          virgin, a greater work than the calling together and uniting the
          scattered parts of our bodies, which are all of one nature and matter?
          And since the power of God is manifested in pardoning innumerable
          sins, is not the scattering our transgressions, as far as the east is
          from the west, as the expression is, Ps. ciii. 12, and casting such
          numbers into the depths of the sea, which is God’s power over himself,
          a greater argument of might than the recalling and repairing the atoms
          of our bodies from their various receptacles? It is not hard for them
          to believe this of the resurrection, that have been sensible of the
          weight and force of their sins, and the power of God in pardoning and
          vanquishing that mighty resistance which was made in their hearts
          against the power of his renewing and sanctifying grace. The
          consideration of the infinite power of God is a good ground of the
          belief of the resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instruct. 8. Since the power of God is so great and incomprehensible,
          how strange is it that it should be contemned and abused by the
          creatures as it is! The power of God is beaten down by some, outraged
          by others, blasphemed by many, under their sufferings. The stripping
          God of the honor of his creation, and the glory of his preservation of
          the world, falls under this charge: thus do they that deny his framing
          the world alone, or thought the first matter was not of God’s
          creation, and such as fancied an evil principle, the author of all
          evil, as God is the author of all good, and so exempt from the power
          of God, that it could not be vanquished by him. These things have
          formerly found defenders in the world; but they are, in themselves,
          ridiculous and vain, and have no footing in common reason, and are not
          worthy of debate in a christian auditory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, all idolatry in the world did arise from the want of a due
          notion of this Infinite Power. The heathen thought one God was not
          sufficient for the managing all things in the world, and therefore
          they feigned several gods, that had several charges; as Ceres presided
          over the fruits of the earth; Esculapius over the cure of distempers;
          Mercury for merchandise and trade; Mars for war and battles; Apollo
          and Minerva for learning and ingenious arts; and Fortune for casual
          things. Whence doth the other sort of idolatry, the adoring our bags
          and gold, our dependencies on, and trusting in, creatures for help
          arise, but from ignorance of God’s power, or mean and slender
          apprehensions of it? First, there is a contempt of it. Secondly, An
          abuse of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is contemned in every sin, especially in obstinacy in sin. All
          sin whatsoever is built upon some false notion or monstrous conception
          of one or other of God’s perfections, and in particular of this. It
          includes a secret and lurking imagination, that we are able to grapple
          with Omnipotence, and enter the lists with Almightiness; what else can
          be judged of the apostle’s expression (1 Cor. x. 22), “Do we provoke
          the Lord to jealousy; are we stronger than he?” Do we think we have an
          arm too powerful for that justice we provoke, and can repel that
          vengeance we exasperate? Do we think we are an even match for God, and
          are able to despoil him of his Divinity? To despise his will, violate
          his order, practise what he forbids with a severe threatening, and
          pawns his power to make it good, is to pretend to have an arm like
          God, and be able to thunder with a voice equal or superior to him, as
          the expression is (Job xl. 9). All security in sin is of this strain;
          when men are not concerned at Divine threatenings, nor staggered in
          their sinful race, they intimate, that the declarations of Divine
          Power are but vain‑glorious boastings; that God is not so strong and
          able as he reports himself to be; and therefore they will venture it,
          and dare him to try, whether the strength of his arm be as forcible as
          the words of his mouth are terrible in his threats; this is to believe
          themselves Creators, not creatures. We magnify God’s power in our
          wants, and debase it in our rebellions; as though Omnipotence were
          only able to supply our necessities, and unable to revenge the
          injuries we offer him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This power is contemned in distrust of God. All distrust is founded
          in a doubting of his truth, as if he would not be as good as his word;
          or of his omniscience, as if he had not a memory to retain his word;
          or of his power, as if he could not be as great as his word. We
          measure the infinite power of God by the short line of our
          understandings, as if infinite strength were bounded within the narrow
          compass of our finite reason; as if he could do no more than we were
          able to do. How soon did those Israelites lose the remembrance of
          God’s outstretched arm, when they uttered that atheistical speech (Ps.
          lxxviii. 19), “Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?” As if he
          that turned the dust of Egypt into lice, for the punishment of their
          oppressors, could not turn the dust of the wilderness into corn, for
          the support of their bodies! As if he that had miraculously rebuked
          the Red Sea, for their safety, could not provide bread, for their
          nourishment! Though they had seen the Egyptians with lost lives in the
          morning, in the same place where their lives had been miraculously
          preserved in the evening, yet they disgrace that experimental power,
          by opposing to it the stature of the Anakims, the strength of their
          cities, and the height of their walls (Numb. xiii. 32). And (Numb.
          xiv. 3). “Wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to fall by
          the sword?” As though the giants of Canaan were too strong for Him,
          for whom they had seen the armies of Egypt too weak. How did they
          contract the almightiness of God into the littleness of a little man,
          as if he must needs sink under the sword of a Canaanite? This distrust
          must arise either from a flat atheism, a denial of the being of God,
          or his government of the world; or unworthy conceits of a weakness in
          him, that he had made creatures too hard for himself; that he were not
          strong enough to grapple with those mighty Anakims, and give them the
          possession of Canaan against so great a force. Distrust of him implies
          either that he was always destitute of power, or that his power is
          exhausted by his former works, or that it is limited, and near a
          period: it is to deny him to be the Creator that moulded heaven and
          earth. Why should we, by distrust, put a slight upon that power which
          he hath so often expressed, and which, in the minutest works of his
          hands, surmount the force of the sharpest understanding?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is contemned in too great a fear of man, which ariseth from a
          distrust of Divine power. Fear of man is a crediting the might of man
          with a disrepute of the arm of God, it takes away the glory of his
          might, and renders the creature stronger than God; and God more feeble
          than a mortal; as if the arm of man were a rod of iron, and the arm of
          God a brittle reed. How often do men tremble at the threatenings and
          hectorings of ruffians, yet will stand as stakes against the precepts
          and threatenings of God, as though he had less power to preserve us,
          than enemies had to destroy? With what disdain doth God speak to men
          infected with this humor (Isa. li. 12, 13)? “Who art thou, that art
          afraid of a man that shall die, and the Son of man that shall be made
          as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy Maker, that hath stretched forth
          the heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth; and hast feared
          continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor?” To fear
          man that is as grass, that cannot think a thought without a Divine
          concourse, that cannot breathe, but by a Divine power, nor touch a
          hair without license first granted from heaven; this is forgetfulness,
          and consequently a slight of that Infinite Power, which hath been
          manifested in founding the earth and garnishing the heavens. All fear
          of man, in the way of our duty, doth in some sort thrust out the
          remembrance, and discredit the great actions of the Creator. Would not
          a mighty prince think it a disparagement to him, if his servant should
          decline his command for fear of one of his subjects? and hath not the
          great God just cause to think himself disgraced by us, when we deny
          him obedience for fear of a creature: as though he had but an infant
          ability too feeble to bear us out in duty, and incapable to balance
          the strength of an arm of flesh?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is contemned by trusting in ourselves, in means, in man, more
          than in God. When in any distress we will try every creature refuge,
          before we have recourse to God; and when we apply ourselves to him, we
          do it with such slight and perfunctory frames, and with so much
          despondency, as if we despaired either of his ability or will to help
          us; and implore him with cooler affections than we solicit creatures:
          or, when in a disease we depend upon the virtue of the medicine, the
          ability of the physician, and reflect not upon that power that endued
          the medicine with that virtue, and supports the quality in it, and
          concurs to the operation of it. When we depend upon the activity of
          the means, as if they had power originally in themselves, and not
          derivatively; and do not eye the power of God animating and assisting
          them. We cannot expect relief from anything with a neglect of God, but
          we render it in our thoughts more powerful than God: we acknowledge a
          greater fulness in a shallow stream, than in an eternal spring; we do,
          in effect, depose the true God, and create to ourselves a new one; we
          assert, by such a kind of acting, the creature, if not superior, yet
          equal with God, and independent on him. When we trust in our own
          strength, without begging his assistance; or boast of our own
          strength, without acknowledging his concurrence, as the Assyrian; “By
          the strength of my hand have I done this; I have put down the
          inhabitants like a valiant man” (Isa. x. 13). It is, as if the axe
          should boast itself against him that hews therewith, and thinks itself
          more mighty than the arm that wields it (ver. 15), when we trust in
          others more than in God. Thus God upbraids those by the prophet, that
          sought help from Egypt, telling them (Isa. xxxi. 3), “The Egyptians
          were men, and not gods;” intimating, that by their dependence on them,
          they rendered them gods and not men, and advanced them from the state
          of creatures to that of almighty deities. It is to set a pile of dust,
          a heap of ashes, above Him that created and preserves the world. To
          trust in a creature, is to make it as infinite as God; to do that
          which is impossible in itself to be done. God himself cannot make a
          creature infinite, for that were to make him God. It is also contemned
          when we ascribe what we receive to the power of instruments, and not
          to the power of God. Men, in whatsoever they do for us, are but the
          tools whereby the Creator works. Is it not a disgrace to the limner to
          admire his pencil, and not himself; to the artificer, to admire his
          file and engines, and not his power? “It is not I,” saith Paul, “that
          labor, but the grace, the efficacious grace of God, which is in me.”
          Whatsoever good we do is from him, not from ourselves; to ascribe it
          to ourselves, or to instruments, is to overlook and contemn his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Unbelief of the gospel is a contempt and disowning Divine power.
          This perfection hath been discovered in the conception of Christ, the
          union of the two natures, his resurrection from the grave, the
          restoration of the world, and the conversion of men, more than in the
          creation of the world: then what a disgrace is unbelief to all that
          power that so severely punished the Jews for the rejecting the gospel:
          turned so many nations from their beloved superstitions; humbled the
          power of princes and the wisdom of philosophers; chased devils from
          their temples by the weakness of fishermen; planted the standard of
          the gospel against the common notions and inveterate customs of the
          world! What a disgrace is unbelief to this power which hath preserved
          Christianity from being extinguished by the force of men and devils,
          and kept it flourishing in the midst of sword, fire, and executioners;
          that hath made the simplicity of the gospel overpower the eloquence of
          orators, and multiplied it from the ashes of martyrs, when it was
          destitute of all human assistances! Not heartily to believe and
          embrace that doctrine, which hath been attended with such marks of
          power, is a high reflection upon this Divine perfection, so highly
          manifested in the first publication, propagation, and preservation of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, The power of God is abused, as well as contemned. 1. When we
          make use of it to justify contradictions. The doctrine of
          transubstantiation is an abuse of this power. When the maintainers of
          it cannot answer the absurdities alleged against it, they have
          recourse to the power of God. It implies a contradiction, that the
          same body should be on earth and in heaven at the same instant of
          time; that it should be at the right hand of God, and in the mouth and
          stomach of a man; that it should be a body of flesh, and yet bread to
          the eye and to the taste; that it should be visible and invisible, a
          glorious body, and yet gnawn by the teeth of a creature; that it
          should be multiplied in a thousand places, and yet an entire body in
          every one, where there is no member to be seen, no flesh to be tasted;
          that it should be above us in the highest heavens, and yet within us
          in our lower bowels; such contradictions as these are an abuse of the
          power of God. Again, we abuse this power when we believe every idle
          story that is reported, because God is able to make it so if he
          pleased. We may as well believe Æsop’s Fables to be true, that birds
          spake, and beasts reasoned, because the power of God can enable such
          creatures to such acts. God’s power is not the rule of our belief of a
          thing without the exercise of it in matter of fact, and the
          declaration of it upon sufficient evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The power of God is abused by presuming on it, without using the
          means he hath appointed. When men sit with folded arms, and make a
          confidence in his power a glorious title to their idleness and
          disobedience, they would have his strength do all, and his precept
          should move them to do nothing; this is a trust of his power against
          his command, a pretended glorifying his power with a slight of his
          sovereignty. Though God be almighty, yet, for the most part, he
          exerciseth his might in giving life and success to second causes and
          lawful endeavors. When we stay in the mouth of danger, without any
          call ordering us to continue, and against a door of providence opened
          for our rescue, and sanctuary ourselves in the power of God without
          any promise, without any providence conducting us; this is not to
          glorify the Divine might, but to neglect it, in neglecting the means
          which his power affords to us for our escape; to condemn it to our
          humors, to work miracles for us according to our wills, and against
          his own.884 God could have sent a worm to be Herod’s executioner when
          he sought the life of our Saviour, or employed an angel from heaven to
          have tied his hands or stopped his breath, and not put Joseph upon a
          flight to Egypt with our Saviour; yet had it not been an abuse of the
          power of God, for Joseph to have neglected the precept, and slighted
          the means God gave him for the preserving his own life and that of the
          child’s? Christ himself, when the Jews consulted to destroy him,
          presumed not upon the power of God to secure him, but used ordinary
          means for his preservation, by walking no more openly, but retiring
          himself into a city near the wilderness till the hour was come, and
          the call of his Father manifest (John xi. 53, 54). A rash running upon
          danger, though for the truth itself, is a presuming upon, and
          consequently an abuse of, this power; a proud challenging it to serve
          our turns against the authority of his will, and the force of his
          precept; a not resting in his ordinate power, but demanding his
          absolute power to pleasure our follies and presumptions; concluding
          and expecting more from it than what is authorized by his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instruct. 9. If infinite power be a peculiar property of God, how
          miserable will all wicked rebels be under this power of God! Men may
          break his laws, but not impair his arm; they may slight his word, but
          cannot resist his power. If he swear that he will sweep a place with
          the besom of destruction, “as he hath thought, so shall it come to
          pass; and as he hath purposed, so shall it stand,” (Isa. xiv. 23, 24).
          Rebels against an earthly prince may exceed him in strength, and be
          more powerful than their sovereign; none can equal God, much less
          exceed him. As none can exercise an act of hostility against him
          without his permissive will, so none can struggle from under his hand
          without his positive will. He hath an arm not to be moved, a hand not
          to be wrung aside. God is represented on his throne like a “jasper
          stone” (Rev. iv. 3), as one of invincible power when he comes to
          judge; the jasper is a stone which withstands the greatest force.885
          Though men resist the order of his laws, they cannot the sentence of
          their punishment, nor the execution of it. None can any more exempt
          themselves from the arm of his strength, than they can from the
          authority of his dominion. As they must bow to his sovereignty, so
          must they sink under his force. A prisoner in this world may make his
          escape, but a prisoner in the world to come cannot (Job x. 7). “There
          is none that can deliver out of thine hand.” “There is none to deliver
          when he tears in pieces” (Ps. l. 22). His strength is uncontrollable;
          hence his throne is represented as a “fiery flame” (Dan. vii. 9). As a
          spark of fire hath power to kindle one thing after another, and
          increase till it consumes a forest, a city, swallow up all combustible
          matter till it consumes a world, and many worlds, if they were in
          being, what power hath the tree to resist the fire, though it seems
          mighty, when it outbraves the winds? What man, to this day, hath been
          able to free himself from that chain of death God clapped upon him for
          his revolt? And if he be too feeble to rescue himself from a temporal,
          much less from an eternal death. The devils have, to this minute,
          groaned under the pile of wrath, without any success in delivering
          themselves by all their strength, which much surmounts all the
          strength of mankind, nor have they any hopes to work their rescue to
          eternity. How foolish is every sinner! Can we poor worms strut it out
          against Infinite Power? We cannot resist the meanest creatures when
          God commissions them, and puts a sword into their hands. They will
          not, no, not the worms, be startled at the glory of a king, when they
          have the Creator’s warrant to be his executioners (Acts xii. 23). Who
          can withstand him, when he commands the waves and inundations of the
          sea to leap over the shore; when he divides the ground in earthquakes,
          and makes it gape wide to swallow the inhabitants of it; when the air
          is corrupted to breed pestilences; when storms and showers,
          unseasonably falling, putrify the fruits of the earth; what created
          power can mend the matter, and, with a prevailing voice, say to him,
          What dost thou? There are two attributes God will make glister in hell
          to the full; his wrath and his power (Rom. ix. 22): “What if God,
          willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
          much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction?” If
          it were mere wrath, and no power to second it, it were not so
          terrible; but it is wrath and power: both are joined together. It is
          not only a sharp sword, but a powerful arm; and not only that, for
          then it were well for the damned creature. To have many sharp blows,
          and from a strong arm, this may be without putting forth the highest
          strength a man hath; but in this God makes it his design to make his
          power known and conspicuous; he takes the sword, as it were, in both
          hands, that he may show the strength of his arm in striking the harder
          blow; and therefore the apostle calls it (2 Thess. i. 9) “the glory of
          his power,” which puts a sting into his wrath; and it is called (Rev.
          xix. 15) “the fierceness of the wrath of the Almighty.” God will do it
          in such a manner as to make men sensible of his almightiness in every
          stroke. How great must that vengeance be, that is backed by all the
          strength of God! When there will be a powerful wrath, without a
          powerful compassion; when all his power shall be exercised in
          punishing, and not the least mite of it exercised in pitying; how
          irresistible will be the load of such a weighty hand! How can the dust
          of the balance break the mighty bars, or get out of the lists of a
          powerful vengeance, or hope for any grain of comfort? O, that every
          obstinate sinner would think of this, and consider his unmeasurable
          boldness in thinking himself able to grapple with Omnipotence! What
          force can any have to resist the presence of Him, before whom rocks
          melt, and the heavens, at length, shall be shrivelled up as a
          parchment by the last fire! As the light of God’s face is too dazzling
          to be beheld by us, so the arm of his power is too mighty to be
          opposed by us. His almightiness is above the reach of our potsherd
          strength, as his infiniteness is above the capacity of our purblind
          understanding. God were not omnipotent, if his power could be rendered
          ineffectual by any.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use II. A second use of this point, from the consideration of the
          infinite power of God, is of comfort. As Omnipotence is an ocean that
          cannot be fathomed, so the comforts from it are streams that cannot be
          exhausted. What joy can be wanting to him that finds himself folded in
          the arms of Omnipotence? This perfection is made over to believers in
          the covenant, as well as any other attribute; “I am the Lord, your
          God;” therefore, that power, which is as essential to the Godhead as
          any other perfection of his nature, is, in the rights and extent of
          it, assured unto you. Nay, may we not say, it is made over more than
          any other, because it is that which animates every other perfection;
          and is the Spirit that gives them motion and appearance in the world.
          If God had expressed himself in particular, as, “I am a true God, a
          wise God, a loving God, a righteous God, I am yours;” what would all,
          or any of those, have signified, unless the other also had been
          implied, as, “I am an almighty God, I am your God?” In God’s making
          over himself in any particular attribute, this of his power is
          included in every one, without which, all his other grants would be
          insignificant. It is a comfort that power is in the hands of God; it
          can never be better placed, for he can never use his power to injure
          his confiding creature; if it were in our own hands, we might use it
          to injure ourselves. It is a power in the hands of an indulgent
          Father, not a hard‑hearted tyrant; it is a just power; “His right hand
          is full of righteousness” (Ps. xlviii. 10); because of his
          righteousness he can never use it ill, and because of his wisdom he
          can never use it unseasonably. Men that have strength, often misplace
          the actings of it, because of their folly; and sometimes employ it to
          base ends, because of their wickedness; but this power in God is
          always awakened by goodness, and conducted by wisdom; it is never
          exercised by self‑will and passion, but according to the immutable
          rule of his own nature, which is righteousness. How comfortable is it
          to think, that you have a God that can do what he pleases; nothing so
          difficult but he can effect, nothing so strong but he can overrule!
          You need not dread men, since you have One to restrain them; nor fear
          devils, since you have One to chain them; no creature but is acted by
          this power; no creature but must fall upon the withdrawing of this
          power. It was not all laid out in creation; it is not weakened by his
          preservation of things; he yet hath a fullness of power, and a residue
          of Spirit; for whom should that eternal arm of the Lord be displayed,
          and that incomprehensible thunder of his power be shot out, but for
          those for whose sake and for whose comfort it is revealed in his word?
          In particular,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Here is comfort in all afflictions and distresses. Our evils can
          never be so great to oppress us, as his power is great to deliver us.
          The same power that brought a world out of a chaos, and constituted,
          and hath hitherto preserved, the regular motion of the stars, can
          bring order out of our confusions, and light out of our darkness. When
          our Saviour was in the greatest distress, and beheld the face of his
          Father frowning, while he was upon the cross, in his complaint to him,
          he exerciseth faith upon his power (Matt. xxvii. 46): “Eli, Eli: My
          God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” that this, My strong, my
          strong; El, is a name of power, belonging to God; he comforts himself
          in his power, while he complains of his frowns. Follow his pattern,
          and forget not that power that can scatter the clouds, as well as
          gather them together. The Psalmist’s support in his distress, was in
          the creative power of God (Ps. cxxi. 2): “My help comes from the Lord,
          which made heaven and earth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is comfort in all strong and stirring corruptions and mighty
          temptations. It is by this we may arm ourselves, and “be strong in the
          power of his might” (Eph. vi. 10); by this we may conquer
          principalities and powers, as dreadful as hell, but not so mighty as
          heaven; by this we may triumph over lusts within, too strong for an
          arm of flesh; by this the devils that have possessed us may be cast
          out; the battered walls of our souls may be repaired; and the sons of
          Anak laid flat. That power that brought light out of darkness, and
          over‑mastered the deformity of the chaos, and set bounds to the ocean,
          and dried up the Red Sea by a rebuke, can quell the tumults in our
          spirits, and level spiritual Goliahs by his word. When the disciples
          heard that terrifying speech of our Saviour, concerning rich men, that
          it was “easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for
          a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God” (Matt. xix. 24), to
          entertain the gospel, which commanded self‑denial; and that, because
          of the allurements of the world, and the strong habits in their soul;
          Christ refers them to the power of God (ver. 26), who could expel
          those ill habits, and plant good ones: “With men this is impossible,
          but with God all things are possible.” There is no resistance, but he
          can surmount; no strong‑hold, but he can demolish; no tower, but he
          can level.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is comfort from hence, that all promises shall be performed.
          Goodness is sufficient to make a promise, but power is necessary to
          perform a promise. Men that are honest, cannot often make good their
          words, because something may intervene that may shorten their ability:
          but nothing can disable God, without diminishing his godhead. He hath
          an infiniteness of power to accomplish his word, as well as an
          infiniteness of goodness to make and utter his word. That might
          whereby he made heaven and earth, and his keeping truth forever, are
          joined together (Ps. cxlvi. 5, 6); his Father’s faithfulness, and his
          creative power are linked together. It is upon this basis the
          covenant, and every part of it, is established, and stands as firm as
          the almightiness of God, whereby he sprung up the earth, and reared
          the heavens. “No power can resist his will” (Rom. ix. 19); “Who can
          disannul his purpose, and turn back his hand when it is stretched out”
          (Isa. xiv. 27)? His word is unalterable, and his power is invincible.
          He could not deceive himself, for he knew his own strength when he
          promised: no unexpected event can change his resolution, because
          nothing can happen without the compass of his foresight. No created
          strength can stop him in his action, because all creatures are ready
          to serve him at his command; not the devils in hell, nor all the
          wicked men on earth, since he hath strength to restrain them, and an
          arm to punish them. What can be too hard for Him that created heaven
          and earth? Hence it was, that when God promised anything anciently to
          his people, he used often the name of the Almighty, the Lord that
          created heaven and earth, as that which was an undeniable answer to
          any objection, against anything that might be made against the
          greatness and stupendousness of any promise; by that name, in all his
          works of grace, was he known to them (Exod. vi. 3). When we are sure
          of his will, we need not question his strength, since he never
          over‑engaged himself above his ability. He that could not be resisted
          by anything in creation, nor vanquished by devils in redemption, can
          never want power to glorify his faithfulness in his accomplishment of
          whatsoever he hath promised.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. From this infiniteness of power in God, we have ground of assurance
          for perseverance. Since conversion is resembled to the works of
          creation and resurrection, two great marks of his strength, he doth
          not surely employ himself in the first of changing the heart, to let
          any created strength baffle that power which he began and intends to
          glorify. It was this might that struck off the chain, and expelled
          that strong one that possessed you. What, if you are too weak to keep
          him out of his lost possession, will God lose the glory of his first
          strength, by suffering his foiled adversary to make a re‑entry, and
          regain his former usurpation? His out‑stretched arm will not do less
          by his spiritual, than it did by his national Israel: it guarded them
          all the way to Canaan, and left them not to shift for themselves after
          he had struck off the fetters of Egypt, and buried their enemies in
          the Red Sea (Deut. i. 31). This greatness of the Father, above all,
          our Saviour makes the ground of believers’ continuance forever,
          against the blasts of hell and engines of the world (John x. 29). “My
          Father is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my
          Father’s hands.” Our keeping is not in our own weak hands, but in the
          hands of Him who is mighty to save. That power of God keeps us which
          intends our salvation. In all fears of falling away, shelter
          yourselves in the power of God: “He shall be holden up,” saith the
          apostle, speaking concerning one weak in faith; and no other reason is
          rendered by him but this, “For God is able to make him to stand” (Rom.
          xiv. 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. From this attribute of the infinite power of God, we have a ground
          of comfort in the lowest estate of the church. Let the state of the
          church be never so deplorable, the condition never so desperate, that
          Power that created the world, and shall raise the bodies of men, can
          create a happy state for the church, and raise her from an
          overwhelming grave; though the enemies trample upon her, they cannot
          upon the arm that holds her, which by the least motion of it, can lift
          her up above the heads of her adversaries, and make them feel the
          thunder of that Power that none can understand: by the “blast of God
          they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils they are consumed” (Job
          iv. 9); they “shall be scattered as chaff before the wind.” If once he
          “draw his hand out of his bosom,” all must fly before him, or sink
          under him (Ps. lxxiv. 11): and when there is “none to help, his own
          arm sustains him, and brings salvation, and his fury doth uphold him”
          (Isa. lxiii. 5). What if the church totter under the underminings of
          hell? What if it hath a sad heart and wet eyes? In what a little
          moment can he make the night turn into day, and make the Jews, that
          were preparing for death in Shushan, triumph over the necks of their
          enemies, and march in one hour with swords in their hands, that
          expected the last hour “ropes about their necks” (Esth. ix. 1, 5)? If
          Israel be pursued by Pharaoh, the sea shall open its arms to protect
          them: if they be thirsty, a rock shall spout out water to refresh
          them: if they be hungry, heaven shall be their granary for manna: if
          Jerusalem be besieged, and hath not force enough to encounter
          Sennacherib, an angel shall turn the camp into an Aceldema, a field of
          blood. His people shall not want deliverances, till God want a power
          of working miracles for their security: he is more jealous of his
          power, than the church can be of her safety. And if we should want
          other arguments to press him, we may implore him by virtue of his
          power: for when there is nothing in the church as a motive to him to
          save it, there is enough in his own name, and “the illustration of his
          power” (Ps. cvi. 8). Who can grapple with the omnipotency of that God,
          who is jealous of, and zealous for, the honor of it? And therefore
          God, for the most part, takes such opportunities to deliver, wherein
          his almightiness may be most conspicuous, and his counsels most
          admirable. He awakened not himself to deliver Israel, till they were
          upon the brink of the Red Sea; nor to rescue the three children, till
          they were in the fiery furnace; nor Daniel, till he was in the lion’s
          den. It is in the weakness of his creature that his strength is
          perfected, not in a way of addition of perfectness to it, but in a way
          of manifestation of the perfection of it; as it is the perfection of
          the sun to shine and enlighten the world, not that the sun receives an
          increase of light by the darting of his beams, but discovers his glory
          to the admiration of men, and pleasure of the world. If it were not
          for such occasions, the world would not regard the mightiness of God,
          nor know what power were in him. It traverses the stage in its fulness
          and liveliness upon such occasions, when the enemies are strong, and
          their strength edged with an intense hatred, and but little time
          between the contrivance and execution. It is a great comfort that the
          lowest distresses of the church are a fit scene for the discovery of
          this attribute, and that the glory of God’s omnipotence, and the
          church’s security, are so straitly linked together. It is a promise
          that will never be forgotten by God, and ought never to be forgotten
          by us, that “in this mountain the hand of the Lord shall rest” (Isa.
          xxv. 10); that is, the power of the Lord shall abide; and Moab “shall
          be trodden under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.”
          And the “plagues of Babylon shall come in one day, death, and
          mourning, and famine; for strong is the Lord who judgeth her” (Rev.
          xviii. 8).
        </p>
        <p>Use III. The third use is for exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          1. Meditate on this power of God, and press it often upon your minds.
          We conclude many things of God that we do not practically suck the
          comfort of, for want of deep thoughts of it, and frequent inspection
          into it. We believe God to be true, yet distrust him; we acknowledge
          him powerful, yet fear the motion of every straw. Many truths, though
          assented to in our understandings, are kept under hatches by corrupt
          affections, and have not their due influence, because they are not
          brought forth into the open air of our souls by meditation. If we will
          but search our hearts, we shall find it is the power of God we often
          doubt of. When the heart of Ahaz and his subjects trembled at the
          combination of the Syrian and Israelitish kings against him, for want
          of a confidence in the power of God, God sends his prophet with
          commission to work a miraculous sign at his own choice, to rear up his
          fainting heart; and when he refused to ask a sign out of diffidence of
          that almighty Power, the prophet complains of it as an affront to his
          Master (Isa. vii. 12, 13). Moses, so great a friend of God, was
          overtaken with this kind of unbelief, after all the experiments of
          God’s miraculous acts in Egypt; the answer God gives him manifests
          this to be at the core: “Is the Lord’s hand waxed short” (Numb. xi.
          23)? For want of actuated thoughts of this, we are many times turned
          from our known duty by the blast of a creature; as though man had more
          power to dismay us, than God hath to support us in his commanded way.
          The belief of God’s power is one of the first steps to all religion;
          without settled thoughts of it, we cannot pray lively and believingly
          for the obtaining the mercies we want, or the averting the evils we
          fear; we should not love him, unless we are persuaded he hath a power
          to bless us; nor fear him, unless we were persuaded of his power to
          punish us. The frequent thoughts of this would render our faith more
          stable, and our hopes more stedfast; it would make us more feeble to
          sin, and more careful to obey. When the virgin staggered at the
          message of the angel, that she should “bear a Son,” he, in his answer,
          turns her to the creative power of God (Luke i. 35), “The power of the
          Highest shall overshadow thee;” which seems to be in allusion to the
          Spirit’s moving upon the face of the deep, and bringing a comely world
          out of a confused mass. Is it harder for God to make a virgin conceive
          a Son by the power of his Spirit, than to make a world? Why doth he
          reveal himself so often under the title of Almighty, and press it upon
          us, but that we should press it upon ourselves? And shall we be
          forgetful of that which everything about us, everything within us, is
          a mark of? How come we by a power of seeing and hearing, a faculty,
          and act of understanding and will, but by this power framing us, this
          power assisting us? What though the thunder of his power cannot be
          understood, no more can any other perfection of his nature; shall we,
          therefore, seldom think of it? The sea cannot be fathomed, yet the
          merchant excuseth not himself from sailing upon the surface of it. We
          cannot glorify God without due consideration of this attribute; for
          his power is his glory as much as any other, and called both by the
          name of glory (Rom. vi. 4), speaking of Christ’s resurrection by the
          glory of the Father; and also “the riches of his glory” (Eph. iii.
          16). Those that have strong temptations in their course and
          over‑pressing corruptions in their hearts, have need to think of it
          out of interest, since nothing but this can relieve them. Those that
          have experimented the working of it in their new creation, are obliged
          to think of it out of gratitude. It was this mighty power over himself
          that gave rise to all that pardoning grace already conferred, or
          hereafter expected; without it our souls had been consumed, the world
          overturned; we could not have expected a happy heaven, but have lain
          yelling in an eternal hell, had not the power of his mercy exceeded
          that of his justice, and his infinite power executed what his infinite
          wisdom had contrived for our redemption. How much also should we be
          raised in our admirations of God, and ravish ourselves in
          contemplating that might that can raise innumerable worlds in those
          infinite imaginary spaces without this globe of heaven and earth, and
          exceed inconceivably what he hath done in the creation of this?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. From the pressing the consideration of this upon ourselves, let us
          be induced to trust God upon the account of his power. The main end of
          the revelation of his power to the patriarchs, and of the miraculous
          operations of it in Egypt, was to induce them to an entire reposing
          themselves in God: and the Psalmist doth scarce speak of the Divine
          Omnipotence without making this inference from it; and scarce exhorts
          to a trust in God, but backs it with a consideration of his power in
          creation, it being the chief support of the soul (Ps. cxlvi. 1):
          “Happy is he whose hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven and
          earth, the sea, and all that therein is.” That Power is invincible
          that drew the world out of nothing: nothing can happen to us harder
          than the making the world without the concurrence of instruments: no
          difficulty can nonplus that strength, that hath drawn all things out
          of nothing, or out of a confused matter next to nothing: no power can
          rifle what we commit to him (2 Tim. i. 12). He is all power, above the
          reach of all power; all other powers in the world flowing from him, or
          depending on him, he is worthy to be trusted, since we know him true,
          without ever breaking his word; and Omnipotent, never failing of his
          purpose; and a confidence in it is the chief act whereby we can
          glorify this power, and credit his arm. A strong God, and a weak faith
          in omnipotence, do not suit well together. Indeed, we are more engaged
          to a trust in Divine power than the ancient patriarchs were; they had
          the verbal declaration of his power, and many of them little other
          evidence of it, than in the creation of the world; and their faith in
          God being established in this first discovery of his omnipotence, drew
          out itself further to believe, that whatsoever God promised by his
          word, he was able to perform, as well as the creation of the world out
          of nothing; which seems to be the intendment of the apostle (Heb. xi.
          3); not barely to speak of the creation of the world by God, which was
          a thing the Hebrews understood well enough from their ancient oracles;
          but to show the foundation of the patriarch’s faith, viz. God making
          the world by his Word, and what use they made of the discovery of his
          power in that, to lead them to believe the promise of God concerning
          the Seed of the woman to be brought into the world. But we have not
          only the same foundation, but superadded demonstrations of this
          attribute in the conception of our Saviour, the union of the two
          natures, the glorious redemption, the propagation of the gospel, and
          the new creation of the world. They relied upon the naked power of
          God, without those more illustrious appearances of it, which have been
          in the ages since, and arrived to their notice; we have the wonderful
          effects of that which they had but obscure expectations of.

        <p>
          (1.) Consider, trust in God can never be without taking in God’s power
          as a concurrent foundation with his truth. It is the main ground of
          trust, and so set forth in the prophet (Isa. xxvi. 4); “Trust ye in
          the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.”
          And the faith of the ancients so recommended (Heb. xi.), had this
          chiefly for its ground; and the faith in gospel times is called a
          “trusting on his arm” (Isa. li. 5.) All the attributes of God are the
          objects of our veneration, but they do not equally contribute to the
          producing trust in our hearts; his eternity, simplicity, infiniteness,
          ravish and astonish our minds when we consider them; but there is no
          immediate tendency in their nature to allure us to a confidence in
          him, no, not in an innocent state, much less in a lapsed and revolted
          condition: but the other perfections of his nature, as his holiness,
          righteousness, mercy, are amiable to us in regard of the immediate
          operations of them upon and about the creature, and so have something
          in their own nature to allure us to repose ourselves in him; but yet
          those cannot engage to an entire trust in him without reflecting upon
          his ability, which can only render those useful and successful to the
          creature.886 For whatsoever bars stand in the way of his holy,
          righteous, and merciful proceedings towards his creatures, are not
          overmastered by those perfections, but by that strength of his which
          can only relieve us in concurrence with the other attributes. How
          could his mercy succor us without his arm, or his wisdom guide us
          without his hand, or his truth perform promises to us without his
          strength? As no attribute can act without it, so in our addresses to
          him upon the account of any particular perfection in the Godhead
          according to our indigency, our eye must be perpetually fixed upon
          this of his power, and our faith would be feeble and dispirited
          without eyeing this: without this, his holiness, which hates sin,
          would not be regarded; and his mercy, pitying a grieving sinner, would
          not be valued. As this power is the ground of a wicked man’s fear, so
          it is the ground of a good man’s trust. This was that which was the
          principal support of Abraham, not barely his promise, but his ability
          to make it good (Rom. iv. 21); and when he was commanded to sacrifice
          Isaac, the ability of God to raise him up again (Heb. xi. 19). All
          faith would droop, and be in the mire, without leaning upon this; all
          those attributes which we consider as moral in God, would have no
          influence upon us without this, which we consider physically in God.
          Though we value the kindness men may express to us in our distresses,
          yet we make them not the objects of our confidence, unless they have
          an ability to act what they express. There can be no trust in God
          without an eye to his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Sometimes the power of God is the sole object of trust. As when
          we have no promise to assure us of his will, we have nothing else to
          pitch upon but his ability; and that not his absolute power, but his
          ordinate, in the way of his providence; we must not trust in it so as
          to expect he should please our humor with fresh miracles, but rest
          upon his power, and leave the manner to his will. Asa, when ready to
          conflict with the vast Ethiopian army, pleaded nothing else but this
          power of God (2 Chron. xiv. 11). And the three children, who had no
          particular promise of deliverance (that we read of) stuck to God’s
          ability to preserve them against the king’s threatening, and owned it
          in the face of the king, yet with some kind of inward intimations in
          their own spirits, that he would also deliver them (Dan. iii. 17).
          “Our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
          furnace.” And accordingly the fire burnt the cords that tied them,
          without singeing any thing else about them. But when this power hath
          been exercised upon like occasions, it is a precedent he hath given us
          to rest upon. Precedents in law are good pleas, and strong
          encouragements to the client to expect success in his suit. “Our
          fathers trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them,” saith David
          (Ps. xxii. 4). And Jehoshaphat, in a case of distress (2 Chron. xx.
          7), “Art not thou our God, that didst drive out the inhabitants of
          this land before thy people Israel?” When we have not any statute law
          and promise to plead, we may plead his power, together with the former
          precedents and act of it. The centurion had nothing else to act his
          faith upon but the power of Christ, and some evidences of it in the
          miracles reported of him; but he is silent in the latter, and casts
          himself only upon the former, acknowledging that Christ had the same
          command over diseases, as himself had over his soldiers (Matt. viii.
          10). And our Saviour, when he receives the petition of the blind men,
          requires no more of them in order to a cure, but a belief of his
          ability to perform it (Matt. ix. 28). “Believe you that I am able to
          do this?” His will is not known but by revelation, but his power is
          apprehended by reason, as essentially and eternally linked with the
          notion of a God. God also is jealous of the honor of this attribute;
          and since it is so much virtually discredited, he is pleased when any
          do cordially own it, and entirely resign themselves to the assistance
          of it. Well, then, in all duties where faith is particularly to be
          acted, forget not this as the main prop of it: do you pray for a
          flourishing and triumphing grace? Consider him “as able to make all
          grace to abound in you” (2 Cor. ix. 8). Do you want comfort and
          reviving under your contritions and godly sorrow? Consider him, as he
          declares himself, “the high and lofty One” (Isa. lvii. 15). Are you
          under pressing distresses? take Eliphaz’s advice to Job, when he tells
          him what he himself would do if he were in his case (Job v. 8), “I
          would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:” but
          observe under what consideration (ver. 9) as to one “that doth great
          things, and unsearchable; marvellous things without number.” When you
          beg of him the melting your rocky hearts, the dashing in pieces your
          strong corruptions, the drawing his beautiful image in your soul, the
          quickening your dead hearts, and reviving your drooping spirits, and
          supplying your spiritual wants, consider him as one “able to do
          abundantly,” not only “above what you can ask,” but “above what you
          can think” (Eph. iii. 20). Faith will be spiritless, and prayer will
          be lifeless, if power be not eyed by us in those things which cannot
          be done without an arm of Omnipotence.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This doctrine teacheth us humility and submission. The vast
          disproportion between the mightiness of God, and the meanness of a
          creature, inculcates the lesson of humility in his presence. How
          becoming is humility under a mighty hand (1 Pet. v. 6)! What is an
          infant in a giant’s hand, or a lamb in a lion’s paw? Submission to
          irresistible power is the best policy, and the best security; this
          gratifies and draws out goodness, whereas murmuring and resistance
          exasperates and sharpens power. We sanctify his name, and glorify his
          strength, by falling down before it; it is an acknowledgment of his
          invisible strength, and our inability to match it. How low should we
          therefore lie before him, against whose power our pride and murmuring
          can do no good, who can out‑wrestle us in our contests, and alway
          overcome when he judges (Rom. iii. 4)!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This doctrine teacheth us not to fear the pride and force of man.
          How unreasonable is it to fear a limited, above an unbounded power!
          How unbecoming is the fear of man in him, who hath an interest in a
          strength able to curb the strongest devils! Who would tremble at the
          threats of a dwarf, that hath a mighty and watchful giant for his
          guard? If God doth but arise, his enemies are scattered (Ps. lxviii.
          1): the least motion makes them fly before him: it is no difficult
          thing for Him, that made them by a word, to unmake their designs, and
          shiver them in pieces by the breath of his mouth: “He brings princes
          to nothing, and makes the judges of the earth vanity; they wither when
          he blows upon them, and their stock shall not take root in the earth.
          He can command a whirlwind to take them away as stubble” (Isa. xl. 23,
          24); yea, with the “shaking of his hand he makes servants to become
          rulers of those that were their masters” (Zech. ii. 9). Whole nations
          are no more in his hands than a “morning cloud,” or the “dew upon the
          ground,” or “the chaff before the wind,” or the smoke against the
          motion of the air, which, though it appear out of a chimney like a
          black invincible cloud, is quickly dispersed, and becomes invisible
          (Hos. xiii. 3). How inconsiderable are the most mighty to this
          strength, which can puff away a whole world of proud grasshoppers, and
          a whole sky of daring clouds! He that by his word masters the rage of
          the sea, can overrule the pride and power of men. Where is the fury of
          the oppressor? It cannot overleap the bounds he hath set it, nor march
          an inch beyond the point he hath prescribed it. Fear not the
          confederacies of man, but “sanctify the Lord of hosts; let him be your
          fear, and let him be your dread” (Isa. viii. 13). To fear men is to
          dishonor the name of God, and regard him as a feeble Lord, and not as
          the Lord of hosts, who is mighty in strength, so that they that harden
          themselves against him shall not prosper.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Therefore this doctrine teacheth us the fear of God. The prophet
          Jeremiah counts it as an impossible thing for men to be destitute of
          the fear of God, when they seriously consider his name to be great and
          mighty (Jer. x. 6, 7): “Thou art great, and thy name is great in
          might: who would not fear thee, O thou King of nations?” Shall we not
          tremble at his presence, who hath placed the “sand for the bound of
          the sea by a perpetual decree;” that though the waves thereof toss
          themselves, yet they cannot prevail (Jer. v. 22). He can arm the
          weakest creature for our destruction, and disarm the strongest
          creatures which appear for our preservation. He can command a hair, a
          crumb, a kernel, to go awry, and strangle us. He can make the heavens
          brass over our head, stop close the bottles of the clouds, and make
          the fruit of the fields droop, when there is a small distance to the
          harvest; he can arm men’s wit, wealth, hands, against themselves; he
          can turn our sweet morsels into bitter, and our own consciences into
          devouring lions; he can root up cities by moles, and conquer the
          proudest by lice and worms. The omnipotence of God is not only the
          object of a believer’s trust, but a believer’s fear. It is from the
          consideration of this power only, that our Saviour presses his
          disciples, whom he entitles his friends, to fear God; which lesson he
          presses by a double repetition, and with a kind of asseveration,
          without rendering any other reason than this of the ability of God to
          cast into hell (Luke xii. 5). We are to fear Him because he can; but
          bless his goodness because he will not. In regard of his omnipotence,
          he is to be reverenced, not only by mortal men, but by the blessed
          angels, who are past the fear of any danger by his power, being
          confirmed in a happy state by his unalterable grace: when they adore
          him for his holiness, they reverence him for his power with covered
          faces: the title of the “Lord of hosts” is joined in their reverential
          praise with that of his holiness (Isa. vi. 3), “Holy, holy, holy is
          the Lord of hosts.” How should we adore that Power which can preserve
          us, when devils and men conspire to destroy us! How should we stand in
          awe of that Power which can destroy us, though angels and men should
          combine to preserve us! The parts of his ways which are discovered,
          are sufficient motives to an humble and reverential adoration: but who
          can fear and adore him according to the vastness of his power, and his
          excellent greatness, since “the thunder of his power who can
          understand?”
