        <h2>DISCOURSE XIV.</h2>
        <p>ON GOD’S PATIENCE.</p>
        <p>
          Nahum I. 3.—The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will
          not at all acquit the wicked: the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind
          and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject of this prophecy is God’s sentence against Nineveh, the
          head and metropolis of the Assyrian empire: a city famous for its
          strength, and thickness of its walls, and the multitude of its towers
          for defence against an enemy. The forces of this empire did God use as
          a scourge against the Israelites, and by their hands ruined Samaria,
          the chief city of the ten tribes, and transplanted them as captives
          into another country (2 Kings xvii. 5, 6), about six years after
          Hezekiah came to the crown of Judah (2 Kings xviii. compared with
          chap. xvii. 6), in whose time, or, as some think, later, Nahum uttered
          this prophecy. The name, Nahum, signifies Comforter; though the matter
          of his prophecy be dreadful to Nineveh, it was comfortable to the
          people of God: for a promise is made, (ver. 7), “The Lord is good, a
          stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in
          him.” And an encouragement to Judah, to keep their solemn feasts,
          (ver. 15: and also in chap. ii. 3), with a declaration of the misery
          of Nineveh, and the destruction of it. Observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In all the fears of God’s people, God will have a Comforter for
          them. Judah might well be dejected with the calamity of their
          brethren, not knowing but it might be their own turn shortly after.
          They knew not where the ambition of the Assyrian would stop; but God
          by his prophets calms their fears of their furious neighbor, by
          predicting to them the ruin of their feared adversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The destruction of the church’s enemies is the comfort of the
          church. By that God is glorified in his justice, and the church
          secured in its worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The victories of persecutors secure them not from being the
          triumphs of others. The Assyrians that conquered and captived Israel,
          were themselves to be conquered and captived by the Medes. The whole
          oppressing empire is threatened with destruction in the ruin of their
          chief city; accordingly it was accomplished, and the empire
          extinguished by a greater power. God burns the rod when it hath done
          the work he appointed it for; and the wisp of straw wherewith the
          vessels are scoured, is flung into the fire, or upon the dunghill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nahum begins his prophecy majestically, with a description of the
          wrath and fury of God. (Ver. 2), “God is jealous, and the Lord
          revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is furious: the Lord will take
          vengeance on his adversaries, and reserveth wrath for his enemies.”
          And therefore the whole of it is called (ver. 1), “The burden of
          Nineveh,” as those prophecies are, which are composed of threatenings
          of judgments, which lie as a mighty weight upon the heads and backs of
          sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is jealous—jealous of his glory and worship, and jealous for his
          people, and their security. He cannot long bear the oppressions of his
          people, and the boasts of his enemies. He is jealous for himself, and
          is jealous for you of Judah, who retain his worship. He is not
          forgetful of those that remember him, nor of the danger of those that
          are desirous to maintain his honor in the world. In this first
          expression, the prophet uses the covenant name, God; the covenant
          runs, “I am your God,” or “the Lord your God;” mostly God without
          Lord, never Lord without God: and, therefore, his jealousy here is
          meant of the care of his people, and the relation that his actions
          against his enemies have to his servants. He is a lover of his own,
          and a revenger on his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord revengeth, and is furious.—He now describes God by a name of
          sovereignty and power, when he describes him in his wrath and fury,
          and is furious. Heb. בעל חמה, Lord of hot anger. God will vindicate
          his own glory, and have his right on his enemies in a way of
          punishment, if they will not give it him in a way of obedience. It is
          three times repeated, to show the certainty of the judgment;1024 and
          the name of “Lord” added to every one, to intimate the power wherewith
          the judgment should be executed. It is not a fatherly correction of
          children in a way of mercy, but an offended Sovereign’s destruction of
          his enemies in a way of vengeance. There is an anger of God with his
          own people, which hath more of mercy than wrath; in this his rod is
          guided by his bowels. There is a fury of God against his enemies,
          where there is sole wrath without any tincture of mercy; when his
          sword is all edge, without any balsam drops upon it. Such a fury as
          David deprecates (Ps. vi. 1): “O Lord, rebuke me not in thy anger, nor
          chasten me in thy sore displeasure,” with a fury untempered with
          grace, and insupportable wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reserves wrath for his enemies.—He lays it up in his treasury, to
          be brought out and expended in a due season. “Wrath” is supplied by
          our translators, and is not in the Hebrew. He reserves, what?—that
          which is too sharp to be expressed, too great to be conceived: a
          vengeance it is. And ונוטר הוא, He reserves it. He that hath an
          infinite wrath, he reserves it; that hath a strength and power to
          execute it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Ver. 3.) The Lord is slow to anger, Heb. ארך אפים, of broad nostrils.
          The anger of God is expressed by this word, which signifies
          “nostrils:” as, Job ix. 13, “If God will not withdraw his anger,” Heb.
          “his nostrils.” And the anger whereby the wicked are consumed, is
          called the “breath of nostrils” (Job iv. 9); and when he is angry,
          smoke and fire are said to go out of his nostrils (2 Sam. ii. 9); and
          in Psalm lxxiv. 1, “Why doth thy anger smoke?” Heb. “Why do thy
          nostrils smoke?” So the rage of a horse, when he is provoked in
          battle, is called the glory of his nostrils (Job xxxix. 20). He
          breathes quick fumes, and neighs with fury. And slowness to anger is
          here expressed by the phrase of “long or wide nostrils:” because in a
          vehement anger, the blood boiling about the heart, exhales men’s
          spirit, which fume up, and break out in dilated nostrils. But where
          the passages are straighter the spirits have not so quick a vent, and
          therefore raise more motions within; or, because the wider the
          nostrils are, the more cool air is drawn in to temper the heat of the
          heart, where the angry spirits are gathered; and so the passion is
          allayed, and sooner calmed. God speaks of himself in Scripture often
          after the rate of men; Jeremiah prays (ch. xv. 15) that God would not
          take him away in his long‑suffering, Heb. “in the length of his
          nostrils,” i. e. Be not slow and backward in thy anger against my
          persecutors, as to give them time and opportunity to destroy me. The
          nostrils, as well as other members of a human body, are ascribed to
          God. He is slow to anger; he hath anger in his nature, but is not
          always in the execution of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And great in power.—This may refer to his patience as the cause of it,
          or as a bar to the abuse of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. “He is slow to anger, and great in power,” i. e. his power
          moderates his anger; he is not so impotent as to be at the command of
          his passions, as men are; he can restrain his anger under just
          provocations to exercise it. His power over himself is the cause of
          his slowness to wrath, as Numb. xiv. 17: “Let the power of my Lord be
          great,” saith Moses, when he pleads for the Israelites’ pardon. Men
          that are great in the world are quick in passions, and are not so
          ready to forgive an injury, or bear with an offender, as one of a
          meaner rank. It is a want of a power over a man’s self that makes him
          do unbecoming things upon a provocation. A prince that can bridle his
          passion, is a king over himself, as well as over his subjects. God is
          slow to anger, because great in power: he hath no less power over
          himself than over his creatures: he can sustain great injuries without
          an immediate and quick revenge: he hath a power of patience, as well
          as a power of justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Or thus: “He is slow to anger and great in power.” He is slow to
          anger, but not for want of power to revenge himself; his power is as
          great to punish, as his patience to spare. It seems thus, that
          slowness to anger is brought in as an objection against the revenge
          proclaimed. What do you tell us of vengeance, vengeance, nothing but
          such repetitions of vengeance?—as though we were ignorant that God is
          slow to anger. It is true, saith the prophet, I acknowledge it as much
          as you, that God is slow to anger; but withal, great in power. His
          anger certainly succeeds his abused patience; he will not always
          bridle in his wrath, but one time or other let it march out in fury
          against his adversaries. The Assyrians, who had captived the ten
          tribes, and been victorious a little against the Jews, might think
          that the God of Israel had been conquered by their gods, as well as
          the people professing him had been subdued by their arms; that God had
          lost all his power; and the Jews might argue, from God’s patience to
          his enemies, against the credit of the prophet’s denouncing revenge.
          The prophet answers, to the terror of the one, and the comfort of the
          other, that this indulgence to his enemies, and not accounting with
          them for their crimes, proceeded from the greatness of his patience,
          and not from any debility in his power. As it refers to the Assyrian,
          it may be rendered thus: You Ninevites, upon your repentance after
          Jonah’s thundering of judgments, are witnesses of the slowness of God
          to anger, and had your punishments deferred; but, falling to your old
          sins, you shall find a real punishment, and that he hath as much power
          to execute his ancient threatenings, as he had then compassion to
          recall them; his patience to you then was not for want of power to
          ruin you, but was the effect of his goodness towards you. As it refers
          to the Jews, it may be thus paraphrased: Do not despise this
          threatening against your enemies because of the greatness of their
          might, the seeming stability of their empire, and the terror they
          possess all the nations with round about them: it may be long before
          it comes, but assure yourselves the threatening I denounce shall
          certainly be executed; though he hath patience to endure them a
          hundred and thirty‑five years (for so long as it was before Nineveh
          was destroyed after this threatening, as Ribera, in loc.1025 computes
          from the years of the reign of the kings of Judah), yet he hath also
          power to verify his word, and accomplish his will: assure yourselves,
          he will not at all acquit the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will not acquit the wicked.—He will not always account the criminal
          an innocent, as he seems to do by a present sparing of them, and
          dealing with them as if they were destitute of any provoking carriage
          towards him, and he void of any resentment of it. He will “not acquit
          the wicked;” how is this? Who then can be saved? Is there no place for
          remission? He will “not acquit the wicked.” i. e. he will not acquit
          obstinate sinners. As he hath patience for the wicked, so he hath
          mercy for the penitent. The wicked are the subjects of his
          long‑suffering, but not of his acquitting grace; he doth not presently
          punish their sins, because he is slow to anger; but without their
          repentance he will not blot out their sins, because he is righteous in
          judgment: if God should acquit them without repentance for their
          crimes, he must himself repent of his own law and righteous sanction
          of it. “He will not acquit,” i. e. he will not go back from the thing
          he hath spoken, and forbear, at long run, the punishment he hath
          threatened.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind.—The way of God signifies
          sometimes the law of God, sometimes the providential operations of
          God: “Is not my way equal?” (Ezek. xviii. 25). It seems there to take
          in both.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.—The prophet
          describes here the fight of God with the Assyrians, as if he rushed
          upon them with a mighty noise of an army, raising the dust with the
          feet of their horses, and motion of their chariots.1026 Symbolically,
          it signifies the multitude of the Chaldean and Median forces,
          invading, besieging, and storming the city. It signifies,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The rule of providence. The way of God is in every motion of the
          creature; he rules all things, whirlwinds, storms, and clouds; his way
          is in all their walks, in the whirlings and blusterings of the one, in
          the raising and dissolving the other. He blows up the winds, and
          compacts the clouds, to make them serviceable to his designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The management of wars by God. His way is in the storm: as he was
          the Captain of the Assyrians against Samaria, so he will be the
          Captain of the Medes against Nineveh: as Israel was not so much wasted
          by the Assyrians as by the Lord, who levied and armed their forces; so
          Nineveh shall be subverted, rather by God, than by the arms of the
          Medes. Their force is described not to be so much from human power as
          Divine. God is President in all the commotions of the world, his way
          is in every whirlwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The easiness of executing the judgment. He is of so great power
          that he can excite tempests in the air, and overthrow them with the
          clouds, which are the dust of his feet: he can blind his enemies, and
          avenge himself on them: he is Lord of clouds, and can fill their womb
          with hail, lightnings, and thunders, to burst out upon those he
          kindles his anger against: he is of so great force, that he needs not
          use the strength of his arm, but the dust of his feet, to effect his
          destroying purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The suddenness of the judgment. Whirlwinds come suddenly, without
          any harbingers to give notice of their approach: clouds are swift in
          their motion; “Who are those that fly as a cloud?” (Isa. lx. 8), i. e.
          with a mighty nimbleness. What God doth, he shall do on the sudden,
          come upon them before they are aware, be too quick for them in his
          motion to overrun and overreach them. The winds are described with
          wings, in regard of the quickness of their motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The terror of judgments. “The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind,”
          i. e. in great displeasure. The anger of the Lord is often compared to
          a storm; he shall bring clouds of judgments upon them, many and thick,
          as terrible as when a day is turned into night, by the mustering of
          the darkest clouds that interpose between the sun and the earth.
          “Clouds and darkness are round about him, and a fire goes before him,”
          when he “burns up his enemies” (Ps. xcvii. 2, 3). The judgments shall
          have terror without mercy, as clouds obscure the light, and are dark
          masks before the face and glory of the sun, and cut off its refreshing
          beams from the earth. Clouds note multitude and obscurity; God could
          crush them without a whirlwind, beat them to powder with one touch,
          but he will bring his judgments in the most surprising and amazing
          manner to flesh and blood, so that all their glory shall be changed
          into nothing but terror, by the noise of the bellowing winds, and the
          clouds, like ink, blacking the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The confusion of the offenders upon God’s proceeding. A whirlwind
          is not only a boisterous wind, that hurls and rolls everything out of
          its place, but, by its circular motion, by its winding to all points
          of the compass, it confounds things, and jumbles them together. It
          keeps not one point, but, by a circumgyration, toucheth upon all.
          Clouds, like dust, shall be blown in their face, and gum up their
          eyes: they shall be in a posture of confusion, not know what counsels
          to take, what motions to resolve upon. Let them look to every point of
          heaven and earth, they shall meet with a whirlwind to confound them,
          and cloudy dust to blind them.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The irresistibleness of the judgment. Winds have more than a
          giant‑like force, a torrent of compacted air, that, with an invincible
          wifulness, bears all before it, displaceth the firmest trees, and
          levels the tallest towers, and pulls up bodies from their natural
          place. Clouds also are over our heads, and above our reach; when God
          places them upon his people for defence they are an invincible
          security (Isa. iv. 5); and when he moves them, as his chariot, against
          a people, they end in an irresistible destruction. Thus the ruin of
          the wicked is described (Prov. x. 25): “As the whirlwind passes, so is
          the wicked no more:” it blows them down, sweeps them away, they
          irrecoverably fall before the force of it. What heart can endure, and
          what hands can be strong, in the days wherein God doth deal with them!
          (Ezek. xxii. 14). Thus is the judgment against Nineveh described: God
          hath his way in the whirlwind, to thunder down their strongest walls,
          which were so thick that chariots could march abreast upon them; and
          batter down their mighty towers, which that city had in multitudes
          upon their walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are the first words I intend to insist upon, to treat of the
          Patience of God described in those words, “The Lord is slow to anger.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. Slowness to anger, or admirable patience, is the property of
          the Divine nature. As patience signifies suffering, so it is not in
          God. The Divine nature is impassible, incapable of any impair, it
          cannot be touched by the violences of men, nor the essential glory of
          it be diminished by the injuries of men; but as it signifies a
          willingness to defer, and an unwillingness to pour forth his wrath
          upon sinful creatures, he moderates his provoked justice, and forbears
          to revenge the injuries he daily meets with in the world. He suffers
          no grief by men’s wronging him, but he restrains his arm from
          punishing them according to their merits; and thus there is patience
          in every cross a man meets with in the world, because, though it be a
          punishment, it is less than is merited by the unrighteous rebel, and
          less than may be inflicted by a righteous and powerful God. This
          patience is seen in his providential works in the world: “He suffered
          the nations to walk in their own way,” and the witness of his
          providence to them was his “giving them rain and fruitful seasons,
          filling their heart with food and gladness” (Acts xvi. 17). The
          heathens took notice of it, and signified it by feigning their god
          Saturn, to be bound a whole year in a soft cord, a cord of wool, and
          expressed it by this proverb: “The mills of the gods grind slowly;” i.
          e. God doth not use men with that severity that they deserve; the
          mills being usually turned by criminals condemned to that work.1027
          This, in Scripture, is frequently expressed by a slowness to anger
          (Ps. ciii. 8), sometimes by long‑suffering, which is a patience with
          duration (Ps. cxlv. 8; Joel ii. 13). He is slow to anger, he takes not
          the first occasions of a provocation; he is long‑suffering (Rom. ix.
          22), and (Ps. lxxxvi. 15) he forbears punishment upon many occasions
          offered him. It is long before he consents to give fire to his wrath,
          and shoot out his thunderbolts. Sin hath a loud cry, but God seems to
          stop his ears, not to hear the clamor it raises and the charge it
          presents. He keeps his sword a long time in the sheath; one calls the
          patience of God the sheath of his sword, upon those words (Ezek. xxi.
          3), “I will draw forth my sword out of his sheath.” This is one
          remarkable letter in the name of God; he himself proclaims it (Exod.
          xxxiv. 6): “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful, gracious, and
          long‑suffering.” And Moses pleads it in the behalf of the people
          (Numb. xiv. 18), where he placeth it in the first rank; the Lord is
          “long‑suffering and of great mercy:” it is the first spark of mercy,
          and ushers it to its exercises in the world.1028 In the Lord’s
          proclamation, it is put in the middle link, mercy and truth together;
          mercy could have no room to act if patience did not prepare the way;
          and his truth and goodness, in his promise of the Redeemer, would not
          have been manifest to the world if he had shot his arrows as soon as
          men committed their sins, and deserved his punishment. This perfection
          is expressed by other phrases, as “keeping silence” (Ps. l. 21):
          “These things hast thou done, and I kept silence,” אלה עשית והחרשתי;
          it signifies to behave one’s self as a deaf or dumb man. I did not fly
          in thy face, as some do, with a great noise upon a light provocation,
          as if their life, honor, estates, were at the stake; I did not
          presently call thee to the bar, and pronounce judicial sentence upon
          thee according to the law, but demeaned myself as if I had been
          ignorant of thy crimes, and had not been invested with the power of
          judging thee for them. Chald. “I waited for thy conversion.” God’s
          patience is the silence of his justice, and the first whisper of his
          mercy. It is also expressed by not laying folly to men (Job xxiv. 12);
          men groan under the oppressions of others, yet God lays not folly to
          them, i. e. to the oppressors; God suffers them to go on with
          impunity. He doth not deliver his people because he would try them,
          and takes not revenge upon the unrighteous, because in patience he
          doth bear with them: patience is the life of his providence in this
          world. He chargeth not men with their crimes here, but reserves them,
          upon impenitency, for another trial. This attribute is so great a one,
          that it is signally called by the name of “Perfection” (Matt. v. 45,
          48). He had been speaking of Divine goodness, and patience to evil
          men, and he concludes, “Be you perfect,” &amp;c., implying it to be an
          amazing perfection of the Divine nature, and worthy of imitation.

          In the prosecution of this, I. Let us consider the nature of this
          patience. II. Wherein it is manifested. III. Why God doth exercise so
          much patience. IV. The Use.
        </p>
        <p>I. The nature of this patience.</p>
        <p>
          1. It is part of the Divine goodness and mercy, yet differs from both.
          God being the greatest goodness, hath the greatest mildness. Mildness
          is always the companion of true goodness, and the greater the goodness
          the greater the mildness. Who so holy as Christ, and who so meek?
          God’s slowness to anger is a branch or slip from his mercy (Ps. cxlv.
          8): “The Lord is full of compassion, slow to anger.” It differs from
          mercy in the formal consideration of the object; mercy respects the
          creature as miserable, patience respects the creature as criminal;
          mercy pities him in his misery, and patience bears with the sin which
          engendered that misery, and is giving birth to more. Again, mercy is
          one end of patience; his long‑suffering is partly to glorify his
          grace: so it was in Paul (1 Tim. i. 16). As slowness to anger springs
          from goodness, so it makes mercy the butt and mark of its operations
          (Isa. xxx. 18): “He waits that he may be gracious.” Goodness sets God
          upon the exercise of patience, and patience sets many a sinner on
          running into the arms of mercy. That mercy which makes God ready to
          embrace returning sinners, makes him willing to bear with them in
          their sins, and wait their return. It differs also from goodness, in
          regard of the object. The object of goodness is every creature,
          angels, men, all inferior creatures, to the lowest worm that crawls
          upon the ground. The object of patience is, primarily, man, and
          secondarily, those creatures that respect men’s support, conveniency,
          and delight; but they are not the objects of patience, as considered
          in themselves, but in relation to man, for whose use they were
          created; and therefore God’s patience to them is properly his patience
          with man. The lower creatures do not injure God, and therefore are not
          the objects of his patience, but as they are forfeited by man, and man
          deserves to be deprived of them; as man in this regard falls under the
          patience of God, so do those creatures which are designed for man’s
          good. That patience which spares man, spares other creatures for him,
          which were all forfeited by man’s sin, as well as his own life, and
          are rather the testimonies of God’s patience, than the proper objects
          of it. The object of God’s goodness, then, is the whole creation; not
          a devil in hell, but as a creature, is a mark of his goodness, but not
          of his patience. There is a kind of sparing exercised to the devils,
          in deferring their complete punishment, and hitherto keeping off the
          day wherein their final sentence is to be pronounced; yet the
          Scripture never mentions this by the name of slowness to anger, or
          long‑suffering. It can no more be called patience, than a prince’s
          keeping a malefactor in chains, and not pronouncing a condemning
          sentence, or not executing a sentence already pronounced, can be
          called a patience with him, when it is not out of kindness to the
          offender, but for some reasons of state. God’s sparing the devils from
          their total punishment—which they have not yet, but are “reserved in
          chains, under darkness for it” (Jude 6)—is not in order to repentance,
          or attended with any invitations from God, or hopes in them; and,
          therefore, cannot come under the same title as God’s sparing man:
          where there is no proposal of mercy, there is no exercise of patience.
          The fallen angels had no mercy reserved for them, nor any sacrifices
          prepared for them; God “spared not the angels” (2 Pet. ii. 4), “but
          delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment,”
          i. e. he had no patience for them; for patience is properly a
          temporary sparing a person, with a waiting of his relenting, and a
          change of his injurious demeanor. The object of goodness is more
          extensive than that of patience: nor do they both consider the object
          under the same relation. Goodness respects things in a capacity, or in
          a state of creation, and brings them forth into creation, and nurseth
          and supports them as creatures. Patience considers them already
          created, and fallen short of the duty of creatures; it considers them
          as sinners, or in relation to sinners. Had not sin entered, patience
          had never been exercised; but goodness had been exercised, had the
          creature stood firm in its created state without any transgression;
          nay, creation could not have been without goodness, because it was
          goodness to create; but patience had never been known without an
          object, which could not have been without an injury. Where there is no
          wrong, no suffering, nor like to be any, patience hath no prospect of
          any operation. So, then, goodness respects persons as creatures,
          patience as transgressors; mercy eyes men as miserable and obnoxious
          to punishment; patience considers men as sinful, and provoking to
          punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Since it is a part of goodness and mercy, it is not an insensible
          patience. What is the fruit of pure goodness cannot be from a weakness
          of resentment; he is “slow to anger;” the prophet doth not say, he is
          incapable of anger, or cannot discern what is a real object of anger;
          it implies, that he doth consider every provocation, but he is not
          hasty to discharge his arrows upon the offenders; he sees all, while
          he bears with them; his omniscience excludes any ignorance; he cannot
          but see every wrong; every aggravation in that wrong, every step and
          motion from the beginning to the completing it; for he knows all our
          thoughts; he sees the sin and the sinner at the same time; the sin
          with an eye of abhorrency, and the sinner with an eye of pity. His eye
          is upon their iniquities, and his hatred edged against them; while he
          stands with arms open, waiting a penitent return. When he publisheth
          his patience in his keeping silence, he publisheth also his
          resolution, to set sin in order before their eyes (Ps. l. 21): “I will
          reprove thee, and set them in order before thy eyes.” Think me not
          such a piece of phlegm, and so dull as not to resent your insolences;
          you shall see, in my final charge, when I come to judge, that not a
          wry look escaped my knowledge, that I had an eye to behold, and a
          heart to loathe every one of your transgressions. The church was ready
          to think that God’s slowness to deliver her, and his bearing with her
          oppressors, was not from any patience in his nature, but a drowsy
          carelessness, a senseless lethargy (Ps. xliv. 23): “Awake, why
          sleepest thou, O Lord?” We must conclude him an inapprehensive God,
          before we can conclude him an insensible God. As his delaying his
          promise is not slackness to his people (2 Pet. iii. 9), so his
          deferring of punishment is not from a stupidity under the affronts
          offered him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Since it is a part of his mercy and goodness, it is not a
          constrained or faint‑hearted patience. It is not a slowness to anger,
          arising from a despondency of his own power to revenge. He hath as
          much power to punish as he hath to forbear punishment. He that created
          a world in six days, and that by a word, wants not a strength to crush
          all mankind in one minute; and with as much ease as a word imports,
          can give satisfaction to his justice in the blood of the offender.
          Patience in man is many times interpreted, and truly too, a cowardice,
          a feebleness of spirit, and a want of strength. But it is not from the
          shortness of the Divine arm, that he cannot reach us, nor from the
          feebleness of his hand, that he cannot strike us. It is not because he
          cannot level us with the dust, dash us in pieces like a potter’s
          vessel, or consume us as a moth. He can make the mightiest to fall
          before him, and lay the strongest at his feet the first moment of
          their crime. He that did not want a powerful word to create a world,
          cannot want a powerful word to dissolve the whole frame of it, and
          raze it out of being. It is not, therefore, out of a distrust of his
          own power, that he hath supported a sinful world for so many ages, and
          patiently borne the blasphemies of some, the neglects of others, and
          the ingratitude of all, without inflicting that severe justice which
          righteously he might have done; he wants no thunder to crush the whole
          generation of men, nor waters to drown them, nor earth to swallow them
          up. How easy is it for him to single out this or that particular
          person to be the object of his wrath, and not of his patience! What he
          hath done to one, he may to another; any signal judgment he hath sent
          upon one, is an evidence that he wants not power to inflict it upon
          all. Could he not make the motes in the air to choke us at every
          breath, rain thunderbolts instead of drops of water, fill the clouds
          with a consuming lightning, take off the reverence and fear of man,
          which he hath imprinted upon the creature, spirit our domestic beasts
          to be our executioners, unloose the tiles from the house‑top to brain
          us, or make the fall of a house to crush us? It is but taking out the
          pins, and giving a blast, and the work is done. And doth he want a
          power to do any of those things? It is not then a faint‑hearted, or
          feeble patience, that he exerciseth towards man.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Since it is not for want of power over the creature, it is from a
          fulness of power over himself. This is in the text, “The Lord is slow
          to anger, and great in power;” it is a part of his dominion over
          himself, whereby he can moderate, and rule his own affections
          according to the holiness of his own will. As it is the effect of his
          power, so it is an argument of his power; the greatness of the effect
          demonstrates the fulness and sufficiency of the cause. The more feeble
          any man is in reason the less command he hath over his passions, and
          he is the more heady to revenge. Revenge is a sign of a childish mind;
          the stronger any man is in reason, the more command he hath over
          himself. “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
          that rules his own spirit, than he that takes a city” (Prov. xvi. 32);
          he that can restrain his anger, is stronger than the Cæsars and
          Alexanders of the world, that have filled the earth with slain
          carcasses and ruined cities. By the same reason, God’s slowness to
          anger is a greater argument of his power than the creating a world, or
          the power of dissolving it by a word; in this he hath a dominion over
          creatures, in the other over himself; this is the reason he will not
          return to destroy; because “I am God, and not man” (Hos. xi. 9); I am
          not so weak and impotent as man, that cannot restrain his anger. This
          is a strength possessed only by a God, wherein a creature is no more
          able to parallel him, than in any other; so that he may be said to be
          the Lord of himself; as it is in the verse before the text, that he is
          the Lord of anger, in the Hebrew, instead of “furious,” as we
          translate it; so he is the Lord of patience. The end why God is
          patient, is to show his power. “What if God, willing to show his
          wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long‑suffering
          the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?” (Rom. ix. 22). To show
          his wrath upon sinners, and his power over himself in bearing such
          indignities, and forbearing punishment so long, when men were vessels
          of wrath fitted for destruction, of whom there was no hopes of
          amendment. Had he immediately broken in pieces those vessels, his
          power had not so eminently appeared as it hath done, in tolerating
          them so long, that had provoked him to take them off so often; there
          is indeed the power of his anger, and there is the power of his
          patience; and his power is more seen in his patience than in his
          wrath: it is no wonder that He that is above all, is able to crush
          all; but it is a wonder, that he that is provoked by all, doth not,
          upon the first provocation, rid his hands of all. This is the reason
          why he did bear such a weight of provocations from vessels of wrath,
          prepared for ruin, that he might γνωρίσαι τὸ δυνατὸν αὑτοῦ, show what
          he was able to do, the lordship and royalty he had over himself. The
          power of God is more manifest in his patience to a multitude of
          sinners, than it would be in creating millions of worlds out of
          nothing; this was the δυνατὸν αὑτοῦ, a power over himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This patience being a branch of mercy, the exercise of it is
          founded in the death of Christ. Without the consideration of this, we
          can give no account why Divine patience should extend itself to us,
          and not to the fallen angels. The threatening extends itself to us as
          well as to the fallen angels; the threatening must necessarily have
          sunk man, as well as those glorious creatures, had not Christ stepped
          in to our relief. Had not Christ interposed to satisfy the justice of
          God, man upon his sin had been actually bound over to punishment, as
          well as the fallen angels were upon theirs, and been fettered in
          chains as strong as those spirits feel.1029 The reason why man was not
          hurled into the same deplorable condition upon his sin, as they were,
          is Christ’s promise of taking our nature, and not theirs. Had God
          designed Christ’s taking their nature, the same patience had been
          exercised towards them, and the same offers would have been made to
          them, as are made to us. In regard to these fruits of this patience,
          Christ is said to buy the wickedest apostates from him: “Denying the
          Lord that bought them” (1 Pet. ii. 1). Such were bought by him, as
          “bring upon themselves just destruction, and whose damnation slumbers
          not” (ver. 3); he purchased the continuance of their lives, and the
          stay of their execution, that offers of grace might be made to them.
          This patience must be either upon the account of the law, or the
          gospel; for there are no other rules, whereby God governs the world. A
          fruit of the law it was not; that spake nothing but curses after
          disobedience; not a letter of mercy was writ upon that, and therefore
          nothing of patience; death and wrath were denounced; no slowness to
          anger intimated. It must be therefore upon account of the gospel, and
          a fruit of the covenant of grace, whereof Christ was Mediator. Besides
          this perfection being God’s “waiting that he might be gracious” (Isa.
          xxx. 18), that which made way for God’s grace made way for his waiting
          to manifest it. God discovered not his grace, but in Christ; and
          therefore discovered not his patience but in Christ; it is in him he
          met with the satisfaction of his justice, that he might have a ground
          for the manifestation of his patience. And the sacrifices of the law,
          wherein the life of a beast was accepted for the sin of man,
          discovered the ground of his forbearance of them to be the expectation
          of the great Sacrifice, whereby sin was to be completely expiated
          (Gen. viii. 21). The publication of his patience to the end of the
          world is presently after the sweet savor he found in Noah’s sacrifice.
          The promised and designed coming of Christ, was the cause of that
          patience God exercised before in the world; and his gathering the
          elect together, is the reason of his patience since his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The naturalness of his veracity and holiness, and the strictness of
          his justice, are no bars to the exercise of his patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) His veracity. In those threatenings where the punishment is
          expressed, but not the time of inflicting it prefixed and determined
          in the threatening, his veracity suffers no damage by the delaying
          execution; so it be once done, though a long time after, the credit of
          his truth stands unshaken: as when God promises a thing without fixing
          the time, he is at liberty to pitch upon what time he pleases for the
          performance of it, without staining his faithfulness to his word, by
          not giving the thing promised presently. Why should the deferring of
          justice upon an offender be any more against his veracity than his
          delaying an answer to the petitions of a suppliant? But the difference
          will lie in the threatening. “In the day thou eatest thereof, thou
          shalt die the death” (Gen. ii. 17). The time was there settled; “in
          that day thou shalt die;” some refer “day” to eating, not to dying;
          and render the sentence thus: I do not prohibit thee the eating this
          fruit for a day or two, but continually. In whatsoever day thou eatest
          thereof, thou shalt die; but not understanding his dying that very day
          he should eat of it; referring “day” to the extensiveness of the
          prohibition, as to time. But to leave this as uncertain, it may be
          answered, that as in some threatenings a condition is implied, though
          not expressed, as in that positive denouncing of the destruction of
          Ninevah: “Yet forty days, and Ninevah shall be destroyed” (Jonah iii.
          4), the condition is implied; unless they humble themselves, and
          repent; for upon their repentance, the sentence was deferred. So here,
          “in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death,” or
          certainly die, unless there be a way found for the expiation of thy
          crime, and the righting my honor. This condition, in regard of the
          event, may as well be asserted to be implied in this threatening, as
          that of repentance was in the other; or rather, “thou shalt die,” thou
          shalt die spiritually, thou shalt lose that image of mine in thy
          nature, that righteousness which is as much the life of thy soul as
          thy soul is the life of thy body; that righteousness whereby thou art
          enabled to live to me and thy own happiness. What the soul is to the
          body, a quickening soul, that the image of God is to the soul, a
          quickening image. Or “thou shalt die the death,” or certainly die;
          thou shalt be liable to death. And so it is to be understood, not of
          an actual death of the body, but the merit of death, and the necessity
          of death; thou wilt be obnoxious to death, which will be avoided, if
          thou dost forbear to eat of the forbidden fruit; thou shalt be a
          guilty person, and so under a sentence of death, that I may, when I
          please, inflict it on thee.1030 Death did come upon Adam that day,
          because his nature was vitiated; he was then also under an expectation
          of death, he was obnoxious to it, though that day it was not poured
          out upon him in the full bitterness and gall of it: as when the
          apostle saith, “The body is dead because of sin” (Rom. viii. 10), he
          speaks to the living, and yet tells them the body was dead because of
          sin; he means no more than that it was under a sentence, and so a
          necessity of dying, though not actually dead; so thou shalt be under
          the sentence of death that day, as certainly as if that day thou
          shouldst sink into the dust: and as by his patience towards man, not
          sending forth death upon him in all the bitter ingredients of it, his
          justice afterwards was more eminent upon man’s surety, than it would
          have been if it had been then employed in all its severe operations
          upon man. So was his veracity eminent also in making good this
          threatening, in inflicting the punishment included in it upon our
          nature assumed by a mighty Person, and upon that Person in our nature,
          who was infinitely higher than our nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) His justice and righteousness are not prejudiced by his patience.
          There is a hatred of the sin in his holiness, and a sentence past
          against the sin in his justice, though the execution of that sentence
          be suspended, and the person reprieved by patience, which is implied
          (Eccles. viii. 11): “Because sentence against an evil work is not
          executed speedily; therefore, the heart of the sons of men is fully
          set in them to do evil;” sentence is past, but a speedy execution is
          stopped. Some of the heathens, who would not imagine God unjust, and
          yet, seeing the villanies and oppressions of men in the world remain
          unpunished, and frequently beholding prosperous wickedness, to free
          him from the charge of injustice, denied his providence and actual
          government of the world; for if he did take notice of human affairs,
          and concern himself in what was done upon the earth, they could not
          think an Infinite Goodness and Justice could be so slow to punish
          oppressors, and relieve the miserable, and leave the world in that
          disorder under the injustice of men: they judged such a patience as
          was exercised by him, if he did govern the world, was drawn out beyond
          the line of fit and just. Is it not a presumption in men to prescribe
          a rule of righteousness and conveniency to their Creator? It might be
          demanded of such, whether they never injured any in their lives; and
          when certainly they have one way or another, would they not think it a
          very unworthy, if not unjust, thing, that a person so injured by them
          should take a speedy and severe revenge on them?—and if every man
          should do the like, would there not be a speedy despatch made of
          mankind? Would not the world be a shambles, and men rush forwards to
          one another’s destructions, for the wrongs they have mutually
          received? If it be accounted a virtue in man, and no unrighteousness,
          not presently to be all on fire against an offence; by what right
          should any question the inconsistency of God’s patience with his
          justice? Do we praise the lenity of parents to children, and shall we
          disparage the long‑suffering of God to men? We do not censure the
          righteousness of physicians and chirurgeons, because they cut not off
          a corrupt member this day as well as to‑morrow? And is it just to
          asperse God, because he doth defer his vengeance which man assumes to
          himself a right to do? We never account him a bad governor that defers
          the trial, and consequently the condemnation and execution of a
          notorious offender for important reasons, and beneficial to the
          public, either to make the nature of his crime more evident, or to
          find out the rest of his complices by his discovery. A governor,
          indeed, were unjust, if he commanded that which were unrighteous, and
          forbade that which were worthy and commendable; but if he delays the
          execution of a convict offender for weighty reasons, either for the
          benefit of the state whereof he is the ruler, or for some advantage to
          the offender himself, to make him have a sense of, and a regret for
          his offence, we account him not unjust for this. God doth not by his
          patience dispense with the holiness of his law, nor cut off anything
          from its due authority. If men do strengthen themselves by his
          long‑suffering against his law, it is their fault, not any
          unrighteousness in him; he will take a time to vindicate the
          righteousness of his own commands, if men will wholly neglect the time
          of his patience, in forbearing to pay a dutiful observance to his
          precept. If justice be natural to him, and he cannot but punish sin,
          yet he is not necessitated to consume sinners, as the fire doth
          stubble put into it, which hath no command over its own qualities to
          restrain them from acting; but God is a free agent, and may choose his
          own time for the distribution of that punishment his nature leads him
          to. Though he be naturally just, yet it is not so natural to him, as
          to deprive him of a dominion over his own acts, and a freedom in the
          exerting them what time he judgeth most convenient in his wisdom. God
          is necessarily holy, and is necessarily angry with sin; his nature can
          never like it, and cannot but be displeased with it; yet he hath a
          liberty to restrain the effects of this anger for a time, without
          disgracing his holiness, or being interpreted to act unrighteously; as
          well as a prince or state may suspend the execution of a law, which
          they will never break, only for a time and for a public benefit. If
          God should presently execute his justice, this perfection of patience,
          which is a part of his goodness, would never have an opportunity of
          discovery; part of his glory, for which he created the world, would
          lie in obscurity from the knowledge of his creature; his justice would
          be signal in the destruction of sinners, but this stream of his
          goodness would be stopped up from any motion. One perfection must not
          cloud another; God hath his seasons to discover all, one after
          another: “The times and seasons are in his own power” (Acts i. 7): the
          seasons of manifesting his own perfections as well as other things;
          succession of them, in their distinct appearance, makes no invasion
          upon the rights of any. If justice should complain of an injury from
          patience, because it is delayed, patience hath more reason to complain
          of an injury from justice, that by such a plea it would be wholly
          obscured and inactive: for this perfection hath the shortest time to
          act its part of any, it hath no stage but this world to move in; mercy
          hath a heaven, and justice a hell, to display itself to eternity, but
          long‑suffering hath only a short‑lived earth for the compass of its
          operation. Again, justice is so far from being wronged by patience,
          that it rather is made more illustrious, and hath the fuller scope to
          exercise itself; it is the more righted for being deferred, and will
          have stronger grounds than before for its activity; the equity of it
          will be more apparent to every reason, the objections more fully
          answered against it, when the way of dealing with sinners by patience
          hath been slighted. When this dam of long‑suffering is removed, the
          floods of fiery justice will rush down with more force and violence;
          justice will be fully recompensed for the delay, when, after patience
          is abused, it can spread itself over the offender with a more
          unquestionable authority; it will have more arguments to hit the
          sinner in the teeth with, and silence him; there will be a sharper
          edge for every stroke; the sinner must not only pay for the score of
          his former sins, but the score of abused patience, so that justice
          hath no reason to commence a suit against God’s slowness to anger:
          what it shall want by the fulness of mercy upon the truly penitent, it
          will gain by the contempt of patience on the impenitent abusers. When
          men, by such a carriage, are ripened for the stroke of justice,
          justice may strike without any regret in itself, or pull‑back from
          mercy; the contempt of long‑suffering will silence the pleas of the
          one, and spirit the severity of the other. To conclude: since God hath
          glorified his justice on Christ, as a surety for sinners, his patience
          is so far from interfering with the rights of his justice, that it
          promotes it; it is dispensed to this end, that God might pardon with
          honor, both upon the score of purchased mercy and contented justice;
          that by a penitent sinner’s return his mercy might be acknowledged
          free, and the satisfaction of his justice by Christ be glorified in
          believing: for he is long‑suffering from an unwillingness “that any
          should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Pet. iii.
          9); i. e. all to whom the promise is made, for to such the apostle
          speaks, and calls it “long‑suffering to us‑ward;” and repentance being
          an acknowledgment of the demerit of sin, and a breaking off
          unrighteousness, gives a particular glory to the freeness of mercy,
          and the equity of justice.

        <p>
          II. The second thing, How this patience or slowness to anger is
          manifested.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To our first parents. His slowness to anger was evidenced in not
          directing his artillery against them, when they first attempted to
          rebel. He might have struck them dead when they began to bite at the
          temptation, and were inclinable to a surrender; for it was a degree of
          sinning, and a breach of loyalty as well, though not so much as the
          consummating act. God might have given way to the floods of his wrath
          at the first spring of man’s aspiring thoughts, when the monstrous
          motion of being as God began to be curdled in his heart; but he took
          no notice of any of their embryo sins till they came to a ripeness,
          and started out of the womb of their minds into the open air: and
          after he had brought his sin to perfection, God did not presently send
          that death upon him, which he had merited, but continued his life to
          the space of 930 years (Gen. v. 5). The sun and stars were not
          arrested from doing their office for him. Creatures were continued for
          his use, the earth did not swallow him up, nor a thunderbolt from
          heaven raze out the memory of him. Though he had deserved to be
          treated with such a severity for his ungrateful demeanor to his
          Creator and Benefactor, and affecting an equality with him, yet God
          continued him with a sufficiency for his content, after he turned
          rebel, though not with such a liberality as when he remained a loyal
          subject; and though he foresaw that he would not make an end of
          sinning, but with an end of living, he used him not in the same manner
          as he had used the devils. He added days and years to him, after he
          had deserved death, and hath for this 5,000 years continued the
          propagation of mankind, and derived from his loins an innumerable
          posterity, and hath crowned multitudes of them with hoary heads. He
          might have extinguished human race at the first; but since he hath
          preserved it till this day, it must be interpreted nothing else but
          the effect of an admirable patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His slowness to anger is manifest to the Gentiles. What they were,
          we need no other witness than the apostle Paul, who sums up many of
          their crimes (Rom. i. 29‒32). He doth preface the catalogue with a
          comprehensive expression, “Being filled with all unrighteousness;” and
          concludes it with a dreadful aggravation, “They not only do the same,
          but have pleasure in them that do them.” They were so soaked and
          naturalized in wickedness, that they had no delight, and found no
          sweetness in anything else but what was in itself abominable; all of
          them were plunged in idolatry and superstition; none of them but
          either set up their great men, or creatures, beneficial to the world,
          and some the damned spirits in his stead, and paid an adoration to
          insensible creatures or devils, which was due to God. Some were so
          depraved in their lives and actions, that it seemed to be the interest
          of the rest of the world, that they should have been extinguished for
          the instruction of their contemporaries and posterity. The best of
          them had turned all religion into a fable, coined a world of rites,
          some unnatural in themselves, and most of them unbecoming a rational
          creature to offer, and a Deity to accept: yet he did not presently arm
          himself against them with fire and sword, nor stopped the course of
          their generations, nor tear out all those relics of natural light
          which were left in their minds. He did not do what he might have done,
          but he winked at the “times of that ignorance” (Acts xvii. 30), their
          ignorant idolatry; for that it refers to (ver. 29): “They thought the
          Godhead was like to gold or silver, or stone graven by art, and men’s
          device;” ὑπεριδὼν, overlooking them. He demeaned himself so, as if he
          did not take notice of them. He winked as if he did not see them, and
          would not deal so severely with them: the eye of his justice seemed to
          wink, in not calling them to an account for their sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. His slowness to anger is manifest to the Israelites. You know how
          often they are called a “stiff‑necked people;” they are said to do
          evil “from their youth;” i. e. from the time wherein they were erected
          a nation and commonwealth; and that “the city had been a provocation
          of his anger, and of his fury, from the day that they built it, even
          to this day;” i. e. the day of Jeremiah’s prophecy, “that he should
          remove it from before his face” (Jer. xxxii. 31): from the days of
          Solomon, say some, which is too much a curtailing of the text, as
          though their provocations had taken date no higher than from the time
          of Solomon’s rearing the temple, and beautifying the city, whereby it
          seemed to be a new building. They began more early; they scarce
          discontinued their revolting from God; they were a “grief to him forty
          years together in the wilderness” (Ps. xcv. 10), “yet he suffered
          their manners” (Acts xiii. 18). He bore with their ill‑behaviour and
          sauciness towards him; and no sooner was Joshua’s head laid, and the
          elders, that were their conductors, gathered to their fathers, but the
          next generation forsook God, and smutted themselves with the idolatry
          of the nations (Judges ii. 7, 10, 11): and when he punished them by
          prospering the arms of their enemies against them, they were no sooner
          delivered upon their cry and humiliation, but they began a new scene
          of idolatry; and though he brought upon them the power of the
          Babylonian empire, and laid chains upon them to bring them to their
          right mind. And at seventy years’ end he struck off their chains, by
          altering the whole posture of affairs in that part of the world for
          their sakes: overturning one empire, and settling another for their
          restoration to their ancient city. And though they did not after
          disown him for their God, and set up “Baal in his throne,” yet they
          multiplied foolish traditions, whereby they impaired the authority of
          the law; yet he sustained them with a wonderful patience, and
          preferred them before all other people in the first offers of the
          gospel; and after they had outraged not only his servants, the
          prophets, but his Son, the Redeemer, yet he did not forsake them, but
          employed his apostles to solicit them, and publish among them the
          doctrine of salvation: so that his treating this people might well be
          called “much long‑suffering,” it being above 1500 years, wherein he
          bore with them, or mildly punished them, far less than their deserts;
          their coming out of Egypt being about the year of the world 2450, and
          their final destruction as a commonwealth, not till about forty years
          after the death of Christ; and all this while his patience did
          sometimes wholly restrain his justice, and sometimes let it fall upon
          them in some few drops, but made no total devastation of their
          country, nor wrote his revenge in extraordinary bloody characters,
          till the Roman conquest, wherein he put a period to them both as a
          church and state. In particular this patience is manifest,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. In his giving warnings of judgments, before he orders them to go
          forth. He doth not punish in a passion, and hastily; he speaks before
          he strikes, and speaks that he may not strike. Wrath is published
          before it is executed, and that a long time; an hundred and twenty
          years’ advertisement was given to a debauched world before the heavens
          were opened, to spout down a deluge upon them. He will not be accused
          of coming unawares upon a people; he inflicts nothing but what he
          foretold either immediately to the people that provoke him, or
          anciently to them that have been their forerunners in the same
          provocation (Hos. vii. 12), “I will chastise them, as their
          congregation hath heard.” Many of the leaves of the Old Testament are
          full of those presages and warnings of approaching judgment. These
          make up a great part of the volume of it in various editions,
          according to the state of the several provoking times. Warnings are
          given to those people that are most abominable in his sight (Zeph. ii.
          1, 2); “Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
          desired,”—it is a Meiosis, O nation abhorred,—“before the decree bring
          forth.” He sends his heralds before he sends his armies; he summons
          them by the voice of his prophets, before he confounds them by the
          voice of his thunders. When a parley is beaten, a white flag of peace
          is hung out, before a black flag of fury is set up. He seldom cuts
          down men by his judgments, before he hath “hewed them by his prophets”
          (Hos. vi. 5). Not a remarkable judgment but was foretold: the flood to
          the old world by Noah; the famine to Egypt by Joseph; the earthquake
          by Amos (ch. i. 1); the storm from Chaldea by Jeremiah; the captivity
          of the ten tribes by Hosea; the total destruction of Jerusalem and the
          Temple by Christ himself. He hath chosen the best persons in the world
          to give those intimations; Noah, the most righteous person on the
          earth, for the old world; and his Son, the most beloved person in
          heaven, for the Jews in the later time: and in other parts of the
          world, and in the later times, where he hath not warned by prophets,
          he hath supplied it by prodigies in the air and earth; histories are
          full of such items from heaven. Lesser judgments are forewarners of
          greater, as lightnings before thunder are messengers to tell us of a
          succeeding clap.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) He doth often give warning of judgments. He comes not to
          extremity, till he hath often shaken the rod over men; he thunders
          often, before he crusheth them with his thunderbolt; he doth not till
          after the first and second admonition punish a rebel, as he would have
          us reject a heretic. “He speaks once, yea, twice” (Job xxxiii. 14),
          “and man perceives it not;” he sends one message after another, and
          waits the success of many messages before he strikes. Eight prophets
          were ordered to acquaint the whole world with approaching judgment (2
          Pet. ii. 5): he saved “Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of
          righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly,”
          called “the eighth” in respect of his preaching, not in regard of his
          preservation; he was the eighth preacher in order, from the beginning
          of the world, that endeavored to restore the world to the way of
          righteousness. Most, indeed, consider him here as the eighth person
          saved, so do our translators; and, therefore, add person, which is not
          in the Greek. Some others consider him here as the eighth preacher of
          righteousness, reckoning Enoch, the son of Seth, the first, grounding
          it upon Gen. iv. 26: “Then began men to call upon the name of the
          Lord,” Heb. “Then it was began to call in the name of the Lord,” τὸ
          ὄνομα τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ. Sept. “He began to call in the name of the
          Lord,” which others render, “He began to preach, or call upon men in
          the name of the Lord.” The word קרא signifies to preach, or to call
          upon men by preaching (Prov. i. 21): “Wisdom crieth,” or “preaches;”
          and if this be so, as it is very probable, it is easy to reckon him
          the eighth preacher, by numbering the successive heads of the
          generations (Gen. v.), beginning at Enoch, the first preacher of
          righteousness. So many there were before God choked the old world with
          water, and swept them away. It is clear he often did admonish, by his
          prophets, the Jews of their sin, and the wrath which should come upon
          them.1031 One prophet, Hosea, prophesied seventy years; for he
          prophesied in the days of four kings of Judah, and one of Israel,
          Jeroboam, the son of Joash (Hos. i. 1), or Jeroboam, the second of
          that name. Uzziah, king of Judah, in whose reign Hosea prophesied,
          lived thirty‑eight years after the death of Jeroboam. The second
          Jotham, Uzziah’s successor, reigned sixteen years; Ahaz sixteen;
          Hezekiah twenty‑nine years. Now, take nothing of Hezekiah’s time, and
          date the beginning of his prophecy from the last year of Jeroboam’s
          reign, and the time of Hosea’s prophecy will be seventy years
          complete; wherein God warned those people, and waited the return
          particularly of Israel;1032 and not less than five of those we call
          the Lesser Prophets, were sent to foretell the destruction of the ten
          tribes, and to call them to repentance,—Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah,
          Jonah; and though we have nothing of Jonah’s prophecy in this concern
          of Israel, yet that he lived in the time of the same Jeroboam, and
          prophesied things which are not upon record in the book of Jonah, is
          clear (2 Kings xiv. 25). And besides those, Isaiah prophesied also in
          the reign of the same kings as Hosea did (Isa. i. 1); and it is God’s
          usual method to send forth his servants, and when their admonitions
          are slighted he commissions others, before he sends out his destroying
          armies (Matt. xxii. 3, 4, 7).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He doth often give warning of judgments, that he might not pour
          out his wrath. He summons them to a surrender of themselves, and a
          return from their rebellion, that they might not feel the force of his
          arms. He offers peace before he shakes off the dust of his feet, that
          his despised peace might not return in vain to him to solicit a
          revenge from his anger. He hath a right to punish upon the first
          commission of a crime, but he warns men of what they have deserved, of
          what his justice moves him to inflict, that by having recourse to his
          mercy he might not exercise the rights of his justice. God sought to
          kill Moses for not circumcising his son (Exod. iv. 24). Could God,
          that sought it, miss a way to do it? Could a creature lurch, or fly
          from him? God put on the garb of an enemy, that Moses might be
          discouraged from being an instrument of his own ruin: God manifested
          an anger against Moses for his neglect, as if he would then have
          destroyed him, that Moses might prevent it by casting off his
          carelessness, and doing his duty. He sought to kill him by some
          evident sign, that Moses might escape the judgment by his obedience.
          He threatens Nineveh, by the prophet, with destruction, that Nineveh’s
          repentance might make void the prophecy. He fights with men by the
          sword of his mouth, that he might not pierce them by the sword of his
          wrath. He threatens, that men might prevent the execution of his
          threatening; he terrifies, that he might not destroy, but that men by
          humiliation may lie prostrate before him, and move the bowels of his
          mercy to a louder sound than the voice of his anger. He takes time to
          whet his sword, that men may turn themselves from the edge of it. He
          roars like a lion, that men, by hearing his voice, may shelter
          themselves from being torn by his wrath. There is patience in the
          sharpest threatening, that we may avoid the scourge. Who can charge
          God with an eagerness to revenge, that sends so many heralds, and so
          often before he strikes, that he might be prevented from striking? His
          threatenings have not so much of a black flag as of an olive branch.
          He lifts up his hand before he strikes, that men might see and avert
          the stroke (Isa. xxvi. 11).
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. His patience is manifest in long delaying his threatened
          judgments, though he finds no repentance in the rebels. He doth
          sometimes delay his lighter punishments, because he doth not delight
          in torturing his creatures; but he doth longer delay his destroying
          punishments, such as put an end to men’s happiness, and remit them to
          their final and unchangeable state; because he “doth not delight in
          the death of a sinner.” While he is preparing his arrows, he is
          waiting for an occasion to lay them aside, and dull their points, that
          he may with honor march back again, and disband his armies. He brings
          lighter smarts sooner, that men might not think him asleep, but he
          suspends the more terrible judgments that men might be led to
          repentance. He scatters not his consuming fires at the first, but
          brings on ruining vengeance with a “slow pace; sentence against an
          evil work is not speedily executed” (Eccles. viii. 11). The Jews
          therefore say, that Michael, the minister of justice, flies with one
          wing, but Gabriel, the minister of mercy, with two. An hundred and
          twenty years did God wait upon the old world, and delay their
          punishment all the time the “ark was preparing” (1 Pet. iii. 20);
          wherein that wicked generation did not enjoy only a bare patience, but
          a striving patience (Gen. vi. 3): “My Spirit shall not always strive
          with man, yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years,” the
          days wherein I will strive with him; that his long‑suffering might not
          lose all its fruit, and remit the objects of it into the hands of
          consuming justice. It was the tenth generation of the world from Adam,
          when the deluge overflowed it, so long did God bear with them: and the
          tenth generation from Noah wherein Sodom was consumed. God did not
          come to keep his assizes in Sodom, till “the cry of their sins was
          very strong,” that it had been a wrong to his justice to have
          restrained it any longer. The cry was so loud that he could not be at
          quiet, as it were, on his throne of glory for the disturbing noise
          (Gen. xviii. 20, 21). Sin transgresseth the law; the law being
          violated, solicits justice; justice, being urged, pleads for
          punishment; the cry of their sins did, as it were, force him from
          heaven to come down, and examine what cause there was for that clamor.
          Sin cries loud and long before he takes his sword in hand. Four
          hundred years he kept off deserved destruction from the Amorites, and
          deferred making good his promise to Abraham, of giving Canaan to his
          posterity, out of his long‑suffering to the Amorites (Gen. xv. 16). In
          the fourth generation they shall come hither again, “for the iniquity
          of the Amorites is not yet full.” Their measure was filling then, but
          not so full as to put a stop to any further patience till four hundred
          years after. The usual time in succeeding generations, from the
          denouncing of judgments to the execution, is forty years; this some
          ground upon Ezek. iv. 6, “Thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of
          Judah forty days,” taking each day for a year. Though Hosea lived
          seventy years, yet from the beginning of his prophesying judgments
          against Israel to the pouring them out upon that idolatrous people, it
          was forty years. Hosea, as was mentioned before, prophesied against
          them in the days of Jeroboam the Second, in whose time God did
          wonderfully deliver Israel (2 Kings xiv. 26, 27). From that time, till
          the total destruction of the ten tribes, it was forty years, as may
          easily be computed from the story (2 Kings xv.‒xvi.), by the reign of
          the succeeding kings. So forty years after the most horrid villany
          that ever was committed in the face of the sun, viz., the crucifying
          the Son of God, was Jerusalem destroyed, and the inhabitants captived;
          so long did God delay a visible punishment for such an outrage.
          Sometimes he prolongs sending a threatened judgment upon a mere shadow
          of humiliation; so he did that denounced against Ahab. He turned it
          over to his posterity, and adjourned it to another season (1 Kings
          xxi. 29). He doth not issue out an arrest upon one transgression; you
          often find him not commencing a suit against men till “three and four
          transgressions.” The first of Amos, all along that chapter and the
          second chapter, for “three and four,” i. e. “seven;” a certain number
          for an uncertain. He gives not orders to his judgments to march till
          men be obstinate, and refuse any commerce with him; he stops them till
          “there be no remedy” (2 Chron. xxxvi. 16). It must be a great
          wickedness that gives vent to them (Hos. x. 15); Heb. “Your wickedness
          of wickedness.” He is so “slow to anger,” and stays the punishment his
          enemies deserve, that he may seem to have forgot his “kindness to his
          friends” (Ps. xliv. 24): “Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and
          forgettest our affliction and oppression?” He lets his people groan
          under the yoke of their enemies, as if he were made up of kindness to
          his enemies, and anger against his friends. This delaying of
          punishment to evil men is visible in his suspending the terrifying
          acts of conscience, and supporting it only in its checking,
          admonishing, and controlling acts. The patience of a governor is seen
          in the patient mildness of his deputy: David’s conscience did not
          terrify him till nine months after his sin of murder. Should God set
          open the mouth of this power within us, not only the earth, but our
          own bodies and spirits, would be a burden to us: it is long before God
          puts scorpions into the hands of men’s consciences to scourge them: he
          holds back the rod, waiting for the hour of our return, as if that
          would be a recompense for our offences and his forbearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. His patience is manifest in his unwillingness to execute his
          judgments when he can delay no longer. “He doth not afflict willingly,
          nor grieve the children of men.” (Lam. iii. 33): Heb. “He doth not
          afflict from his heart:” he takes no pleasure in it, as he is Creator.
          The height of men’s provocations, and the necessity of the preserving
          his rights, and vindicating his laws, obligeth him to it, as he is the
          Governor of the world; as a judge may willingly condemn a malefactor
          to death out of affection to the laws, and desire to preserve the
          order of government, but unwillingly, out of compassion to the
          offender himself. When he resolved upon the destruction of the old
          world, he spake it as a God grieved with an occasion of punishment
          (Gen. vi. 6, 7, compared together). When he came to reckon with Adam,
          “he walked,” he did not run with his sword in his hand upon him, as a
          mighty man with an eagerness to destroy him (Gen. iii. 8), and that
          “in the cool of the day,” a time when men, tired in the day, are
          unwilling to engage in a hard employment. His exercising judgment is a
          “coming out of his place” (Isa. xxvi. 21; Mic. i. 3): he comes out of
          his station to exercise judgment; a throne is more his place than a
          tribunal. Every prophecy, loaded with threatenings, is called the
          “burden of the Lord;” a burden to him to execute it, as well as to men
          to suffer it. Though three angels came to Abraham about the punishment
          of Sodom, whereof one Abraham speaks to as to God, yet but two
          appeared at the destruction of Sodom, as if the Governor of the world
          were unwilling to be present at such dreadful work (Gen. xix. 1): and
          when the man, that had the ink‑horn by his side, that was appointed to
          mark those that were to be preserved in the common destruction,
          returned to give an account of the performing his commission (Ezek.
          ix. 10), we read not of the return of those that were to kill, as if
          God delighted only to hear again of his works of mercy, and had no
          mind to hear again of his severe proceedings. The Jews, to show God’s
          unwillingness to punish, imagine that hell was created the second day,
          because that day’s work is not pronounced good by God as all the other
          days’ works are1033 (Gen. i. 8).
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) When God doth punish he doth it with some regret. When he hurls
          down his thunders, he seems to do it with a backward hand, because
          with an unwilling heart.1034 He created, saith Chrysostom, the world
          in six days, but was seven days in destroying one city, Jericho, which
          he had before devoted to be razed to the ground. What is the reason,
          saith he, that God is so quick to build up, but slow to pull down? His
          goodness excites his power to the one, but is not earnest to persuade
          him to the other: when he comes to strike, he doth it with a sigh or
          groan (Isa. i. 24): “Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge
          me on my enemies,” הוי, Ah! a note of grief. So Hos. vi. 4, “O
          Ephraim! what shall I do unto thee? O Judah! what shall I do unto
          thee?” It is an addubitatio, a figure in rhetoric, as if God were
          troubled that he must deal so sharply with them, and give them up to
          their enemies:—I have tried all means to reclaim you; I have used all
          ways of kindness, and nothing prevails; what shall I do? my mercy
          invites me to spare them, and their ingratitude provokes me to ruin
          them. God had borne with that people of Israel almost three hundred
          years, from the setting up of the calves at Dan and Bethel; sent many
          a prophet to warn them, and spent many a rod to reform them: and when
          he comes to execute his threatenings, he doth with a conflict in
          himself (Hos. xi. 8): “How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? how shall
          I deliver thee, Israel?” as if there were a pull‑back in his own
          bowels. He solemnizeth their approaching funeral with a hearty groan,
          and takes his farewell of the dying malefactor with a pang in himself.
          How often, in former times, when he had signed a warrant for their
          execution, did he call it back? (Ps. lxxviii. 38): “Many a time turned
          he his anger away.” Many a time he recalled or ordered his anger to
          return again, as the word signifies, as if he were irresolute what to
          do: he recalled it, as a man doth his servant, several times, when he
          is sending him upon an unwelcome message; or as a tender‑hearted
          prince wavers and trembles when he is to sign a writ for the death of
          a rebel that hath been before his favorite, as if, when he had signed
          the writ, he blotted out his name again, and flung away the pen. And
          his method is remarkable when he came to punish Sodom; though the cry
          of their sin had been fierce in his ears, yet when he comes to make
          inquisition, he declares his intention to Abraham, as if he were
          desirous that Abraham should have helped him to some arguments to stop
          the outgoings of his judgment. He gave liberty to the best person in
          the world to stand in the gap, and enter into a treaty with him, to
          show, saith one,1035 how willingly his mercy would have compounded
          with his justice for their redemption; and Abraham interceded so long,
          till he was ashamed for pleading the cause of patience and mercy to
          the wrong of the rights of Divine justice. Perhaps, had Abraham had
          the courage to ask, God would have had the compassion to grant a
          reprieve just at the time of execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) His patience is manifest in that when he begins to send out his
          judgments, he doth it by degrees. His judgments are “as the morning
          light,” which goes forth by degrees in the hemisphere (Hos. vi. 5). He
          doth not shoot all his thunders at once, and bring his sharpest
          judgments in array at one time, but gradually, that a people may have
          time to turn to him (Joel i. 4). First the palmer‑worm, then the
          locust, then the canker‑worm, then the caterpillar; what one left, the
          other was to eat, if there were not a timely return. A Jewish
          writer1036 saith, these judgments came not all in one year, but one
          year after another. The palmer‑worm and locust might have eaten all,
          but Divine patience set bounds to the devouring creatures. God had
          been first as a moth to Israel (Hos. v. 12): “Therefore will I be to
          the house of Ephraim as a moth;” Rivet translates it, “I have been;”
          in the Hebrew it is “I,” without adding “I have been,” or “I will be,”
          and more probably “I have been;” I was as a moth, which makes little
          holes in a garment, and consumes it not all at once; and as
          “rottenness to the house of Judah,” or a worm that eats into wood by
          degrees. Indeed, this people had consumed insensibly, partly by civil
          combustions, change of governors, foreign invasions, yet they were as
          obstinate in their idolatry as ever; at last God would be no longer to
          them as a moth, but as a lion, tear and go away (ver. 14): so Hos.
          ii., God had disowned Israel for his spouse (ver. 2), “She is not my
          wife, neither am I her husband;” yet he had not taken away her
          ornaments, which by the right of divorce he might have done, but still
          expected her reformation, for that the threatening intimates (ver. 3);
          let her put away her whoredom, “lest I strip her naked, and set her as
          in the day when she was born.” If she returned, she might recover what
          she had lost; if not, she might be stripped of what remained: thus God
          dealt with Judah (Ezek. ix. 3). The glory of God goes first from the
          cherub to the threshold of the house, and stays there, as if he had a
          mind to be invited back again; then it goes from the threshold of the
          house, and stands over the cherubims, as if upon a penitent call it
          would drop down again to its ancient station and seat, over which it
          hovered (Ezek. x. 18); and when he was not solicited to return, he
          departs out of the city, and stood upon the mountain, which is on the
          east part of the city (Ezek. xi. 23), looking still towards, and
          hovering about the temple, which was on the east of Jerusalem, as if
          loth to depart, and abandon the place and people. He walks so
          leisurely, with his rod in his hand, as if he had a mind rather to
          fling it away than use it; his patience in not pouring out all his
          vials, is more remarkable than his wrath in pouring out one or two.
          Thus hath God made his slowness to anger visible to us in the gradual
          punishment of us; first, the pestilence on this city, then firing our
          houses, consumption of trade; these have not been answered with such a
          carriage as God expects, therefore a greater is reserved. I dare
          prognosticate, upon reasons you may gather from what hath been spoke
          before, if I be not much mistaken, the forty years of his usual
          patience are very near expired; he hath inflicted some, that he might
          be met with in a way of repentance, and omit with honor the inflicting
          the remainder.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. His patience is manifest, in moderating his judgments, when he
          sends them. Doth he empty his quiver of his arrows, or exhaust his
          magazines of thunder? No; he could roll one thunderbolt successively
          upon all mankind; it is as easy with him to create a perpetual motion
          of lightning and thunder, as of the sun and stars, and make the world
          as terrible by the one, as it is delightful by the other. He opens not
          all his store, he sends out a light party to skirmish with men, and
          puts not in array his whole army; “He stirs not up all his wrath” (Ps.
          lxxviii. 38); he doth but pinch, where he might have torn asunder;
          when he takes away much, he leaves enough to support us; if he had
          stirred up all his anger, he had taken away all, and our lives to
          boot. He rakes up but a few sparks, takes but one firebrand to fling
          upon men, when he might discharge the whole furnace upon them; he
          sends but a few drops out of the cloud, which he might make to break
          in the gross, and fall down upon our heads to overwhelm us; he abates
          much of what he might do. When he might sweep away a whole nation by
          deluges of water, corruption of the air, or convulsions of the earth,
          or by other ways that are not wanting at his order; he picks out only
          some persons, some families, some cities; sends a plague into one
          house, and not into another; here is patience to the stock of a
          nation, while he inflicts punishment upon some of the most notorious
          sinners in it. Herod is suddenly snatched away, being willingly
          flattered into the thoughts of his being a god; God singled out the
          chief in the herd for whose sake he had been affronted by the rabble
          (Acts xii. 22, 23). Some find him sparing them, while others feel him
          destroying them; he arrests some, when he might seize all, all being
          his debtors; and often in great desolations brought upon a people for
          their sin, he hath left a stump in the earth, as Daniel speaks (Dan.
          iv. 15), for a nation to grow upon it again, and arise to a stronger
          constitution. He doth punish “less than our iniquities deserve” (Ezra
          ix. 13), and rewards us “not according to our iniquities” (Ps. ciii.
          10). The greatness of any punishment in this life, answers not the
          greatness of the crime. Though there be an equity in whatsoever he
          doth, yet there is not an equality to what we deserve; our iniquities
          would justify a severer treating of us; his justice goes not here to
          the end of its line, it is stopped in its progress, and the blows of
          it weakened by his patience; he did not curse the earth after Adam’s
          fall, that it should bring forth no fruit, but that it should not
          bring forth fruit without the wearisome toil of man, and subjected him
          to distempers presently, but inflicted not death immediately; while he
          punished him, he supported him; and while he expelled him from
          paradise, he did not order him not to cast his eye towards it, and
          conceive some hopes of regaining that happy place.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. His patience is seen in giving great mercies after provocations.
          He is so slow to anger, that he heaps many kindnesses upon a rebel,
          instead of punishment. There is a prosperous wickedness, wherein the
          provoker’s strength continues firm; the troubles, which like clouds
          drop upon others, are blown away from them, and they are “not plagued
          like other men,” that have a more worthy demeanor towards God (Ps.
          lxxiii. 3‒5). He doth not only continue their lives, but sends out
          fresh beams of his goodness upon them, and calls them by his
          blessings, that they may acknowledge their own fault and his bounty,
          which he is not obliged to by any gratitude he meets with from them,
          but by the richness of his own patient nature: for he finds the
          unthankfulness of men as great as his benefits to them. He doth not
          only continue his outward mercies, while we continue our sins, but
          sometimes gives fresh benefits after new provocations, that if
          possible he might excite an ingenuity in men. When Israel at the Red
          Sea flung dirt in the face of God, by quarrelling with his servant
          Moses for bringing them out of Egypt, and misjudging God in his design
          of deliverance, and were ready to submit themselves to their former
          oppressors (Exod. xiv. 11, 12), which might justly have urged God to
          say to them, Take your own course; yet he is not only patient under
          their unjust charge, but “makes bare his arm in a deliverance at the
          Red Sea,” that was to be an amazing monument to the world in all ages;
          and afterwards, when they repiningly quarrelled with him in their
          wants in the wilderness, he did not only not revenge himself upon
          them, or cast off the conduct of them, but bore with them by a
          miraculous long‑suffering, and supplied them with miraculous
          provision,—manna from heaven, and water from a rock. Food is given to
          support us, and clothes to cover us, and Divine patience makes the
          creature which we turn to another use than what they were at first
          intended for, serve us contrary to their own genius: for had they
          reason, no question but they would complain to be subjected to the
          service of man, who hath been so ungrateful to their Creator, and
          groan at the abuse of God’s patience, in the abuse they themselves
          suffer from the hands of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. All this is more manifest, if we consider the provocations he
          hath. Wherein his slowness to anger infinitely transcends the patience
          of any creature; nay, the spirits of all the angels and glorified
          saints in heaven, would be too narrow to bear the sins of the world
          for one day, nay, not so much as the sins of churches, which is a
          little spot in the whole world; it is because he is the Lord, one of
          an infinite power over himself, that not only the whole mass of the
          rebellious world, but of the sons of Jacob (either considered as a
          church and nation springing from the loins of Jacob, or considered as
          the regenerate part of the world, sometimes called the seed of Jacob),
          “are not consumed” (Mal. iii. 6). A Jonah was angry with God, for
          recalling his anger from a sinful people; had God committed the
          government of the world to the glorified saints, who are perfect in
          love and holiness, the world would have had an end long ago; they
          would have acted that which they sue for at the hands of God, and is
          not granted them. “How long, Lord, holy and true, dost thou not avenge
          our blood on them that dwell on the earth?” (Rev. vi. 10). God hath
          designs of patience above the world, above the unsinning angels, and
          perfectly renewed spirits in glory. The greatest created
          long‑suffering is infinitely disproportioned to the Divine: fire from
          heaven would have been showered down before the greatest part of a day
          were spent, if a created patience had the conduct of the world, though
          that creature were possessed with the spirit of patience, extracted
          from all the creatures which are in heaven, or are, or ever were upon
          the earth. Methinks Moses intimates this; for as soon as God had
          passed by, proclaiming his name gracious and long suffering, as soon
          as ever Moses had paid his adoration, he falls to praying that God
          would go with the Israelites; “For it is a stiff‑necked people” (Exod.
          xxxiv. 8, 9). What an argument is here for God to go along with them!
          he might rather, since he had heard him but just before say “he would
          by no means clear the guilty,” desire God to stand further off from
          them, for fear the fire of his wrath should burst out from him, to
          burn them as he did the Sodomites. But he considers, that as none but
          God had such anger to destroy them, so none but God had such a
          patience to bear with them; it is as much as if he should have said,
          Lord! if thou shouldest send the most tender‑hearted angel in heaven
          to have the guidance of this people, they would be a lost people; a
          period will quickly be set to their lives, no created strength can
          restrain its power from crushing such a stiff‑necked people; flesh and
          blood cannot bear them, nor any created spirit of a greater might.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Consider the greatness of the provocations. No light matter, but
          actions of a great defiance: what is the practical language of most in
          the world, but that of Pharaoh? “Who is the Lord, that I should obey
          him?” How many questions his being, and more his authority? What
          blasphemies of him, what reproaches of his Majesty! Men “drinking up
          iniquity like water,” and with a haste and ardency “rushing into sin,
          as the horse into the battle.” What is there in the reasonable
          creature, that hath the quickest capacity, and the deepest obligation
          to serve him, but opposition and enmity, a slight of him in
          everything, yea, the services most seriously performed, unsuited to
          the royalty and purity of so great a Being? such provocations as dare
          him to his face, that are a burden to so righteous a Judge, and so
          great a lover of the authority and majesty of his laws; that were
          there but a spark of anger in him, it is a wonder it doth not show
          itself. When he is invaded in all his attributes, it is astonishing
          that this single one of patience and meekness should withstand the
          assault of all the rest of his perfections; his being, which is
          attacked by sin, speaks for vengeance; his justice cannot be imagined
          to stand silent without charging the sinner. His holiness cannot but
          encourage his justice to urge its pleas, and be an advocate for it.
          His omniscience proves the truth of all the charge, and his abused
          mercy hath little encouragement to make opposition to the indictment;
          nothing but patience stands in the gap to keep off the arrest of
          judgment from the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) His patience is manifest, if you consider the multitudes of these
          provocations. Every man hath sin enough in a day to make him stand
          amazed at Divine patience, and to call it, as well as the apostle did,
          “all long‑suffering” (1 Tim. i. 16). How few duties of a perfectly
          right stamp are performed! What unworthy considerations mix
          themselves, like dross, with our purest and sincerest gold! How more
          numerous are the respects of the worshippers of him to themselves,
          than unto him! How many services are paid him, not out of love to him,
          but because he should do us no hurt, and some service; when we do not
          so much design to please him, as to please ourselves by expectations
          of a reward from him! What master would endure a servant that
          endeavored to please him, only because he should not kill him? Is that
          former charge of God upon the old world yet out of date, “That the
          imagination of the thoughts of the heart of man was only evil, and
          that continually?” (Gen. vi. 5.) Was not the new world as chargeable
          with it as the old? Certainly it was (Gen. viii. 21); and is of as
          much force this very minute as it was then. How many are the sins
          against knowledge, as well as those of ignorance; presumptuous sins,
          as well as those of infirmity! How numerous those of omission and
          commission! It is above the reach of any man’s understanding to
          conceive all the blasphemies, oaths, thefts, adulteries, murders,
          oppressions, contempt of religion, the open idolatries of Turks and
          heathens, the more spiritual and refined idolatries of others.1037 Add
          to those, the ingratitude of those that profess his name, their pride,
          earthliness, carelessness, sluggishness to Divine duties, and in every
          one of those a multitude of provocations; the whole man being engaged
          in every sin, the understanding contriving it, the will embracing it,
          the affections complying with it, and all the members of the body
          instruments in the acting the unrighteousness of it; every one of
          these faculties bestowed upon men by him, are armed against him in
          every act: and in every employment of them there is a distinct
          provocation, though centred in one sinful end and object. What are the
          offences all the men of the world receive from their fellow‑creatures,
          to the injuries God receives from men, but as a small dust of earth to
          the whole mass of earth and heaven too? What multitudes of sins is one
          profane wretch guilty of in the space of twenty, forty, fifty years?
          Who can compute the vast number of his transgressions, from the first
          use of reason to the time of the separation of his soul from his body,
          from his entrance into the world to his exit? What are those, to those
          of a whole village of the like inhabitants? What are those, to those
          of a great city? Who can number up all the foul‑mouthed oaths, the
          beastly excess, the goatish uncleanness, committed in the space of a
          day, year, twenty years in this city, much less in the whole nation,
          least of all, in the whole world? Were it no more than the common
          idolatry of former ages, when the whole world turned their backs upon
          their Creator, and passed him by to sue to a creature, a stock or
          stone, or a degraded spirit? How provoking would it be to a prince to
          see a whole city under his dominion deny him a respect, and pay it to
          his scullion, or the common executioner he employs! Add to this the
          unjust invasion of kings, the oppressions exercised upon men, all the
          private and public sins that have been in the world ever since it
          began. The Gentiles were described by the apostle (Rom. i. 29‒31), in
          a black character, “They were haters of God;” yet how did the “riches
          of his patience” preserve multitudes of such disingenuous persons, and
          how “many millions of such haters of him” breathe every day in his
          air, and are maintained by his bounty, have their tables spread, and
          their cups filled to the brim, and that, too, in the midst of
          reiterated belchings of their enmity against him? All are under
          sufficient provocations of him to the highest indignation. The
          presiding angels over nations could not forbear, in love and honor to
          their governor, to arm themselves to the destruction of their several
          charges, if Divine patience did not set them a pattern, and their
          obedience incline them to expect his orders, before they act what
          their zeal would prompt them to. The devils would be glad of a
          commission to destroy the world, but that his patience puts a stop to
          their fury, as well as his own justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Consider the long time of this patience. He spread out his hands
          “all the day” to a rebellious world (Isa. lxv. 2). All men’s day, all
          God’s day, which is a “thousand years,” he hath borne with the gross
          of mankind, with all the nations of the world in a long succession of
          ages, for five thousand years and upwards already, and will bear with
          them till the time comes for the world’s dissolution. He hath suffered
          the monstrous acts of men, and endured the contradictions of a sinful
          world against himself, from the first sin of Adam, to the last
          committed this minute. The line of his patience hath run along with
          the duration of the world to this day; and there is not any one of
          Adam’s posterity but hath been expensive to him, and partaken of the
          riches of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) All these he bears when he hath a sense of them. He sees every
          day the roll and catalogue of sin increasing; he hath a distinct view
          of every one, from the sin of Adam to the last filled up in his
          omniscience; and yet gives no order for the arrest of the world. He
          knows men fitted for destruction; all the instants he exerciseth
          long‑suffering towards them, which makes the apostle call it not
          simply long‑suffering, without the addition of πολλῇ, “much
          long‑suffering” (Rom. ix. 23). There is not a grain in the whole mass
          of sin, that he hath not a distinct knowledge of, and of the quality
          of it. He perfectly understands the greatness of his own majesty that
          is vilified, and the nature of the offence that doth disparage him. He
          is solicited by his justice, directed by his omniscience, and armed
          with judgments to vindicate himself, but his arm is restrained by
          patience. To conclude: no indignity is hid from him, no iniquity is
          beloved by him; the hatred of their sinfulness is infinite, and the
          knowledge of the malice is exact. The subsisting of the world under
          such weighty provocations, so numerous, so long time, and with his
          full sense of every one of them, is an evidence of such a “forbearance
          and long‑suffering,” that the addition of riches which the apostle
          puts to it (Rom. ii. 4), labors with an insufficiency clearly to
          display it.
        </p>
        <p>III. Why God doth exercise so much patience.</p>
        <p>
          1. To show himself appeasable. God did not declare by his patience to
          former ages, or any age, that he was appeased with them, or that they
          were in his favor; but that he was appeasable, that he was not an
          implacable enemy, but that they might find him favorable to them, if
          they did seek after him. The continuance of the world by patience, and
          the bestowing many mercies by goodness, were not a natural revelation
          of the manner how he would be appeased: that was made known only by
          the prophets, and after the coming of Christ by the apostles; and had
          indeed been intelligible in some sort to the whole world, had there
          been a faithfulness in Adam’s posterity, to transmit the tradition of
          the first promise to succeeding generations. Had not the knowledge of
          that died by their carelessness and neglect, it had been easy to tell
          the reason of God’s patience to be in order to the exhibition of the
          “Seed of the woman to bruise the serpent’s head.” They could not but
          naturally know themselves sinners, and worthy of death; they might, by
          easy reflections upon themselves, collect that they were not in that
          comely and harmonious posture now, as they were when God first wrought
          them with his own finger, and placed them as his lieutenants in the
          world; they knew they did grievously offend him; this they were taught
          by the sprinklings of his judgments among them sometimes. And since he
          did not utterly root up mankind, his sparing patience was a prologue
          of some further favors, or pardoning grace to be displayed to the
          world by some methods of God yet unknown to them. Though the earth was
          something impaired by the curse after the fall, yet the main pillars
          of it stood; the state of the natural motions of the creature was not
          changed; the heavens remained in the same posture wherein they were
          created; the sun, and moon, and other heavenly bodies, continued their
          usefulness and refreshing influences to man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heavens did still “declare the glory of God, day unto day” did
          “utter speech; their line is gone throughout all the earth, and their
          words to the end of the world” (Ps. xix. 1‒4): which declared God to
          be willing to do good to his creatures, and were as so many legible
          letters or rudiments, whereby they might read his patience, and that a
          further design of favor to the world lay hid in that patience. Paul
          applies this to the preaching of the gospel (Rom. x. 18): “Have they
          not heard the word of God? yes, verily, their sound went into all the
          earth, and their words unto the end of the world.” Redeeming grace
          could not be spelled out by them in a clear notion, but yet they did
          declare that which is the foundation of gospel mercy. Were not God
          patient, there were no room for a gospel mercy, so that the heavens
          declare the gospel, not formally, but fundamentally, in declaring the
          long‑suffering of God, without which no gospel had been framed, or
          could have been expected. They could not but read in those things
          favorable inclinations towards them: and though they could not be
          ignorant that they deserved a mark of justice, yet seeing themselves
          supported by God, and beholding the regular motions of the heavens
          from day to day, and the revolutions of the seasons of the year, the
          natural conclusions they might draw from thence was, that God was
          placable; since he behaved himself more as a tender friend, that had
          no mind to be at war with them, than an enraged enemy. The good things
          which he gave them, and the patience whereby he spared them, were no
          arguments of an implacable disposition; and, therefore, of a
          disposition willing to be appeased. This is clearly the design of the
          apostle’s arguing with the Lystrians, when they would have offered
          sacrifices to Paul (Acts xiv. 17). When God “suffered all nations to
          walk in their own ways, he did not leave himself without witness,
          giving rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons.” What were those
          witnesses of? not only of the being of a God, by their readiness to
          sacrifice to those that were not gods, only supposed to be so in their
          false imaginations; but witnesses to the tenderness of God, that he
          had no mind to be severe with his creatures, but would allure them by
          ways of goodness. Had not God’s patience tended to this end, to bring
          the world under another dispensation, the apostle’s arguing from it
          had not been suitable to his design, which seems to be a hindering the
          sacrifices they intended for them, and a drawing them to embrace the
          gospel, and therefore preparing the way to it, by speaking of the
          patience and goodness of God to them, as an unquestionable testimony
          of the reconcilableness of good to them, by some sacrifice which was
          represented under the common notion of sacrifices.1038 These things
          were not witnesses of Christ, or syllables whereby they could spell
          out the redeeming person; but witnesses that God was placable in his
          own nature. When man abused those noble faculties God had given him,
          and diverted them from the use and service God intended them for, God
          might have stripped man of them the first time that he misemployed
          them; and it would have seemed most agreeable to his wisdom and
          justice, not to suffer himself to be abused, and the world to go
          contrary to its natural end. But since he did not level the world with
          its first nothing, but healed the world so favorably, it was evident
          that his patience pointed the world to a further design of mercy and
          goodness in him. To imagine that God had no other design in his
          long‑suffering but that of vengeance, had been a notion unsuitable to
          the goodness and wisdom of God. He would never have pretended himself
          to be a friend, if he had harbored nothing but enmity in his heart
          against them. It had been far from his goodness to give them a cause
          to suspect such a design in him, as his patience certainly did, had he
          not intended it. Had he preserved men only for punishment, it is more
          like he would have treated men as princes do those they reserve for
          the axe or halter, give them only things necessary to uphold their
          lives till the day of execution, and not have bestowed upon them so
          many good things to make their lives delightful to them, nor have
          furnished them with so many excellent means to please their senses,
          and recreate their minds; it had been a mocking of them to treat them
          at that rate, if nothing but punishment had been intended towards
          them. If the end of it, to lead men to repentance, were easily
          intelligible by them, as the apostle intimates (Rom. ii. 4)—which is
          to be linked with the former chapter, a discourse of the Gentiles:
          “Not knowing,” saith he, “that the riches of his forbearance and
          goodness leads thee to repentance”—it also gives them some ground to
          hope for pardon. For what other argument can more induce to repentance
          than an expectation of mercy upon a relenting, and acknowledging the
          crime? Without a design of pardoning grace, his patience would have
          been in a great measure exercised in vain: for by mere patience God is
          not reconciled to a sinner, no more than a prince to a rebel, by
          bearing with him. Nor can a sinner conclude himself in the favor of
          God, no more than a rebel can conclude himself in the favor of his
          prince; only, this he may conclude, that there is some hopes he may
          have the grant of a pardon, since he hath time to sue it out. And so
          much did the patience of God naturally signify that he was of a
          reconcilable temper, and was willing men should sue out their pardon
          upon repentance; otherwise, he might have magnified his justice, and
          condemned men by the law of works.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He therefore exercised so much patience to wait for men’s
          repentance. All the notices and warnings that God gives men, of either
          public or personal calamities, is a continual invitation to
          repentance. This was the common interpretation the heathens made of
          extraordinary presages and prodigies, which showed as well the delays
          as the approaches of judgments. What other notion but this, that those
          warnings of judgments witness a slowness to anger, and a willingness
          to turn his arrows another way, should move them to multiply
          sacrifices, go weeping to their temples, sound out prayers to their
          gods, and show all those other testimonies of a repentance which their
          blind understandings hit upon? If a prince should sometimes in a light
          and gentle manner punish a criminal, and then relax it, and show him
          much kindness, and afterwards inflict upon him another kind of
          punishment as light as the former, and less than was due to his crime,
          what could the malefactor suspect by such a way of proceeding, but
          that the prince, by those gently‑repeated chastisements, had a mind to
          move him to a regret for his crime?1039 And what other thoughts could
          men naturally have of God’s conduct, that he should warn them of great
          judgments, send light afflictions, which are testimonies rather of a
          patience than of a severe wrath, but that it was intended to move them
          to a relenting, and a breaking off their sins by working
          righteousness? Though Divine patience does not, in the event, induce
          men to repentance, yet the natural tendency of such a treatment is to
          mollify men’s hearts, to overcome their obstinacy; and no man hath any
          reason to judge otherwise of such a proceeding. The “long‑suffering of
          God is salvation,” saith Peter (2 Pet. iii. 15), i. e. hath a tendency
          to salvation, in its being a solicitation of men to the means of it;
          for the apostle cites Paul for the confirmation of it,—“Even as our
          beloved brother, Paul, hath written unto you,” which must refer to
          Rom. ii. 4: “it leads to repentance,” ἄγει, it conducts, which is more
          than barely to invite; it doth, as it were, take us by the hand, and
          point us to the way wherein we should go; and for this end it was
          exercised, not only towards the Jews, but towards the Gentiles, not
          only towards those that are within the pale of the church, and under
          the dews of the gospel, but to those that are in darkness, and in the
          shadow of death; for this discourse of the apostle was but an
          inference from what he had treated of in the first chapter concerning
          the idolatry and ingratitude of the Gentiles; since the Gentiles were
          to be punished for the abuse of it as well as the Jews, as he
          intimates, ver. 9. It is plain that his patience, which is exercised
          towards the idolatrous Gentiles, was to allure them to repentance as
          well as others; and it was a sufficient motive in itself to persuade
          them to a change of their vile and gross acts, to such as were morally
          good: and there was enough in God’s dealing with them, and in that
          light they had to engage them to a better course than what they
          usually walked in; and though men do abuse God’s long‑suffering, to
          encourage their impenitence, and persisting in their crimes, yet that
          they cannot reasonably imagine that to be the end of God is evident;
          their own gripes of conscience would acquaint them that it is
          otherwise. They know that conscience is a principle that God hath
          given them, as well as understanding, and will, and other faculties;
          that God doth not approve of that which the voice of their own
          consciences, and of the consciences of all men under natural light,
          are utterly against: and if there were really, in this forbearance of
          God, an approbation of men’s crimes, conscience could not, frequently
          and universally in all men, check them for them. What authority could
          conscience have to do it? But this it doth in all men: as the apostle
          (Rom. i. 22), “They know the judgment of God, that those that do such
          things,” which he had mentioned before, “are worthy of death.” In this
          thing the consciences of all men cannot err: they could not,
          therefore, conclude from hence God’s approbation of their iniquities,
          but his desire that their hearts should be touched with a repentance
          for them. The “sin of Ephraim is hid” (Hos. xiii. 12, 13); i. e. God
          doth not presently take notice of it, to order punishment; he lays it
          in a secret place from the eye of his justice, that Ephraim might not
          be his unwise son, and “stay long in the place of the breaking forth
          of children;” i. e. that he should speedily reclaim himself, and not
          continue in the way of destruction. God hath no need to abuse any; he
          doth not lie to the sons of men; if he would have men perish, he could
          easily destroy them, and have done it long ago: he did not leave the
          woman Jezebel in being, nor lengthened out her time, but as a space to
          repent (Rev. ii. 21), that she might reflect upon her ways, and devote
          herself seriously to his service, and her own happiness. His patience
          stands between the offending creature and eternal misery a long time,
          that men might not foolishly throw away their souls, and be damned for
          their impenitency; by this he shows himself ready to receive men to
          mercy upon their return. To what purpose doth he invite men to
          repentance, if he intended to deceive them, and damn them after they
          repent?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He doth exercise patience for the propagation of mankind. If God
          punished every sin presently, there would not only be a period put to
          churches, but to the world; without patience, Adam had sunk into
          eternal anguish the first moment of his provocation, and the whole
          world of mankind, in his loins, had perished with him, and never seen
          the light. If this perfection had not interposed after the first sin,
          God had lost his end in the creation of the world, which he “created
          not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited” (Isa. xlv. 18). It had
          been inconsistent with the wisdom of God to make a world to be
          inhabited, and destroy it upon sin, when it had but two principal
          inhabitants in it; the reason of his making this earth had been
          insignificant; he had not had any upon earth to glorify him, without
          erecting another world, which might have proved as sinful and as
          quickly wicked as this; God should have always been pulling down and
          rearing up, creating and annihilating; one world would have come after
          another, as wave after wave in the sea. His patience stepped in to
          support the honor of God, and the continuance of men, without which
          one had been in part impaired, and the other totally lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. He doth exercise patience for the continuance of the church. If he
          be not patient toward sinners, what stock would there be for believers
          to spring up from? He bears with the provoking carriage of men, evil
          men, because out of their loins he intends to extract others, which he
          will form for the glory of his grace. He hath some unborn that belong
          to the election of grace, which are to be the seed of the worst of
          men; Jeroboam, the chief incendiary of the Israelites to idolatry, had
          an Abijah, in whom was found “some good thing towards the Lord God of
          Israel” (1 Kings xiv. 13). Had Ahaz been snapped in the first act of
          his wickedness, the Israelites had wanted so good a prince and so good
          a man as Hezekiah, a branch of that wicked predecessor. What gardener
          cuts off the thorns from the rose‑brush till he hath gathered the
          roses? and men do not use to burn all the crab‑tree, but preserve a
          stock to engraft some sweet fruit upon. There could not have been a
          saint in the earth, nor, consequently, in heaven, had it not been for
          this perfection: he did not destroy the Israelites in the wilderness,
          that he might keep up a church among them, and not extinguish the
          whole seed that were heirs of the promises and covenant made with
          Abraham. Had God punished men for their sins as soon as they had been
          committed, none would have lived to have been better, none could have
          continued in the world to honor him by their virtues. Manasseh had
          never been a convert, and many brutish men had never been changed from
          beasts to angels, to praise and acknowledge their Creator. Had Peter
          received his due recompense upon the denial of his Master, he had
          never been a martyr for him; nor had Paul been a preacher of the
          gospel; nor any else: and so the gospel had not shined in any part of
          the world. No seed would have been brought into Christ; Christ is
          beholding immediately to this attribute for all the seed he hath in
          the world: it is for his name’s sake that he doth defer his anger; and
          for his praise that he doth refrain from “cutting us off” (Isa.
          xlviii. 9): and in the next chapter follows a prophecy of Christ. To
          overthrow mankind for sin, were to prevent the spreading a church in
          the world: a woman that is guilty of a capital crime, and lies under a
          condemning sentence, is reprieved from execution for her being with
          child; it is for the child’s sake the woman is respited, not for her
          own: it is for the elect’s sake, in the loins of transgressors, that
          they are a long time spared, and not for their own (Isa. lxv. 8): “As
          the new wine is found in a cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for
          a blessing is in it, so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may
          not destroy them all;” as a husbandman spares a vine for some good
          clusters in it. He had spoke of vengeance before, yet he would reserve
          some from whom he would bring forth those that should be “inheritors
          of his mountains,” that he might make up his church of Judea;
          Jerusalem being a mountainous place, and the type of the church in all
          ages. What is the reason he doth not level his thunder at the heads of
          those for whose destruction he receives so many petitions from the
          “souls under the altar?” (Rev. vi. 9, 10). Because God had others to
          write a testimony for him in their own blood, and perhaps out of the
          loins of those for whom vengeance was so earnestly supplicated; and
          God, as the master of a vessel, lies patiently at anchor, till the
          last passenger he expects be taken in.1040
        </p>
        <p>
          5. For the sake of his church he is patient to wicked men. The tares
          are patiently endured till the harvest, for fear in the plucking up
          the one, there might be some prejudice done to the other. Upon this
          account he spares some, who are worse than others whom he crusheth by
          signal judgments: the Jews had committed sins worse than Sodom, for
          the confirmation of which we have God’s oath (Ezek. xvi. 48); and more
          by half than Samaria, or the ten tribes had done (ver. 51): yet God
          spared the Jews, though he destroyed the Sodomites. What was the
          reason, but a larger remnant of righteous persons, more clusters of
          good grapes, were found among them than grew in Sodom? (Isa. i. 9). A
          few more righteous in Sodom had damped the fire and brimstone designed
          for that place, and a “remnant of such in Judea” was a bar to that
          fierceness of anger, which otherwise would have quickly consumed them.
          Had there been but “ten righteous in Sodom,” Divine patience had still
          bound the arms of Justice, that it should not have prepared its
          brimstone, notwithstanding the clamor of the sins of the multitude.
          Judea was ripe for the sickle, but God would put a lock upon the
          torrent of his judgments, that they should not flow down upon that
          wicked place, to make them a desolation and a curse, as long as
          tender‑hearted Josiah lived, “who had humbled himself” at the
          threatening, and wept before the Lord (2 Kings xxii. 19, 20).
          Sometimes he bears with wicked men, that they might exercise the
          patience of the saints (Rev. xiv. 12): the whole time of the
          “forbearance of antichrist” in all his intrusions into the temple of
          God, invasions of the rights of God, usurpations of the office of
          Christ, and besmearing himself with the blood of the saints, was to
          give them an opportunity of patience. God is patient towards the
          wicked, that by their means he might try the righteous. He burns not
          the wisp till he hath scoured his vessels; nor lays by the hammer,
          till he hath formed some of his matter into an excellent fashion. He
          useth the worst men as rods to correct his people, before he sweeps
          the twigs out of his house. God sometimes uses the thorns of the
          world, as a hedge to secure his church, sometimes as instruments to
          try and exercise it. Howsoever he useth them, whether for security or
          trial, he is patient to them for his church’s advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. When men are not brought to repentance by his patience, he doth
          longer exercise it, to manifest the equity of his future justice upon
          them. As wisdom is justified by her obedient children, so is justice
          justified by the rebels against patience; the contempt of the latter
          is the justification of the former. The “apostles were unto God a
          sweet savor of Christ in them that perish,” as well as in them that
          were saved by the acceptation of their message (2 Cor. ii. 15). Both
          are fragrant to God; his mercy is glorified by the one’s acceptance of
          it, and his justice freed from any charge against it by the other’s
          refusal. The cause of men’s ruin cannot be laid upon God, who provided
          means for their salvation, and solicited their compliance with him.
          What reason can they have to charge the Judge with any wrong to them,
          who reject the tenders he makes, and who hath forborne them with so
          much patience, when he might have censured them by his righteous
          justice, upon the first crime they committed, or the first refusal of
          his gracious offers? “Quanto Dei magis judicium tardum est tanto magis
          justum.”1041 After the despising of patience, there can be no
          suspicion of an irregularity in the acts of justice. Man hath no
          reason to fall foul in his charge upon God, if he were punished for
          his own sin, considering the dignity of the injured person, and the
          meanness of himself, the offender; but his wrath is more justified
          when it is poured out upon those whom he hath endured with much
          long‑suffering. There is no plea against the shooting of his arrows
          into those, for whom this voice hath been loud, and his arms open for
          their return. As patience, while it is exercised, is the silence of
          his justice, so when it is abused, it silenceth men’s complaints
          against his justice. The “riches of his forbearance” made way for the
          manifesting the “treasures of his wrath.” If God did but a little bear
          with the insolencies of men, and cut them off after two or three sins,
          he would not have opportunity to show either the power of his
          patience, or that of his wrath; but when he hath a right to punish for
          one sin, and yet bears with them for many, and they will not be
          reclaimed, the sinner is more inexcusable, Divine justice less
          chargeable, and his wrath more powerful. (Rom. ix. 22), “What if God,
          willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
          much long‑suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction?” The
          proper and immediate end of his long‑suffering is to lead men to
          repentance; but after they have by their obstinacy fitted themselves
          for destruction, he bears longer with them, to “magnify his wrath”
          more upon them; and if it is not the finis operantis, it is at least
          the finis operis, where patience is abused. Men are apt to complain of
          God, that he deals hardly with them; the Israelites seem to charge God
          with too much severity, to cast them off, when so many promises were
          made to the fathers for their perpetuity and preservation, which is
          intimated, Hos. ii. 2. “Plead with your mother, plead:” by the double
          repetition of the word “plead;” do not accuse me of being false or too
          rigorous, but accuse your mother, your church, your magistracy, your
          ministry, for their spiritual fornications which have provoked me; for
          their נאפופיה, intimating the greatness of their sins by the
          reduplication of the word, “lest I strip her naked.” I have borne with
          her under many provocations, and I have not yet taken away all her
          ornaments, or said to her, according to the rule of divorce, Res tuas
          tibi habeto. God answers their impudent charge: “She is not my wife,
          nor am I her husband;” he doth not say first, I am not her husband,
          but she is not my wife; she first withdrew from her duty by breaking
          the marriage covenant, and then I ceased to be her husband. No man
          shall be condemned, but he shall be convinced of the due desert of his
          sin, and the justice of God’s proceeding. God will lay open men’s
          guilt, and repeat the measures of his patience to justify the severity
          of his wrath (Hos. vii. 10), “Sins will testify to their face.” What
          is in its own nature a preparation for glory, men by their obstinacy
          make a preparation for a more indisputable punishment. We see many
          evidences of God’s forbearance here, in sparing men under those
          blasphemies which are audible, and those profane carriages which are
          visible, which would sufficiently justify an act of severity; yet when
          men’s secret sins, both in heart and action, and the vast multitude of
          them, far surmounting what can arrive to our knowledge here, shall be
          discovered, how great a lustre will it add to God’s bearing with them,
          and make his justice triumph without any reasonable demur from the
          sinner himself! He is long‑suffering here, that his justice may be
          more public hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use IV. For instruction. How is this patience of God abused! The
          Gentiles abused those testimonies of it, which were written in showers
          and fruitful seasons. No nation was ever stripped of it, under the
          most provoking idolatries, till after multiplied spurns at it: not a
          person among us but hath been guilty of the abuse of it. How have we
          contemned that which demands a reverence from us! How have we requited
          God’s waitings with rebellions, while he hath continued urging and
          expecting our return! Saul relented at David’s forbearing to revenge
          himself, when he had his prosecuting and industrious enemy in his
          power. (1 Sam. xxiv. 17), “Thou art more righteous than I; thou hast
          rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil:” and shall we not
          relent at God’s wonderful long‑suffering, and silencing his anger so
          much? He could puff away our lives, but he will not, and yet we
          endeavor to strip him of his being, though we cannot.
        </p>
        <p>1. Let us consider the ways, how slowness to anger is abused.</p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is abused by misinterpretations of it, when men slander his
          patience to be only a carelessness and neglect of his providence; as
          Averroes argued from his slowness to anger, a total neglect of the
          government of the lower world: or when men from his long‑suffering
          charge him with impurity, as if his patience were a consent to their
          crimes; and because he suffered them, without calling them to account,
          he were one of their partisans, and as wicked as themselves (Ps. l.
          21): “Because I kept silence, thou thoughtest I was altogether such a
          one as thyself.” His silence makes them conclude him to be an abettor
          of, and a consort in their sins; and think him more pleased with their
          iniquity than their obedience. Or when they will infer from his
          forbearance a want of his omniscience; because he suffers their sins,
          they imagine he forgets them (Ps. x. 11): “He hath said in his heart,
          God hath forgotten:” thinking his patience proceeds not from the
          sweetness of his nature, but a weakness of his mind. How base is it,
          instead of admitting him, to disparage him for it; and because he
          stands in so advantageous a posture towards us, not to own the
          choicest prerogatives of his Deity! This is to make a perfection, so
          useful to us, to shadow and extinguish those others, which are the
          prime flowers of his crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) His patience is abused by continuing in a course of sin under the
          influences of it. How much is it the practical language of men, Come,
          let us commit this or that iniquity; since Divine patience hath
          suffered worse than this at our hands! Nothing is remitted to their
          sensual pleasures, and eagerness in them. How often did the Israelites
          repeat their murmurings against him, as if they would put his patience
          to the utmost proof, and see how far the line of it could extend! They
          were no sooner satisfied in one thing, but they quarrelled with him
          about another, as if he had no other attribute to put in motion
          against them. They tempted him as often as he relieved them, as though
          the declaration of his name to Moses (Exod. xxxiv.), “to be a God
          gracious, and long‑suffering,” had been intended for no other purpose
          but a protection of them in their rebellions. Such a sort of men the
          prophet speaks of, that were “settled in their lees,” or dregs (Zeph.
          i. 12): they were congealed, and frozen in their successful
          wickedness. Such an abuse of Divine patience is the very dregs of sin;
          God chargeth it highly upon the Jews (Isa. lvii. 11): “I have held my
          peace, even of old, and thou fearest me not;” my silence made thee
          confident, yea, impudent in thy sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) His patience is abused by repeating sin, after God hath, by an
          act of his patience, taken off some affliction from men. As metals
          melted in the fire remain fluid under the operations of the flames,
          yet when removed from the fire, they quickly return to their former
          hardness, and sometimes grow harder than they were before; so men who,
          in their afflictions, seem to be melted, like Ahab confess their sins,
          lie prostrate before God, and seek him early; yet, if they be brought
          from under the power of their afflictions, they return to their old
          nature, and are as stiff against God, and resist the blows of the
          Spirit as much as they did before. They think they have a new stock of
          patience to sin upon. Pharaoh was somewhat thawed under judgments, and
          frozen again under forbearance (Exod. ix. 27, 34). Many will howl when
          God strikes them, and laugh at him when he forbears them. Thus that
          patience which should melt us, doth often harden us, which is not an
          effect natural to his patience, but natural to our abusing corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) His patience is abused, by taking encouragement from it to mount
          to greater degrees of sin. Because God is slow to anger, men are more
          fierce in sin, and not only continue in their old rebellions, but heap
          new upon them. If he spare them for three transgressions, they will
          commit four, as is intimated in the first and second of Amos; “Men’s
          hearts are fully set in them to do evil, because sentence against an
          evil work is not speedily executed” (Eccles. viii. 11). Their hearts
          are more desperately bent; before they had some waverings, and
          pull‑backs, but after a fair sunshine of Divine patience, they
          entertain more unbridled resolutions, and pass forward with more
          liberty and licentiousness. They make his long‑suffering subservient
          to turn out all those little relentings and regrets they had before,
          and banish all thoughts of barring out a temptation. No encouragement
          is given to men by God’s patience, but they force it by their
          presumption. They invert God’s order, and bind themselves stronger to
          iniquity by that which should bind them faster to their duty. A happy
          escape at sea makes men go more confidently into the deeps afterward.
          Thus we deal with God as debtors do with good‑natured creditors:
          because they do not dun them for what they owe, they take
          encouragement to run more upon the score, till the sum amounts above
          their ability of payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let it be considered, 1st. That this abuse of patience is a high
          sin. As every act of forbearance obligeth us to duty, so every act of
          it abused, increaseth our guilt. The more frequent its solicitations
          of us have been, the deeper aggravations our sin receives by it. Every
          sin, after an act of Divine patience, contracts a blacker guilt. The
          sparing us after the last sin we committed, was a superadded act of
          long‑suffering, and a laying out more of his riches upon us: and,
          therefore, every new act committed is a despite against greater riches
          expended, and greater cost upon us, and against his preserving us from
          the hand of justice for the last transgression. It is disingenuous not
          to have a due resentment of so much goodness, and base to injure him
          the more, because he doth not right himself. Shall he receive the more
          wrongs from us, by how much the sweeter he is to us? No man’s
          conscience but will tell him it is vile to prefer the satisfaction of
          a sordid lust, before the counsel of a God of so gracious a
          disposition. The sweeter the nature, the fouler is the injury that is
          done unto it. 2d. It is dangerous to abuse his patience. Contempt of
          kindness is most irksome to an ingenuous spirit; and he is worthy to
          have the arrows of God’s indignation lodged in his heart, who
          despiseth the riches of his long‑suffering. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] The time of patience will have an end. Though his Spirit strives
          with man, yet it shall “not always strive” (Gen. vi. 3). Though there
          be a time wherein Jerusalem might “know the things that concerned her
          peace,” yet there is another period wherein they should be “hid from
          her eyes” (Luke xix. 43): “O that thou hadst known in this thy day!”
          Nations have their day, and persons have their day; and the day of
          most persons is shorter than the day of nations. Jerusalem had her day
          of forty years; but how many particular persons were taken off before
          the last or middle hours of that day were arrived! “Forty years was
          God grieved” with the generation of the Israelites (Heb. iii. 11). One
          carcass dropped after another in that limited time, and at the end not
          a man but fell under the judicial stroke, except Caleb and Joshua. One
          hundred and twenty years was the term set to the mass of the old
          world, but not to every man in the old world; some fell while the ark
          was preparing, as well as the whole stock when the ark was completed.
          Though he be patient with most, yet he is not in the same degree with
          all; every sinner hath his time of sinning, beyond which he shall
          proceed no further, be his lusts never so impetuous, and his
          affections never so imperious. The time of his patience is, in
          Scripture, set forth sometimes by years; three years he came to find
          fruit on the fig‑tree: sometimes by days; some men’s sins are sooner
          ripe, and fall. There is a measure of sin (Jer. ii. 13), which is set
          forth by the ephah (Zech. v. 8), which, when it is filled, is sealed
          up, and a weight of lead cast upon the mouth of it. When judgments are
          preparing, once and twice the Lord is prevailed with by the
          intercession of the prophet: the prepared grass‑hoppers are not sent
          to devour, and the kindled fire is not blown up to consume (Amos vii.
          1‒8). But at last God takes the plumb‑line, to suit and measure
          punishment to their sin, and would not pass by them any more; and when
          their sin was ripe, represented by a “basket of summer‑fruit,” God
          would withhold his hand no longer, but brought such a day upon them,
          wherein “the songs of the Temple should be howlings, and dead bodies
          be in every place” (Amos viii. 2, 3). He lays by any further thoughts
          of patience to speed their ruin. God had borne long with the
          Israelites, and long it was before he gave them up. He would first
          brake the “bow in Jezreel” (Hos. i. 5); take away the strength of the
          nation by the death of Zechariah, the last of Jehu’s race, which
          introduced civil dissentions and ambitious murders, for the throne,
          whereby in weakening one part they weakened the whole; or, as some
          think, alluding to Tiglah Pilezar, who carried captive two tribes and
          a half. If this would not reclaim them, then follows “Lo‑ruhamah, I
          will not have mercy,” I will sweep them out of the land (ver. 6). If
          they did not repent, they should be “Lo‑ammi” (ver. 9), “You are not
          my people,” and “I will not be your God.” They should be
          discovenanted, and stripped of all federal relation. Here patience
          forever withdrew from them, and wrathful anger took its place. And,
          for particular persons, the time of life, whether shorter or longer,
          is the only time of long‑suffering. It hath no other stage than the
          present state of things to act upon; there is none else to be expected
          after but giving account of what hath been done in the body, not of
          anything done after the soul is fled from the body: the time of
          patience ends with the first moment of the soul’s departure from the
          body. This time only is the “day of salvation;” i. e. the day wherein
          God offers it, and the day wherein God waits for our acceptance of it:
          it is at his pleasure to shorten or lengthen our day, not at ours; it
          is not our long‑suffering, but his; he hath the command of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] God hath wrath to punish, as well as patience to bear. He hath a
          fury to revenge the outrages done to his meekness: when his messages
          of peace, sent to reclaim men, are slighted, his sword shall be
          whetted, and his instruments of war prepared (Hos. v. 3): “Blow ye the
          cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah.” As he deals gently, like
          a father, so he can punish capitally as a judge: though he holds his
          peace for a long time, yet at last he will go forth like a mighty man,
          and stir up jealousy, as a man of war, to cut in pieces his enemies.
          It is not said he hath no anger, but that he is “slow to anger,” but
          sharp in it: he hath a sword to cut, and a bow to shoot, and arrows to
          pierce (Ps. xii. 13): though he be long drawing the one out of its
          scabbard, and long fitting the other to his bow, yet, when they are
          ready, he strikes home, and hits the mark: though he hath a time of
          patience, yet he hath also a “day of rebuke” (Hos. v. 9); though
          patience overrules justice, by suspending it, yet justice will at last
          overrule patience, by an utter silencing it. God is Judge of the whole
          earth to right men, yet he is no less Judge of the injuries he
          receives to right himself. Though God awhile was pressed with the
          murmurings of the Israelites, after their coming out of Egypt, and
          seemed desirous to give them all satisfaction upon their unworthy
          complaints, yet, when they came to open hostility, in setting a golden
          calf in his throne, he commissions the “Levites to kill every man his
          brother and companion in the camp” (Exod. xxxii. 27): and how desirous
          soever he was to content them before, they never murmured afterwards
          but they severely smarted for it. When once he hath begun to use his
          sword, he sticks it up naked, that it might be ready for use upon
          every occasion. Though he hath feet of lead, yet he hath hands of
          iron. It was long that he supported the peevishness of the Jews, but
          at last he captived them by the arms of the Babylonians, and laid them
          waste by the power of the Romans. He planted, by the apostles,
          churches in the east; and when his goodness and long‑suffering
          prevailed not with them, he tore them up by the roots. What Christians
          are to be found in those once famous parts of Asia but what are
          overgrown with much error and ignorance?
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] The more his patience is abused, the sharper will be the wrath he
          inflicts. As his wrath restrained makes his patience long, so his
          compassions restrained will make his wrath severe; as he doth
          transcend all creatures in the measures of the one, so he doth
          transcend all creatures in the sharpness of the other. Christ is
          described with “feet of brass,” as if they burned in a furnace (Rev.
          i. 15), slow to move, but heavy to crush, and hot to burn. His wrath
          loseth nothing by delay; it grows the fresher by sleeping, and strikes
          with greater strength when it awakes: all the time men are abusing his
          patience, God is whetting his sword, and the longer it is whetting the
          sharper will be the edge; the longer he is fetching his blow, the
          smarter it will be. The heavier the cannons are, the more difficultly
          are they drawn to the besieged town; but, when arrived, they
          recompense the slowness of their march by the fierceness of their
          battery. “Because I have purged thee,” i. e. used means for thy
          reformation, and waited for it, “and thou wast not purged, thou shalt
          not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury
          to rest upon thee: I will not go back, neither will I spare; according
          to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee”
          (Ezek. xxiv. 13, 14). God will spare as little then as he spared much
          before; his wrath shall be as raging upon them as the sea of their
          wickedness was within them. When there is a bank to forbid the
          irruption of the streams, the waters swell; but when the bank is
          broke, or the lock taken away, they rush with the greater violence,
          and ravage more than they would have done had they not met with a
          stop: the longer a stone is in falling, the more it bruiseth and
          grinds to powder. There is a greater treasure of wrath laid up by the
          abuses of patience: every sin must have a just recompense of reward;
          and therefore every sin, in regard of its aggravations, must be more
          punished than a sin in the singleness and simplicity of its own
          nature. As treasures of mercy are kept by God for us, “he keeps mercy
          for thousands;” so are treasures of wrath kept by him to be expended,
          and a time of expense there must be: patience will account to justice
          all the good offices it hath done the sinner, and demand to be righted
          by justice; justice will take the account from the hands of patience,
          and exact a recompense for every disingenuous injury offered to it.
          When justice comes to arrest men for their debts, patience, mercy, and
          goodness, will step in as creditors, and clap their actions upon them,
          which will make the condition so much more deplorable.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] When he puts an end to his abused patience, his wrath will make
          quick and sure work. He that is “slow to anger” will be swift in the
          execution of it. The departure of God from Jerusalem is described with
          “wings and wheels” (Ezek. xi. 23). One stroke of his hand is
          irresistible; he that hath spent so much time in waiting needs but one
          minute to ruin; though it be long ere he draws his sword out of his
          scabbard, yet, when once he doth it, he despatcheth men at a blow.
          Ephraim, or the ten tribes, had a long time of patience and
          prosperity, but now shall a “month devour him with his portion” (Hos.
          v. 7). One fatal month puts a period to the many years’ peace and
          security of a sinful nation; his arrows wound suddenly (Ps. lxiv. 7);
          and while men are about to fill their bellies, he casts the fruits of
          his wrath upon them (Job xx. 23), like thunder out of a cloud, or a
          bullet out of a cannon, that strikes dead before it is heard. God
          deals with sinners as enemies do with a town, batter it not by planted
          guns, but secretly undermines and blows up the walls, whereby they
          involve the garrison in a sudden ruin, and carry the town. God spared
          the Amalekites a long time after the injury committed against the
          Israelites, in their passage out of Egypt to Canaan; but when he came
          to reckon with them, he would waste them in a trice, and make an utter
          consumption of them (1 Sam. xv. 2, 3). He describes himself by a
          “travailing woman” (Isa. xxiv. 14), that hath borne long in her womb,
          and at last sends forth her birth with strong cries. Though he hath
          held his peace, been still, and refrained himself, yet, at last, he
          will destroy and devour at once: the Ninevites, spared in the time of
          Jonah for their repentance, are, in nature, threatened with a certain
          and total ruin, when God should come to bring them to an account for
          his length and patience, so much abused by them. Though God endured
          the murmuring Israelites so long in the wilderness, yet he paid them
          off at last, and took away the rebels in his wrath: he uttered their
          sentence with an irreversible oath, that “none of them should enter
          into his rest;” and he did as surely execute it as he had solemnly
          sworn it.
        </p>
        <p>
          [5.] Though he doth defer his visible wrath, yet that very delay may
          be more dreadful than a quick punishment. He may forbear striking, and
          give the reins to the hardness and corruption of men’s hearts; he may
          suffer them to walk in their own counsels, without any more striving
          with them, whereby they make themselves fitter fuel for his vengeance.
          This was the fate of Israel when they would not hearken to his voice;
          he “gave them up to their own hearts’ lusts, and they walked in their
          own counsels” (Ps. lxxxi. 12). Though his sparing them had the outward
          aspect of patience, it was a wrathful one, and attended with spiritual
          judgments; thus many abusers of patience may still have their line
          lengthened, and the candle of prosperity to shine upon their heads,
          that they may increase their sins, and be the fitter mark at last for
          his arrows; they swim down the stream of their own sensuality with a
          deplorable security, till they fall into an unavoidable gulf, where,
          at last, it will be a great part of their hell to reflect on the
          length of Divine patience on earth, and their inexcusable abuse of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It informs us of the reason why he lets the enemies of his church
          oppress it, and defers his promise of the deliverance of it. If he did
          punish them presently, his holiness and justice would be glorified,
          but his power over himself in his patience would be obscured. Well may
          the church be content to have a perfection of God glorified, that is
          not like to receive any honor in another world by any exercise of
          itself. If it were not for this patience, he were incapable to be the
          Governor of a sinful world; he might, without it, be the Governor of
          an innocent world, but not of a criminal one; he would be the
          destroyer of the world, but not the orderer and disposer of the
          extravagancies and sinfulness of the world. The interest of his
          wisdom, in drawing good out of evil, would not be served, if he were
          not clothed with this perfection as well as with others. If he did
          presently destroy the enemies of his church upon the first oppression,
          his wisdom in contriving, and his power in accomplishing deliverance
          against the united powers of hell and earth, would not be visible, no,
          nor that power in preserving his people unconsumed in the furnace of
          affliction. He had not got so great a name in the rescue of his Israel
          from Pharaoh, had he thundered the tyrant into destruction upon his
          first edicts against the innocent. If he were not patient to the most
          violent of men, he might seem to be cruel. But when he offers peace to
          them under their rebellions, waits that they may be members of his
          church, rather than enemies to it, he frees himself from any such
          imputation, even in the judgment of those that shall feel most of his
          wrath; it is this renders the equity of his justice unquestionable,
          and the deliverance of his people righteous in the judgment of those
          from whose fetters they are delivered. Christ reigns in the midst of
          his enemies, to show his power over himself, as well as over the heads
          of his enemies, to show his power over his rebels. And though he
          retards his promise, and suffers a great interval of time between the
          publication and performance, sometimes years, sometimes ages to pass
          away, and little appearance of any preparation, to show himself a God
          of truth; it is not that he hath forgotten his word, or repents that
          ever he passed it, or sleeps in a supine neglect of it: but that men
          might not perish, but bethink themselves, and come as friends into his
          bosom, rather than be crushed as enemies under his feet (2 Pet. iii.
          9): “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, but is
          long‑suffering to us‑ward, not willing that any should perish, but
          that all should come to repentance.” Hereby he shows, that he would be
          rather pleased with the conversion, than the destruction, of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We see the reason why sin is suffered to remain in the regenerate;
          to show his patience towards his own; for since this attribute hath no
          other place of appearance but in this world, God takes opportunity to
          manifest it; because, at the close of the world, it will remain closed
          up in the Deity, without any further operation. As God suffers a
          multitude of sins in the world, to evidence his patience to the
          wicked, so he suffers great remainders of sin in his people, to show
          his patience to the godly. His sparing mercy is admirable, before
          their conversion, but more admirable in bearing with them after so
          high an obligation as the conferring upon them special converting
          grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 2. Of comfort. It is a vast comfort to any when God is pacified
          towards them; but it is some comfort to all, that God is yet patient
          towards them, though but very little to a refractory sinner. His
          continued patience to all, speaks a possibility of the care of all,
          would they not stand against the way of their recovery. It is a terror
          that God hath anger, but it is a mitigation of that terror that God is
          slow to it; while his sword is in his sheath there is some hopes to
          prevent the drawing of it: alas! if he were all fire and sword upon
          sin, what would become of us? We should find nothing else but
          overflowing deluges, or sweeping pestilences, or perpetual flashes of
          Sodom’s fire and brimstone from heaven. He dooms us not presently to
          execution, but gives us a long breathing time after the crime, that by
          retiring from our iniquities, and having recourse to his mercy, he may
          be withheld forever from signing a warrant against us, and change his
          legal sentence into an evangelical pardon. It is a special comfort to
          his people, that he is a “sanctuary to them” (Ezek. xi. 16); a place
          of refuge, a place of spiritual communications; but it is some
          refreshment to all in this life, that he is a defence to them: for so
          is his patience called (Numb. xiv. 9): “Their defence is departed from
          them;” speaking to the Israelites, that they should not be afraid of
          the Canaanites, for their defence is departed from them. God is no
          longer patient to them, since their sins be full and ripe. Patience,
          as long as it lasts, is a temporary defence to those that are under
          the wing of it; but to the believer it is a singular comfort; and God
          is called the “God of patience and consolation” in one breath (Rom.
          xv. 5): “The God of patience and consolation grant you to be
          like‑minded;” all interpreters understand it effectively. The God that
          inspires you with patience, and cheers you with comfort, grant this to
          you. Why may it not be understood formally, of the patience belonging
          to the nature of God? and though it be expressed in the way of
          petition, yet it might also be proposed as a pattern for imitation,
          and so suits very well to the exhortation laid down (ver. 1), which
          was to “bear with the infirmities of the weak,” which he presseth them
          to (ver. 3) by the example of Christ; and (ver. 5) by the patience of
          God to them, and so they are very well linked together. “God of
          patience and consolation” may well be joined, since patience is the
          first step of comfort to the poor creature. If it did not administer
          some comfortable hopes to Adam, in the interval between his fall and
          God’s coming to examine him, I am sure it was the first discovery of
          any comfort to the creature, after the sweeping the destroying deluge
          out of the world (Gen. ix. 21); after the “savor of Noah’s sacrifice,”
          representing the great Sacrifice which was to be in the world, had
          ascended up to God, the return from him is a publication of his
          forbearing to punish any more in such a manner: and though he found
          man no better than he was before, and the imaginations of men’s hearts
          as evil as before the deluge, that he would not again smite every
          living thing, as he had done. This was the first expression of comfort
          to Noah, after his exit from the ark; and declares nothing else but
          the continuance of patience to the new world above what he had shown
          to the old.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a comfort, in that it is an argument of his grace to his
          people. If he hath so rich a patience to exercise towards his enemies,
          he hath a greater treasure to bestow upon his friends. Patience is the
          first attribute which steps in for our salvation, and therefore called
          “salvation” (2 Pet. iii. 15). Something else is therefore built upon
          it, and intended by it, to those that believe. Those two letters of
          his name, “a God keeping mercy for thousands, and forgiving iniquity,
          transgressions and sin,” follow the other letter of his long‑suffering
          in the proclamation (Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7). He is “slow to anger,” that
          he may be merciful, that men may seek, and receive their pardon. If he
          be long‑suffering, in order to be a pardoning God, he will not be
          wanting in pardoning those who answer the design of his forbearance of
          them. You would not have had sparing mercy to improve, if God would
          have denied you saving mercy upon the improvement of his sparing
          goodness. If he hath so much respect to his enemies that provoke him,
          as to endure them with much long‑suffering, he will surely be very
          kind to those that obey him, and conform to his will. If he hath much
          long‑suffering to those that are “fitted for destruction” (Rom. ix.
          22), he will have a muchness of mercy for those that are prepared for
          glory by faith and repentance. It is but a natural conclusion a
          gracious soul may make,—If God had not a mind to be appeased towards
          me, he would not have had a mind to forbear me; but since he hath
          forborne me, and given me a heart to see, and answer the true end of
          that forbearance, I need not question, but that sparing mercy will end
          in saving, since it finds that repentance springing up in me, which
          that patience conducted me to.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His patience is a ground to trust in his promise. If his slowness
          to anger be so great when his precept is slighted, his readiness to
          give what he hath promised will be as great when his promise is
          believed. If the provocations of them meet with such an unwillingness
          to punish them, faith in him will meet with the choicest embraces from
          him. He was more ready to make the promise of redemption after man’s
          apostasy, than to execute the threatening of the law. He doth still
          witness a greater willingness to give forth the fruits of the promise,
          than to pour out the vials of his curses. His slowness to anger is an
          evidence still, that he hath the same disposition, which is no slight
          cordial to faith in his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is a comfort in infirmities. If he were not patient, he could
          not bear with so many peevishnesses and weaknesses in the hearts of
          his own. If he be patient to the grosser sins of his enemies, he will
          be no less to the lighter infirmities of his people. When the soul is
          a bruised reed, that can emit no sound at all, or one very harsh and
          ungrateful, he doth not break it in pieces, and fling it away in
          disdain, but waits to see whether it will fully answer his pains, and
          be brought to a better frame and sweeter note. He brings them not to
          account for every slip, but, “as a father, spares his son that serves
          him” (Mal. iii. 17). It is a comfort to us in our distracted services;
          for were it not for this slowness to anger, he would stifle us in the
          midst of our prayers, wherein there are as many foolish thoughts to
          disgust him, as there are petitions to implore him. The patientest
          angels would hardly be able to bear with the follies of good men in
          acts of worship.
        </p>
        <p>Use 3. For exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          1. Meditate often on the patience of God. The devil labors for nothing
          more than to deface in us the consideration and memory of this
          perfection. He is an envious creature; and since it hath reached out
          itself to us and not to him, he envies God the glory of it, and man
          the advantage of it: but God loves to have the volumes of it studied,
          and daily turned over by us. We cannot without an inexcusable
          wilfulness miss the thoughts of it, since it is visible in every bit
          of bread, and breath of air in ourselves, and all about us.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The frequent consideration of his patience would render God
          highly amiable to us. It is a more endearing argument than his mere
          goodness; his goodness to us as creatures, endowing us with such
          excellent faculties, furnishing us with such a commodious world, and
          bestowing upon us so many attendants for our pleasure and service, and
          giving us a lordship over his other works, deserves our affection: but
          his patience to us as sinners, after we have merited the greatest
          wrath, shows him to be of a sweeter disposition than creating goodness
          to unoffending creatures; and, consequently, speaks a greater love in
          him, and bespeaks a greater affection from us. His creating goodness
          discovered the majesty of his Being, and the greatness of his mind,
          but this the sweetness and tenderness of his nature. In this patience
          he exceeds the mildness of all creatures to us; and therefore should
          be enthroned in our affections above all other creatures. The
          consideration of this would make us affect him for his nature as well
          as for his benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The consideration of his patience would make us frequent and
          serious in the exercise of repentance. In its nature it leads to it,
          and the consideration of it would engage us to it, and melt us in the
          exercise of it. Could we deeply think of it without being touched with
          a sense of the kindness of our forbearing Creditor and Governor? Could
          we gaze upon it, nay, could we glance upon it, without relenting at
          our offending one of so mild a nature, without being sensibly
          affected, that he hath preserved us so long from being loaded with
          those chains of darkness, under which the devils groan? This
          forbearance hath good reason to make sin and sinners ashamed. That you
          are in being, is not for want of advantages enough in his hand against
          you; many a forfeiture you have made, and many an engagement you have
          broke; he hath scarce met with any other dealing from us, than what
          had treachery in it. Whatsoever our sincerity is, we have no reason to
          boast of it, when we consider what mixtures there are in it, and what
          swarms of base motions taint it. Hath he not lain pressed and groaning
          under our sins, as a “cart is pressed with sheaves” (Amos ii. 13),
          when one shake of himself, as Sampson, might have rid him of the
          burden, and dismissed us in his fury into hell? If we should often ask
          our consciences why have we done thus and thus against so mild a God,
          would not the reflection on it put us to the blush? If men would
          consider, that such a time they provoked God to his face, and yet not
          have felt his sword; such a time they blasphemed him, and made a
          reproach of his name, and his thunder did not stop their motion; such
          a time they fell into an abominable brutishness, yet he kept the
          punishment of devils, the unclean spirits, from reaching them; such a
          time he bore an open affront from them, when they scoffed at his word,
          and he did not send a destruction, and laugh at it: would not such a
          meditation work some strange kind of relentings in men? What if we
          should consider, that we cannot do a sinful act without the support of
          his concurring Providence? We cannot see, hear, move, without his
          concourse. All creatures we use for our necessity or pleasure, are
          supported by him in the very act of assisting to pleasure us; and when
          we abuse those creatures against him, which he supports for our use,
          how great is his patience to bear with us, that he doth not annihilate
          those creatures, or at least embitter their use! What issue could
          reasonably be expected from this consideration, but, “O wretched man
          that I am, to serve myself of God’s power to affront him, and of his
          long‑suffering to abuse him?” O infinite patience to employ that power
          to preserve me, that might have been used to punish me! He is my
          Creator, I could not have a being without him, and yet I offend him!
          He is my Preserver, I cannot maintain my being without him, and yet I
          affront him! Is this a worthy requital of God (Deut. xxxii. 6), “Do
          you thus requite the Lord?” would be the heart‑breaking reflection.
          How would it give men a fuller prospect of the depravation of their
          nature than anything else; that their corruption should be so deep and
          strong, that so much patience could not overcome it! It would
          certainly make a man ashamed of his nature as well as his actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The consideration of his patience would make us resent more the
          injuries done by others to God. A patient sufferer, though a deserving
          sufferer, attracts the pity of men, that have a value for any virtue,
          though clouded with a heap of vice. How much more should we have a
          concern of God, who suffers so many abuses from others! and be
          grieved, that so admirable a patience should be slighted by men, who
          solely live by and under the daily influence of it! The impression of
          this would make us take God’s part, as it is usual with men to take
          the part of good dispositions that lie under oppression.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It would make us patient under God’s hand. His slowness to anger
          and his forbearance is visible, in the very strokes we feel in this
          life. We have no reason to murmur against him, who gives us so little
          cause, and in the greatest afflictions gives us more occasion of
          thankfulness than of repining. Did not slowness to the extremest anger
          moderate every affliction, it had been a scorpion instead of a rod. We
          have reason to bless Him, who, from his long‑suffering, sends temporal
          sufferings, where eternal are justly due. (Ezra ix. 13), “Thou hast
          punished us less than our iniquities do deserve.” His indulgences
          towards us have been more than our corrections, and the length of his
          patience hath exceeded the sharpness of his rod. Upon the account of
          his long‑suffering, our mutinies against God have as little to excuse
          them, as our sins against him have to deserve his forbearance. The
          consideration of this would show us more reason to repine at our own
          repinings, than at any of his smarter dealings; and the consideration
          of this would make us submissive under the judgments we expect. His
          undeserved patience hath been more than our merited judgments can
          possibly be thought to be. If we fear the removal of the gospel for a
          season, as we have reason to do, we should rather bless him, that by
          his waiting patience, he hath continued it so long, than murmur, that
          he threatens to take it away so late. He hath borne with us many a
          year, since the light of it was rekindled, when our ancestors had but
          six years’ of patience between the rise of Edward the Sixth, and the
          ascent of Queen Mary, to the crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Exhortation is to admire and stand astonished at his patience, “and
          bless him for it.” If you should have defiled your neighbor’s bed, or
          sullied his reputation, or rifled his goods, would he have withheld
          his vengeance, unless he had been too weak to execute it? We have done
          worse to God than we can do to man, and yet he draws not that sword of
          wrath out of the scabbard of his patience, to sheath it in our hearts.
          It is not so much a wonder that any judgments are sent, as that there
          are no more, and sharper. That the world shall be fired at last, is
          not a thing so strange, as that fire doth not come down every day upon
          some part of it. Had the disciples, that saw such excellent patterns
          of mildness from their Master, and were so often urged to learn of him
          that was lowly and meek, the government of the world, it had been long
          since turned into ashes, since they were too forward to desire him to
          open his magazine of judgments, and kindle a fire to consume a
          Samaritan village, for a slight affront in comparison of what he
          received from others, and afterwards from themselves in their
          forsaking of him (Luke ix. 52‒54). We should admire and praise that
          here which shall be praised in heaven; though patience shall cease as
          to its exercise after the consummation of the world, it shall not
          cease from receiving the acknowledgments of what it did, when it
          traversed the stage of this earth. If the name of God be glorified,
          and acknowledged in heaven, no question but this will also; since
          long‑suffering is one of his Divine titles, a letter in his name, as
          well as “merciful, and gracious, abundant in goodness and truth.” And
          there is good reason to think that the patience exercised towards
          some, before converting grace was ordered to seize upon them, will
          bear a great part in the anthems of heaven. The greater his
          long‑suffering hath been to men, that lay covered with their own dung,
          a long time before they were freed by grace from their filth; the more
          admiringly and loudly they will cry up his mercy to them, after they
          have passed the gulf, and see a deserved hell at a distance from them,
          and many in that place of torment who never had the tastes of so much
          forbearance. If mercy will be praised there, that which began the
          alphabet of it, cannot be forgot. If Paul speak so highly of it in a
          damping world, and under the pull‑backs of a “body of death,” as he
          doth 1 Tim. i. 16, 17: “For this cause I obtained mercy; that Christ
          might show forth all long‑suffering. Now unto the King eternal,
          immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor, and glory, for ever
          and ever. Amen.” No doubt, but he will have a higher note for it, when
          he is surrounded with a heavenly flame, and freed from all remains of
          dulness. Shall it be praised above, and have we no notes for it here
          below? Admire Christ, too, who sued out your reprieve upon the account
          of his merit. As mercy acts not upon any but in Christ, so neither had
          patience borne with any but in Christ. The pronouncing the arrest of
          judgment (Gen. viii. 21) was when “God smelled a sweet savor from
          Noah’s sacrifice,” not from the beasts offered, but the anti‑typical
          sacrifice represented. That we may be raised to bless God for it, let
          us consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The multitude of our provocations. Though some have blacker guilt
          than others, and deeper stains, yet let none wipe his mouth, but
          rather imagine himself to have but little reason to bless it. Are not
          all our offences as many as there have been minutes in our lives? All
          the moments of our continuance in the world have been moments of his
          patience and our ingratitude. Adam was punished for one sin, Moses
          excluded Canaan for a passionate unbelieving word. Ananias and
          Sapphira lost their lives for one sin against the Holy Ghost. One sin
          sullied the beauty of the world, defaced the works of God, and cracked
          heaven and earth in pieces, had not infinite satisfaction been
          proposed to the provoked Justice by the Redeemer; and not one sin
          committed, but is of the same venomous nature. How many of those
          contradictions against himself hath he borne with! Had we been only
          unprofitable to him, his forbearance of us had been miraculous; but
          how much doth it exceed a miracle, and lift itself above the meanness
          of a conjunction with such an epithet, since we have been provoking!
          Had there been no more than our impudent or careless rushings into his
          presence in worship; had they been only sins of omission, and sins of
          ignorance, it had been enough to have put a stand to any further
          operations of this perfection towards us. But add to those, sins of
          commission, sins against knowledge, sins against spiritual motions,
          sins against repeated resolutions, and pressing admonitions, the
          neglects of all the opportunities of repentance; put them all
          together, and we can as little recount them, as the sands on the
          sea‑shore. But what, do I only speak of particular men? View the whole
          world, and if our own iniquities render it an amazing patience, what a
          mighty supply will be made to it in all the numerous and weighty
          provocations, under which he hath continued the world for so many
          revolutions of years and ages! Have not all those pressed into his
          presence with a loud cry, and demanded a sentence from justice? yet
          hath not the Judge been overcome by the importunity of our sins? Were
          the devils punished for one sin, a proud thought, and that not
          committed against the blood of Christ, as we have done numberless
          times; yet hath not God made us partakers in their punishment, though
          we have exceeded them in the quality of their sin. O admirable
          patience! that would bear with me under so many, while he would not
          bear with the sinning angels for one.1042
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Consider how mean things we are, who have provoked him. What is
          man but a vile thing, that a God, abounding with all riches, should
          take care of so abject a thing, much more to bear so many affronts
          from such a drop of matter, such a nothing creature! That he that hath
          anger at his command, as well as pity, should endure such a
          detestable, deformed creature by sin, to fly in his face! “What is
          man, that thou art mindful of him?” (Ps. viii.) אנוש, miserable,
          incurable man, derived from a word, that signifies to be incurably
          sick. Man is “Adam,” earth from his earthly original, and “Enoch,”
          incurable from his corruption. Is it not worthy to be admired, that a
          God of infinite glory should wait on such Adams, worms of earth, and
          be, as it were, a servant, and attendant to such Enochs, sickly and
          peevish creatures?
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Consider who it is that is thus patient. He it is that, with one
          breath, could turn heaven and earth, and all the inhabitants of both,
          into nothing; that could, by one thunderbolt, have razed up the
          foundations of a cursed world. He that wants not instruments without
          to ruin us, that can arm our own consciences against us, and can drown
          us in our own phlegm; and, by taking out one pin from our bodies,
          cause the whole frame to fall asunder. Besides, it is a God that,
          while he suffers the sinner, hates the sin more than all the holy men
          upon earth, or angels in heaven, can do; so that his patience for a
          minute transcends the patience of all creatures, from the creation to
          the dissolution of the world: because it is the patience of a God,
          infinitely more sensible to the cursed quality of sin, and infinitely
          more detesting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Consider how long he hath forborne his anger. A reprieve for a
          week or a month is accounted a great favor in civil states; the civil
          law enacts, “That if the emperor commanded a man to be condemned, the
          execution was to be deferred thirty days: because in that time the
          prince’s anger might be appeased.”1043 But how great a favor is it to
          be reprieved thirty years for many offences, every one of which
          deserves death more at the hands of God than any offence can at the
          hands of man! Paul was, according to the common account, but about
          thirty years old at his conversion; and how much doth he elevate
          Divine long‑suffering! Certainly there are many who have more reason,
          as having larger quantities of patience cut out to them, who have
          lived to see their own gray hairs in a rebellious posture against God,
          before grace brought them to a surrender. We were all condemned in the
          womb; our lives were forfeited the first moment of our breath, but
          patience hath stopped the arrest; the merciful Creditor deserves to
          have acknowledgment from us, who hath laid by his bond so many years
          without putting it in suit against us. Many of your companions in sin
          have perhaps been surprised long ago, and haled to an eternal prison;
          nothing is remaining of them but their dust, and the time is not yet
          come for your funeral. Let it be considered, that that God that would
          not wait upon the fallen angels one instant after their sin, nor give
          them a moment’s space of repentance, hath prolonged the life of many a
          sinner in the world to innumerable moments, to 420,000 minutes in the
          space of a year, to 8,400,000 minutes in the space of twenty years.
          The damned in hell would think it a great kindness to have but a
          year’s, month’s, nay, day’s respite, as a space to repent in.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Consider also, how many have been taken away under shorter
          measures of patience: some have been struck into a hell of misery,
          while thou remainest upon an earth of forbearance. In a plague, the
          destroying angel hath hewed down others, and passed by us; the arrows
          have flew about our heads, passed over us, and stuck in the heart of a
          neighbor. How many rich men, how many of our friends and familiars,
          have been seized by death since the beginning of the year, when they
          least thought of it, and imagined it far from them! Have you not known
          some of your acquaintance snatched away in the height of a crime? Was
          not the same wrath due to you as well as to them! And had it not been
          as dreadful for you to be so surprised by Him as it was for them? Why
          should he take a less sturdy sinner out of thy company, and let thee
          remain still upon the earth? If God had dealt so with you, how had you
          been cut off, not only from the enjoyment of this life, but the hopes
          of a better! And if God had made such a providence beneficial for
          reclaiming you, how much reason have you to acknowledge him! He that
          hath had least patience, hath cause to admire; but those that have
          more, ought to exceed others in blessing him for it. If God had put an
          end to your natural life before you had made provision for eternal,
          how deplorable would your condition have been! Consider also, whoever
          have been sinners formerly of a deeper note; might not God have struck
          a man in the embraces of his harlots, and choked him in the moment of
          his excessive and intemperate healths, or on the sudden have spurted
          fire and brimstone into a blasphemer’s mouth? What if God had snatched
          you away, when you had been sleeping in some great iniquity, or sent
          you while burning in lust to the fire it merited? Might he not have
          cracked the string that linked your souls to your bodies, in the last
          sickness you had? And what then had become of you? What could have
          been expected to succeed your impenitent state in this world, but
          howlings in another? but he reprieved you upon your petitions, or the
          solicitations of your friends; and have you not broke your word with
          him? Have your hearts been steadfast; hath he not yet waited,
          expecting when you would put your vows and resolutions into execution?
          What need had he to cry out to any so loud and so long, O you fools,
          “how long will you love foolishness?” (Prov. i. 22), when he might
          have ceased his crying to you, and have by your death prevented your
          many neglects of him? Did he do all this that any of us might add new
          sins to our old; or rather, that we should bless him for his
          forbearance, comply with the end of it in reforming our lives, and
          having recourse to his mercy?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Exhortion; therefore presume not upon his patience. The exercise of
          it is not eternal; you are at present under his patience; yet, while
          you are unconverted, you are also under his anger (Ps. vii. 11), “God
          is angry with the wicked every day.” You know not how soon his anger
          may turn his patience aside, and step before it. It may be his sword
          is drawn out of his scabbard, his arrows may be settled in his bow;
          and perhaps there is but a little time before you may feel the edge of
          the one or the point of the other: and then there will be no more time
          for patience in God to us, or petition from us to him. If we repent
          here he will pardon us. If we defer repentance, and die without it, he
          will have no longer mercy to pardon, nor patience to bear. What is
          there in our power but the present? the future time we cannot command,
          the past time we cannot recall; squander not then the present away.
          The time will come when “time shall be no more,” and then
          long‑suffering shall be no more. Will you neglect the time, wherein
          patience acts, and vainly hope for a time beyond the resolves of
          patience? Will you spend that in vain, which goodness hath allotted
          you for other purposes? What an estimate will you make of a little
          forbearance to respite death, when you are gasping under the stroke of
          its arrows! How much would you value some few days of those many years
          you now trifle away! Can any think God will be always at an expense
          with them in vain, that he will have such riches trampled under their
          feet, and so many editions of his patience be made waste paper? Do you
          know how few sands are yet to run in your glass? Are you sure that He
          that waits to‑day, will wait as well to‑morrow? How can you tell, but
          that God that is slow to anger to‑day, may be swift to it the next?
          Jerusalem had but a day of peace, and the most careless sinner hath no
          more. When their day was done, they were destroyed by famine,
          pestilence, or sword, or led into a doleful captivity. Did God make
          our lives so uncertain, and the duration of his forbearance unknown to
          us, that we should live in a lazy neglect of his glory, and our own
          happiness? If you should have more patience in regard of your lives,
          do you know whether you shall have the effectual offers of grace? As
          your lives depend upon his will, so your conversion depends solely
          upon his grace. There have been many examples of those miserable
          wretches, that have been left to a reprobate sense, after they have a
          long time abused Divine forbearance. Though he waits, yet he “binds up
          sin.” (Hos. xiii. 12), “The sin of Ephraim is bound up,” as bonds are
          bound up by a creditor till a fit opportunity: when God comes to put
          the bond in suit, it will be too late to wish for that patience we
          have so scornfully despised. Consider therefore the end of patience.
          The patience of God considered in itself, without that which it tends
          to, affords very little comfort; it is but a step to pardoning mercy,
          and it may be without it, and often is. Many have been reprieved that
          were never forgiven; hell is full of those that had patience as well
          as we, but not one that accepted pardoning grace went within the gates
          of it. Patience leaves men, when their sins have ripened them for
          hell; but pardoning grace never leaves men till it hath conducted them
          to heaven. His patience speaks him placable, but doth not assure us
          that he is actually appeased. Men may hope that a long‑suffering tends
          to a pardon, but cannot be assured of a pardon, but by something else
          above mere long‑suffering. Rest not then upon bare patience, but
          consider the end of it; it is not that any should sin more freely, but
          repent more meltingly; it is not to spirit rebellion, but give a
          merciful stop to it. Why should any be so ambitious of their ruin, as
          to constrain God to ruin them against the inclinations of his sweet
          disposition?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The fourth exhortation is, Let us imitate God’s patience in our own
          to others. He is unlike God that is hurried, with an unruly impetus,
          to punish others for wronging him. The consideration of Divine
          patience should make us square ourselves according to that pattern.
          God hath exercised a long‑suffering from the fall of Adam to this
          minute on innumerable subjects, and shall we be transported with
          desire of revenge upon a single injury? If God were not “slow to
          wrath,” a sinful world had been long ago torn up from the foundation.
          And if revenge should be exercised by all men against their enemies,
          what man should have been alive, since there is not a man without an
          enemy? If every man were like Saul, breathing out threatenings, the
          world would not only be an aceldema, but a desert. How distant are
          they from the nature of God, who are in a flame upon every slight
          provocation from a sense of some feeble and imaginary honor, that must
          bloody their sword for a trifle, and write their revenge in wounds and
          death! When God hath his glory every day bespattered, yet he keeps his
          sword in his sheath; what a woe would it be to the world, if he drew
          it upon every affront! This is to be like brutes, dogs, or tigers,
          that snarl, bite, and devour, upon every slight occasion: but to be
          patient is to be divine, and to show ourselves acquainted with the
          disposition of God. “Be you therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father
          is perfect” (Matt. v. 48): i. e. Be you perfect and good; for he had
          been exhorting them to bless them that cursed them, and to do good to
          them that hated them, and that from the example God had set them, in
          causing his sun to rise upon the evil as well as the good. “Be you
          therefore perfect.” To conclude: as patience is God’s perfection, so
          it is the accomplishment of the soul: and as his “slowness to anger”
          argues the greatness of his power over himself, so an unwillingness to
          revenge is a sign of a power over ourselves which is more noble than
          to be a monarch over others.
