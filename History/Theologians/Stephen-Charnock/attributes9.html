        <h2>DISCOURSE IX.</h2>
        <p>ON THE WISDOM OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Romans xvi. 27.—To God only wise be glory, through Jesus Christ, for
          ever. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          This chapter being the last of this Epistle, is chiefly made up of
          charitable and friendly salutations and commendations of particular
          persons, according to the earliness and strength of their several
          graces, and their labor of love for the interest of God and his
          people. In verse 17, he warns them not to be drawn aside from the
          gospel doctrine, which had been taught them, by the plausible
          pretences and insinuations which the corrupters of the doctrine and
          rule of Christ never want from the suggestions of their carnal wisdom.
          The brats of soul‑destroying errors may walk about the world in a garb
          and disguise of good words and fair speeches, as it is in the 18th
          verse; by “good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the
          simple.” And for their encouragement to a constancy in the gospel
          doctrine, he assures them, that all those that would dispossess them
          of truth, to possess them with vanity, are but Satan’s instruments,
          and will fall under the same captivity and yoke with their principal
          (ver. 18); “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
          shortly.” Whence, observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. All corrupters of divine truth, and troublers of the church’s
          peace, are no better than devils. Our Saviour thought the name, Satan,
          a title merited by Peter, when he breathed out an advice, as an axe at
          the root of the gospel, the death of Christ, the foundation of all
          gospel truth; and the apostle concludes them under the same character,
          which hinder the superstructure, and would mix their chaff with his
          wheat (Matt. xvi. 23), “Get thee behind me, Satan.” It is not, Get
          thee behind me, Simon, or, Get thee behind me, Peter; but “Get thee
          behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me.” Thou dost oppose thyself
          to the wisdom, and grace, and authority of God, to the redemption of
          man, and to the good of the world. As the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of
          truth, so is Satan the spirit of falsehood: as the Holy Ghost inspires
          believers with truth, so doth the devil corrupt unbelievers with
          error. Let us cleave to the truth of the gospel, that we may not be
          counted by God as part of the corporation of fallen angels, and not be
          barely reckoned as enemies of God, but in league with the greatest
          enemy to his glory in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Reconciler of the world will be the Subduer of Satan. The God
          of peace sent the Prince of peace to be the restorer of his rights,
          and the hammer to beat in pieces the usurper of them. As a God of
          truth, he will make good his promise; as a God of peace, he will
          perfect the design his wisdom hath laid, and begun to act. In the
          subduing Satan, he will be the conqueror of his instruments: he saith
          not, God shall bruise your troublers and heretics, but Satan: the fall
          of a general proves the rout of the army. Since God, as a God of
          peace, hath delivered his own, he will perfect the victory, and make
          them cease from bruising the heel of his spiritual seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Divine evangelical truth shall be victorious. No weapon formed
          against it shall prosper: the head of the wicked shall fall as low as
          the feet of the godly. The devil never yet blustered in the world, but
          he met at last with a disappointment: his fall hath been like
          lightning, sudden, certain, vanishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Faith must look back as far as the foundation promise. “The God of
          peace shall bruise,” &amp;c. The apostle seems to allude to the first
          promise (Gen. ii. 15),—a promise that hath vigor to nourish the church
          in all ages of the world: it is the standing cordial; out of the womb
          of this promise all the rest have taken their birth. The promises of
          the Old Testament were designed for those under the New, and the full
          performance of them is to be expected, and will be enjoyed by them. It
          is a mighty strengthening to faith, to trace the footsteps of God’s
          truth and wisdom, from the threatening against the serpent in Eden, to
          the bruise he received in Calvary, and the triumph over him upon Mount
          Olivet.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We are to confide in the promise of God, but leave the season of
          its accomplishment to his wisdom. He will “bruise Satan under your
          feet,” therefore do not doubt it; and shortly, therefore, wait for it.
          Shortly it will be done, that is, quickly, when you think it may be a
          great way off; or shortly, that is, seasonably, when Satan’s rage is
          hottest. God is the best judge of the seasons of distributing his own
          mercies, and darting out his own glory: it is enough to encourage our
          waiting, that it will be, and that it will be shortly; but we must not
          measure God’s shortly by our minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle after this, concludes with a comfortable prayer, that
          since they were liable to many temptations to turn their backs upon
          the doctrine which they had learned; yet he desires God, who had
          brought them to the knowledge of his truth, would confirm them in the
          belief of it, since it was the gospel of Christ, his dear Son, and a
          mystery he had been chary of and kept in his own cabinet, and now
          brought forth to the world in pursuance of the ancient prophesies, and
          now had published to all nations for that end that it might be obeyed;
          and concludes with a doxology, a voice of praise, to Him, who was only
          wise to effect his own purposes (ver. 25, 26, 27), “Now to him that is
          of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of
          Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was
          kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest, and by
          the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the
          everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of
          faith.” This doxology is interlaced with many comforts for the Romans.
          He explains the causes of this glory to God, power, and wisdom; power
          to establish the Romans in grace, which includes his will. This he
          proves from a divine testimony, viz., the gospel; the gospel committed
          to him, and preached by him, which he commends, by calling it the
          preaching of Christ; and describes it, for the instruction and comfort
          of the church from the adjuncts, the obscurity of it under the Old
          Testament, and the clearness of it under the New. It was hid from the
          former ages, and kept in silence; not simply and absolutely, but
          comparatively and in part; because in the Old Testament, the doctrine
          of salvation by Christ was confined to the limits of Judea, preached
          only to the inhabitants of that country: to them he gave “his statutes
          and his judgments, and dealt not so magnificently with any nation”
          (Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20); but now he causes it to spring with greater
          majesty out of those narrow bounds, and spread its wings about the
          world. This manifestation of the gospel he declares, 1. from the
          subject, All nations. 2. From the principal efficient cause of it, The
          commandment and order of God. 3. The instrumental cause, The prophetic
          Scriptures. 4. From the end of it, The obedience of faith.760
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 1. The glorious attributes of God bear a comfortable respect
          to believers. Power and wisdom are here mentioned as two props of
          their faith; his power here includes his goodness. Power to help,
          without will to assist, is a dry chip. The apostle mentions not God’s
          power simply and absolutely considered, for that of itself is no more
          comfort to men, then it is to devils; but, as considered in the gospel
          covenant, his power, as well as his other perfections, are ingredients
          in that cordial of God’s being our God. We should never think of the
          excellencies of the Divine nature, without considering the duties they
          demand, and gathering the honey they present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 2. The stability of a gracious soul depends upon the wisdom as
          well as the power of God. It would be a disrepute to the Almightiness
          of God if that should be totally vanquished which was introduced by
          his mighty arm, and rooted in the soul by an irresistible grace. It
          would speak a want of strength to maintain it, or a change of
          resolution, and so would be no honor to the wisdom of his first
          design. It is no part of the wisdom of an artificer, to let a work
          wherein he determined to shew the greatness of his skill, be dashed in
          pieces, when he hath power to preserve it. God designed every gracious
          soul for a piece of his workmanship (Eph. ii. 10). What, to have the
          skill of his grace defeated? If any soul which he hath graciously
          conquered should be wrested from him, what could be thought but that
          his power is enfeebled? If deserted by him, what could be imagined,
          but that he repented of his labor, and altered his counsel, as if
          rashly undertaken? These Romans were rugged pieces, and lay in a
          filthy quarry, when God came first to smooth them; for so the apostle
          represents them with the rest of the heathen (Rom. i. 19); and would
          he throw them away, or leave them to the power of his enemy, after all
          his pains he had taken with them to fit them for his building? Did he
          not foresee the designs of Satan against them, what stratagems he
          would use to defeat his purposes and strip him of the honor of his
          work; and would God so gratify his enemy, and disgrace his own wisdom?
          The deserting of what hath been acted is a real repentance, and argues
          an imprudence in the first resolve and attempt. The gospel is called
          the manifold wisdom of God (Eph. iii. 10); the fruit of it, in the
          heart of any person, which is a main design of it, hath a title to the
          same character; and shall this grace, which is the product of this
          gospel, and therefore the birth of manifold wisdom, be suppressed? It
          is at God’s hand we must seek our fixedness and establishment, and act
          faith upon these two attributes of God. Power is no ground to expect
          stability, without wisdom interesting the agent in it, and finding out
          and applying the means for it. Wisdom is naked without power to act,
          and power is useless without wisdom to direct. They are these two
          excellencies of the Deity the apostle here pitches the hope and faith
          of the converted Romans upon for their stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 3. Perseverance of believers in grace is a gospel doctrine.
          “According to my gospel,” my gospel ministerially, according to that
          gospel doctrine I have taught you in this epistle (for, as the
          prophets were comments upon the law, so are the epistles upon the
          gospel), this very doctrine he had discoursed of (Rom. viii. 38, 39),
          where he tells them, that neither death nor life, the terrors of a
          cruel death, or the allurements of an honorable and pleasant life, nor
          principalities and powers, with all their subtelty and strength, nor
          the things we have before us, nor the promises of a future felicity,
          by either angels in heaven or devils in hell, not the highest angel,
          nor the deepest devil, is able to separate us, us Romans, “from the
          love of God which is in Christ Jesus.” So that, according to my
          gospel, may be according to that declaration of the gospel, which I
          have made in this epistle, which doth not only promise the first
          creating grace, but the perfecting and crowning grace; for not only
          the being of grace, but the health, liveness, and perpetuity of grace
          is the fruit of the new covenant (Jer. xxxii. 40.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 4. That the gospel is the sole means of a Christian’s
          establishment; “According to my gospel,” that is, by my gospel. The
          gospel is the instrumental cause of our spiritual life; it is the
          cause also of the continuance of it; it is the seed whereby we were
          born, and the milk whereby we are nourished (1 Pet. i. 23); it is the
          “power of God to salvation” (1 Pet. ii. 2), and therefore to all the
          degrees of it (John xvii. 17); “Sanctify them by thy truth,” or
          through thy truth; by or through his truth he sanctifies us, and by
          the same truth he establisheth us. The first sanctification, and the
          progress of it, the first lineaments, and the last colors, are wrought
          by the gospel. The gospel, therefore, ought to be known, studied, and
          considered by us. It is the charter of our inheritance, and the
          security for our standing. The law acquaints us with our duty, but
          contributes nothing to our strength and settlement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 5. The gospel is nothing else but the revelation of Christ
          (ver. 25); “According to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ;”
          the discovery of the mystery of redemption and salvation in and by
          him. It is genitivus objecti, that preaching wherein Christ is
          declared and set out, with the benefits accruing by him. This is the
          privilege, the wisdom of God reserved for the latter times, which the
          Old Testament church had only under a veil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 6. It is a part of the excellency of the gospel that it had
          the Son of God for its publisher: “The preaching of Jesus Christ.” It
          was first preached to Adam, in Paradise, by God; and afterwards
          published by Christ in person, to the inhabitants of Judea. It was not
          the invention of man, but copied from the bosom of the Father by him
          that lay in his bosom. The gospel we have, is the same which our
          Saviour himself preached when he was in the world: he preached it not
          to the Romans, but the same gospel he preached is transmitted to the
          Romans. It, therefore, commands our respect; whoever slights it, it is
          as much as if he slighted Jesus Christ himself, were he in person to
          sound it from his own lips. The validity of a proclamation is derived
          from the authority of the prince that dictates it and orders it; yet
          the greater the person that publisheth it, the more dishonor is cast
          upon the authority of the prince that enjoins it, if it be contemned.
          The everlasting God ordained it, and the eternal Son published it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 7. The gospel was of an eternal resolution, though of a
          temporary revelation (ver. 25); “According to the revelation of the
          mystery, which was kept secret since the world began.” It is an
          everlasting gospel; it was a promise “before the world began” (Titus
          i. 2). It was not a new invention, but only kept secret among the
          arcana, in the breast of the Almighty. It was hidden from angels, for
          the depths of it are not yet fully made known to them; their desire to
          look into it, speaks yet a deficiency in their knowledge of it (1
          Peter, i. 12). It was published in paradise, but in such words as Adam
          did not fully understand: it was both discovered and clouded in the
          smoke of sacrifices: it was wrapped up in a veil under the law, but
          not opened till the death of the Redeemer: it was then plainly said to
          the cities of Judah, “Behold! your God comes!” The whole transaction
          of it between the Father and the Son, which is the spirit of the
          gospel, was from eternity; the creation of the world was in order to
          the manifestation of it. Let us not, then, regard the gospel as a
          novelty; the consideration of it, as one of God’s cabinet rarities,
          should enhance our estimation of it. No traditions of men, no
          inventions of vain wits, that pretend to be wiser than God, should
          have the same credit with that which bears date from eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observ. 8. That divine truth is mysterious; “According to the
          revelation of the mystery, Christ manifested in the flesh.” The whole
          scheme of godliness is a mystery. No man or angel could imagine how
          two natures so distant as the Divine and human should be united; how
          the same person should be criminal and righteous; how a just God
          should have a satisfaction, and sinful man a justification; how the
          sin should be punished, and the sinner saved. None could imagine such
          a way of justification as the apostle in this epistle declares: it was
          a mystery when hid under the shadows of the law, and a mystery to the
          prophets when it sounded from their mouths; they searched it, without
          being able to comprehend it (1 Peter, i. 10, 11.) If it be a mystery,
          it is humbly to be submitted to: mysteries surmount human reason. The
          study of the gospel must not be with a yawning and careless frame.
          Trades, you call mysteries, are not learned sleeping and nodding:
          diligence is required; we must be disciples at God’s feet. As it had
          God for the author, so we must have God for the teacher of it; the
          contrivance was his, and the illumination of our minds must be from
          him. As God only manifested the gospel, so he can only open our eyes
          to see the mysteries of Christ in it. In verse 26 we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Scriptures of the Old Testament verify the substance of the
          New, and the New doth evidence the authority of the Old, by the
          Scriptures of the prophets made known. The Old Testament credits the
          New, and the New illustrates the Old. The New Testament is a comment
          upon the prophetic part of the Old. The Old shews the promises and
          predictions of God, and the New shews the performance. What was
          foretold in the Old, is fulfilled in the New; the predictions are
          cleared by the events. The predictions of the Old are divine, because
          they are above the reason of man to foreknow; none but an infinite
          knowledge could foretel them, because none but an infinite wisdom
          could order all things for the accomplishment of them. The Christian
          religion hath, then, the surest foundation, since the Scriptures of
          the prophets, wherein it is foretold, are of undoubted antiquity, and
          owned by the Jews and many heathens, which are and were the great
          enemies of Christ. The Old Testament is therefore to be read for the
          strengthening of our faith. Our blessed Saviour himself draws the
          streams of his doctrine from the Old Testament: he clears up the
          promise of eternal life, and the doctrine of the resurrection, from
          the words of the covenant, “I am the God of Abraham,” &amp;c. (Matt.
          xxii. 32.) And our apostle clears up the doctrine of justification by
          faith from God’s covenant with Abraham (Rom. iv.) It must be read, and
          it must be read as it is writ: it was writ to a gospel end, it must be
          studied with a gospel spirit. The Old Testament was writ to give
          credit to the New, when it should be manifested in the world. It must
          be read by us to give strength to our faith, and establish us in the
          doctrine of Christianity. How many view it as a bare story, an
          almanack out of date, and regard it as a dry bone, without sucking
          from it the evangelical marrow! Christ is, in Genesis, Abraham’s seed;
          in David’s psalms and the prophets, the Messiah and Redeemer of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Observe, The antiquity of the gospel is made manifest by the
          Scriptures of the prophets. It was of as ancient a date as any
          prophecy: the first prophecy was nothing else but a gospel charter; it
          was not made at the incarnation of Christ, but made manifest. It then
          rose up to its meridian lustre, and sprung out of the clouds,
          wherewith it was before obscured. The gospel was preached to the
          ancients by the prophets, as well as to the Gentiles by the apostles
          (Heb. iv. 2); “Unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them.”
          To them first, to us after; to them indeed more cloudy, to us more
          clear; but they as well as we, were evangelized, as the word
          signifies. The covenant of grace was the same in the writings of the
          prophets, and the declarations of the evangelists and apostles. Though
          by our Saviour’s incarnation, the gospel light was clearer, and by his
          ascension, the effusions of the Spirit fuller and stronger; yet the
          believers under the Old Testament, saw Christ in the swaddling bands
          of legal ceremonies, and the lattice of prophetical writings; they
          could not else offer one sacrifice, or read one prophecy with a faith
          of the right stamp. Abraham’s justifying faith had Christ for its
          object, though it was not so explicit as ours, because the
          manifestation was not so clear as ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. All truth is to be drawn from Scripture. The apostle refers them
          here to the gospel and the prophets: the Scripture is the source of
          divine knowledge; not the traditions of men, nor reason separate from
          Scripture. Whosoever brings another doctrine, coins another Christ;
          nothing is to be added to what is written, nothing detracted from it.
          He doth not send us for truth, to the puddles of human inventions, to
          the enthusiasms of our brain; not to the See of Rome, no, nor to the
          instructions of angels; but the writings of the prophets, as they
          clear up the declarations of the apostles. The church of Rome is not
          made here the standard of truth: but the Scriptures of the prophets
          are to be the touch‑stone to the Romans, for the trial of the truth of
          the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. How great is the goodness of God! The borders of grace are enlarged
          to the Gentiles, and not hid under the skirts of the Jews. He that was
          so long the God of the Jews, is now also manifest to be the God of the
          Gentiles: the gospel is now made known to all nations, according to
          the commandment of the everlasting God. Not only in a way of common
          providence, but special grace; in calling them to the knowledge of
          himself, and a justification of them by faith, he hath brought
          strangers to him, to the adoption of children, and lodged them under
          the wings of the covenant, that were before alienated from him through
          the universal corruption of nature. Now he hath manifested himself a
          God of truth, mindful of his promise in blessing all nations in the
          seed of Abraham. The fury of devils, and the violence of men could not
          hinder the propagation of the gospel: its light hath been dispersed as
          far as that of the sun; and that grace that founded in the Gentile’s
          ears, hath bent many of their hearts to the obedience of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Observe that libertinism and licentiousness find no encouragement
          in the gospel. It was made known to all nations for the obedience of
          faith. The goodness of God is published, that our enmity to him may be
          parted with. Christ’s righteousness is not offered to us to be put on,
          that we may roll more warmly in our lusts. The doctrine of grace
          commands us to give up ourselves to Christ, to be accepted through
          him, and to be ruled by him. Obedience is due to God, as a sovereign
          lord in his law; and it is due out of gratitude, as he is a God of
          grace in the gospel. The discovery of a further perfection in God
          weakens not the right of another, nor the obligation of the duty the
          former attribute claims at our hands. The gospel frees us from the
          curse, but not from the duty and service: “We are delivered from the
          hands of our enemies, that we might serve God in holiness and
          righteousness” (Luke i. 74). “This is the will of God” in the gospel,
          “even our sanctification.” When a prince strikes off a malefactor’s
          chains, though he deliver him from the punishment of his crime, he
          frees him not from the duty of a subject: his pardon adds a greater
          obligation than his protection did before, while he was loyal.
          Christ’s righteousness gives us a title to heaven; but there must be a
          holiness to give us a fitness for heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Observe, that evangelical obedience, or the obedience of Faith, is
          only acceptable to God. Obedience of faith; genitivus speciei, noting
          the kind of obedience God requires; an obedience springing from faith,
          animated and influenced by faith. Not obedience of faith, as though
          faith were the rule, and the law were abrogated; but to the law as a
          rule, and from faith as a principle. There is no true obedience before
          faith (Heb. xi. 6.) “Without faith it is impossible to please God;”
          and therefore without faith impossible to obey him. A good work cannot
          proceed from a defiled mind and conscience; and without faith every
          man’s mind is darkened, and his conscience polluted (Tit. i. 15).
          Faith is the band of union to Christ, and obedience is the fruit of
          union; we cannot bring forth fruit without being branches (John xv. 4,
          5), and we cannot be branches without believing. Legitimate fruit
          follows upon marriage to Christ, not before it (Rom. vii. 4). “That
          you should be married to another, even to him that is raised from the
          dead, that you should bring forth fruit unto God.” All fruit before
          marriage is bastard, and bastards were excluded from the sanctuary.
          Our persons must be first accepted in Christ, before our services can
          be acceptable; those works are not acceptable where the person is not
          pardoned. Good works flow from a pure heart; but the heart cannot be
          pure before faith. All the good works reckoned up in the eleventh
          chapter of the Hebrews were from this spring; those heroes first
          believed and then obeyed. By faith Abel was righteous before God,
          without it his sacrifice had been no better than Cain’s: by faith
          Enoch pleased God, and had a divine testimony to his obedience before
          his translation; by faith Abraham offered up Isaac, without which he
          had been no better than a murderer. All obedience hath its root in
          faith, and is not done in our own strength, but in the strength and
          virtue of another, of Christ, whom God hath set forth as our head and
          root.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Observe, faith and obedience are distinct, though inseparable: “The
          obedience of faith.” Faith, indeed, is obedience to a gospel command,
          which enjoins us to believe; but it is not all our obedience.
          Justification and sanctification are distinct acts of God;
          justification respects the person, sanctification the nature;
          justification is first in order of nature, and sanctification follows:
          they are distinct, but inseparable; every justified person hath a
          sanctified nature, and every sanctified nature supposeth a justified
          person. So faith and obedience are distinct: faith as the principle,
          obedience as the product; faith as the cause, obedience as the effect;
          the cause and the effect are not the same. By faith we own Christ as
          our Lord: by obedience we regulate ourselves according to his command.
          The acceptance of the relation to him as a subject, precedes the
          performance of our duty: by faith we receive his law, and by obedience
          we fulfil it. Faith makes us God’s children (Gal. iii. 26). Obedience
          manifests us to be Christ’s disciples (John xv. 8). Faith is the
          touchstone of obedience; the touchstone, and that which is tried by
          it, are not the same. But though they are distinct, yet they are
          inseparable. Faith and obedience are joined together; obedience
          follows faith at the heels. Faith purifies the heart, and a pure heart
          cannot be without pure actions. Faith unites us to Christ, whereby we
          partake of his life; and a living branch cannot be without fruit in
          its season, and “much fruit” (John xv. 5), and that naturally from a
          “newness of spirit” (Rom. vii. 9); not constrained by the rigors of
          the law, but drawn forth from a sweetness of love; for faith works by
          love. The love of God is the strong motive, and love to God is the
          quickening principle; as there can be no obedience without faith, so
          no faith without obedience. After all this, the apostle ends with the
          celebration of the wisdom of God; “To God only wise, be glory, through
          Jesus Christ forever.” The rich discovery of the gospel cannot be
          thought of, by a gracious soul, without a return of praise to God, and
          admiration of his singular wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wise God. His power before, and his wisdom here, are mentioned in
          conjunction (in which his goodness is included, as interested in his
          establishing power) as the ground of all the glory and praise God hath
          from his creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only wise. As Christ saith (Matt. xix. 17), “None is good, but God;”
          so the apostle saith, None wise, but God. As all creatures are unclean
          in regard of his purity, so they are all fools in regard of his
          wisdom; yea, the glorious angels themselves (Job iv. 18). Wisdom is
          the royalty of God; the proper dialect of all his ways and works. No
          creature can lay claim to it; he is so wise, that he is wisdom itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be glory, through Jesus Christ. As God is only known in and by Christ,
          so he must be only worshipped and celebrated in and through Christ. In
          him we must pray to him, and in him we must praise him. As all mercies
          flow from God through Christ to us, so all our duties are to be
          presented to God through Christ. In the Greek, verbatim, it runs thus:
          “To the alone wise God, through Jesus Christ, to him be glory
          forever.” But we must not understand it, as if God were wise by Jesus
          Christ, but that thanks is to be given to God through Christ; because
          in and by Christ God hath revealed his wisdom to the world. The Greek
          hath a repetition of the article ᾧ, and expressed in the translation,
          “To him be glory.” Beza expungeth this article, but without reason,
          for ᾧ is as much as αὐτῷ, “to him;” and joining this, “the only wise
          God” with ver. 25, “to him that is of power to establish you;” reading
          it thus, “To him that is of power to establish you, the only wise
          God,” leaving the rest in a parenthesis, it runs smoothly, “to him be
          glory, through Jesus Christ,” And Crellius, the Socinian, observes,
          that this article ᾧ, which some leave out, might be industriously
          inserted by the apostle, to shew that the glory we ascribe to God is
          also given to Christ. We may observe, that neither in this place, nor
          any where in Scripture, is the Virgin Mary, or any of the saints,
          associated with God or Christ in the glory ascribed to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the words there is, 1. An appropriation of wisdom to God, and a
          remotion of it from all creatures; “only wise God.” 2. A glorifying
          him for it. The point I shall insist upon is, That wisdom is a
          transcendant excellency of the Divine nature. We have before spoken of
          the knowledge of God, and the infiniteness of it; the next attribute
          is the wisdom of God. Most confound the knowledge and wisdom of God
          together; but there is a manifest distinction between them in our
          conception. I shall handle it thus: I. Shew what wisdom is. Then lay
          down, II. Some propositions about the wisdom of God. And shew, III.
          That God is wise, and only wise. IV. Wherein his wisdom appears. V.
          The Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. What wisdom is. Wisdom, among the Greeks, first signified an
          eminent perfection in any art or mystery; so a good statuary,
          engraver, or limner, was called wise, as having an excellent knowledge
          in his particular art. But afterwards the title of wise was
          appropriated to those that devoted themselves to the contemplation of
          the highest things that served for a foundation to speculative
          sciences.761 But ordinarily we count a man a wise man, when he
          conducts his affairs with discretion, and governs his passions with
          moderation, and carries himself with a due proportion and harmony in
          all his concerns. But in particular, wisdom consists,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In acting for a right end. The chiefest part of prudence is in
          fixing a right end, and in choosing fit means, and directing them to
          that scope; to shoot at random is a mark of folly. As he is the wisest
          man that hath the noblest end and fittest means, so God is infinitely
          wise; as he is the most excellent being, so he hath the most excellent
          end. As there is none more excellent than himself, nothing can be his
          end but himself; as he is the cause of all, so he is the end of all;
          and he puts a true bias into all the means he useth to hit the mark he
          aims at: “Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things” (Rom.
          xi. 36).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Wisdom consists in observing all circumstances for action. He is
          counted a wise man that lays hold of the fittest opportunities to
          bring his designs about, that hath the fullest foresight of all the
          little intrigues which may happen in a business he is to manage, and
          times every part of his action in an exact harmony with the proper
          minutes of it. God hath all the circumstances of things in one entire
          image before him; he hath a prospect of every little creek in any
          design. He sees what second causes will act, and when they will act
          this or that; yea, he determines them to such and such acts; so that
          it is impossible he should be mistaken, or miss of the due season of
          bringing about his own purposes. As he hath more goodness than to
          deceive any, so he hath more understanding than to be mistaken in any
          thing. Hence the time of the incarnation of our blessed Saviour is
          called the fulness of time, the proper season for his coming. Every
          circumstance about Christ was timed according to the predictions of
          God; even so little a thing as not parting his garment, and the giving
          him gall and vinegar to drink; and all the blessings he showers down
          upon his people, according to the covenant of grace, are said to come
          “in his season” (Ezek. xxxiv. 25, 26).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Wisdom consists in willing and acting according to the right
          reason, according to a right judgment of things. We can never count a
          wilful man a wise man; but him only that acts according to a right
          rule, when right counsels are taken and vigorously executed. The
          resolves and ways of God are not mere will, but will guided by the
          reason and counsel of his own infinite understanding (Eph. i. 11);
          “Who works all things according to the counsel of his own will.” The
          motions of the Divine will are not rash, but follow the proposals of
          the Divine mind; he chooses that which is fittest to be done, so that
          all his works are graceful, and all his ways have a comeliness and
          decorum in them. Hence all his ways are said to be “judgment” (Deut.
          xxxii. 4), not mere will. Hence it appears, that wisdom and knowledge
          are two distinct perfections. Knowledge hath its seat in the
          speculative understanding, wisdom in the practical. Wisdom and
          knowledge are evidently distinguished as two several gifts of the
          Spirit in man (1 Cor. xii. 8); “To one is given, by the Spirit, the
          word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, by the same
          Spirit.” Knowledge is an understanding of general rules, and wisdom is
          a drawing conclusions from those rules in order to particular cases. A
          man may have the knowledge of the whole Scripture, and have all
          learning in the treasury of his memory, and yet be destitute of skill
          to make use of them upon particular occasions, and untie those knotty
          questions which may be proposed to him, by a ready application of
          those rules. Again, knowledge and wisdom may be distinguished, in our
          conception, as two distinct perfections in God: the knowledge of God
          is his understanding of all things; his wisdom is the skilful
          resolving and acting of all things. And the apostle, in his admiration
          of him, owns them as distinct; “O the depths of the riches, both of
          the wisdom and knowledge of God” (Rom. xi. 33)! Knowledge is the
          foundation of wisdom, and antecedent to it; wisdom the superstructure
          upon knowledge: men may have knowledge without wisdom, but not wisdom
          without knowledge; according to our common proverb, “The greatest
          clerks are not the wisest men.” All practical knowledge is founded in
          speculation, either secundum rem, as in a man; or, secundum rationem,
          as in God. They agree in this, that they are both acts of the
          understanding; but knowledge is the apprehension of a thing, and
          wisdom is the appointing and ordering of things. Wisdom is the
          splendor and lustre of knowledge shining forth in operations, and is
          an act both of understanding and will; understanding in counselling
          and contriving, will in resolving and executing: counsel and will are
          linked together (Eph. i. 11).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thing is to lay down some propositions in general,
          concerning the wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, There is an essential and a personal wisdom of God. The
          essential wisdom, is the essence of God; the personal wisdom is the
          Son of God. Christ is called Wisdom by himself (Luke vii. 35). The
          wisdom of God by the apostle (1 Cor. i. 24). The wisdom I speak of
          belongs to the nature of God, and is considered a necessary
          perfection. The personal wisdom is called so, because he opens to us
          the secrets of God. If the Son were that wisdom whereby the Father is
          wise, the Son would be also the essence whereby the Father is God. If
          the Son were the wisdom of the Father, whereby he is essentially wise,
          the Son would be the essence of the Father, and the Father would have
          his essence from the Son, since the wisdom of God is the essence of
          God; and so the Son would be the Father, if the wisdom and power of
          the Father were originally in the Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Therefore the wisdom of God is the same with the essence of
          God. Wisdom in God is not a habit added to his essence, as it is in
          man, but it is his essence. It is like the splendor of the sun, the
          same with the sun itself; or like the brightness of crystal, which is
          not communicated to it by anything else, as the brightness of a
          mountain is by the beam of the sun, but it is one with the crystal
          itself. It is not a habit superadded to the Divine essence; that would
          be repugnant to the simplicity of God, and speak him compounded of
          divers principles; it would be contrary to the eternity of his
          perfections: if he be eternally wise, his wisdom is his essence; for
          there is nothing eternal but the essence of God. As the sun melts some
          things, and hardens others; blackens some things, and whitens others,
          and produceth contrary qualities in different subjects, yet it is but
          one and the same quality in the sun, which is the cause of those
          contrary operations; so the perfections of God seem to be diverse in
          our conceptions, yet they are but one and the same in God.762 The
          wisdom of God, is God acting prudently; as the power of God, is God
          acting powerfully; and the justice of God, is God acting righteously;
          and therefore it is more truly said, that God is wisdom, justice,
          truth, power, than that he is wise, just, true, &amp;c. as if he were
          compounded of substance and qualities. All the operations of God
          proceed from one simple essence; as all the operations of the mind of
          man, though various, proceed from one faculty of understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Wisdom is the property of God alone: He is “only wise.” It is
          an honor peculiar to him. Upon the account that no man deserved the
          title of wise, but that it was a royalty belonging to God,763
          Pythagoras would not be called Σόφος, a title given to their learned
          men, but Φιλόσοφος. The name philosopher arose out of a respect to
          this transcendent perfection of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God is “only wise” necessarily. As he is necessarily God, so he is
          necessarily wise; for the notion of wisdom is inseparable from the
          notion of a Deity. When we say, God is a Spirit, is true, righteous,
          wise; we understand that he is transcendently these, by an intrinsic
          and absolute necessity, by virtue of his own essence, without the
          efficiency of any other, or any efficiency in and by himself. God doth
          not make himself wise, no more than he makes himself God. As he is a
          necessary Being in regard of his life, so he is necessarily wise in
          regard of his understanding. Synesius saith, that God is essentiated,
          οὐσιοῦσθαι, by his understanding. He places the substance of God in
          understanding and wisdom: wisdom is the first vital operation of God.
          He can no more be unwise than he can be untrue; for folly in the mind
          is much the same with falsity in speech. Wisdom among men is gained by
          age and experience, furthered by instructions and exercise; but the
          wisdom of God is his nature. As the sun cannot be without light, while
          it remains a sun, and as eternity cannot be without immortality, so
          neither can God be without wisdom. As he only hath immortality (1 Tim.
          vi. 16), not arbitrarily, but necessarily; so he only hath wisdom: not
          because he will be wise, but because he cannot but be wise. He cannot
          but contrive counsels, and exert operations, becoming the greatness
          and majesty of his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Therefore “only wise” originally. God is αὐτοδίδακτος αὐτόσοφος.
          Men acquire wisdom by the loss of their fairest years; but his wisdom
          is the perfection of the Divine nature, not the birth of study, or the
          growth of experience, but as necessary, as eternal, as his essence. He
          goes not out of himself to search wisdom: he needs no more the brains
          of creatures in the contrivance of his purposes, than he doth their
          arm in the execution of them. He needs no counsel, he receives no
          counsel from any (Rom. xi. 34): “Who hath been his counsellor?” and
          (Isa. xl. 14) “With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, or
          taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
          showed to him the path of understanding?” He is the only Fountain of
          wisdom to others; angels and men have what wisdom they have, by
          communication from him. All created wisdom is a spark of the Divine
          light, like that of the stars borrowed from the sun. He that borrows
          wisdom from another, and doth not originally possess it in his own
          nature, cannot properly be called wise. As God is the only Being, in
          regard that all other beings are derived from him, so he is only wise,
          because all other wisdom flows from him. He is the spring of wisdom to
          all; none the original of wisdom to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Therefore “only wise” perfectly. There is no cloud upon his
          understanding. He hath a distinct and certain knowledge of all things
          that can fall under action; as he hath a perfect knowledge without
          ignorance, so he hath a beautiful wisdom without mole or wart. Men are
          wise, yet have not an understanding so vast as to grasp all things,
          nor a perspicacity so clear, as to penetrate into the depths of all
          being. Angels have more delightful and lively sparks of wisdom, yet so
          imperfect, that in regard of the wisdom of God they are charged with
          folly (Job iv. 18). Their wisdom as well as their holiness is veiled
          in the presence of God. It vanisheth, as the glowing of a fire doth
          before the beauty of the sun, or as the light of a candle in the midst
          of a sunshine contracts itself, and none of its rays are seen, but in
          the body of the flame. The angels are not perfectly wise, because they
          are not perfectly knowing: the gospel, the great discovery of God’s
          wisdom, was hid from them for ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Therefore “only wise” universally. Wisdom in one man is of one
          sort, in another of another sort; one is a wise tradesman, another a
          wise statesman, and another a wise philosopher: one is wise in the
          business of the world, another is wise in divine concerns. One hath
          not so much of plenty of one sort, but he may have a scantiness in
          another; one may be wise for invention, and foolish in execution; an
          artificer may have skill to frame an engine, and not skill to use it.
          The ground that is fit for olives may not be fit for vines; that will
          bear one sort of grain and not another. But God hath an universal
          wisdom, because his nature is wise; it is not limited, but hovers over
          everything, shines in every being. His executions are as wise as his
          contrivances: he is wise in his resolves, and wise in his ways: wise
          in all the varieties of his works of creation, government, redemption.
          As his will wills all things, and his power effects all things, so his
          wisdom is the universal director of the motions of his will, and the
          executions of his power: as his righteousness is the measure of the
          matter of his actions, so his wisdom is the rule that directs the
          manner of his actions. The absolute power of God is not an unruly
          power: his wisdom orders all things, so that nothing is done but what
          is fit and convenient, and agreeable to so excellent a Being: as he
          cannot do an unjust thing because of his righteousness, so he cannot
          do an unwise act, because of his infinite wisdom. Though God be not
          necessitated to any operation without himself, as to the creation of
          anything, yet supposing he will act, his wisdom necessitates him to do
          that which is congruous, as his righteousness necessitates him to do
          that which is just: so that though the will of God be the principle,
          yet his wisdom is the rule of his actions. We must, in our conceiving
          of the order, suppose wisdom antecedent to will: none that
          acknowledges a God can have such an impious thought as to affix
          temerity and rashness to any of his proceedings. All his decrees are
          drawn out of the infinite treasury of wisdom in himself.764 He
          resolves nothing about any of his creatures without reason; but the
          reason of his purposes is in himself, and springs from himself, and
          not from the creatures: there is not one thing that he wills but “he
          wills by counsel, and works by counsel” (Eph. i. 11). Counsel writ
          down every line, every letter, in his eternal Book; and all the orders
          are drawn out from thence by his wisdom and will: what was illustrious
          in the contrivance, glitters in the execution. His understanding and
          will are infinite; what is therefore the act of his will, is the
          result of his understanding, and therefore rational. His understanding
          and will join hands; there is no contest in God, will against mind,
          and mind against will; they are one in God, one in his resolves, and
          one in all his works.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Therefore he is “only wise” perpetually. As the wisdom of man is
          got by ripeness of age, so it is lost by decay of years; it is got by
          instruction, and lost by dotage. The perfectest minds, when in the
          wane, have been darkened with folly: Nebuchadnezzar, that was wise for
          a man, became as foolish as a brute. But the Ancient of Days is an
          unchangeable possessor of prudence; his wisdom is a mirror of
          brightness, without a defacing spot. It was “possessed by him in the
          beginning of his ways, before his works of old” (Prov. viii. 22), and
          he can never be dispossessed of it in the end of his works. It is
          inseparable from him: the being of his Godhead may as soon cease as
          the beauty of his mind; “with him is wisdom” (Job xii. 13); it is
          inseparable from him; therefore, as durable as his essence. It is a
          wisdom infinite, and therefore without increase or decrease in itself.
          The experience of so many ages in the government of the world hath
          added nothing to the immensity of it, as the shining of the sun since
          the creation of the world hath added nothing to the light of that
          glorious body. As ignorance never darkens his knowledge, so folly
          never disgraces his prudence. God infatuates men, but neither men nor
          devils can infatuate God; he is unerringly wise; his counsel doth not
          vary and flatter; it is not one day one counsel, and another day
          another, but it stands like an immovable rock, or a mountain of brass.
          “The counsel of the Lord stands forever, and the thoughts of his heart
          to all generations” (Ps. xxxiii. 11).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. He is only wise incomprehensibly. “His thoughts are deep” (Ps.
          xcii. 5); “His judgments unsearchable, his ways past finding out”
          (Rom. xi. 33): depths that cannot be fathomed; a splendor more
          dazzling to our dim minds than the light of the sun to our weak eyes.
          The wisdom of one man may be comprehended by another, and
          over‑comprehended; and often men are understood by others to be wiser
          in their actions than they understand themselves to be; and the wisdom
          of one angel may be measured by another angel of the same perfection.
          But as the essence, so the wisdom of God is incomprehensible to any
          creature; God is only comprehended by God. The secrets of wisdom in
          God are double to the expressions of it in his works (Job xi. 6, 7):
          “Canst thou, by searching, find out God?” There is an unfathomable
          depth in all his decrees, in all his works; we cannot comprehend the
          reason of his works, much less that of his decrees, much less that in
          his nature; because his wisdom, being infinite as well as his power,
          can no more act to the highest pitch than his power. As his power is
          not terminated by what he hath wrought, but he could give further
          testimonies of it, so neither is his wisdom, but he could furnish us
          with infinite expressions and pieces of his skill. As in regard of his
          immensity he is not bounded by the limits of place; in regard of his
          eternity, not measured by the minutes of time; in regard of his power,
          not terminated with this or that number of objects; so, in regard of
          his wisdom, he is not confined to this or that particular mode of
          working; so that in regard of the reason of his actions, as well as
          the glory and majesty of his nature, he dwells in unapproachable light
          (1 Tim. vi. 16); and whatsoever we understand of his wisdom in
          creation and providence, is infinitely less than what is in himself
          and his own unbounded nature. Many things in Scripture are declared
          chiefly to be the acts of the Divine will, yet we must not think that
          they were acts of mere will without wisdom, but they are represented
          so to us, because we are not capable of understanding the infinite
          reason of its acts: his sovereignty is more intelligible to us than
          his wisdom. We can better know the commands of a superior, and the
          laws of a prince, than understand the reason that gave birth to those
          laws. We may know the orders of the Divine will, as they are
          published, but not the sublime reason of his will. Though election be
          an act of God’s sovereignty, and he hath no cause from without to
          determine him, yet his infinite wisdom stood not silent while mere
          dominion acted. Whatsoever God doth, he doth wisely, as well as
          sovereignly; though that wisdom which lies in the secret places of the
          Divine Being be as incomprehensible to us as the effects of his
          sovereignty and power in the world are visible, God can give a reason
          of his proceeding, and that drawn from himself, though we understand
          it not. The causes of things visible lie hid from us. Doth any man
          know how to distinguish the seminal virtue of a small seed from the
          body of it, and in what nook and corner that lies, and what that is
          that spreads itself in so fair a plant, and so many flowers? Can we
          comprehend the justice of God’s proceedings in the prosperity of the
          wicked, and the afflictions of the godly? Yet as we must conclude them
          the fruits of an unerring righteousness, so we must conclude all his
          actions the fruits of an unspotted wisdom, though the concatenation of
          all his counsels is not intelligible to us; for he is as essentially
          and necessarily wise, as he is essentially and necessarily good and
          righteous. God is not only so wise that nothing more wise can be
          conceived, but he is more wise than can be imagined; something greater
          in all his perfections than can be comprehended by any creature. It is
          a foolish thing, therefore, to question that which we cannot
          comprehend; we should adore it instead of disputing against it; and
          take it for granted, that God would not order anything, were it not
          agreeable to the sovereignty of his wisdom, as well as that of his
          will. Though the reason of man proceed from the wisdom of God, yet
          there is more difference between the reason of man, and the wisdom of
          God, than between the light of the sun, and the feeble shining of the
          glow‑worm; yet we presume to censure the ways of God, as if our
          purblind reason had a reach above him.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. God is “only wise” infallibly. The wisest men meet with rubs in the
          way, that make them fall short of what they aim at; they often design,
          and fail; then begin again; and yet all their counsels end in smoke,
          and none of them arrive at perfection. If the wisest angels lay a
          plot, they may be disappointed; for though they are higher and wiser
          than man, yet there is One higher and wiser than they, that can check
          their projects. God always compasseth his end, never fails of anything
          he designs and aims at; all his undertakings are counsel and will; as
          nothing can resist the efficacy of his will, so nothing can
          countermine the skill of his counsel: “There is no wisdom, nor
          understanding, nor counsel against the Lord” (Prov. xxi. 30). He
          compasseth his ends by those actions of men and devils, wherein they
          think to cross him; they shoot at their own mark, and hit his.
          Lucifer’s plot, by divine wisdom, fulfilled God’s purpose against
          Lucifer’s mind. The counsel of redemption by Christ, the end of the
          creation of the world, rode into the world upon the back of the
          serpent’s temptation. God never mistakes the means, nor can there be
          any disappointments to make him vary his counsels, and pitch upon
          other means than what before he had ordained. His “word that goeth
          forth of his mouth shall not return to him void, but it shall
          accomplish that which he pleases, and it shall prosper in the thing
          whereto he sent it” (Isa. lv. 11). What is said of his word, is true
          of his counsel; it shall prosper in the thing for which it is
          appointed; it cannot be defeated by all the legions of men and devils;
          for “as he thinks, so shall it come to pass; and as he hath purposed,
          so shall it stand; the Lord hath purposed, and who shall disannul it”
          (Isa. xiv. 24, 27)? The wisdom of the creature is a drop from the
          wisdom of God, and is like a drop to the ocean, and a shadow to the
          sun; and, therefore, is not able to meet the wisdom of God, which is
          infinite and boundless. No wisdom is exempted from mistakes, but the
          Divine: he is wise in all his resolves, and never “calls back his
          words” and purposes (Isa. xxxi. 2).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third general is to prove that God is wise. This is ascribed
          to God in Scripture (Dan. ii. 20); “Wisdom and might are his;” wisdom
          to contrive, and power to effect. Where should wisdom dwell, but in
          the head of a Deity? and where should power triumph, but in the arm of
          Omnipotency?765 All that God doth, he doth artificially, skilfully;
          whence he is called the “Builder of the heavens” (Heb. xi. 10),
          Τεχνίτης an artifical and curious builder, a builder by art: and that
          word (Prov. viii. 30) meant of Christ; “Then I was by him as one
          brought up with him;” some render it, Then I was the curious
          artificer; and the same word, is translated, a cunning workman (Cant.
          vii. 5). For this cause, counsel is ascribed to God;766 not properly,
          for counsel implies something of ignorance, or irresolution,
          antecedent to the consultation, and a posture of will afterwards,
          which was not before. Counsel is, properly, a laborious deliberation,
          and a reasoning of things; an invention of means for the attainment of
          the end, after a discussing and reasoning of all the doubts which
          arise, pro re natâ, about the matter in counsel. But God hath no need
          to deliberate in himself what are the best means to accomplish his
          ends: he is never ignorant or undetermined what course he should take,
          as men are before they consult. But it is an expression, in
          condescension to our capacity, to signify that God doth nothing but
          with reason and understanding, with the highest prudence and for the
          most glorious ends, as men do after consultation and the weighing of
          every foreseen circumstance. Though he acts all things sovereignly by
          his will, yet he acts all things wisely by his understanding; and
          there is not a decree of his will but he can render a satisfactory
          reason for, in the face of men and angels. As he is the cause of all
          things, so he hath the highest wisdom for the ordering of all things.
          If wisdom among men be the knowledge of divine and human things, God
          must be infinitely wise, since knowledge is most radiant in him; he
          knows what angels and men do and infinitely more; what is known by
          them obscurely, is known by him clearly; what is known by man after it
          is done, was known by God before it was wrought. By his wisdom, as
          much as by anything, he infinitely differs from all his creatures, as
          by wisdom man differs from a brute. We cannot frame a notion of God,
          without conceiving him infinitely wise. We should render him very
          inconsiderable, to imagine him furnished with an infinite knowledge,
          and not have an infinite wisdom to make use of that knowledge, or to
          fancy him with a mighty power destitute of prudence. Knowledge without
          prudence, is an eye without motion; and power without discretion, is
          an arm without a head; a hand to act, without understanding to
          contrive and model; a strength to act, without reason to know how to
          act: it would be a miserable notion of a God, to fancy him with a
          brutish and unguided power. The heathens, therefore, had, and could
          not but have, this natural notion of God. Plato, therefore, calls him
          Mens;767 and Cleanthes used to call God Reason; and Socrates thought
          the title of Σοφός too magnificent to be attributed to anything else
          but God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arguments to prove that God is wise.—Reason 1. God could not be
          infinitely perfect without wisdom. A rational nature is better than an
          irrational nature. A man is not a perfect man without reason; how can
          God without it be an infinitely perfect God? Wisdom is the most
          eminent of all virtues; all the other perfections of God without this,
          would be as a body without an eye, a soul without understanding. A
          Christian’s graces want their lustre, when they are destitute of the
          guidance of wisdom: mercy is a feebleness, and justice a cruelty;
          patience a timorousness, and courage a madness, without the conduct of
          wisdom; so the patience of God would be cowardice, his power an
          oppression, his justice a tyranny, without wisdom as the spring and
          holiness as the rule. No attribute of God could shine with a due
          lustre and brightness without it. Power is a great perfection, but
          wisdom a greater.768 Wisdom may be without much power, as in bees and
          ants; but power is a tyrranical thing without wisdom and
          righteousness. The pilot is more valuable because of his skill, than
          the galley slave because of his strength; and the conduct of a general
          more estimable than the might of a private soldier. Generals are
          chosen more by their skill to guide, than their strength to act; what
          a clod is a man without prudence; what a nothing would God be without
          it! This is the salt that gives relish to all other perfections in a
          creature; this is the jewel in the ring of all the excellencies of the
          Divine nature, and holiness is the splendor of that jewel. Now God
          being the first Being, possesses whatsoever is most noble in any
          being. If therefore wisdom, which is the most noble perfection in any
          creature, were wanting to God, he would be deficient in that which is
          the highest excellency. God being the living God, as he is frequently
          termed in Scripture, he hath therefore the most perfect manner of
          living, and that must be a pure and intellectual life; being
          essentially living, he is essentially in the highest degree of living.
          As he hath an infinite life above all creatures, so he hath an
          infinite intellectual life, and therefore an infinite wisdom; whence
          some have called God, not sapientem, but super sapientem,769 not only
          wise, but above all wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 2. Without infinite wisdom he could not govern the world.
          Without wisdom in forming the matter, which was made by Divine power,
          the world could have been no other than a chaos; and without wisdom in
          government, it could have been no other than a heap of confusion;
          without wisdom the world could not have been created in the posture it
          is. Creation supposeth a determination of the will putting power upon
          acting; the determination of the will supposeth the counsel of the
          understanding, determining the will: no work, but supposeth
          understanding as well as will in a rational agent. As without skill
          things could not be created, so without it things cannot be governed.
          Reason is a necessary perfection to him that presides over all things:
          without knowledge there could not be in God a foundation for
          government, and without wisdom there could not be an exercise of
          government; and without the most excellent wisdom, he could not be the
          most excellent governor. He could not be an universal governor,
          without a universal wisdom; nor the sole governor without an
          unimitable wisdom; nor an independent governor without an original and
          independent wisdom; nor a perpetual governor without an incorruptible
          wisdom. He would not be the Lord of the world in all points, without
          skill to order the affairs of it. Power and wisdom are foundations of
          all authority and government; wisdom to know how to rule and command;
          power to make those commands obeyed: no regular order could issue out
          without the first, nor could any order be enforced without the second.
          A feeble wisdom, and a brutish power, seldom or never produce any good
          effect. Magistracy without wisdom, would be a frantic power, a rash
          conduct; like a strong arm when the eye is out, it strikes it knows
          not what, and leads it knows not whither. Wisdom without power, would
          be like a great body without feet,770 like the knowledge of a pilot
          that hath lost his arm, who, though he knows the rule of navigation,
          and what course to follow in his voyage, yet cannot manage the helm:
          but when those two, wisdom and power, are linked together, there
          ariseth from both a fitness for government. There is wisdom to propose
          an end, and both wisdom and power employ means that conduct to that
          end. And therefore when God demonstrates to Job his right of
          government, and the unreasonableness of Job’s quarrelling with his
          proceedings, he chiefly urgeth upon him the consideration of those two
          excellencies of his nature, power and wisdom, which are expressed in
          his works (chap. xxxviii.‒xli.) A prince without wisdom, is but a
          title without a capacity to perform the office; no man without it is
          fit for government; nor could God without wisdom exercise a just
          dominion in the world. He hath, therefore, the highest wisdom, since
          he is the universal governor. That wisdom which is able to govern a
          family, may not be able to govern a city; and that wisdom which
          governs a city, may not be able to govern a nation or kingdom, much
          less a world. The bounds of God’s government being greater than any,
          his wisdom for government must needs surmount the wisdom of all. And
          though the creatures be not in number actually infinite, yet they
          cannot be well governed, but by One endowed with infinite
          discretion.771 Providential government can be no more without infinite
          wisdom, than infinite wisdom can be without Providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 3. The creatures working for an end, without their own
          knowledge, demonstrate the wisdom of God that guides them. All things
          in the world work for some end; the ends are unknown to them, though
          many of their ends are visible to us. As there was some prime cause,
          which by his power inspired them with their several instincts; so
          there must be some supreme wisdom, which moves and guides them to
          their end. As their being manifests his power that endowed them, so
          the acting according to the rules of their nature, which they
          themselves understand not, manifests his wisdom in directing them.
          Everything that acts for an end, must know that end, or be directed by
          another to attain that end. The arrow doth not know who shoots it, or
          to what end it is shot, or what mark is aimed at; but the archer that
          puts it in, and darts it out of the bow, knows. A watch hath a regular
          motion, but neither the spring, nor the wheels that move, know the end
          of their motion; no man will judge a wisdom to be in the watch, but in
          the artificer that disposed the wheels and spring, by a joint
          combination to produce such a motion for such an end. Doth either the
          sun that enlivens the earth, or the earth that travels with the plant,
          know what plant it produceth in such a soil, what temper it should be
          of, what fruit it should bear, and of what color? What plant knows its
          own medicinal qualities, its own beautiful flowers, and for what use
          they are ordained? When it strikes up its head from the earth, doth it
          know what proportion of them there will be? yet it produceth all these
          things in a state of ignorance. The sun warms the earth, concocts the
          humors, excites the virtue of it, and cherishes the seeds which are
          cast into her lap, yet all unknown to the sun or the earth. Since,
          therefore, that nature, that is the immediate cause of those things
          doth not understand its own quality, nor operation, nor the end of its
          action, that which thus directs them must be conceived to have an
          infinite wisdom. When things act by a rule they know not, and move for
          an end they understand not, and yet work harmoniously together for an
          end, that all of them, we are sure, are ignorant of, it mounts up our
          minds to acknowledge the wisdom of that Supreme Cause that hath ranged
          all these inferior causes in their order, and imprinted upon them the
          laws of their motions according to the ideas in his own mind, who
          orders the rule by which they act, and the end for which they act, and
          directs every motion according to their several natures, and therefore
          possessed with infinite wisdom in his own nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 4. God is the fountain of all wisdom in the creatures, and,
          therefore, is infinitely wise himself. As he hath a fulness of being
          in himself, because the streams of being are derived to other things
          from him, so he hath a fulness of wisdom, because he is the spring of
          wisdom to angels and men. That being must be infinitely wise from
          whence all other wisdom derives its original; for nothing can be in
          the effect, which is not eminently in the cause; the cause is alway
          more perfect than the effect. If, therefore, the creatures are wise,
          the Creator must be much more wise. If the Creator were destitute of
          wisdom, the creature would be much more perfect than the Creator. If
          you consider the wisdom of the spider in her web, which is both her
          house and net; the artifice of the bee in her comb, which is both her
          chamber and granary; the provision of the pismire in her repositories
          for corn,—the wisdom of the Creator is illustrated by them: whatsoever
          excellency you see in any creature, is an image of some excellency in
          God. The skill of the artificer is visible in the fruits of his art; a
          workman transcribes his spirit in the work of his hands. But the
          wisdom of rational creatures, as men, doth more illustrate it; all
          arts among men are the rays of Divine wisdom shining upon them, and,
          by a common gift of the Spirit, enlightening their minds to curious
          inventions, as (Prov. viii. 12): “I, wisdom, find out the knowledge of
          witty inventions;” that is, I give a faculty to men to find them out;
          without my wisdom all things would be buried in darkness and
          ignorance: whatsoever wisdom there is in the world, it is but a shadow
          of the wisdom of God, a small rivulet derived from him, a spark
          leaping out from uncreated wisdom (Isa. liv. 16): “He created the
          smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and makes the instruments.”
          The skill to use those weapons in warlike enterprises is from him: “I
          have created the waster to destroy;” it is not meant of creating their
          persons, but communicating to them their art; he speaks it there to
          expel fear from the church of all warlike preparations against them;
          he had given men the skill to form and use weapons, and could as well
          strip them of it, and defeat their purposes. The art of husbandry is a
          fruit of divine teaching (Isa. xxviii. 24, 25). If those lower kinds
          of knowledge, that are common to all nations, and easily learned by
          all, are discoveries of Divine wisdom, much more the nobler sciences,
          intellectual and political wisdom (Dan. ii. 21): “He gives wisdom to
          the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding;” speaking of
          the more abstruse parts of knowledge, “The inspiration of the Almighty
          gives understanding” (Job xxxii. 8). Hence the wisdom which Solomon
          expressed in the harlot’s case (1 Kings iii. 28), was, in the judgment
          of all Israel, the wisdom of God; that is, a fruit of Divine wisdom, a
          beam communicated to him from God. Every man’s soul is endowed, more
          or less, with those noble qualities; the soul of every man exceeds
          that of a brute; if the streams be so excellent, the fountain must be
          fuller and clearer. The first Spirit must infinitely more possess what
          other spirits derive from him by creation; were the wisdom of all the
          angels in heaven, and men on earth, collected in one spirit, it must
          be infinitely less than what is in the spring; for no creature can be
          equal to the Creator. As the highest creature already made, or that we
          can conceive may be made by infinite power, would be infinitely below
          God in the notion of a creature, so it would be infinitely below God
          in the notion of wise.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The fourth thing is, wherein the wisdom of God appears. It
          appears, 1st, In creation. 2dly, In government. 3dly, In redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, In creation. As in a musical instrument there is first the
          skill of the workman in the frame, then the skill of the musician in
          stringing it proper for such musical notes as he will express upon it,
          and after that the tempering of the strings, by various stops, to a
          delightful harmony, so is the wisdom of God seen in framing the world,
          then in tuning it, and afterwards in the motion of the several
          creatures. The fabric of the world is called the wisdom of God (1 Cor.
          i. 21): “After that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
          not God;” i. e., by the creation the world knew not God. The framing
          cause is there put for the effect and the work framed; because the
          Divine wisdom stepped forth in the creatures, to a public appearance,
          as if it had presented itself in a visible shape to man, giving
          instructions in and by the creatures, to know and adore him. What we
          translate (Gen. i. 1) “In the beginning God created the heaven and the
          earth,” the Targum expresseth, “In wisdom God created the heaven and
          the earth.” Both bear a stamp of this perfection on them;772 and when
          the apostle tells the Romans (Rom. i. 20) “The invisible things of God
          were clearly understood by the things that are made,” the word he uses
          is ποιήμασι not ἔργοις; this signifies a work of labor, but ποίημα a
          work of skill, or a poem. The whole creation is a poem, every species
          a stanza, and every individual creature a verse in it. The creation
          presents us with a prospect of the wisdom of God, as a poem doth the
          reader with the wit and fancy of the composer: “By wisdom he created
          the earth” (Prov. iii. 19), “and stretched out the heavens by
          discretion” (Jer. x. 12). There is not anything so mean, so small, but
          glitters with a beam of Divine skill; and the consideration of them
          would justly make every man subscribe to that of the psalmist, “O
          Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all”
          (Ps. civ. 24). All, the least as well as the greatest, and the meanest
          as well as the noblest; even those creatures which seem ugly and
          deformed to us, as toads, &amp;c., because they fall short of those
          perfections which are the dowry of other animals: in these there is a
          footstep of Divine wisdom, since they were not produced by him at
          random, but determined to some particular end, and designed to some
          usefulness, as parts of the world in their several natures and
          stations. God could never have had a satisfaction in the review of his
          works, and pronounced them good or comely, as he did (Gen. i. 31), had
          they not been agreeable to that eternal original copy in his own mind.
          It is said he was refreshed, viz. with that review (Exod. xxxi. 17),
          which could not have been, if his piercing eye had found any defect in
          any thing which had sprung out of his hand, or an unsuitableness to
          that end for which he created them. He seems to do as a man that hath
          made a curious and polite work, with exact care to peer about every
          part and line, if he could perceive any imperfection in it, to rectify
          the mistake: but no defect was found by the infinitely wise God upon
          this second examination. This wisdom of the creation appears, 1. In
          the variety. 2. In the beauty. 3. The fitness of every creature for
          its use. 4. The subordination of one creature to another, and the
          joint concurrence of all to one common end.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the variety (Ps. civ. 24): “O Lord, how manifold are thy works!”
          How great a variety is there of animals and plants, with a great
          variety of forms, shapes, figurations, colors, various smells,
          virtues, and qualities! and this rarity is produced from one and the
          same matter, as beasts and plants from the earth (Gen. i. 11, 24):
          “Let the earth bring forth living creatures; and the earth brought
          forth grass, and the herb yielding seed after his kind:” such
          diversity of fowl and fish from the water (Gen. i. 20): “Let the
          waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and
          fowl that may fly;” such a beautiful and active variety from so dull a
          matter as the earth; so solid a variety from so fluid a matter as the
          water; so noble a piece as the body of man, with such variety of
          members fit to entertain a more excellent soul as a guest, from so
          mean a matter as the dust of the ground (Gen. ii. 7). This extraction
          of such variety of forms out of one single and dull matter, is the
          chemistry of Divine wisdom. It is a greater skill to frame noble
          bodies of vile matter, as varieties of precious vessels of clay and
          earth, than of a nobler matter, as gold and silver. Again, all those
          varieties propagate their kind in every particular and quality of
          their nature, and uniformly bring forth exact copies according to the
          first pattern God made of the kind (Gen. i. 11, 12, 24). Consider,
          also, how the same piece of ground is garnished with plants and
          flowers of several virtues, fruits, colors, scents, without our being
          able to perceive any variety in the earth that breeds them, and not so
          great a difference in the roots that bear them. Add to this the
          diversities of birds of different colors, shapes, notes, consisting of
          various parts, wings like oars, to cut the air, and tails as the
          rudder of a ship, to guide their motion. How various, also, are the
          endowments of the creatures! some have vegetation, and the power of
          growth; others have the addition of sense, and others the excellency
          of reason; something wherein all agree, and something wherein all
          differ; variety in unity, and unity in variety: the wisdom of the
          workman had not been so conspicuous had there been only one degree of
          goodness: the greatest skill is seen in the greatest variety. The
          comeliness of the body is visible in the variety of members, and their
          usefulness to one another. What an inform thing had man been had he
          been all ear, or all eye! If God had made all the stars to be suns, it
          would have been a demonstration of his power, but, perhaps, less of
          his wisdom: no creatures, with the natures they now have, could have
          continued in being under so much heat: there was no less wisdom went
          to the frame of the least, than to the greatest creature. It speaks
          more art in a limner to paint a landscape exactly, than to draw the
          sun, though the sun be a more glorious body. I might instance also, in
          the different characters and features imprinted upon the countenances
          of men and women, the differences of voices and statures, whereby they
          are distinguished from one another: these are the foundations of order
          and of human society, and administration of justice. What confusion
          would have been, if a grown‑up son could not be known from his father,
          the magistrate from the subject, the creditor from the debtor, the
          innocent from the criminal! The laws God hath given to mankind could
          not have been put in execution: this variety speaks the wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The wisdom of the creation appears in the beauty, and order, and
          situation of the several creatures (Eccles. iii. 11): “He hath made
          everything beautiful in his time.” As their being was a fruit of
          Divine power, so their order is a fruit of Divine wisdom. All
          creatures are as members in the great body of the world, proportioned
          to one another, and contributing to the beauty of the whole; so that
          if the particular forms of everything, the union of all for the
          composition of the world, and the laws which are established in the
          order of nature for its conservation, be considered, it would ravish
          us with an admiration of God.773 All the creatures are so many
          pictures or statues, exactly framed by line (Ps. xix. 4): “Their line
          is gone through all the earth;” their “line,” a measuring line, or a
          carpenter’s rule, whereby he proportions several pieces to be exactly
          linked and coupled together. “Their line,” that is, their harmonious
          proportion, and the instruction from it, is gone forth through all the
          earth. Upon the account of this harmony, some of the ancient heathens
          framed the images of their gods with musical instruments in their
          hands, signifying that God wrought all things in a due proportion.774
          The heavens speak this wisdom in their order. The revolutions of the
          sun and moon determine the seasons of the year, and make day and night
          in orderly succession. The stars beautify the heavens, and influence
          the earth, and keep their courses (Judges v. 20). They keep their
          stations without interfering with one another; and though they have
          rolled about for so many ages, they observe their distinct laws, and
          in the variety of their motions have not disturbed one another’s
          functions. The sun is set as the heart in the midst of this great
          body, to afford warmth to all: and had it been set lower, it had long
          since turned the earth into flame and ashes: had it been placed
          higher, the earth would have wanted the nourishment and refreshment
          necessary for it. Too much nearness had ruined the earth by parching
          heat, and too great a distance had destroyed the earth by starving it
          with cold.775 The sun hath also its appointed motion; had it been
          fixed without motion, half of the earth had been unprofitable; there
          had been a perpetual darkness in a moiety of it; nothing had been
          produced for nourishment, and so it had been rendered uninhabitable:
          but now, by its motion, it visits all the climates of the world, runs
          its circuit, so that “nothing is hid from the heat thereof,” (Ps. xix.
          6). It imparts its virtue to every corner of the world in its daily
          and yearly visits. Had it been fixed, the fruits of the earth under it
          had been parched and destroyed before their maturity; but all those
          inconveniences are provided against by the perpetual motion of the
          sun. This motion is orderly; it makes its daily course from east to
          west, its yearly motion from north to south: it goes to the north,
          till it comes to the point God hath set it, and then turns back to the
          south, and gains some point every day: it never riseth nor sets in the
          same place one day, where it did the day before. The world is never
          without its light; some see it rising the same moment we see it
          setting.776 The earth also speaks the Divine wisdom; it is the
          pavement of the world, as the heaven is the ceiling of fretwork. It is
          placed lowermost, as being the heaviest body, and fit to receive the
          weightiest matter, and provided as an habitation proper for those
          creatures which derive the matter of their bodies from it, and partake
          of its earthly nature; and garnished with other creatures for the
          profit or pleasure of man.777 The sea also speaks the same Divine
          wisdom. “He strengthened the fountains of the deep, and gave the sea a
          decree that it should not pass his command” (Prov. viii. 28, 29). He
          hath given it certain bounds that it should not overflow the earth
          (Job xxviii. 11). It contains itself in the situation wherein God hath
          placed it, and doth not transgress its bounds. What if some part of a
          country, a little spot, hath been overflowed by it, and groaned under
          its waves? yet for the main, it retains the same channels wherein it
          was at first lodged. All creatures are clothed with an outward beauty,
          and endowed with an inward harmony; there is an agreement in all parts
          of this great body; every one is beautiful and orderly; but the beauty
          of the world results from all of them disposed and linked together.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This wisdom is seen in the fitness of everything for its end, and
          the usefulness of it. Divine wisdom is more illustrious in the fitness
          and usefulness of this great variety, than in the composure of their
          distinct parts: as the artificer’s skill is more eminent in fitting
          the wheels, and setting them in order for their due motion, than in
          the external fabric of the materials which compose the clock. After
          the most diligent inspection, there can be found nothing in the
          creation unprofitable; nothing but is capable of some service, either
          for the support of our bodies, recreation of our senses, or moral
          instruction of our minds: not the least creature but is formed, and
          shaped, and furnished with members and parts, in a due proportion for
          its end and service in the world; nothing is superfluous, nothing
          defective. The earth is fitted in its parts;778 the valleys are
          appointed for granaries, the mountains to shadow them from the
          scorching heat of the sun; the rivers, like veins, carry refreshment
          to every member of this body; plants and trees thrive on the face of
          the earth, and metals are engendered in the bowels of it, for
          materials for building, and other uses for the service of man. “There
          he causes the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of
          man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth” (Ps. civ. 14). The
          sea is fitted for use; it is a fish pond for the nourishment of man; a
          boundary for the dividing of lands and several dominions: it joins
          together nations far distant: a great vessel for commerce (Ps. civ.
          26), “there go the ships.” It affords vapors to the clouds, wherewith
          to water the earth, which the sun draws up, separating the finer from
          the salter parts, that the earth may be fruitful without being
          burdened with barrenness by the salt. The sea hath also its salt, its
          ebbs, and floods; the one as brine, the other as motion, to preserve
          it from putrefaction, that it may not be contagious to the rest of the
          world. Showers are appointed to refresh the bodies of living
          creatures, to open the womb of the earth, and “water the ground to
          make it fruitful” (Ps. civ. 3). The clouds, therefore, are called the
          chariots of God; he rides in them in the manifestation of his goodness
          and wisdom. Winds are fitted to purify the air, to preserve it from
          putrefaction, to carry the clouds to several parts, to refresh the
          parched earth, and assist her fruits: and also to serve for the
          commerce of one nation with another by navigation.779 God, in his
          wisdom and goodness, “walks upon the wings of the wind” (Ps. civ. 3).
          Rivers780 are appointed to bathe the ground, and render it fresh and
          lively; they fortify cities, are the limits of countries, serve for
          commerce; they are the watering‑pots of the earth, and the vessels for
          drink for the living creatures that dwell upon the earth. God cut
          those channels for the wild asses, the beasts of the desert, which are
          his creatures as well as the rest (Ps. civ. 10, 12, 13). Trees are
          appointed for the habitations of birds, shadows for the earth,
          nourishment for the creatures, materials for building, and fuel for
          the relief of man against cold. The seasons of the year have their
          use; the winter makes the juice retire into the earth, fortifies
          plants, and fixes their roots: it moistens the earth that was dried
          before by the heat of summer, and cleanseth and prepares it for a new
          fruitfulness. The spring calls out the sap in new leaves and fruit.
          The summer consumes the superfluous moisture, and produceth
          nourishment for the inhabitants of the world.781 The day and night
          have also their usefulness: the day gives life to labor, and is a
          guide to motion and action (Ps. civ. 24), “The sun ariseth, man goeth
          forth to his labor until the evening.” It warms the air, and quickens
          nature; without day the world would be a chaos, an unseen beauty. The
          night indeed casts a veil upon the bravery of the earth, but it draws
          the curtains from that of heaven; though it darkens below, it makes us
          see the beauty of the world above, and discovers to us a glorious part
          of the creation of God, the tapestry of heaven, and the motions of the
          stars, hid from us by the eminent light of the day. It procures a
          truce from labor, and refresheth the bodies of creatures, by
          recruiting the spirits which are scattered by watching. It prevents
          the ruin of life, by a reparation of what was wasted in the day. It
          takes from us the sight of flowers and plants, but it washeth their
          face with dews for a new appearance next morning. The length of the
          day and night is not without a mark of wisdom; were they of a greater
          length, as the length of a week or month, the one would too much dry,
          and the other too much moisten; and for want of action, the members
          would be stupified. The perpetual succession of day and night is an
          evidence of the Divine wisdom in tempering the travel and rest of
          creatures. Hence, the psalmist tells us (Ps. lxxxiv. 16, 17), “The day
          is thine, and the night is thine; thou hast prepared the light of the
          sun, and made summer and winter;” i. e. they are of God’s framing, not
          without a wise counsel and end. Hence, let us ascend to the bodies of
          living creatures, and we shall find every member fitted for use. What
          a curiosity is there in every member! Every one fitted to a particular
          use in their situation, form, temper, and mutual agreement for the
          good of the whole: the eye to direct; the ear to receive directions
          from others; the hands to act; the feet to move. Every creature hath
          members fitted for that element wherein it resides; and in the body,
          some parts are appointed to change the food into blood, others to
          refine it, and others to distribute and convey it to several parts for
          the maintenance of the whole: the heart to mint vital spirits for
          preserving life, and the brain to coin animal spirits for life and
          motion; the lungs to serve for the cooling the heart, which else would
          be parched as the ground in summer. The motion of the members of the
          body by one act of the will, and also without the will by a natural
          instinct, is an admirable evidence of Divine skill in the structure of
          the body; so that well might the psalmist cry out (Ps. cxxxix. 14), “I
          am fearfully and wonderfully made!” But how much more of this Divine
          perfection is seen in the soul! A nature, furnished with a faculty of
          understanding to judge of things, to gather in things that are
          distant, and to reason and draw conclusions from one thing to another,
          with a memory to treasure up things that are past, with a will to
          apply itself so readily to what the mind judges fit and comely, and
          fly so speedily from what it judges ill and hurtful. The whole world
          is a stage; every creature in it hath a part to act, and a nature
          suited to that part and end it is designed for; and all concur in a
          joint language to publish the glory of Divine wisdom; they have a
          voice to proclaim the “glory of God” (Ps. xix. 1, 3). And it is not
          the least part of God’s skill, in framing the creatures so, that upon
          man’s obedience, they are the channels of his goodness; and upon man’s
          disobedience, they can, in their natures, be the ministers of his
          justice for the punishing of offending creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This wisdom is apparent in the linking of all these useful parts
          together, so that one is subordinate to the other for a common end.
          All parts are exactly suited to one another, and every part to the
          whole, though they are of different natures, as lines distant in
          themselves, yet they meet in one common centre, the good and the
          preservation of the universe; they are all jointed together, as the
          word translated framed (Heb. xi. 2) signifies; knit by fit hands and
          ligaments to contribute mutual beauty, strength, and assistance to one
          another; like so many links of a chain coupled together, that though
          there be a distance in place, there is a unity in regard of connection
          and end, there is a consent in the whole (Hos. ii. 21, 22). “The
          heavens hear the earth; and the earth hears the corn, and the wine,
          and the oil.” The heavens communicate their qualities to the earth,
          and the earth conveys them to the fruits she bears.782 The air
          distributes light, wind and rain to the earth; the earth and the sea
          render to the air exhalations and vapors, and altogether charitably
          give to the plants and animals that which is necessary for their
          nourishment and refreshment. The influences of the heavens animate the
          earth; and the earth affords matter, in part, for the influences it
          receives from the regions above. Living creatures are maintained by
          nourishment; nourishment is conveyed to them by the fruits of the
          earth; the fruits of the earth are produced by means of rain and heat;
          matter for rain and dew is raised by the heat of the sun; and the sun
          by its motion distributes heat and quickening virtue to all parts of
          the earth. So colors are made for the pleasure of the eye, sounds for
          the delight of the ear; light is formed, whereby the eye may see the
          one, and air to convey the species of colors to the eye, and sound to
          the ear; all things are like the wheels of a watch compacted: and
          though many of the creatures be endowed with contrary qualities, yet
          they are joined in a marriage‑knot for the public security, and
          subserviency to the preservation and order of the universe; as the
          variety of strings upon an instrument, sending forth various and
          distinct sounds, are tempered together, for the framing excellent and
          delightful airs. In this universal conspiring of the creatures
          together to one end, is the wisdom of the Creator apparent; in tuning
          so many contraries as the elements are, and preserving them in their
          order, which if once broken, the whole frame of nature would crack,
          and fall in pieces; all are so interwoven and inlaid together, by the
          Divine workmanship, as to make up one entire beauty in the whole
          fabric: as every part in the body of man hath a distinct comeliness,
          yet there is besides, the beauty of the whole, that results from the
          union of divers parts exactly fashioned to one another, and linked
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, Use. How much may we see of the perfection of God in
          everything that presents itself to our eyes! And how should we be
          convinced of our unworthy neglect of ascending to him with reverend
          and admiring thoughts, upon the prospect of the creatures! What dull
          scholars are we, when every creature is our teacher, every part of the
          creature a lively instruction! Those things that we tread under our
          feet, if used by us according to the full design of their creation,
          would afford rich matter, not only for our heads, but our hearts. As
          grace doth not destroy nature, but elevate it, so neither should the
          fresher and fuller discoveries of Divine wisdom in redemption deface
          all our thoughts of his wisdom in creation. Though the greater light
          of the sun obscures the lesser sparkling of the stars, yet it gives
          way in the night to the discovery of them, that God may be seen,
          known, and considered, in all his works of wonder, and miracles of
          nature. No part of Scripture is more spiritual than the Psalms; none
          filled with clearer discoveries of Christ in the Old Testament; yet
          how often do the penmen consider the creation of God, and find their
          meditations on him to be sweet, as considered in his works (Ps. civ.
          34)! “My meditation of him shall be sweet.” When? why, after a short
          history of the goodness and wisdom of God in the frame of the world,
          and the species of the creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The wisdom of God appears in his government of his
          creatures. The regular motion of the creatures speaks for this
          perfection, as well as the exact composition of them. If the
          exquisiteness of the frame conducts us to the skill of the Contriver,
          the exactness of their order, according to his will and law, speaks no
          less the wisdom of the Governor. It cannot be thought that a rash and
          irrational power presides over a world so well disposed: the
          disposition of things hath no less characters of skill, than the
          creation of them. No man can hear an excellent lesson upon a lute, but
          must presently reflect upon the art of the person that touches it. The
          prudence of man appears in wrapping up the concerns of a kingdom in
          his mind, for the well‑ordering of it; and shall not the wisdom of God
          shine forth, as he is the director of the world? I shall omit his
          government of inanimate creatures, and confine the discourse to his
          government of man, as rational, as sinful, as restored.
        </p>
        <p>1st. In his government of man as a rational creature.</p>
        <p>
          1. In the law he gives to man. Wisdom framed it, though will enacted
          it. The will of God is the rule of righteousness to us, but the wisdom
          of God is the foundation of that rule of righteousness which he
          prescribes us. The composure of a musician is the rule of singing to
          his scholars; yet the consent and harmony in that composure derives
          not itself from his will, but from his understanding; he would not be
          a musician if his composures were contrary to the rules of true
          harmony: so the laws of men are composed by wisdom, though they are
          enforced by will and authority.783 The moral law, which was the law of
          nature, the law imprinted upon Adam, is so framed as to secure the
          rights of God as supreme, and the rights of men in their distinctions
          of superiority and equality: it is therefore called “holy and good”
          (Rom. vii. 12); holy, as it prescribes our duty to God in his worship;
          good, as it regulates the offices of human life, and preserves the
          common interest of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is suited to the nature of man. As God hath given a law of
          nature, a fixed order to inanimate creatures, so he hath given a law
          of reason to rational creatures: other creatures are not capable of a
          law differencing good and evil, because they are destitute of
          faculties and capacities to make distinction between them. It had not
          been agreeable to the wisdom of God to propose any moral law to them,
          who had neither understanding to discern, nor will to choose. It is
          therefore to be observed, that whilst Christ exhorted others to the
          embracing his doctrine, yet he exhorted not little children, though he
          took them in his arms, because, though they had faculties, yet they
          were not come to such a maturity as to be capable of a rational
          instruction. But there was a necessity for some command for the
          government of man; since God had made him a rational creature, it was
          not agreeable to his wisdom to govern him as a brute, but as a
          rational creature, capable of knowing his precepts, and voluntarily
          walking in them; and without a law, he had not been capable of any
          exercise of his reason in services respecting God. He therefore gives
          him a law, with a covenant annexed to it, whereby man is obliged to
          obedience, and secured of a reward. This was enforced with severe
          penalties, death, with all the horrors attending it, to deter him from
          transgression (Gen. ii. 17); wherein is implied a promise of
          continuance of life, and all its felicities, to allure him to a
          mindfulness of his obligation. So perfect a hedge did Divine wisdom
          set about him, to keep him within the bounds of that obedience, which
          was both his debt and security, that wheresoever he looked, he saw
          either something to invite him, or something to drive him to the
          payment of his duty, and perseverance in it. Thus the law was exactly
          framed to the nature of man; man had twisted in him a desire of
          happiness; the promise was suited to cherish this natural desire. He
          had also the passion of fear; the proper object of this was any thing
          destructive to his being, nature, and felicity; this the threatening
          met with. In the whole it was accommodated to man as rational;
          precepts to the law in his mind, promises to the natural appetite,
          threatenings to the most prevailing affection, and to the implanted
          desires of preserving both his being and happiness in that being.
          These were rational motives, fitted to the nature of Adam, which was
          above the life God had given plants, and the sense he had given
          animals. The command given man in innocence was suited to his strength
          and power. God gave him not any command but what he had ability to
          observe: and since we want not power to forbear an apple in our
          corrupted and impotent state, he wanted not strength in his state of
          integrity. The wisdom of God commanded nothing but what was very easy
          to be observed by him, and inferior to his natural ability. It had
          been both unjust and unwise to have commanded him to fly up to the
          sun, when he had not wings; or stop the course of the sea, when he had
          not strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is suited to the happiness and benefit of man. God’s laws are
          not an act of mere authority respecting his own glory, but of wisdom
          and goodness respecting man’s benefit. They are perfective of man’s
          nature, conferring a wisdom upon him, “rejoicing his heart,
          enlightening his eyes” (Ps. xix. 7, 8), affording him both a knowledge
          of God and of himself. To be without a law, is for men to be as
          beasts, without justice and without religion: other things are for the
          good of the body, but the laws of God for the good of the soul; the
          more perfect the law, the greater the benefit. The laws given to the
          Jews were the honor and excellency of that nation (Deut. i. 8); “What
          nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so
          righteous?” They were made statesmen in the judicial law,
          ecclesiastics in the ceremonial, honest men in the second table, and
          divine in the first. All his laws are suited to the true satisfaction
          of man, and the good of human society. Had God framed a law only for
          one nation, there would have been the characters of a particular
          wisdom; but now an universal wisdom appears, in accommodating his law,
          not only to this or that particular society or corporation of men, but
          to the benefit of all mankind, in the variety of climates and
          countries wherein they live; everything that is disturbing to human
          society is provided against; nothing is enjoined but what is sweet,
          rational, and useful: it orders us not to attempt anything against the
          life of our neighbor, the honor of his bed, propriety in his goods,
          and the clearness of his reputation; and, if well observed, would
          alter the face of the world, and make it look with another hue. The
          world would be altered from a brutish to a human world; it would
          change lions and wolves, men of lion‑like and wolfish disposition,
          into reason and sweetness. And because the whole law is summed up in
          love, it obligeth us to endeavor the preservation of one another’s
          beings, the favoring of one another’s interests, and increasing the
          goods, as much as justice will permit, and keeping up one another’s
          credits, because love, which is the soul of the law, is not shown by a
          cessation from action, but signifies an ardor, upon all occasions, in
          doing good. I say, were this law well observed, the world would be
          another thing than it is: it would become a religious fraternity; the
          voice of enmity, and the noise of groans and cursings, would not be
          heard in our streets; peace would be in all borders; plenty of charity
          in the midst of cities and countries; joy and singing would sound in
          all habitations. Man’s advantage was designed in God’s laws, and doth
          naturally result from the observance of them. God so ordered them, by
          his wisdom, that the obedience of man should draw forth his goodness,
          and prevent those smarting judgments which were necessary to reduce
          the creature to order that would not voluntarily continue in the order
          God had appointed. The laws of men are often unjust, oppressive,
          cruel, sometimes against the law of nature; but an universal wisdom
          and righteousness glitters in the Divine law; there is nothing in it
          but is worthy of God, and useful for the creature; so that we may well
          say, with Job, “Who teaches like God” (Job xxxvi. 22)? or as some
          render it, “Who is a lawgiver like God?” Who can say to him, Thou hast
          wrought iniquity or folly among men? His precepts were framed for the
          preservation of man in that rectitude wherein he was created, in that
          likeness to God wherein he was first made, that there might be a
          correspondence between the integrity of the creature and the goodness
          of his Creator, by the obedience of man; that man might exercise his
          faculties in operation worthy of him, and beneficial to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The wisdom of God is seen in suiting his laws to the consciences
          as well as the interests of all mankind (Rom. ii. 14); “The Gentiles
          do, by nature, the things contained in the law;” so great an affinity
          there is between the wise law and the reason of man. There is a
          natural beauty emerging from them, and darting upon the reasons and
          consciences of men, which dictates to them that this law is worthy to
          be observed in itself. The two main principles of the law, the love
          and worship of God, and doing as we would be done by, have an
          indelible impression in the consciences of all men, in regard of the
          principle, though they are not suitably expressed in the practice.
          Were there no law outwardly published, yet every man’s conscience
          would dictate to him that God was to be acknowledged, worshipped,
          loved, as naturally as his reason would acquaint him that there was
          such a being as God. This suitableness of them to the consciences of
          men is manifest, in that the laws of the best governed nations among
          the heathen have had an agreement with them. Nothing can be more
          exactly composed, according to the rules of right and exact reason,
          than this; no man but approves of something in it, yea, of the whole,
          when he exerciseth that dim reason which he hath. Suppose any man, not
          an absolute atheist, he cannot but acknowledge the reasonableness of
          worshipping God. Grant him to be a spirit, and it will presently
          appear absurd to represent him by any corporeal image, and derogate
          from his excellency by so mean a resemblance; with the same easiness
          he will grant a reverence due to the name of God; that we must not
          serve our turn of him, by calling him to witness to a lie in a solemn
          oath; that as worship is due to him, so is some stated time a
          circumstance necessary to the performance of that worship. And as to
          the second table, will any man, in his right reason, quarrel with that
          command that engageth his inferiors to honor him, that secures his
          being from a violent murder, and his goods from unjust rapine? and
          though, by the fury of his lusts, he break the laws of wedlock
          himself, yet he cannot but approve of that law, as it prohibits every
          man from doing him the like injury and disgrace. The suitableness of
          the law to the consciences of men is further evidenced by those
          furious reflections, and strong alarms of conscience, upon a
          transgression of it, and that in all parts of the world, more or less,
          in all men; so exactly hath Divine wisdom fitted the law to the reason
          and consciences of men, as one tally to another: indeed, without such
          an agreement, no man’s conscience could have any ground for a hue and
          cry; nor need any man be startled with the records of it. This
          manifests the wisdom of God in framing his laws so that the reasons
          and consciences of all men do, one time or other, subscribe to it.
          What governor in the world is able to make any law distinct from this
          revealed by God, that shall reach all places, all persons, all hearts?
          We may add to this the extent of his commands, in ordering goodness at
          the root, not only in action, but affection; not only in the motion of
          the members, but the disposition of the soul; which suiting a law to
          the inward frame of man, is quite out of the compass of the wisdom of
          any creature.

        <p>
          (4.) His wisdom is seen in the encouragements he gives for the
          studying and observing his will (Ps. xix. 11); “In keeping thy
          commandments there is great reward.” The variety of them; there is not
          any particular genius in man but may find something suitable to win
          upon him in the revealed will of God. There is a strain of reason to
          satisfy the rational; of eloquence, to gratify the fanciful; of
          interest, to allure the selfish; of terror, to startle the obstinate.
          As a skilful angler stores himself with baits, according to the
          appetites of the sorts of fish he intends to catch, so in the word of
          God there are varieties of baits, according to the varieties of the
          inclinations of men; threatenings to work upon fear; promises to work
          upon love; examples of holy men set out for imitation; and those
          plainly; neither his threatenings nor his promises are dark, as the
          heathen oracles; but peremptory, as becomes a sovereign lawgiver; and
          plain, as was necessary for the understanding of a creature. As he
          deals graciously with men in exhorting and encouraging them, so he
          deals wisely herein, by taking away all excuse from them if they ruin
          the interest of their souls, by denying obedience to their Sovereign.
          Again, the rewards God proposeth are accommodated, not to the brutish
          parts of man, his carnal sense and fleshly appetite, but to the
          capacity of a spiritual soul, which admits only of spiritual
          gratifications; and cannot, in its own nature, without a sordid
          subjection to the humors of the body, be moved by sensual proposals.
          God backs his precepts with that which the nature of man longed for,
          and with spiritual delights, which can only satisfy a rational
          appetite; and thereby did as well gratify the noblest desires in man,
          as oblige him to the noblest service and work.784 Indeed, virtue and
          holiness being perfectly amiable, ought chiefly to affect our
          understandings, and by them draw our wills to the esteem and pursuit
          of them. But since the desire of happiness is inseparable from the
          nature of man, as impossible to be disjoined as an inclination to
          descend to be severed from heavy bodies, or an instinct to ascend from
          light and airy substances; God serves himself of the inclination of
          our natures to happiness, to enjender in us an esteem and affection to
          the holiness he doth require. He proposeth the enjoyment of a
          supernatural good and everlasting glory, as a bait to that insatiable
          longing our natures have for happiness, to receive the impression of
          holiness into our souls. And, besides, he doth proportion rewards
          according the degrees of men’s industry, labor, and zeal for him; and
          weighs out a recompense, not only suited to, but above the service. He
          that improves five talents, is to be ruler over five cities; that is,
          a greater proportion of honor and glory than another (Luke xix. 17,
          18); as a wise father excites the affection of his children to things
          worthy of praise, by varieties of recompenses according to their
          several actions. And it was the wisdom of the steward, in the judgment
          of our Saviour, to give every one the “portion that belonged to him”
          (Luke xii. 42). There is no part of the word wherein we meet not with
          the will and wisdom of God, varieties of duties, and varieties of
          encouragement, mingled together.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) The wisdom of God is seen in fitting the revelations of his will
          to aftertimes, and for the preventing of the foreseen corruptions of
          men. The whole revelation of the mind of God is stored with wisdom in
          the words, connexion, sense; it looks backwards to past, and forwards
          to ages to come: a hidden wisdom lies in the bowels of it, like gold
          in a mine. The Old Testament was so composed, as to fortify the New,
          when God should bring it to light. The foundations of the gospel were
          laid in the law: the predictions of the Prophets, and figures of the
          law, were so wisely framed, and laid down in such clear expressions,
          as to be proofs of the authority of the New Testament, and convictions
          of Jesus’ being the Messiah (Luke xxiv. 14). Things concerning Christ
          were written in Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms; and do, to this day,
          stare the Jews so in the face, that they are fain to invent absurd and
          nonsensical interpretations to excuse their unbelief, and continue
          themselves in their obstinate blindness. And in pursuance of the
          efficacy of those predictions, it was a part of the wisdom of God to
          bring forth the translation of the Old Testament, (by the means of
          Ptolomy, king of Egypt, some hundreds of years before the coming of
          Christ) into the Greek language, the tongue then most known in the
          world; and why? to prepare the Gentiles, by the reading of it, for
          that gracious call he intended them, and for the entertainment of the
          gospel, which some few years after was to be published among them;
          that, by reading the predictions so long before made, they might more
          readily receive the accomplishment of them in their due time. The
          Scripture is written in such a manner, as to obviate errors foreseen
          by God to enter into the church. It may be wondered, why the universal
          particle should be inserted by Christ, in the giving the cup in the
          supper, which was not in the distributing the bread (Matt. xxvi. 27):
          “Drink ye all of it;” not at the distributing the bread, “Eat you all
          of it;” and Mark, in his relation, tells us, “They all drank of it”
          (Mark xi. 23). The church of Rome hath been the occasion of
          discovering to us the wisdom of our Saviour, in inserting that
          particle all, since they were so bold to exclude the communicants from
          the cup by a trick of concomitancy. Christ foresaw the error, and
          therefore put in a little word to obviate a great invasion: and the
          Spirit of God hath particularly left upon record that particle, as we
          may reasonably suppose to such a purpose. And so, in the description
          of the “blessed Virgin” (Luke i. 27), there is nothing of her holiness
          mentioned, which is with much diligence recorded of Elizabeth (ver.
          6): “Righteous, walking in all the commandments of God, blameless;”
          probably to prevent the superstition which God foresaw would arise in
          the world. And we do not find more undervaluing speeches uttered by
          Christ to any of his disciples, in the exercise of his office, than to
          her, except to Peter. As when she acquainted him with the want of wine
          at the marriage in Cana, she receives a slighting answer: “Woman, what
          have I to do with thee” (John ii. 4)? And when one was admiring the
          blessedness of her that bare him, he turns the discourse another way,
          to pronounce a blessedness rather belonging to them that “hear the
          word of God, and keep it” (Luke xi. 27, 28); in a mighty wisdom to
          antidote his people against any conceit of the prevalency of the
          Virgin over him in heaven, in the exercise of his mediatory office.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As his wisdom appears in his government by his laws, so it appears
          in the various inclinations and conditions of men. As there is a
          distinction of several creatures, and several qualities in them, for
          the common good of the world, so among men there are several
          inclinations and several abilities, as donatives from God, for the
          common advantage of human society; as several channels cut out from
          the same river run several ways, and refresh several soils, one man is
          qualified for one employment, another marked out by God for a
          different work, yet all of them fruitful to bring in a revenue of
          glory to God, and a harvest of profit to the rest of mankind. How
          unuseful would the body be, if it had but “one member” (1 Cor. xii.
          19)! How unprovided would a house be, if it had not vessels of
          dishonor as well as of honor! The corporation of mankind would be as
          much a chaos, as the matter of the heavens and the earth was, before
          it was distinguished by several forms breathed into it at the
          creation. Some are inspired with a particular genius for one art, some
          for another; every man hath a distinct talent. If all were husbandmen,
          where would be the instruments to plough and reap? If all were
          artificers, where would they have corn to nourish themselves? All men
          are like vessels, and parts in the body, designed for distinct offices
          and functions for the good of the whole, and mutually return an
          advantage to one another. As the variety of gifts in the church is a
          fruit of the wisdom of God, for the preservation and increase of the
          church, so the variety of inclinations and employments in the world is
          a fruit of the wisdom of God, for the preservation and subsistence of
          the world by mutual commerce. What the apostle largely discourseth of
          the former, in 1 Cor. xii. may be applied to the other. The various
          conditions of men is also a fruit of Divine wisdom. Some are rich, and
          some poor; the rich have as much need of the poor, as the poor have of
          the rich; if the poor depend upon the rich for their livelihood, the
          rich depend upon the poor for their conveniences. Many arts would not
          be learned by men, if poverty did not oblige them to it; and many
          would faint in the learning of them, if they were not thereunto
          encouraged by the rich. The poor labor for the rich, as the earth
          sends vapors into the vaster and fuller air; and the rich return
          advantages again to the poor, as the clouds do the vapors in rain upon
          the earth. As meat would not afford a nourishing juice without bread,
          and bread without other food would immoderately fill the stomach, and
          not be well digested, so the rich would be unprofitable in the
          commonwealth without the poor, and the poor would be burdensome to a
          commonwealth without the rich. The poor could not be easily governed
          without the rich, nor the rich sufficiently and conveniently provided
          for without the poor. If all were rich, there would be no objects for
          the exercise of a noble part of charity: if all were poor, there were
          no matter for the exercise of it. Thus the Divine wisdom planted
          various inclinations, and diversified the conditions of men for the
          public advantages of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly. God’s wisdom appears, in the government of men, as fallen and
          sinful; or, in the government of sin. After the law of God was broke,
          and sin invaded and conquered the world, divine wisdom had another
          scene to act in, and other methods of government were necessary. The
          wisdom of God is then seen in ordering those jarring discords, drawing
          good out of evil, and honour to himself out of that which in its own
          nature tended to the supplanting of his glory. God being a sovereign
          good, would not suffer so great an evil to enter, but to serve himself
          of it for some greater end, for all his thoughts are full of goodness
          and wisdom. Now, though the permission of sin be an act of his
          sovereignty, and the punishment of sin be an act of his justice, yet
          the ordination of sin to good, is an act of his wisdom, whereby he
          doth dispose the evil, overrules the malice, and orders the events of
          it to his own purposes. Sin in itself is a disorder, and therefore God
          doth not permit sin for itself; for in its own nature it hath nothing
          of amiableness, but he wills it for some righteous end, which belongs
          to the manifestation of his glory, which is his aim in all the acts of
          his will; he wills it not as sin, but as his wisdom can order it to
          some greater good than was before in the world, and make it contribute
          to the beauty of the order he intends. As a dark shadow is not
          delightful and pleasant in itself, nor is drawn by a painter for any
          amiableness there is in the shadow itself, but as it serves to set
          forth that beauty which is the main design of his art, so the glorious
          effects which arise from the entrance of sin into the world, are not
          from the creatures evil, but the depths of divine wisdom.
          Particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God’s wisdom is seen in the bounding of sin; as it is said of the
          wrath of man, it shall praise him, and the remainder of wrath God doth
          restrain (Ps. lxxvi. 10). He sets limits to the boiling corruption of
          the heart, as he doth to the boisterous waves of the sea; “Hitherto
          shalt thou go, and no further.” As God is the rector of the world, he
          doth so restrain sin, so temper and direct it, as that human society
          is preserved, which else would be overflown with a deluge of
          wickedness, and ruin would be brought upon all communities. The world
          would be a shambles, a brothel‑house, if God, by his wisdom and
          goodness, did not set bars to that wickedness which is in the hearts
          of men: the whole earth would be as bad as hell. Since the heart of
          man is a hell of corruption, by that the souls of all men would be
          excited to the acting the worst villanies; since “every thought of the
          heart of man is only evil, and that continually” (Gen. vi. 5). If the
          wisdom of God did not stop these floodgates of evil in the hearts of
          men, it would overflow the world, and frustrate all the gracious
          designs he carries on among the sons of men. Were it not for this
          wisdom, every house would be filled with violence, as well as every
          nature is with sin. What harm would not strong and furious beasts do,
          did not the skill of man tame and bridle them? How often hath Divine
          wisdom restrained the viciousness of human nature, and let it run, not
          to that point they designed, but to the end he purposed! Laban’s fury,
          and Esau’s enmity against Jacob, were pent in within bounds for
          Jacob’s safety, and their hearts overruled from an intended
          destruction of the good man, to a perfect amity (Gen. xxxi. 29, and
          xxxii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God’s wisdom is seen in the bringing glory to himself out of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Out of sin itself. God erects the trophies of honor upon that
          which is a natural means to hinder and deface it. His glorious
          attributes are drawn out to our view, upon the occasion of sin, which
          otherwise had lain hid in his own Being. Sin is altogether black and
          abominable; but by the admirable wisdom of God, he hath drawn out of
          the dreadful darkness of sin the saving beams of his mercy, and
          displayed his grace in the incarnation and passion of his Son for the
          atonement of sin. Thus he permitted Adam’s fall, and wisely ordered
          it, for a fuller discovery of his own nature, and a higher elevation
          of man’s good, that “as sin reigned to death, so might grace reign
          through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ” (Rom. v. 21).
          The unbounded goodness of God could not have appeared without it. His
          goodness in rewarding innocent obedience would have been manifested;
          but not his mercy, in pardoning rebellious crimes. An innocent
          creature is the object of the rewards of grace, as the standing angels
          are under the beams of grace; but not under the beams of mercy,
          because they were never sinful, and, consequently, never miserable.
          Without sin the creature had not been miserable: had man remained
          innocent, he had not been the subject of punishment; and without the
          creature’s misery, God’s mercy in sending his Son to save his enemies,
          could not have appeared. The abundance of sin is a passive occasion
          for God to manifest the abundance of his grace. The power of God in
          the changing the heart of a rebellious creature, had not appeared, had
          not sin infected our nature. We had not clearly known the vindictive
          justice of God, had no crime been committed; for that is the proper
          object of Divine wrath. The goodness of God could never have permitted
          justice to exercise itself upon an innocent creature, that was not
          guilty either personally or by imputation (Ps. xi. 7), “The righteous
          Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance doth uphold the upright.”
          Wisdom is illustrious hereby. God suffered man to fall into a mortal
          disease, to shew the virtue of his own restoratives to cure sin, which
          in itself is incurable by the art of any creature. And otherwise this
          perfection, whereby God draws good out of evil, had been utterly
          useless, and would have been destitute of an object wherein to
          discover itself. Again, wisdom, in ordering a rebellious head‑strong
          world to its own ends, is greater than the ordering an innocent world,
          exactly observant of his precepts, and complying with the end of the
          creation. Now, without the entrance of sin, this wisdom had wanted a
          stage to act upon. Thus God raised the honor of this wisdom, while man
          ruined the integrity of his nature; and made use of the creature’s
          breach of his divine law, to establish the honor of it in a more
          signal and stable manner, by the active and passive obedience of the
          Son of his bosom. Nothing serves God so much, as an occasion of
          glorifying himself, as the entrance of sin into the world; by this
          occasion God communicates to us the knowledge of those perfections of
          his nature, which had else been folded up from us in an eternal night;
          his justice had lain in the dark, as having nothing to punish; his
          mercy had been obscure, as having none to pardon; a great part of his
          wisdom had been silent, as having no such object to order.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) His wisdom appears, in making use of sinful instruments. He uses
          the malice and enmity of the devil to bring about his own purposes,
          and makes the sworn enemy of his honor contribute to the illustrating
          of it against his will. This great craftsmaster he took in his own
          net, and defeated the devil by the devil’s malice; by turning the
          contrivances he had hatched and accomplished against man, against
          himself. He used him as a tempter, to grapple with our Saviour in the
          wilderness, whereby to make him fit to succor us; and as the god of
          this world, to conspire the wicked Jews to crucify him, whereby to
          render him actually the Redeemer of the world, and so make him an
          ignorant instrument of that divine glory he designed to ruin. It is
          more skill to make a curious piece of workmanship with ill‑conditioned
          tools, than with instruments naturally fitted for the work: it is no
          such great wonder for a limner to draw an exact piece with a fit
          pencil and suitable colors, as to begin and perfect a beautiful work
          with a straw and water, things improper for such a design.785 This
          wisdom of God is more admirable and astonishing than if a man were
          able to rear a vast palace by fire, whose nature is to consume
          combustible matter not to erect a building. To make things serviceable
          contrary to their own nature, is a wisdom peculiar to the Creator of
          Nature. God’s making use of devils, for the glory of his name, and the
          good of his people, is a more amazing piece of wisdom than his
          goodness in employing the blessed angels in his work. To promise, that
          the world, (which includes the god of the world), and death, and
          things present, let them be as evil as they will, should be ours, that
          is, for our good, and for his glory, is an act of goodness; but to
          make them serviceable to the honor of Christ, and the good of his
          people, is a wisdom that may well raise our highest admirations: they
          are for believers, as they are for the glory of Christ, and as Christ
          is for the glory of God (1 Cor. iii. 22). To chain up Satan wholly,
          and frustrate his wiles, would be an argument of Divine goodness; but
          to suffer him to run his risk, and then improve all his contrivances
          for his own glorious and gracious ends and purposes, manifests,
          besides his power and goodness, his wisdom also. He uses the sins of
          evil instruments for the glory of his justice (Isa. x. 5‒7). Thus he
          served himself of the ambition and covetousness of the Assyrians,
          Chaldeans, and Romans, for the correction of his people, and
          punishment of his rebels, just as the Roman magistrates used the fury
          of lions and other wild beasts, in their theatres, for the punishment
          of criminals: the lions acted their natural temper in tearing those
          that were exposed to them for a prey; but the intent of the
          magistrates was to punish their crimes. the lions with their rage,
          that they had from their natures; but served themselves of that
          natural rage to execute justice.

          (3.) God’s wisdom is seen in bringing good to the creature out of sin.
          He hath ordered sin to such an end as man never dreamt of, the devil
          never imagined, and sin in its own nature could never attain. Sin in
          its own nature tends to no good, but that of punishment, whereby the
          creature is brought into order. It hath no relation to the creature’s
          good in itself, but to the creature’s mischief: but God, by an act of
          infinite wisdom, brings good out of it to the creature, as well as
          glory to his name, contrary to the nature of the crime, the intention
          of the criminal, and the design of the tempter. God willed sin, that
          is, he willed to permit it, that he might communicate himself to the
          creature in the most excellent manner. He willed the permission of
          sin, as an occasion to bring forth the mystery of the incarnation and
          passion of our Saviour; as he permitted the sin of Joseph’s brethren,
          that he might use their evil to a good end. He never, because of his
          holiness, wills sin as an end; but in regard of his wisdom he wills to
          permit it as a means and occasion; and thus, to draw good out of those
          things which are in their own nature most contrary to good, is the
          highest pitch of wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] The redemption of man in so excellent a way, was drawn from the
          occasion of sin. The greatest blessing that ever the world was blessed
          with, was ushered in by contraieties, by the lust and irregular
          affection of man; the first promise of the Redeemer by the fall of
          Adam (Gen. iii. 15), and the bruising the heel of that promised Seed,
          by the blackest tragedy acted by wicked rebels, the treachery of
          Judas, and the rage of the Jews; the highest good hath been brought
          forth by the greatest wickedness. As God out of the chaos of rude and
          indigested matter framed the first creation; so from the sins of men,
          and malice of Satan, he hath erected the everlasting scheme of honor
          in a new creation of all things by Jesus Christ. The devil inspired
          man, to content his own fury in the death of Christ; and God ordered
          it to accomplish his own design of redemption in the passion of the
          Redeemer; the devil had his diabolical ends, and God overpowers his
          actions to serve his own divine ends. The person that betrayed him was
          admitted to be a spectator of the most private actions of our Saviour,
          that his innocence might be justified; to shew, that he was not afraid
          to have his enemies judges of his most retired privacies. While they
          all thought to do their own wills, Divine wisdom orders them to do
          God’s will (Acts ii. 23): “Him, being delivered by the determinate
          counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands
          have crucified and slain.” And wherein the crucifiers of Christ
          sinned, in shedding the richest blood, upon their repentance they
          found the expiation of their crimes, and the discovery of a
          superabundant mercy. Nothing but the blood was aimed at by them: the
          best blood was shed by them; but infinite Wisdom makes the cross the
          scene of his own righteousness, and the womb of man’s recovery. By the
          occasion of man’s lapsed state, there was a way open to raise man to a
          more excellent condition than that whereinto he was put by creation:
          and the depriving man of the happiness of an earthly paradise, in a
          way of justice, was an occasion of advancing him to a heavenly
          felicity, in a way of grace. The violation of the old covenant
          occasionally introduced a better: the loss of the first integrity
          ushered in a more stable righteousness, an everlasting righteousness
          (Dan. ix. 24). And the falling of the first head was succeeded by one
          whose standing could not but be eternal. The fall of the devil was
          ordered by infinite Wisdom, for the good of that body from which he
          fell. It is supposed by some, that the devil was the chief angel in
          heaven, the head of all the rest; and that he falling, the angels were
          left as a body without a head; and after he had politically beheaded
          the angels, he endeavored to destroy man, and rout him out of
          paradise; but God takes the opportunity to set up his Son, as the head
          of angels and men. And thus whilst the devil endeavored to spoil the
          corporation of angels, and make them a body contrary to God, God makes
          angels and men one body under one head, for his service. The angels in
          losing a defectible head, attained a more excellent and glorious Head
          in another nature, which they had not before; though of a lower nature
          in his humanity, yet of a more glorious nature in his divinity: from
          whence many suppose they derive their confirming grace, and the
          stability of their standing. “All things in heaven and earth are
          gathered together in Christ” (Eph i. 10), ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι, all
          united in him, and reduced under one head: that though our Saviour be
          not properly their Redeemer, for redemption supposeth captivity, yet
          in some sense he is their Head and Mediator: so that now the
          inhabitants of heaven and earth are but one family (Eph. iii. 15). And
          the innumerable company of angels are parts of that heavenly and
          triumphant Jerusalem, and that general assembly, whereof Jesus Christ
          is Mediator (Heb. xii. 22, 29).
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] The good of a nation often, by the skill of Divine wisdom, is
          promoted by the sins of some men. The patriarchs’ selling Joseph to
          the Midianites (Gen. xxxvii. 28), was without question a sin, and a
          breach of natural affection; yet, by God’s wise ordination, it proved
          the safety of the whole church of God in the world, as well as the
          Egyptian nation (Gen. xlv. 5, 8; l. 20). The Jews’ unbelief was a step
          whereby the Gentiles arose to the knowledge of the gospel; as the
          setting of the sun in one place is the rising of it in another (Matt.
          xxii. 9). He uses the corruptions of men instrumentally to propogate
          his gospel: he built up the true church by the preaching of some out
          of envy (Phil. i. 15), as he blessed Israel out of the mouth of a
          false prophet (Numb. xxiii.) How often have the heresies of men been
          the occasion of clearing up the truth of God, and fixing the more
          lively impressions of it on the hearts of believers! Neither Judah nor
          Tamar, in their lust, dreamt of a stock for the Redeemer; yet God gave
          a son from that unlawful bed, whereof “Christ came according to the
          flesh” (Gen. xxxviii. 29, compared with Matt. i. 3). Jonah’s sin was
          probably the first and remote occasion of the Ninevites giving credit
          to his prophecy; his sin was the cause of his punishment, and his
          being flung into the sea might facilitate the reception of his
          message, and excite the Ninevites’ repentance, whereby a cloud of
          severe judgment was blown away from them. It is thought by some, that
          when Jonah passed through the streets of Nineveh, with his
          proclamation of destruction, he might be known by some of the mariners
          of that ship, from whence he was cast overboard into the sea, and
          might, after their voyage, be occasionally in that city, the
          metropolis of the nation, and the place of some of their births; and
          might acquaint the people, that this was the same person they had cast
          into the sea, by his own consent, for his acknowledged running from
          the presence of the Lord: for that he had told them (Jonah i. 10); and
          the mariner’s prayer (ver. 14) evidenced it; whereupon they might
          conclude his message worthy of belief, since they knew from such
          evidences, that he had sunk into the bowels of the waters, and now saw
          him safe in their streets, by a deliverence unknown to them; and that
          therefore that power that delivered him, could easily verify his word
          in the threatened judgment. Had Jonah gone at first, without
          committing that sin, and receiving that punishment, his message had
          not been judged a divine prediction, but a fruit of some enthusiastic
          madness; his sin upon this account was the first occasion of averting
          a judgment from so great a city.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] The good of the sinner himself is sometimes promoted by Divine
          wisdom ordering the sin. As God had not permitted sin to enter upon
          the world, unless to bring glory to himself by it; so he would not let
          sin remain in the little world of a believer’s heart, if he did not
          intend to order it for his good. What is done by man, to his damage
          and disparagement, is directed by Divine wisdom to his advantage; not
          that it is the intent of the sin, or the sinner; but it is the event
          of the sin, by the ordination of Divine wisdom and grace. As without
          the wisdom of God permitting sin to enter into the world, some
          attributes of God had not been experimentally known, so some graces
          could not have been exercised; for where had there been an object for
          that noble zeal, in vindicating the glory of God, had it not been
          invaded by an enemy? The intenseness of love to him could not have
          been so strong, had we not an enemy to hate for his sake. Where had
          there been any place for that noble part of charity in holy
          admonitions and compassion to the souls of our neighbors, and
          endeavors to reduce them out of a destructive, to a happy path?
          Humility would not have had so many grounds for its growth and
          exercise, and holy sorrow had no fuel. And as without the appearance
          of sin there had been no exercise of the patience of God, so without
          afflictions, the fruits of sin, there had been no ground for the
          exercise of the patience of a christian, one of the noblest parts of
          valor. Now sin being evil, and such as cannot but be evil, hath no
          respect in itself to any good, and cannot work a gracious end, or
          anything profitable to the creature; nay it is a hindrance to any
          good, and, therefore, what good comes from it, is accidental;
          occasioned, indeed, by sin, but efficiently caused by the over‑ruling
          wisdom of God, taking occasion thereby to display itself and the
          Divine goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The sins and corruptions remaining in the heart of man, God orders
          for good; and there are good effects by the direction of his wisdom
          and grace, as the soul respects God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God often brings forth a sensibleness of the necessity of
          dependence on him. The nurse often lets the child slip, that it may
          the better know who supports it, and may not be too venturous and
          confident of its own strength. Peter would trust in habitual grace,
          and God suffers him to fall, that he might trust more in assisting
          grace (Matt. xxvi. 35): “Though I should die with thee, yet I will not
          deny thee.” God leaves sometimes the brightest souls in eclipse, to
          manifest that their holiness, and the preservation of it, depend upon
          the darting out his beams upon them. As the falls of men are the
          effects of their coldness and remissness in acts of faith and
          repentance, so the fruit of these falls is often a running to him for
          refuge, and a deeper sensibleness where their security lies. It makes
          us lower our swelling sails, and come under the lee and protection of
          Divine grace. When the pleasures of sin answer not the expectations of
          a revolted creature, he reflects upon his former state, and sticks
          more close to God, when before God had little of his company (Hos. ii.
          7): “I will return to my first husband, for then it was better with me
          than now.” As God makes the sins of men sometimes an occasion of their
          conversion, so he sometimes makes them an occasion of a further
          conversion. Onesimus run from Philemon, and was met with by Paul, who
          proved an instrument of his conversion (Philem. 10): “My son,
          Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds.” His flight from his
          master was the occasion of his regeneration by Paul, a prisoner. The
          falls of believers God orders to their further stability; he that is
          fallen for want of using his staff, will lean more upon it to preserve
          himself from the like disaster. God, by permitting the lapses of men,
          doth often make them despair of their own strength to subdue their
          enemies, and rely upon the strength of Christ, wherein God hath laid
          up power for us, and so becomes stronger in that strength which God
          hath ordained for them. We are very apt to trust in ourselves, and
          have confidence in our own worth and strength; and God lets loose
          corruptions to abate this swelling humor. This was the reason of the
          apostle Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” (2 Cor. xii. 7); whether it were a
          temptation, or corruption, or sickness, that he might be sensible of
          his own inability, and where the sufficiency of grace for him was
          placed. He that is in danger of drowning, and hath the waves come over
          his head, will, with all the might he hath, lay hold upon anything
          near him, which is capable to save him. God lets his people sometimes
          sink into such a condition, that they may lay the faster hold on him
          who is near to all that call upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) God hereby raiseth higher estimations of the value and virtue of
          the blood of Christ. As the great reason why God permitted sin to
          enter into the world, was to honor himself in the Redeemer, so the
          continuance of sin, and the conquests it sometimes makes in renewed
          men, are to honor the infinite value and virtue of the Redeemer’s
          merit, which God, from the beginning, intended to magnify: the value
          of it, in taking off so much successive guilt; and the virtue of it,
          in washing away so much daily filth. The wisdom of God hereby keeps up
          the credit of imputed righteousness, and manifests the immense
          treasure of the Redeemer’s merit to pay such daily debts. Were we
          perfectly sanctified, we should stand upon our own bottom, and imagine
          no need of the continual and repeated imputation of the righteousness
          of Christ for our justification: we should confide in inherent
          righteousness, and slight imputed. If God should take off all
          remainders of sin, as well as the guilt of it, we should be apt to
          forget that we are fallen creatures, and that we had a Redeemer; but
          the relics of sin in us mind us of the necessity of some higher
          strength to set us right: they mind us both of our own misery, and the
          Redeemer’s perpetual benefit. God, by this, keeps up the dignity and
          honor of our Saviour’s blood to the height, and therefore sometimes
          lets us see, to our own cost, what filth yet remains in us for the
          employment of that blood, which we should else but little think of,
          and less admire. Our gratitude is so small to God as well as man, that
          the first obligations are soon forgot if we stand not in need of fresh
          ones successively to second them; we should lose our thankful
          remembrance of the first virtue of Christ’s blood in washing us, if
          our infirmities did not mind us of fresh reiterations and applications
          of it. Our Saviour’s office of advocacy was erected especially for
          sins committed after a justified and renewed state (1 John ii. 1). We
          should scarce remember we had an Advocate, and scarce make use of him
          without some sensible necessity; but our remainders of sin discover
          our impotency, and an impossibility for us either to expiate our sin,
          or conform to the law, which necessitates us to have recourse to that
          person whom God hath appointed to make up the breaches between God and
          us. So the apostle wraps up himself in the covenant of grace and his
          interest in Christ, after his conflict with sin (Rom. vii. ult.), “I
          thank God, through Jesus Christ.” Now, after such a body of death, a
          principle within me that sends up daily steams, yet as long as I serve
          God with my mind, as long as I keep the main condition of the
          covenant, “there is no condemnation” (Rom. viii. 1): Christ takes my
          part, procures my acceptance, and holds the band of salvation firm in
          his hands. The brightness of Christ’s grace is set off by the darkness
          of our sin. We should not understand the sovereignty of his medicines,
          if there were no relics of sin for him to exercise his skill upon: the
          physician’s art is most experimented, and therefore most valued in
          relapses, as dangerous as the former disease. As the wisdom of God
          brought our Saviour into temptation, that he might have compassion to
          us, so it permits us to be overcome by temptation, that we might have
          due valuations of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God hereby often engageth the soul to a greater industry for his
          glory. The highest persecutors, when they have become converts have
          been the greatest champions for that cause they both hated and
          oppressed. The apostle Paul is such an instance of this, that it needs
          no enlargement. By how much they have failed of answering the end of
          their creation in glorifying God, by so much the more they summon up
          all their force for such an end, after their conversion; to restore as
          much as they can of that glory to God, which they, by their sin, had
          robbed him of. Their sins, by the order of Divine wisdom, prove
          whetstones to sharpen the edge of their spirits for God. Paul never
          remembered his persecuting fury, but he doubled his industry for the
          service of God, which before he trampled under his feet. The further
          we go back, the greater leap many times we take forward. Our Saviour,
          after his resurrection, put Peter upon the exercise of that love to
          him, which had so lately shrunk his head out of suffering (John xxi.
          15‒17); and no doubt, but the consideration of his base denial,
          together with a reflection upon a gracious pardon, engaged his
          ingenuous soul to stronger and fiercer flames of affection. A
          believer’s courage for God is more sharpened oftentimes by the shame
          of his fall: he endeavors to repair the faults of his ingratitude and
          his disingenuity by larger and stronger steps of obedience; as a man
          in a fight, having been foiled by his enemy, reassumes new courage by
          his fall, and is many times obliged to his foil, both for his spirit
          and his victory. A gracious heart will, upon the very motions to sin,
          double its vigor, as well as by good ones: it is usually more
          quickened, both in its motion to God and for God, by the temptations
          and motions to sin which run upon it. This is another good the wisdom
          of God brings forth from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Again, humility towards God is another good Divine wisdom brings
          forth from the occasion of sin. By this God beats down all good
          opinion of ourselves. Hezekiah was more humbled by his fall into
          pride, than by all the distress he had been in by Sennacherib’s army
          (2 Chron. xxxii. 26). Peter’s confidence before his fall, gave way to
          an humble modesty after it; you see his confidence (Mark xiv. 24).
          “Though all should be offended in thee, yet will not I;” and you have
          the mark of his modesty (John xxi. 17). It is not then, Lord, I will
          love thee to the death, I will not start from thee; but, “Lord, thou
          knowest that I love thee:” I cannot assure myself of anything after
          this miscarriage; but, Lord, thou knowest there is a principle of love
          in me to thy name. He was ashamed, that himself who appeared such a
          pillar, should bend as meanly as a shrub to a temptation. The
          reflection upon sin lays a man as low as hell in his humiliation, as
          the commission of sin did in the merit. When David comes to exercise
          repentance for his sin, he begins it from the well‑head of sin (Ps.
          li. 5), his original corruption, and draws down the streams of it to
          the last commission; perhaps he did not so seriously humble himself
          for the sin of his nature all his days, so much as at that time; at
          least, we have not such evidences of it. And Hezekiah humbled himself
          for the pride of his heart; not only for the pride of his act (2
          Chron. xxxii. 26), but for the pride in the heart, which was the
          spring of that pride in act, in showing his treasures to the
          Babylonish ambassadors. God lets sin continue in the hearts of the
          best in this world, and sometimes gives the reins to Satan, and a
          man’s own corruption, to keep up a sense of the ancient sale we made
          of ourselves to both.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In regard of ourselves. Herein is the wonder of Divine wisdom, that
          God many times makes a sin, which meritoriously fits us for hell, a
          providential occasion to fit us for heaven; when it is an occasion of
          a more humble faith and believing humility, and an occasion of a
          thorough sanctification and growth in grace, which prepares us for a
          state of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) He makes use of one sin’s breaking out to discover more; and so
          brings us to a self‑abhorrency and indignation against sin, the first
          step towards heaven. Perhaps David, before his gross fall, thought he
          had no hypocrisy in him. We often find him appealing to God for his
          integrity, and desiring God to try him, if any guile could be found in
          his heart, as if he could find none himself; but his lapse into that
          great wickedness makes him discern much falseness in his soul, when he
          desires God to renew a right spirit within him, and speaks of truth in
          the inward parts (Ps. li. 6, 10). The stirring of corruption makes all
          the mud at the bottom appear, which before a soul did not suspect. No
          man would think there were so great a cloud of smoke contained in a
          little stick of wood, were it not for the powerful operation of the
          fire, that both discovers and separates it. Job, that cursed the day
          of his birth, and uttered many impatient expressions against God upon
          the account of his own integrity; upon his recovery from his
          affliction, and God’s close application of himself, was wrought to a
          greater abhorrency of himself than ever we read he was exercised in
          before (Job xlii. 6). The hostile acts of sin increase the soul’s
          hatred of it; and the deeper our humiliations are for it, the stronger
          impressions of abhorrency are made upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He often orders it, to make conscience more tender, and the soul
          more watchful. He that finds by his calamity his enemy to have more
          strength against him than he suspected, will double his guards, and
          quicken his diligence against him. A being overtaken by some sin, is,
          by the wisdom of God, disposed to make us more fearful of cherishing
          any occasion to inflame it, and watchful against every motion and
          start of it. By a fall, the soul hath more experience of the
          deceitfulness of the heart; and by observing its methods, is rendered
          better able to watch against them. It is our ignorance of the devices
          of Satan, and our own hearts, that makes us obnoxious to their
          surprises. A fall into one sin is often a prevention of more which lay
          in wait for us; as the fall of a small body into an ambush prevents
          the design of the enemy upon a greater: as God suffers heresies in the
          church, to try our faith, so he suffers sins to remain, and sometimes
          to break out, to try our watchfulness. This advantage he brings from
          them, to steel our resolutions against the same sins, and quicken our
          circumspection for the future against new surprises by a temptation.
          David’s sin was ever before him (Ps. li. 3), and made his conscience
          cry, Blood, blood! upon every occasion: he refused the water of the
          well of Bethlehem (2 Sam. xxiii. 16, 17), because it was gained with
          the hazard of lives: he could endure nothing that had the taste of
          blood in it. Our fear of a thing depends much upon a trial of it: a
          child will not fear too near approaches to the fire till he feels the
          smart of it. Mortification doth not wholly suppress the motions of
          sin, though it doth the resolutions to commit it; but that there will
          be a proneness in the relics of it, to entice a man into those faults,
          which, upon sight of their blemishes, cost him so many tears; as great
          sicknesses, after the cure, are more watched, and the body humored,
          that a man might not fall from the craziness they have left in him,
          which he is apt to do if relapses are not provided against. A man
          becomes more careful of anything that may contribute to the
          resurrection of an expired disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God makes it an occasion of the mortification of that sin which
          was the matter of the fall. The liveliness of one sin, in a renewed
          man, many times is the occasion of the death of it. A wild beast,
          while kept close in a den, is secure in its life, but when it breaks
          out to rapine, it makes the master resolve to prevent any further
          mischief by the death of it. The impetuous stirring of a humor, in a
          disease, is sometimes critical, and a prognostic of the strength of
          nature against it, whereby the disease loses its strength, by its
          struggling, and makes room for health to take place by degrees. One
          sin is used by God for the destruction both of itself and others, as
          the flesh of a scorpion cures the biting of it. It sometimes, by
          wounding us, loseth its sting, and, like the bee, renders itself
          incapable of a second revenge. Peter, after his gross denial, never
          denied his Master afterwards. The sin that lay undiscovered, is, by a
          fall, become visible, and so more obvious to a mortifying stroke. The
          soul lays the faster hold on Christ and the promise, and goes out
          against that enemy, in the name of that Lord of Hosts, of which he was
          too negligent before; and, therefore, as he proves more strong, so
          more successful: he hath more strength, because he hath less
          confidence in himself, and more in God, the prime strength of his
          soul. As it was with Christ, so it is with us; while the devil was
          bruising his heel, he was bruising his head; and while the devil is
          bruising our heel, the God of peace and wisdom is sometimes bruising
          his head, both in us and for us, so that the strugglings of sin are
          often as the faint groans or bitings of a beast that is ready to
          expire. It is just with a man, sometimes, as with a running fountain
          that hath mud at the bottom, when it is stirred the mud tinctures and
          defiles it all over; yet some of that mud hath a vent with the streams
          which run from it, so that, when it is re‑settled at the bottom, it is
          not so much in quantity as it was before. God, by his wisdom, weakens
          the sin by permitting it to stir and defile.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Sometimes Divine wisdom makes it an occasion to promote a
          sanctification in all parts of the soul. As the working of one
          ill‑humor in the body is an occasion of cashiering, not only that, but
          the rest, by a sound purge; as a man, that is a little cold, doth not
          think of the fire, but if he slips with one foot into an icy puddle,
          he hastens to the fire, whereby not only that part, but all the rest
          receive a warmth and strength upon that occasion; or, as if a person
          fall into the mire, his clothes are washed, and by that means
          cleansed, not only from the filth at present contracted, but from the
          former spots that were before unregarded. God, by his wisdom, brings
          secret sins to a discovery, and thereby cleanseth the soul of them.
          David’s fall might be ordered as an answer to his former petition (Ps.
          xix. 12): “Cleanse thou me from my secret sins;” and as he did
          earnestly pray after his fall, so no doubt but he endeavored a
          thorough sanctification (Ps. li. 7); “Purge me, wash me;” and that he
          meant not only a sanctification from that single sin, but from all,
          root and branch, is evident by that complaint of the flaw in his
          nature (ver. 5): the dross and chaff which lies in the heart is hereby
          discovered, and an opportunity administered of throwing it out, and
          searching all the corners of the heart to discover where it lay. As
          God sometimes takes occasion from one sin to reckon with men, in a way
          of justice, for others, so he sometimes takes occasion, from the
          commission of one sin, to bring out all the actions against the
          sinner, to make him, in a way of gracious wisdom, set more cordially
          upon the work of sanctification. A great fall sometimes hath been the
          occasion of a man’s conversion. The fall of mankind occasioned a more
          blessed restoration; and the falls of particular believers ofttimes
          occasion a more extensive sanctification. Thus the only wise God makes
          poisons in nature to become medicines in a way of grace and wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Hereby the growth in grace is furthered. It is a wonder of Divine
          wisdom, to subtract sometimes grace from a person, and let him fall
          into sin, thereby to occasion the increase of habitual grace in him,
          and to augment it by those ways that seemed to depress it. By making
          sins an occasion of a more vigorous acting, the contrary grace, the
          wisdom of God, makes our corruptions, in their own nature destructive,
          to become profitable to us. Grace often breaks out more strongly
          afterwards, as the sun doth with its heat, after it hath been masked
          and interrupted with a mist: they often, through the mighty working of
          the Spirit, make us more humble, and “humility fits us to receive more
          grace from God” (James iv. 6). How doth faith, that sunk under the
          waves, lift up its head again, and carry the soul out with a greater
          liveliness! What ardors of love, what floods of repenting tears, what
          severity of revenge, what horrors at the remembrance of the sin, what
          tremblings at the appearance of a second temptation! so that grace
          seems to be awakened to a new and more vigorous life (2 Cor. vii. 11).
          The broken joint is many times stronger in the rupture than it was
          before. The luxuriancy of the branches of corruption is an occasion of
          purging, and purging is with a design to make grace more fruitful
          (John xv. 2); “He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.”
          Thus Divine wisdom doth both sharpen and brighten us by the dust of
          sin, and ripen and mellow the fruits of grace by the dung of
          corruption. Grace grows the stronger by opposition, as the fire burns
          hottest and clearest when it is most surrounded by a cold air; and our
          natural heat reassumes a new strength by the coldness of the winter.
          The foil under a diamond, though an imperfection in itself, increaseth
          the beauty and lustre of the stone. The enmity of man was a
          commendation of the grace of God: it occasioned the breaking out of
          the grace of God upon us; and is an occasion, by the wisdom and grace
          of God, of the increase of grace many times in us. How should the
          consideration of God’s incomprehensible wisdom, in the management of
          evil, swallow us up in admiration! who brings forth such beauty, such
          eminent discoveries of himself, such excellent good to the creature,
          out of the bowels of the greatest contrarieties, making dark shadows
          serve to display and beautify, to our apprehensions, the Divine glory!
          If evil were not in the world, men would not know what good is; they
          would not behold the lustre of Divine wisdom, as without night we
          could not understand the beauty of the day. Though God is not the
          author of sin, because of his holiness, yet he is the administrator of
          sin by his wisdom, and accomplisheth his own purposes, by the
          iniquities of his enemies, and the lapses and infirmities of his
          friends. Thus much for the second, the government of man in his lapsed
          state, and the government of sin, wherein the wisdom of God doth
          wonderfully appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly. The wisdom of God appears in the government of man in his
          conversion and return to him. If there be a counsel in framing the
          lowest creature, and in the minutest passages of providence, there
          must needs be a higher wisdom in the government of the creature to a
          supernatural end, and framing the soul to be a monument of his glory.
          The wisdom of God is seen with more admirations, and in more
          varieties, by the angels, in the church than in the creation (Eph.
          iii. 10); that is, in forming a church out of the rubbish of the
          world, out of contrarieties and contradictions to him, which is
          greater than the framing a celestial and elementary world out of a
          rude chaos. The most glorious bodies in the world, even those of the
          sun, moon, and stars, have not such stamps of Divine skill upon them
          as the soul of man; nor is there so much of wisdom in the fabric and
          faculties of that, as in the reduction of a blind, wilful, rebellious
          soul, to its own happiness, and God’s glory (Eph. i. 11, 12); “He
          worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will, that we
          should be for the praise of his glory.” If all things, then this,
          which is none of the least of his works; to the praise of the glory of
          his goodness in his work, and to the praise of the rule of his work,
          his counsel, in both the act of his will, and the act of his wisdom.
          The restoring of the beauty of the soul, and its fitness for its true
          end, speaks no less wisdom than the first draught of it in creation:
          and the application of redemption, and bringing forth the fruits of
          it, is as well an act of his prudence, as the contrivance was of his
          counsel. Divine wisdom appears,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the subjects of conversion. His goodness reigns in the very
          dust, and he erects the walls and ornaments of his temple from the
          clay and mud of the world. He passes over the wise, and noble, and
          mighty, that may pretend some grounds of boasting in their own natural
          or acquired endowments; and pitches upon the most contemptible
          materials, wherewith to build a spiritual tabernacle for himself (1
          Cor. i. 26, 27), “the foolish, and weak things of the world;” those
          that are naturally most unfit for it, and most refractory to it.
          Herein lies the skill of an architect, to render the most knotty,
          crooked, and inform pieces, by his art, subservient to his main
          purpose and design. Thus God hath ordered, from the beginning of the
          world, contrary tempers, various humors, diverse nations, as stones of
          several natures, to be a building for himself, fitly framed together,
          and to be his own family (1 Cor. iii. 9). Who will question the skill
          that alters a black jet into a clear crystal, a glow‑worm into a star,
          a lion into a lamb, and a swine into a dove? The more intricate and
          knotty any business is, the more eminent is any man’s ability and
          prudence, in untying the knots and bringing it to a good issue. The
          more desperate the disease, the more admirable is the physician’s
          skill in the cure. He pitches upon men for his service, who have
          natural dispositions to serve him in such ways as he disposeth of
          them, after their conversion: so Paul was naturally a conscientious
          man; what he did against Christ was from the dictates of an erroneous
          conscience, soaked in the Pharisaical interpretations of the Jewish
          law: he had a strain of zeal to prosecute what his depraved reason and
          conscience did inform him in. God pitches upon this man, and works him
          in the fire for his service. He alters not his natural disposition, to
          make him of a constitution and temper contrary to what he was before;
          but directs it to another object, claps in another bias into the bowl,
          and makes his ill‑governed dispositions move in a new way of his own
          appointment, and guides that natural heat to the service of that
          interest which he was before ambitious to extirpate; as a high‑mettled
          horse, when left to himself, creates both disturbance and danger, but
          under the conduct of a wise rider, moves regularly; not by a change of
          his natural fierceness, but a skilful management of the beast to the
          rider’s purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the means of conversion. The prudence of man consists in the
          timing the executions of his counsels; and no less doth the wisdom of
          God consist in this. As he is a God of judgment or wisdom, he waits to
          introduce his grace into the soul in the fittest season. This
          attribute, Paul, in the story of his own conversion, puts a particular
          remark upon, which he doth not upon any other; in that catalogue he
          reckons up (1 Tim. i. 17), “Now, unto the King eternal, immortal,
          invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory, for ever and ever.
          Amen.” A most solemn doxology, wherein wisdom sits upon the throne
          above all the rest, with a special Amen to the glory of it, which
          refers to the timing of his mercy so to Paul, as made most for the
          glory of his grace, and the encouragement of others from him as the
          pattern. God took him at a time when he was upon the brink of hell;
          when he was ready to devour the new‑born infant church at Damascus;
          when he was armed with all the authority from without, and fired with
          all the zeal from within, for the prosecution of his design: then God
          seizeth upon him, and runs him in a channel for his own honor, and his
          creatures’ happiness. It is observable786 how God set his eye upon
          Paul all along in his furious course, and lets him have the reins,
          without putting out his hand to bridle him; yet no motion he could
          take, but the eye of God runs along with him: he suffered him to kick
          against the pricks of miracles, and the convincing discourse of
          Stephen at his martyrdom. There were many that voted for Stephen’s
          death, as the witnesses that flung the stones first at him; but they
          are not named, only Saul, who testified his approbation as well as the
          rest, and that by watching the witnesses’ clothes while they were
          about that bloody work (Acts vii. 58); “the witnesses laid their
          clothes at a young man’s feet, named Saul.” Again, though multitudes
          were consenting to his death, yet (Acts viii. 1) Saul only is
          mentioned. God’s eye is upon him, yet he would not at that time stop
          his fury. He goes on further, and makes “havoc of the church” (Acts
          viii. 3). He had surely many more complices, but none are named (as if
          none regarded with any design of grace) but Saul: yet God would not
          reach out his hand to change him, but eyes him, waiting for a fitter
          opportunity, which in his wisdom he did foresee. And, therefore (Acts
          ix. 1) the Spirit of God adds a yet; “Saul yet breathing out
          threatenings.” It was not God’s time yet, but it would be shortly.
          But, when Saul was putting in execution his design against the church
          of Damascus, when the devil was at the top of his hopes, and Saul in
          the height of his fury, and the Christians sunk into the depth of
          their fears, the wisdom of God lays hold of the opportunity, and by
          Paul’s conversion at this season, defeats the devil, disappoints the
          high priests, shields his people, discharges their fears, by pulling
          Saul out of the devil’s hands, and forming Satan’s instruments to a
          holy activity against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The wisdom of God appears in the manner of conversion. So great a
          change God makes, not by a destruction, but with a preservation of,
          and suitableness to nature. As the devil tempts us, not by offering
          violence to our natures, but by proposing things convenient to our
          corrupt natures, so doth God solicit us to a return by proposals
          suited to our faculties. As he doth in nature convey nourishment to
          men, by means of the fruits of the earth, and produceth the fruits of
          the earth by the influences of heaven; the influences of heaven do not
          force the earth, but excite that natural virtue and strength which is
          in it. So God produceth grace in the soul by the means of the word,
          fitted to the capacity of man, as man, and proportioned to his
          rational faculties, as rational. It would be contrary to the wisdom of
          God to move man like a stone, to invert the order and privilege of
          that nature which he settled in creation; for then God would in vain
          have given man understanding and will: because, without moving man
          according to those faculties, they would remain unprofitable and
          unuseful in man.787 God doth not reduce us to himself, as logs, by a
          mere force, or as slaves forced by a cudgel, to go forth to that
          place, and do that work which they have no stomach to: but he doth
          accommodate himself to those foundations he hath laid in our nature,
          and guides us in a way agreeable thereunto, by an action as sweet as
          powerful; clearing our understandings of dark principles, whereby we
          may see his truth, our own misery, and the seat of our happiness; and
          bending our wills according to this light, to desire and move
          conveniently to this end of our calling; efficaciously, yet agreeably;
          powerfully, yet without imposing on our natural faculties; sweetly,
          without violence, in ordering the means; but effectually, without
          failing, in accomplishing the end.788 And therefore the Scripture
          calleth it, teaching (John vi. 45), alluring (Hos. ii. 15), calling us
          to seek the Lord (Ps. xxvii. 8). Teaching is an act of wisdom;
          alluring, an act of love; calling, an act of authority: but none of
          them argue a violent constraint. The principle that moves the will is
          supernatural; but the will, as a natural faculty, concurs in the act
          or motion. God doth not act in this in a way of absolute power,
          without an infinite wisdom, suiting himself to the nature of the
          things he acts upon: he doth not change the physical nature, though he
          doth the moral. As in the government of the world, he doth not make
          heavy things ascend, nor light things descend, ordinarily, but guides
          their motions according to their natural qualities: so God doth not
          strain the faculties beyond their due pitch. He lets the nature of the
          faculty remain, but changes the principle in it: the understanding
          remains understanding, and the will remains will. But where there was
          before folly in the understanding, he puts in a spirit of wisdom; and
          where there was before a stoutness in the will, he forms it to a
          pliableness to his offers. He hath a key to fit every ward in the
          lock, and opens the will without injuring the nature of the will. He
          doth not change the soul by an alteration of the faculties, but by an
          alteration of something in them: not by an inroad upon them, or by
          mere power, or a blind instinct, but by proposing to the understanding
          something to be known, and informing it of the reasonableness of his
          precepts, and the innate goodness and excellency of his offers, and by
          inclining the will to love and embrace what is proposed. And things
          are proposed under those notions, which usually move our wills and
          affections. We are moved by things as they are good, pleasant,
          profitable; we entertain things as they make for us, and detest things
          as they are contrary to us. Nothing affects us but under such
          qualities, and God suits his encouragements to these natural
          affections which are in us: his power and wisdom go hand in hand
          together; his power to act what his wisdom orders, and his wisdom to
          conduct what his power executes. He brings men to him in ways suited
          to their natural dispositions. The stubborn he tears like a lion, the
          gentle he wins like a turtle, by sweetness; he hath a hammer to break
          the stout, and a cord of love to draw the more pliable tempers: he
          works upon the more rational in a way of gospel reason; upon the more
          ingenuous in a way of kindness, and draws them by the cords of love.
          The wise men were led to Christ by a star, and means suited to the
          knowledge and study that those eastern nations used, which was much in
          astronomy: he worketh upon others by miracles accommodated to every
          one’s sense, and so proportions the means according to the nature of
          the subjects he works upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The wisdom of God is apparent in his discipline and penal evils.
          The wisdom of human governments is seen in the matter of their laws,
          and in the penalties of their laws, and in the proportion of the
          punishment to the offence, and in the good that redounds from the
          punishment either to the offender, or to the community. The wisdom of
          God is seen in the penalty of death upon the transgression of his law;
          both in that it was the greatest evil that man might fear, and so was
          a convenient means to keep him in his due bound, and also in the
          proportion of it to the transgression. Nothing less could be in a wise
          justice inflicted upon an offender for a crime against the highest
          Being and the Supreme Excellency: but this hath been spoken of before
          in the wisdom of his laws. I shall only mention some few; it would be
          too tedious to run into all.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) His wisdom appears in judgments, in the suiting them to the
          qualities of persons, and nature of sins. He deviseth evil (Jer.
          xviii. 11); his judgments are fruits of counsel. “He also is wise, and
          will bring evil” (Isa. xxxi. 2),—evil suitable to the person
          offending, and evil suitable to the offence committed: as the
          husbandman doth his threshing instruments to the grain: he hath a rod
          for the cummin, a tenderer seed, and a flail for the harder; so hath
          God greater judgments for the obdurate sinner, and lighter for those
          that have something of tenderness in their wickedness (Isa. xxviii.
          27, 29): “Because he is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
          working;” so some understand the place, “With the froward, he will
          show himself froward.” He proportions punishment to the sin, and
          writes the cause of the judgment in the forehead of the judgment
          itself. Sodom burned in lust, and was consumed by fire from heaven.
          The Jews sold Christ for thirty pence; and at the taking of Jerusalem,
          thirty of them were sold for a penny. So Adonibezek cut off the thumbs
          and great toes of others, and he is served in the same kind (Judges i.
          7). The Babel builders designed an indissoluble union, and God brings
          upon them an unintelligible confusion. And in Exod. ix. 9, the ashes
          of the furnace where the Israelites burnt the Egyptian bricks,
          sprinkled towards heaven, brought boils upon the Egyptian bodies, that
          they might feel in their own, what pain they had caused in the
          Israelites’ flesh; and find, by the smart of the inflamed scab, what
          they had made the Israelites endure. The waters of the river Nilus are
          turned into blood, wherein they had stifled the breath of the
          Israelites’ infants: and at last the prince, and the flower of their
          nobility, are drowned in the Red Sea. It is part of the wisdom of
          justice to proportion punishment to the crime, and the degrees of
          wrath to the degrees of malice in the sin. Afflictions also are wisely
          proportioned: God, as a wise physician, considers the nature of the
          humor and strength of the patient, and suits his medicines both to the
          one and the other (1 Cor. x. 13).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) In the seasons of punishments and afflictions. He stays till sin
          be ripe, that his justice may appear more equitable, and the offender
          more inexcusable (Dan. ix. 14); he watches upon the evil to bring it
          upon men; to bring it in the just season and order for his righteous
          and gracious purpose; his righteous purpose on the enemies, and his
          gracious purpose on his people. Jerusalem’s calamity came upon them,
          when the city was full of people at the solemnity of the passover,
          that he might mow down his enemies at once, and time their destruction
          to such a moment wherein they had timed the crucifixion of his Son. He
          watched over the clouds of his judgments, and kept them from pouring
          down, till his people, the Christians, were provided for, and had
          departed out of the city to the chambers and retiring places God had
          provided for them. He made not Jerusalem the shambles of his enemies,
          till he had made Pella, and other places, the arks of his friends. As
          Pliny tells us, “The providence of God holds the sea in a calm for
          fifteen days, that the halcyons, little birds that frequent the shore,
          may build their nests, and hatch up their young.” The judgment upon
          Sodom was suspended for some hours, till Lot was secured. God suffered
          not the church to be invaded by violent persecutions, till she was
          established in the faith: he would not expose her to so great combats,
          while she was weak and feeble, but gave her time to fortify herself,
          to be rendered more capable of bearing up under them.789 He stifled
          all the motions of passion the idolaters might have for their
          superstition, till religion was in such a condition, as rather to be
          increased and purified, than extinguished by opposition. Paul was
          secured from Nero’s chains, and the nets of his enemies, till he had
          broke off the chain of the devil from many cities of the Gentiles, and
          catched them by the net of the gospel out of the sea of the world.
          Thus the wisdom of God is seen in the seasons of judgments and
          afflictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It is apparent in the gracious issue of afflictions and penal
          evils. It is a part of wisdom to bring good out of evil of punishment,
          as well as to bring good out of sin. The church never was so like to
          heaven, as when it was most persecuted by hell: the storms often
          cleansed it and the lance often made it more healthful. Job’s
          integrity had not been so clear, nor his patience so illustrious, had
          not the devil been permitted to afflict him. God, by his wisdom,
          outwits Satan; when he by his temptations intends to pollute us and
          buffet us, God orders it to purify us; he often brings the clearest
          light out of the thickest darkness, makes poisons to become medicines.
          Death itself, the greatest punishment in this life, and the entrance
          into hell in its own nature, he hath by his wise contrivance, made to
          his people the gate of heaven, and the passage into immortality.790
          Penal evils in a nation often end in a public advantage: troubles and
          wars among a people are many times not destroying, but medicinal, and
          cure them of that degeneracy, luxury, and effeminateness, they
          contracted by a long peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) This wisdom is evident in the various ends which God brings about
          by afflictions. The attainment of various ends by one and the same
          means, is the fruit of the agent’s prudence. By the same affliction,
          the wise God corrects sometimes for some base affection, excites some
          sleepy grace, drives out some lurking corruption, refines the soul,
          and ruins the lust; discovers the greatness of a crime, the vanity of
          the creature, and the sufficiency in himself. The Jews bind Paul, and
          by the judge he is sent to Rome; while his mouth is stopped in Judea,
          it is opened in one of the greatest cities of the world, and his
          enemies unwittingly contribute to the increase of the knowledge of
          Christ by those chains, in that city (Acts xxviii. 31) that triumphed
          over the earth. And his afflictive bonds added courage and resolution
          to others (Phil. i. 14): “Many waxing confident by my bonds;” which
          could not in their own nature produce such an effect, but by the order
          and contrivance of Divine wisdom: in their own nature, they would
          rather make them disgust the doctrine he suffered for, and cool their
          zeal in the propagating of it, for fear of the same disgrace and
          hardship they saw him suffer.791 But the wisdom of God changed the
          nature of these fetters, and conducted them to the glory of his name,
          the encouragement of others, the increase of the gospel, and the
          comfort of the apostle himself (Phil. i. 12, 13, 18). The sufferings
          of Paul at Rome confirmed the Philippians, a people at a distance from
          thence, in the doctrine they had already received at his hands. Thus
          God makes sufferings sometimes, which appear like judgments, to be
          like the viper on Paul’s hand (Acts xxviii. 6), a means to clear up
          innocence, and procure favor to the doctrine among those barbarians.
          How often hath he multiplied the church by death and massacres, and
          increased it by those means used to annihilate it!
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) The Divine wisdom is apparent in the deliverances he affords to
          other parts of the world, as well as to his church. There are delicate
          composures, curious threads in his webs, and he works them like an
          artificer: a goodness wrought for them, curiously wrought (Ps. xxxi.
          19), [1.] In making the creatures subservient in their natural order
          to his gracious ends and purposes. He orders things in such a manner,
          as not to be necessitated to put forth an extraordinary power in
          things, which some part of the creation might accomplish. Miraculous
          productions would speak his power; but the ordering the natural course
          of things, to occasion such effects they were never intended for, is
          one part of the glory of his wisdom. And that his wisdom may be seen
          in the course of nature, he conducts the motions of creatures, and
          acts them in their own strength; and doth that by various windings and
          turnings of them, which he might do in an instant by his power, in a
          supernatural way. Indeed, sometimes he hath made invasions on nature,
          and suspended the order of their natural laws for a season, to show
          himself the absolute Lord and Governor of nature: yet if frequent
          alterations of this nature were made, they would impede the knowledge
          of the nature of things, and be some bar to the discovery and glory of
          his wisdom, which is best seen by moving the wheels of inferior
          creatures in an exact regularity to his own ends. He might, when his
          little church in Jacob’s family was like to starve in Canaan, have,
          for their preservation, turned the stones of the country into bread;
          but he sends them down to Egypt to procure corn, that a way might be
          opened for their removal into that country; the truth of his
          prediction in their captivity accomplished, and a way made after the
          declaration of his great name, Jehovah, both in the fidelity of his
          word and the greatness of his power, in their deliverance from that
          furnace of affliction. He might have struck Goliath, the captain of
          the Philistine’s army, with a thunderbolt from heaven, when he
          blasphemed his name, and scared his people; but he useth the natural
          strength of a stone, and the artificial motion of a sling, by the arm
          of David, to confront the giant, and thereby to free Judea from the
          ravage of a potent enemy. He might have delivered the Jews from
          Babylon by as strange miracles as he used in their deliverance from
          Egypt: he might have plagued their enemies, gathered his people into a
          body, and protected them by the bulwark of a cloud and a pillar of
          fire, against the assaults of their enemies. But he uses the
          differences between the Persians and those of Babylon, to accomplish
          his ends. How sometimes hath the veering about of the wind on a sudden
          been the loss of a navy, when it hath been put upon the point of
          victory, and driven back the destruction upon those which intended it
          for others! and the accidental stumbling, or the natural fierceness of
          a horse, flung down a general in the midst of a battle, where he hath
          lost his life by the throng, and his death hath brought a defeat to
          his army, and deliverance to the other party, that were upon the brink
          of ruin! Thus doth the wisdom of God link things together according to
          natural order, to work out his intended preservation of a people. [2.]
          In the season of deliverance. The timing of affairs is a part of the
          wisdom of man, and an eminent part of the wisdom of God. It is in due
          season he sends the former and the latter rain, when the earth is in
          the greatest indigence, and when his influences may most contribute to
          the bringing forth and ripening the fruit. The dumb creatures have
          their meat from him in due season (Ps. civ. 27): and in his due season
          have his darling people their deliverance. When Paul was upon his
          journey to Damascus with a persecuting commission, he is struck down
          for the security of the church in that city. The nature of the lion is
          changed in due season, for the preservation of the lambs from
          worrying. The Israelites are miraculously rescued from Egypt, when
          their wits were at a loss, when their danger to human understanding
          was unavoidable; when earth and sea refused protection, then the
          wisdom and power of heaven stepped in to effect that which was past
          the skill of the conductors of that multitude. And when the lives of
          the Jews lay at the stake, and their necks were upon the block at the
          mercy of their enemies’ swords by an order from Shushan, not only a
          reprieve, but a triumph, arrives to the Jews, by the wisdom of God
          guiding the affair, whereby of persons designed to execution, they are
          made conquerors, and have opportunity to exercise their revenge
          instead of their patience, proving triumphers where they expected to
          be sufferers (Esth. viii. 9). How strangely doth God, by secret ways,
          bow the hearts of men and the nature of things to the execution of
          that which he designs, notwithstanding all the resistance of that
          which would traverse the security of his people! How often doth he
          trap the wicked in the work of their own hands, make their confidence
          to become their ruin, and ensnare them in those nets they wrought and
          laid for others (Ps. ix. 16)! “The wicked is snared in the work of his
          own hands. He scatters the proud in the imagination of their hearts”
          (Luke i. 51), in the height of their hopes, when their designs have
          been laid so deep in the foundation, and knit and cemented so close in
          their superstructure, that no human power or wisdom could rase them
          down: he hath then disappointed their projects, and befooled their
          craft. How often hath he kept back the fire, when it hath been ready
          to devour; broke the arrows when they have been prepared in the bow;
          turned the spear into the bowels of the bearers, and wounded them at
          the very instant they were ready to wound others! [3.] In suiting
          instruments to his purpose. He either finds them fit, or makes them on
          a sudden fit for his gracious ends. If he hath a tabernacle to build,
          he will fit a Bezaleel and an Aholiab with the spirit of wisdom and
          understanding in all cunning workmanship (Exod. xxxi. 3, 6). If he
          finds them crooked pieces, he can, like a wise architect, make them
          straight beams for the rearing his house, and for the honor of his
          name. He sometimes picks out men according to their natural tempers,
          and employs them in his work. Jehu, a man of a furious temper, and
          ambitious spirit, is called out for the destruction of Ahab’s house.
          Moses, a man furnished with all Egyptian wisdom, fitted by a generous
          education, prepared also by the affliction he met with in his flight,
          and one who had had the benefit of conversation with Jethro, a man of
          more than an ordinary wisdom and goodness, as appears by his prudent
          and religious counsel; this man is called out to be the head and
          captain of an oppressed people, and to rescue them from their bondage,
          and settle the first national church in the world. So Elijah, a
          high‑spirited man, of a hot and angry temper, one that slighted the
          frowns, and undervalued the favor of princes, is set up to stem the
          torrent of Israelitish idolatry. So Luther, a man of the same temper,
          is drawn out by the same wisdom to encounter the corruptions in the
          church, against such opposition, which a milder temper would have sunk
          under. The earth, in Rev. xii. 16, is made an instrument to help the
          woman: when the grandees of that age transferred the imperial power
          upon Constantine, who became afterwards a protecting and nursing
          father to the church, an end which many of his favorers never
          designed, nor ever dreamt of: but God, by his infinite wisdom, made
          these several designs, like several arrows shot at rovers, meet in one
          mark to which he directed them, viz., in bringing forth an instrument
          to render peace to the world and security and increase to his church.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The wisdom of God doth wonderfully appear in redemption. His
          wisdom in creature ravisheth the eye and understanding; his wisdom in
          government doth no less affect a curious observer of the links and
          concatenation of the means; but his wisdom in redemption mounts the
          mind to a greater astonishment. The works of creation are the
          footsteps of his wisdom; the work of redemption is the face of his
          wisdom. A man is better known by the features of his face, than by the
          prints of his feet. We, with “open face,” or a revealed face,
          “beholding the glory of the Lord” (2 Cor. iii. 18). Face, there,
          refers to God, not to us; the glory of God’s wisdom is now open, and
          no longer covered and veiled by the shadows of the law. As we behold
          the light glorious as scattered in the air before the appearance of
          the sun, but more gloriously in the face of the sun when it begins its
          race in our horizon. All the wisdom of God in creation, and government
          in his variety of laws, was like the light the three first days of the
          creation, dispersed about the world; but the fourth day it was more
          glorious, when all gathered into the body of the sun (Gen. i. 4, 16).
          So the light of Divine wisdom and glory was scattered about the world,
          and so more obscure, till the fourth divine day of the world, about
          the four thousandth year, it was gathered into one body, the Sun of
          Righteousness, and so shone out more gloriously to men and angels. All
          things are weaker the thinner they are extended, but stronger the more
          they are united and compacted in one body and appearance. In Christ,
          in the dispensation by him, as well as his person, were “hid all the
          treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Coloss. ii. 3). Some doles of
          wisdom were given out in creation, but the treasures of it opened in
          redemption, the highest degrees of it that ever God did exert in the
          world. Christ is therefore called the “wisdom of God,” as well as the
          “power of God” (1 Cor. i. 24); and the gospel is called the “wisdom of
          God.” Christ is the wisdom of God principally, and the gospel
          instrumentally, as it is the power of God instrumentally to subdue the
          heart to himself. This is wrapped up in the appointing Christ as
          Redeemer, and opened to us in the revelation of it by the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a hidden wisdom. In this regard God is said, in the text, to
          be only wise: and it is said to be a “hidden wisdom” (1 Tim. i. 17),
          and “wisdom in a mystery” (1 Cor. ii. 7), incomprehensible to the
          ordinary capacity of an angel, more than the obstruse qualities of the
          creatures are to the understanding of man. No wisdom of men or angels
          is able to search the veins of this mine, to tell all the threads of
          this web, or to understand all the lustre of it; they are as far from
          an ability fully to comprehend it, as they were at first to contrive
          it. That wisdom that invented it can only comprehend it. In the
          uncreated understanding only there is a clearness of light without any
          shadow of darkness. We come as short of full apprehensions of it, as a
          child doth of the counsel of the wisest prince. It is so hidden from
          us, that, without revelation, we could not have the least imagination
          of it; and though it be revealed to us, yet, without the help of an
          infiniteness of understanding, we cannot fully fathom it: it is such a
          tractate of divine wisdom, that the angels never before had seen the
          edition of it, till it was published to the world (Eph. iii. 10): “to
          the intent that now unto principalities and powers in heavenly places
          might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.” Now made
          known to them, not before; and now made known to them “in the heavenly
          places.” They had not the knowledge of all heavenly mysteries, though
          they had the possession of heavenly glory: they knew the prophecies of
          it in the word, but attained not a clear interpretation of those
          prophecies till the things that were prophesied of came upon the
          stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Manifold wisdom: so it is called. As manifold as mysterious:
          variety in the mystery, and mystery in every part of the variety. It
          was not one single act, but a variety of counsels met in it; a
          conjunction of excellent ends and excellent means. The glory of God,
          the salvation of man, the defeat of the apostate angels, the discovery
          of the blessed Trinity in their nature, operations, their combined and
          distinct acts and expressions of goodness. The means are the
          conjunction of two natures, infinitely distinct from one another; the
          union of eternity and time, of mortality and immortality: death is
          made the way to life, and shame the path to glory. The weakness of the
          cross is the reparation of man, and the creature is made wise by the
          “foolishness of preaching;” fallen man grows rich by the poverty of
          the Redeemer, and man is filled by the emptiness of God; the heir of
          hell made a son of God, by God’s taking upon him the “form of a
          servant;” the son of man advanced to the highest degree of honor, by
          the Son of God becoming of “no reputation.” It is called (Eph. i. 8)
          “abundance of wisdom and prudence.” Wisdom, in the eternal counsel,
          contriving a way; prudence, in the temporary revelation, ordering all
          affairs and occurrences in the world for the attaining the end of his
          counsel. Wisdom refers to the mystery; prudence, to the manifestation
          of it in fit ways and convenient seasons. Wisdom, to the contrivance
          and order; prudence, to the execution and accomplishment. In all
          things God acted as became him, as a wise and just Governor of the
          world (Heb. ii. 10). Whether the wisdom of God might not have found
          out some other way, or whether he were, in regard of the necessity and
          naturalness of his justice, limited to this, is not the question; but
          that it is the best and wisest way for the manifestation of his glory,
          is out of question.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wisdom will appear in the different interests reconciled by it:
          in the subject, the second person in the Trinity, wherein they were
          reconciled: in the two natures, wherein he accomplished it; whereby
          God is made known to man in his glory, sin eternally condemned, and
          the repenting and believing sinner eternally rescued: the honor and
          righteousness of the law vindicated both in the precept and penalty:
          the devil’s empire overthrown by the same nature he had overturned,
          and the subtilty of hell defeated by that nature he had spoiled: the
          creature engaged in the very act to the highest obedience and
          humility, that, as God appears as a God upon his throne, the creature
          might appear in the lowest posture of a creature, in the depths of
          resignation and dependence: the publication of this made in the
          gospel, by ways congruous to the wisdom which appeared in the
          execution of his counsel, and the conditions of enjoying the fruit of
          it, most wise and reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The greatest different interests are reconciled, justice in
          punishing, and mercy in pardoning. For man had broken the law, and
          plunged himself into a gulf of misery: the sword of vengeance was
          unsheathed by justice, for the punishment of the criminal; the bowels
          of compassion were stirred by mercy, for the rescue of the miserable.
          Justice severely beholds the sin, and mercy compassionately reflects
          upon the misery. Two different claims are entered by those concerned
          attributes: justice votes for destruction, and mercy votes for
          salvation. Justice would draw the sword, and drench it in the blood of
          the offender; mercy would stop the sword, and turn it from the breast
          of the sinner. Justice would edge it, and mercy would blunt it. The
          arguments are strong on both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Justice pleads. I arraign, before thy tribunal, a rebel, who was
          the glorious work of thy hands, the centre of thy rich goodness, and a
          counterpart of thy own image; he is indeed miserable, whereby to
          excite thy compassion; but he is not miserable, without being
          criminal. Thou didst create him in a state, and with ability to be
          otherwise: the riches of thy bounty aggravate the blackness of his
          crime. He is a rebel, not by necessity, but will. What constraint was
          there upon him to listen to the counsels of the enemy of God? What
          force could there be upon him, since it is without the compass of any
          creature to work upon, or constrain the will? Nothing of ignorance can
          excuse him; the law was not ambiguously expressed, but in plain words,
          both as to precept and penalty; it was writ in his nature in legible
          characters: had he received any disgust from thee after his creation,
          it would not excuse his apostasy, since, as a Sovereign, thou wert not
          obliged to thy creature. Thou hadst provided all things richly for
          him; he was crowned with glory and honor: thy infinite power had
          bestowed upon him an habitation richly furnished, and varieties of
          servants to attend him. Whatever he viewed without, and whatever he
          viewed within himself, were several marks of thy Divine bounty, to
          engage him to obedience: had there been some reason of any disgust, it
          could not have balanced that kindness which had so much reason to
          oblige him: however, he had received no courtesy from the fallen
          angel, to oblige him to turn into his camp. Was it not enough, that
          one of thy creatures would have stripped thee of the glory of heaven,
          but this also must deprive thee of thy glory upon earth, which was due
          from him to thee as his Creator? Can he charge the difficulty of the
          command? No: it was rather below, than above his strength. He might
          rather complain that it was no higher, whereby his obedience and
          gratitude might have a larger scope, and a more spacious field to move
          in than a precept so light; so easy, as to abstain from one fruit in
          the garden. What excuse can he have, that would prefer the
          liquorishness of his sense before the dictates of his reason, and the
          obligations of his creation? The law thou didst set him was righteous
          and reasonable; and shall righteousness and reason be rejected by the
          supreme and infallible reason, because the rebellious creature hath
          trampled upon it? What! must God abrogate his holy law, because the
          creature hath slighted it? What reflection will this be upon the
          wisdom that enacted it, and upon the equity of the command and
          sanction of it? Either man must suffer, or the holy law be expunged,
          and forever out of date. And is it not better man should eternally
          smart under his crime, than any dishonorable reflections of
          unrighteousness be cast upon the law, and of folly, and want of
          foresight upon the Lawgiver? Not to punish, would be to approve the
          devil’s lie, and justify the creature’s revolt. It would be a
          condemnation of thy own law as unrighteous, and a sentencing thy own
          wisdom as imprudent. Better man should forever bear the punishment of
          his offence, than God bear the dishonor of his attributes: better man
          should be miserable than God should be unrighteous, unwise, false, and
          tamely bear the denial of his sovereignty. But what advantage would it
          be to gratify mercy by pardoning the malefactor? Besides the
          irreparable dishonor to the law, the falsifying thy veracity in not
          executing the denounced threatenings, he would receive encouragement
          by such a grace to spurn more at thy sovereignty, and oppose thy
          holiness by running on in a course of sin with hopes of impunity. If
          the creature be restored, it cannot be expected that he that hath
          fared so well, after the breach of it, should be very careful of a
          future observance: his easy readmission would abet him in the
          repetition of his offence, and thou shalt soon find him cast off all
          moral dependence on thee. Shall he be restored without any condition,
          or covenant? He is a creature not to be governed without a law, and a
          law is not to be enacted without a penalty. What future regard will he
          have to thy precept, or what fear will he have of thy threatening, if
          his crime be so lightly past over? Is it the stability of thy word?
          What reason will he have to give credit to that, which he hath found
          already disregarded by thyself? Thy truth in future threatenings will
          be of no force with him, who hath experienced thy laying it aside in
          the former. It is necessary, therefore, that the rebellious creature
          should be punished for the preservation of the honor of the law, and
          the honor of the Lawgiver, with all those perfections that are united
          in the composure of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Mercy doth not want a plea. It is true, indeed, the sin of man
          wants not its aggravations: he hath slighted thy goodness, and
          accepted thy enemy as his counsellor; but it was not a pure act of his
          own, as the devil’s revolt was: he had a tempter, and the devil had
          none: he had, I acknowledge, an understanding to know thy will, and a
          power to obey it; yet he was mutable, and had a capacity to fall. It
          was no difficult task that was set him, nor a hard yoke that was laid
          upon him; yet he had a brutish part, as well as a rational, and sense
          as well as soul; whereas the fallen angel was a pure intellectual
          spirit. Did God create the world to suffer an eternal dishonor, in
          letting himself be outwitted by Satan, and his work wrested out of his
          hands? Shall the work of eternal counsel presently sink into
          irreparable destruction, and the honor of an almighty and wise work be
          lost in the ruin of the creature? This would seem contrary to the
          nature of thy goodness, to make man only to render him miserable: to
          design him in his creation for the service of the devil, and not for
          the service of his Creator. What else could be the issue, if the chief
          work of thy hand, defaced presently after the erecting, should forever
          remain in this marred condition? What can be expected upon the
          continuance of his misery, but a perpetual hatred, and enmity of thy
          creature against thee? Did God in creation design his being hated, or
          his being loved by his creature? Shall God make a holy law, and have
          no obedience to that law from that creature whom it was made to
          govern? Shall the curious workmanship of God, and the excellent
          engravings of the law of nature in his heart, be so soon defaced, and
          remain in that blotted condition forever? This fall thou couldst not
          but in the treasures of thy infinite knowledge foresee. Why hadst thou
          goodness then to create him in an integrity, if thou wouldst not have
          mercy to pity him in misery? Shall thy enemy forever trample upon the
          honor of thy work, and triumph over the glory of God, and applaud
          himself in the success of his subtilty? Shall thy creature only
          passively glorify thee as an avenger, and not actively as a
          compassionater? Am not I a perfection of thy nature as well as
          justice? Shall justice engross all, and I never come into view? It is
          resolved already, that the fallen angels shall be no subjects for me
          to exercise myself upon; and I have now less reason than before to
          plead for them: they fell with a full consent of will, without any
          motion from another; and not content with their own apostasy they envy
          thee, and thy glory upon earth, as well as in heaven, and have drawn
          into their party the best part of the creation below. Shall Satan
          plunge the whole creation in the same irreparable ruin with himself?
          If the creature be restored, will he contract a boldness in sin by
          impurity? Hast thou not a grace to render him ingenuous in obedience,
          as well as a compassion to recover him from misery? What will hinder,
          but that such a grace, which hath established the standing angels, may
          establish this recovered creature? If I am utterly excluded from
          exercising myself on men, as I have been from devils, a whole species
          is lost; nay, I can never expect to appear upon the stage: if thou
          wilt quite ruin him by justice, and create another world, and another
          man, if he stand, thy bounty will be eminent, yet there is no room for
          mercy to act, unless by the commission of sin, he exposeth himself to
          misery; and if sin enter into another world, I have little hopes to be
          heard then, if I am rejected now. Worlds will be perpetually created
          by goodness, wisdom, and power; sin entering into these worlds, will
          be perpetually punished by justice; and mercy, which is a perfection
          of thy nature, will forever be commanded silence, and lie wrapt up in
          an eternal darkness. Take occasion now, therefore, to expose me to the
          knowledge of thy creature, since without misery, mercy can never set
          foot into the world. Mercy pleads, if man be ruined, the creation is
          in vain; justice pleads, if man be not sentenced, the law is in vain;
          truth backs justice, and grace abets mercy. What shall be done in this
          seeming contradiction? Mercy is not manifested, if man be not
          pardoned; justice will complain, if man be not punished.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) An expedient is found out, by the wisdom of God, to answer these
          demands, and adjust the differences between them. The wisdom of God
          answers, I will satisfy your pleas. The pleas of justice shall be
          satisfied in punishing, and the pleas of mercy shall be received in
          pardoning. Justice shall not complain for want of punishment, nor
          mercy for want of compassion. I will have an infinite sacrifice to
          content justice; and the virtue and fruit of that sacrifice shall
          delight mercy. Here shall justice have punishment to accept, and mercy
          shall have pardon to bestow. The rights of both are preserved, and the
          demands of both amicably accorded in punishment and pardon, by
          transferring the punishment of our crimes upon a surety, exacting a
          recompense from his blood by justice, and conferring life and
          salvation upon us by mercy without the expense of one drop of our own.
          Thus is justice satisfied in its severities, and mercy in its
          indulgences. The riches of grace are twisted with the terrors of
          wrath. The bowels of mercy are wound about the flaming sword of
          justice, and the sword of justice protects and secures the bowels of
          mercy. Thus is God righteous without being cruel, and merciful without
          being unjust; his righteousness inviolable, and the world recoverable.
          Thus is a resplendent mercy brought forth in the midst of all the
          curses, confusions, and wrath threatened to the offender. This is the
          admirable temperament found out by the wisdom of God: his justice is
          honored in the sufferings of man’s surety; and his mercy is honored in
          the application of the propitiation to the offender (Rom. iii. 24,
          25): “Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that
          is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
          through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
          remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.” Had
          we in our persons been sacrifices to justice, mercy had forever been
          unknown; had we been solely fostered by mercy, justice had forever
          been secluded; had we, being guilty, been absolved, mercy might have
          rejoiced, and justice might have complained; had we been solely
          punished, justice would have triumphed, and mercy grieved. But by this
          medium of redemption, neither hath ground of complaint; justice hath
          nothing to charge, when the punishment is inflicted; mercy hath
          whereof to boast when the surety is accepted. The debt of the sinner
          is transferred upon the surety, that the merit of the surety may be
          conferred upon the sinner; so that God now deals with our sins in a
          way of consuming justice, and with our persons in a way of relieving
          mercy. It is highly better, and more glorious, than if the claim of
          one had been granted, with the exclusion of the demand of the other;
          it had then been either an unrighteous mercy, or a merciless justice;
          it is now a righteous mercy, and a merciful justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The wisdom of God appears in the subject or person wherein these
          were accorded; the Second Person is the blessed Trinity. There was a
          congruity in the Son’s undertaking and effecting it rather than any
          other person, according to the order of the persons, and the several
          functions of the persons, as represented in Scripture. The Father,
          after creation, is the lawgiver, and presents man with the image of
          his own holiness and the way to his creatures’ happiness; but after
          the fall, man was too impotent to perform the law, and too polluted to
          enjoy a felicity. Redemption was then necessary; not that it was
          necessary for God to redeem man, but it was necessary for man’s
          happiness that he should be recovered. To this the Second Person is
          appointed, that by communion with him, man might derive a happiness,
          and be brought again to God. But since man was blind in his
          understanding, and an enemy in his will to God, there must be the
          exerting of a virtue to enlighten his mind, and bend his will to
          understand, and accept of this redemption; and this work is assigned
          to the Third Person, the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It was not congruous that the Father should assume human nature,
          and suffer in it for the redemption of man. He was first in order; he
          was the lawgiver, and therefore to be the judge. As lawgiver, it was
          not convenient he should stand in the stead of the law‑breaker; and as
          judge, it was as little convenient he should be reputed a malefactor.
          That he who had made a law against sin denounced a penalty upon the
          commission of sin, and whose part it was actually to punish the
          sinner, should become sin for the wilful transgressor of his law. He
          being the rector, how could he be an advocate and intercessor to
          himself? How could he be the judge and the sacrifice? a judge, and yet
          a mediator to himself? If he had been the sacrifice, there must be
          some person to examine the validity of it, and pronounce the sentence
          of acceptance. Was it agreeable that the Son should sit upon a throne
          of judgment, and the Father stand at the bar, and be responsible to
          the Son? That the Son should be in the place of a governor, and the
          Father in the place of the criminal? That the Father should be bruised
          (Isa. liii. 10) by the Son, as the Son was by the Father (Zech. xiii.
          70)? that the Son should awaken a sword against the Father, as the
          Father did against the Son? That the Father should be sent by the Son,
          as the Son was by the Father (Gal. iv. 4)? The order of the persons in
          the blessed Trinity had been inverted and disturbed. Had the Father
          been sent, he had not been first in order; the sender is before the
          person sent: as the Father begets, and the son is begotten (John i.
          14), so the Father sends, and the son is sent. He whose orders is to
          send, cannot properly send himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Nor was it congruous that the Spirit should be sent upon this
          affair. If the Holy Ghost had been sent to redeem us, and the Son to
          apply that redemption to us, the order of the Persons had also been
          inverted; the Spirit, then, who was third in order, had been second in
          operation. The Son would then have received of the Spirit, as the
          Spirit doth now of Christ, “and shew it unto us” (John i. 15). As the
          Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son, so the proper function
          and operation of it was in order after the operations of the Father
          and the Son. Had the Spirit been sent to redeem us, and the Son sent
          by the Father, and the Spirit to apply that redemption to us, the Son
          in his acts had proceeded from the Father and the Spirit; the Spirit,
          as sender, had been in order before the Son; whereas, the Spirit is
          called “the Spirit of Christ,” as sent by Christ from the “Father”
          (Gal. iv. 6; John xv. 27). But as the order of the works, so the order
          of the Persons is preserved in their several operations. Creation, and
          a law to govern the creature, precedes redemption. Nothing, or that
          which hath no being, is not capable of a redeemed being. Redemption
          supposeth the existence and the misery of a person redeemed. As
          creation precedes redemption, so redemption precedes the application
          of it. As redemption supposeth the being of the creature, so
          application of redemption supposeth the efficacy of redemption.
          According to the order of these works, is the order of the operations
          of the Three Persons. Creation belongs to the Father, the first
          person; redemption, the second work, is the function of the Son, the
          second person; application, the third work, is the office of the Holy
          Ghost, the third person. The Father orders it, the Son acts it, the
          Holy Ghost applies it. He purifies our souls to understand, believe,
          and love these mysteries. He forms Christ in the womb of the soul, as
          he did the body of Christ in the womb of the Virgin. As the Spirit of
          God moved upon the waters, to garnish and adorn the world, after the
          matter of it was formed (Gen. i. 2), so he moves upon the heart, to
          supple it to a compliance with Christ, and draws the lineaments of the
          new creation in the soul, after the foundation is laid. The Son pays
          the price that was due from us to God, and the Spirit is the earnest
          of the promises of life and glory purchased by the merit of that
          death.792 It is to be observed, that the Father, under the
          dispensation of the law, proposed the commands, with the promises and
          threatenings, to the understandings of men; and Christ, under the
          dispensation of grace, when he was upon the earth, proposeth the
          gospel as the means of salvation, exhorts to faith as the condition of
          salvation; but it was neither the functions of the one or the other to
          display such an efficacy in the understanding and will to make men
          believe and obey; and, therefore, there were such few conversions in
          the time of Christ, by his miracles. But this work was reserved for
          the fuller and brighter appearance of the Spirit, whose office it was
          to convince the world of the necessity of a Redeemer, because of their
          lost condition; of the person of the Redeemer, the Son of God; of the
          sufficiency and efficacy of redemption, because of his righteousness
          and acceptation by the Father. The wisdom of God is seen in preparing
          and presenting the objects, and then in making impression of them upon
          the subject he intends. And thus is the order of the Three Persons
          preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The Second Person had the greatest congruity in this work. He by
          whom God created the world was most conveniently employed in restoring
          the defaced world (John i. 4): who more fit to recover it from its
          lapsed state than he that had erected it in its primitive state (Heb.
          i. 2)? He was the light of men in creation, and therefore it was most
          reasonable he should be the light of men in redemption. Who fitter to
          reform the Divine image than he that first formed it? Who fitter to
          speak for us to God than he who was the Word (John i. 1)? Who could
          better intercede with the Father than he who was the only begotten and
          beloved Son? Who so fit to redeem the forfeited inheritance as the
          Heir of all things? Who fitter and better to prevail for us to have
          the right of children than he that possessed it by nature? We fell
          from being the sons of God, and who fitter to introduce us into an
          adopted state than the Son of God? Herein was an expression of the
          richer grace, because the first sin was immediately against the wisdom
          of God, by an ambitious affectation of a wisdom equal to God, that
          that person, who was the wisdom of God, should be made a sacrifice for
          the expiation of the sin against wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The wisdom of God is seen in the two natures of Christ, whereby
          this redemption was accomplished. The union of the two natures was the
          foundation of the union of God and the fallen creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The union itself is admirable: “The Word is made flesh” (John i.
          14), one “equal with God in the form of a servant” (Phil. ii. 7). When
          the apostle speaks of “God manifested in the flesh,” he speaks “the
          wisdom of God in a mystery” (1 Tim. iii. 16); that which is
          incomprehensible to the angels, which they never imagined before it
          was revealed, which perhaps they never knew till they beheld it. I am
          sure, under the law, the figures of the cherubims were placed in the
          sanctuary, with their “faces looking towards the propitiatory,” in a
          perpetual posture of contemplation and admiration (Exod. xxxvii. 9),
          to which the apostle alludes (1 Pet. i. 12). Mysterious is the wisdom
          of God to unite finite and infinite, almightiness and weakness,
          immortality and mortality, immutability, with a thing subject to
          change; to have a nature from eternity, and yet a nature subject to
          the revolutions of time; a nature to make a law, and a nature to be
          subjected to the law; to be God blessed forever, in the bosom of his
          Father, and an infant exposed to calamities from the womb of his
          mother: terms seeming most distant from union, most uncapable of
          conjunction, to shake hands together, to be most intimately conjoined;
          glory and vileness, fulness and emptiness, heaven and earth; the
          creature with the Creator; he that made all things, in one person with
          a nature that is made; Immanuel, God, and man in one; that which is
          most spiritual to partake of that which is carnal flesh and blood
          (Heb. ii. 14); one with the Father in his Godhead, one with us in his
          manhood; the Godhead to be in him in the fullest perfection, and the
          manhood in the greatest purity; the creature one with the Creator, and
          the Creator one with the creature. Thus is the incomprehensible wisdom
          of God declared in the “Word being made flesh.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. In the manner of this union. A union of two natures, yet no
          natural union. It transcends all the unions visible among
          creatures:793 it is not like the union of stones in a building, or two
          pieces of timber fastened together, which touch one another only in
          their superficies and outside, without any intimacy with one another.
          By such a kind of union God would not be a man: the Word could not so
          be made flesh. Nor is it a union of parts to the whole, as the members
          and the body; the members are parts, the body is the whole; for the
          whole results from the parts, and depends upon the parts: but Christ,
          being God, is independent upon anything. The parts are in order of
          nature before the whole, but nothing can be in order of nature before
          God. Nor is it as the union of two liquors, as when wine and water are
          mixed together, for they are so incorporated as not to be
          distinguished from one another; no man can tell which particle is
          wine, and which is water. But the properties of the Divine nature are
          distinguishable from the properties of the human. Nor is it as the
          union of the soul and body, so as that the Deity is the form of the
          humanity, as the soul is the form of the body: for as the soul is but
          a part of the man, so the Divinity would be then but a part of the
          humanity; and as a form, or the soul, is in a state of imperfection,
          without that which it is to inform, so the Divinity of Christ would
          have been imperfect till it had assumed the humanity, and so the
          perfection of an eternal Deity would have depended on a creature of
          time. This union of two natures in Christ is incomprehensible: and it
          is a mystery we cannot arrive to the top of, how the Divine nature,
          which is the same with that of the Father and the Holy Ghost, should
          be united to the human nature, without its being said that the Father
          and the Holy Ghost were united to the flesh; but the Scripture doth
          not encourage any such notion; it speaks only of the Word, the person
          of the Word being made flesh, and in his being made flesh,
          distinguisheth him from the Father, as “the only begotten of the
          Father” (John i. 14). The person of the Son was the term of this
          union.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) This union doth not confound the properties of the Deity and
          those of the humanity. They remain distinct and entire in each other.
          The Deity is not changed into flesh, nor the flesh transformed into
          God: they are distinct, and yet united; they are conjoined, and yet
          unmixed: the dues of either nature are preserved. It is impossible
          that the majesty of the Divinity can receive an alteration. It is as
          impossible that the meanness of the humanity can receive the
          impressions of the Deity, so as to be changed into it, and a creature
          be metamorphosed into the Creator, and temporary flesh become eternal,
          and finite mount up into infinity: as the soul and body are united,
          and make one person, yet the soul is not changed into the perfections
          of the body, nor the body into the perfections of the soul. There is a
          change made in the humanity, by being advanced to a more excellent
          union, but not in the Deity, as a change is made in the air, when it
          is enlightened by the sun, not in the sun, which communicates that
          brightness to the air. Athanasius makes the burning bush to be a type
          of Christ’s incarnation (Exod. iii. 2): the fire signifying the Divine
          nature, and the bush the human. The bush is a branch springing up from
          the earth, and the fire descends from heaven; as the bush was united
          to the fire, yet was not hurt by the flame, nor converted into fire,
          there remained a difference between the bush and the fire, yet the
          properties of the fire shined in the bush, so that the whole bush
          seemed to be on fire. So in the incarnation of Christ, the human
          nature is not swallowed up by the Divine, nor changed into it, nor
          confounded with it, but so united, that the properties of both remain
          firm: two are so become one, that they remain two still: one person in
          two natures, containing the glorious perfections of the Divine, and
          the weaknesses of the human. The “fulness of the Deity dwells bodily
          in Christ” (Col. ii. 9).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The Divine nature is united to every part of the humanity. The
          whole Divinity to the whole humanity; so that no part but may be said
          to be the member of God, as well as the blood is said to be the “blood
          of God” (Acts xx. 28). By the same reason, it may be said, the hand of
          God, the eye of God, the arm of God. As God is infinitely present
          everywhere, so as to be excluded from no place, so is the Deity
          hypostatically everywhere in the humanity, not excluded from any part
          of it; as the light of the sun in every part of the air; as a
          sparkling splendor in every part of the diamond. Therefore, it is
          concluded, by all that acknowledge the Deity of Christ, that when his
          soul was separated from the body, the Deity remained united both to
          soul and body, as light doth in every part of a broken crystal.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Therefore, perpetually united (Col. ii. 9). The “fulness of the
          Godhead dwells in him bodily.” It dwells in him, not lodges in him, as
          a traveller in an inn: it resides in him as a fixed habitation. As God
          describes the perpetuity of his presence in the ark by his habitation
          or dwelling in it (Exod. xxix. 44), so doth the apostle the
          inseparable duration of the Deity in the humanity, and the
          indissoluble union of the humanity with the Deity. It was united on
          earth; it remains united in heaven. It was not an image or an
          apparition, as the tongues wherein the Spirit came upon the apostles,
          were a temporary representation, not a thing united perpetually to the
          person of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It was a personal union. It was not an union of persons, though
          it was a personal union; so Davenant expounds (Col. ii. 9), Christ did
          not take the person of man, but the nature of man into subsistence
          with himself. The body and soul of Christ were not united in
          themselves, had no subsistence in themselves, till they were united to
          the person of the Son of God. If the person of a man were united to
          him, the human nature would have been the nature of the person so
          united to him, and not the nature of the Son of God (Heb. ii. 14, 16),
          “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
          also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
          might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. For
          verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the
          seed of Abraham.” He took flesh and blood to be his own nature,
          perpetually to subsist in the person of the Λόγος, which must be by a
          personal union, or no way: the Deity united to the humanity, and both
          natures to be one person. This is the mysterious and manifold wisdom
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>3d. The end of this union.</p>
        <p>
          (1.) He was hereby fitted to be a Mediator. He hath something like to
          man, and something like to God. If he were in all things only like to
          man, he would be at a distance from God: if he were in all things only
          like to God, he would be at a distance from man. He is a true Mediator
          between mortal sinners and the immortal righteous One. He was near to
          us by the infirmities of our nature, and near to God by the
          perfections of the Divine; as near to God in his nature, as to us in
          ours; as near to us in our nature, as he is to God in the Divine.
          Nothing that belongs to the Deity, but he possesses; nothing that
          belongs to the human nature, but he is clothed with. He had both the
          nature which had offended, and that nature which was offended: a
          nature to please God, and a nature to pleasure us: a nature, whereby
          he experimentally knew the excellency of God, which was injured, and
          understood the glory due to him, and consequently the greatness of the
          offence, which was to be measured by the dignity of his person: and a
          nature whereby he might be sensible of the miseries contracted by, and
          endure the calamities due to the offender, that he might both have
          compassion on him, and make due satisfaction for him. He had two
          distinct natures capable of the affections and sentiments of the two
          persons he was to accord; he was a just judge of the rights of the
          one, and the demerit of the other.794 He could not have this full and
          perfect understanding if he did not possess the perfections of the
          one, and the qualities of the other; the one fitted him for “things
          appertaining to God” (Heb. v. 1), and the other furnished him with a
          sense of the “infirmities of man” (Heb. iv. 15).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He was hereby fitted for the working out the happiness of man. A
          Divine nature to communicate to man, and a human nature to carry up to
          God. [1.] He had a nature whereby to suffer for us, and a nature
          whereby to be meritorious in those sufferings. A nature to make him
          capable to bear the penalty, and a nature to make his sufferings
          sufficient for all that embraced him. A nature, capable to be exposed
          to the flames of Divine wrath, and another nature, incapable to be
          crushed by the weight, or consumed by the heat of it: a human nature
          to suffer, and stand a sacrifice in the stead of man; a Divine nature
          to sanctify these sufferings, and fill the nostrils of God with a
          sweet savor, and thereby atone his wrath: the one to bear the stroke
          due to us, and the other to add merit to his sufferings for us. Had he
          not been man, he could not have filled our place in suffering; and
          could he otherwise have suffered, his sufferings had not been
          applicable to us; and had he not been God, his sufferings had not been
          meritoriously and fruitfully applicable. Had not his blood been the
          blood of God, it had been of as little advantage as the blood of an
          ordinary man, or the blood of the legal sacrifices (Heb. ix. 12).
          Nothing less than God could have satisfied God for the injury done by
          man. Nothing less than God could have countervailed the torments due
          to the offending creature. Nothing less than God could have rescued us
          out of the hands of the jailor, too powerful for us. [2.] He had,
          therefore, a nature to be compassionate to us, and victorious for us.
          A nature sensibly to compassionate us, and another nature, to render
          those compassions effectual for our relief; he had the compassions of
          our nature to pity us, and the patience of the Divine nature to bear
          with us. He hath the affections of a man to us, and the power of a God
          for us: a nature to disarm the devil for us, and another nature to be
          insensible of the working of the devil in us, and against us. If he
          had been only God, he would not have had an experimental sense of our
          misery; and if he had been only man, he could not have vanquished our
          enemies; had he been only God, he could not have died; and had he been
          only man, he could not have conquered death. [3.] A nature
          efficaciously to instruct us. As man, he was to instruct us sensibly;
          as God, he was to instruct us infallibly. A nature, whereby he might
          converse with us, and a nature, whereby he might influence us in those
          converses. A human mouth to minister instruction to man, and a Divine
          power to imprint it with efficacy. [4.] A nature to be a pattern to
          us. A pattern of grace as man, as Adam was to have been to his
          posterity:795 a Divine nature shining in the human, the image of the
          invisible God in the glass of our flesh, that he might be a perfect
          copy for our imitation (Col. i. 15), “The image of the invisible God,
          and the first‑born of every creature” in conjunction. The virtues of
          the Deity are sweetened and tempered by the union with the humanity,
          as the beams of the son are by shining through a colored glass, which
          condescends more to the weakness of our eye. Thus the perfections of
          the invisible God, breaking through the first‑born of every creature,
          glittering in Christ’s created state, became more sensible for
          contemplation by our mind, and more imitiable for conformity in our
          practice. [5.] A nature to be a ground of confidence in our approach
          to God. A nature wherein we may behold him, and wherein we may
          approach to him. A nature for our comfort, and a nature for our
          confidence. Had he been only man, he had been too feeble to assure us;
          and had he been only God, he had been too high to attract us: but now
          we are allured by his human nature, and assured by his Divine, in our
          drawing near to heaven. Communion with God was desired by us, but our
          guilt stifled our hopes, and the infinite excellency of the Divine
          nature would have damped our hopes of speeding; but since these two
          natures, so far distant, are met in a marriage‑knot, we have a ground
          of hope, nay, an earnest, that the Creator and believing creature
          shall meet and converse together. And since our sins are expatiated by
          the death of the human nature in conjunction with the Divine, our
          guilt, upon believing, shall not hinder us from this comfortable
          approach. Had he been only man, he could not have assured us an
          approach to God: had he been only God, his justice would not have
          admitted us to approach to him; he had been too terrible for guilty
          persons, and too holy for polluted persons to come near to him: but by
          being made man, his justice is tempered, and by his being God and man,
          his mercy is ensured. A human nature he had, one with us, that we
          might be related to God, as one with him. [6.] A nature to derive all
          good to us. Had he not been man, we had had no share or part in him: a
          satisfaction by him had not been imputed to us. If he were not God, he
          could not communicate to us divine graces and eternal happiness; he
          could not have had power to convey so great a good to us, had he been
          only man; and he could not have done it, according to the rule of
          inflexible righteousness, had he been only God. As man, he is the way
          of conveyance; as God, he is the spring of conveyance. From this grace
          of union, and the grace of unction, we find rivers of waters flowing
          to make glad the city of God. Believers are his branches, and draw sap
          from him, as he is their root in his human nature, and have an endless
          duration of it from his Divine. Had he not been man, he had not been
          in a state to obey the law; had he not been God as well as man, his
          obedience could not have been valuable to be imputed to us. How should
          this mystery be studied by us, which would afford us both admiration
          and content! Admiration, in the incomprehensibleness of it;
          contentment, in the fitness of the Mediator. By this wisdom of God we
          receive the props of our faith, and the fruits of joy and peace.
          Wisdom consists in choosing fit means, and conducting them in such a
          method, as may reach with good success the variety of marks which are
          aimed at. Thus hath the wisdom of God set forth a Mediator, suited to
          our wants, fitted for our supplies, and ordered so the whole affair by
          the union of these two natures in the person of the Redeemer, that
          there could be no disappointment, by all the bustle hell and hellish
          instruments could raise against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The wisdom of God is seen in this way of redemption, in vindicating
          the honor and righteousness of the law, both as to precept and
          penalty. The first and irreversible design of the law was obedience.
          The penalty of the law had only entrance upon transgression. Obedience
          was the design, and the penalty was added to enforce the observance of
          the precept (Gen. ii. 17): “Thou shalt not eat;” there is the precept:
          “In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die;” there is the penalty.
          Obedience was our debt to the law, as creatures; punishment was due
          from the law to us, as sinners: we are bound to endure the penalty for
          our first transgression, but the penalty did not cancel the bond of
          future obedience; the penalty had not been incurred without
          transgressing the precept; yet the precept was not abrogated by
          enduring the penalty. Since man so soon revolted, and by this revolt
          fell under the threatening, the justice of the law had been honored by
          man’s sufferings, but the holiness and equity of the law had been
          honored by man’s obedience. The wisdom of God finds out a medium to
          satisfy both: the justice of the law is preserved in the execution of
          the penalty; and the holiness of the law is honored in the observance
          of the precept. The life of our Saviour is a conformity to the
          precept, and his death is a conformity to the penalty; the precepts
          are exactly performed, and the curse punctually executed, by a
          voluntary observing the one, and a voluntary undergoing the other. It
          is obeyed, as if it had not been transgressed, and executed as if it
          had not been obeyed. It became the wisdom, justice, and holiness of
          God, as the Rector of the world, to exact it (Heb. ii. 10), and it
          became the holiness of the Mediator to “fulfil all the righteousness
          of the law” (Rom. viii. 3; Matt. iii. 15). And thus the honor of the
          law was vindicated in all the parts of it. The transgression of the
          law was condemned in the flesh of the Redeemer, and the righteousness
          of the law was fulfilled in his person: and both these acts of
          obedience, being counted as one righteousness, and imputed to the
          believing sinner, render him a subject to the law, both in its
          perceptive and minatory part. By Adam’s sinful acting we were made
          sinners, and by Christ’s righteous acting we are made righteous (Rom.
          v. 19): “As by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by
          the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” The law was obeyed
          by him, that the righteousness of it might be fulfilled in us (Rom.
          viii. 4). It is not fulfilled in us, or in our actions, by inherency,
          but fulfilled in us by imputation of that righteousness which was
          exactly fulfilled by another. As he died for us, and rose again for
          us, so he lived for us. The commands of the law were as well observed
          for us, as the threatenings of the law were endured for us. This
          justification of a sinner, with the preservation of the holiness of
          the law in truth, in the inward parts, in sincerity of intention, as
          well as conformity in action, is the wisdom of God, the gospel wisdom
          which David desires to know (Ps. li. 6): “Thou desirest truth in the
          inward parts, and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know
          wisdom;” or, as some render it, “the hidden things of wisdom.” Not an
          inherent wisdom in the acknowledgments of his sin, which he had
          confessed before, but the wisdom of God in providing a medicine, so as
          to keep up the holiness of the law in the observance of it in truth,
          and the averting the judgment due to the sinner. In and by this way
          methodized by the wisdom of God, all doubts and troubles are
          discharged. Naturally, if we take a view of the law to behold its
          holiness and justice, and then of our hearts, to see the contrariety
          in them to the command, and the pollution repugnant to its holiness;
          and after this, cast our eyes upward, and beholding a flaming sword,
          edged with curses and wrath; is there any matter, but that of terror,
          afforded by any of these? But when we behold, in the life of Christ, a
          conformity to the mandatory part of the law, and in the cross of
          Christ, a sustaining the minatory part of the law, this wisdom of God
          gives a well‑grounded and rational dismiss to all the horrors that can
          seize upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The wisdom of God in redemption is visible in manifesting two
          contrary affections at the same time, and in one act: the greatest
          hatred of sin, and the greatest love to the sinner. In this way he
          punishes the sin without ruining the sinner, and repairs the ruins of
          the sinner without indulging the sin. Here is eternal love and eternal
          hatred; a condemning the sin to what it merited, and an advancing the
          sinner to what he could not expect. Herein is the choicest love and
          the deepest hatred manifested: an implacableness against the sin, and
          a placableness to the sinner. His hatred of sin hath been discovered
          in other ways: in punishing the devil without remedy; sentencing man
          to an expulsion from paradise, though seduced by another; in accursing
          the serpent, an irrational creature, though but a misguided
          instrument. The whole tenor of his threatenings declare his loathing
          of sin, and the sprinklings of his judgments in the world, and the
          horrible expectations of terrified consciences confirm it. But what
          are all these testimonies to the highest evidence that can possibly be
          given in the sheathing the sword of his wrath in the heart of his Son?
          If a father should order his son to take a mean garb below his
          dignity, order him to be dragged to prison, seem to throw off all
          affection of a father for the severity of a judge, condemn his son to
          a horrible death, be a spectator of his bleeding condition, withhold
          his hand from assuaging his misery, regard it rather with joy than
          sorrow, give him a bitter cup to drink, and stand by to see him drink
          it off to the bottom, dregs and all, and flash frowns in his face all
          the while; and this not for any fault of his own, but the rebellion of
          some subjects he undertook for, and that the offenders might have a
          pardon sealed by the blood of the son, the sufferer: all this would
          evidence his detestation of the rebellion, and his affection to the
          rebels; his hatred to their crime, and his love to their welfare. This
          did God do. He “delivered Christ up for our offences” (Rom. viii. 32);
          the Father gave him the cup (John xviii. 18); the Lord bruised him
          with pleasure (Isa. liii. 10), and that for sin. He transferred upon
          the shoulders of his Son the pain we had merited, that the criminal
          might be restored to the place he had forfeited. He hates the sin so
          as to condemn it forever, and wrap it up in the curse he had
          threatened; and loves the sinner, believing and repenting, so as to
          mount him to an expectation of a happiness exceeding the first estate,
          both in glory and perpetuity. Instead of an earthly paradise, lays the
          foundation of an heavenly mansion, brings forth a weight of glory from
          a weight of misery, separates the comfortable light of the sun from
          the scorching heat we had deserved at his hands. Thus hath God’s
          hatred of sin been manifested. He is at eternal defiance with sin, yet
          nearer in alliance with the sinner than he was before the revolt; as
          if man’s miserable fall had endeared him to the Judge. This is the
          wisdom and prudence of “grace wherein God hath abounded” (Eph. i. 9):
          a wisdom in twisting the happy restoration of the broken amity, with
          an everlasting curse upon that which made the breach, both upon sin
          the cause, and upon Satan the seducer to it. Thus is hatred and love,
          in their highest glory, manifested together: hatred to sin, in the
          death of Christ, more than if the torments of hell had been undergone
          by the sinner; and love to the sinner, more than if he had, by an
          absolute and simple bounty, bestowed upon him the possession of
          heaven; because the gift of his Son, for such an end, is a greater
          token of his boundless affections, than a re‑instating man in
          paradise. Thus is the wisdom of God seen in redemption, consuming the
          sin, and recovering the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The wisdom of God is evident in overturning the devil’s empire by
          the nature he had vanquished, and by ways quite contrary to what that
          malicious spirit could imagine. The devil, indeed, read his own doom
          in the first promise, and found his ruin resolved upon, by the means
          of the “Seed of the woman;” but by what seed was not so easily known
          to him.796 And the methods whereby it was to be brought about was a
          mystery kept secret from the malicious devils, since it was not
          discovered to the obedient angels. He might know, from Isa. liii.,
          that the Redeemer was assured to divide the spoil with the strong, and
          rescue a part of the lost creation out of his hands; and that this was
          to be effected by making his soul an offering for sin: but could he
          imagine which way his soul was to be made such an offering? He
          shrewdly suspected Christ, just after his inauguration into his office
          by baptism, to be the Son of God: but did he ever dream that the
          Messiah, by dying as a reputed malefactor, should be a sacrifice for
          the expiation of the sin the devil had introduced by his subtilty? Did
          he ever imagine a cross should dispossess him of his crown, and that
          dying groans should wrest the victory out of his hands? He was
          conquered by that nature he had cast headlong into ruin: a woman, by
          his subtilty, was the occasion of our death; and a woman, by the
          conduct of the only wise God, brings forth the Author of our life, and
          the Conqueror of our enemies. The flesh of the old Adam had infected
          us, and the flesh of the new Adam cures us (1 Cor. xv. 21): “By man
          came death; by man also came the resurrection from the dead.” We are
          killed by the old Adam, and raised by the new; as among the
          Israelites, a fiery serpent gave the wound, and a brazen serpent
          administers the cure. The nature that was deceived bruiseth the
          deceiver, and raiseth up the foundations of his kingdom. Satan is
          defeated by the counsels he took to secure his possession, and loses
          the victory by the same means whereby he thought to preserve it. His
          tempting the Jews to the sin of crucifying the Son of God, had a
          contrary success to his tempting Adam to eat of the tree. The first
          death he brought upon Adam, ruined us, and the death he brought by his
          instruments upon the second Adam, restored us. By a tree, if one may
          so say, he had triumphed over the world, and by the fruit of a tree,
          one hanging upon a tree, he is discharged of his power over us (Heb.
          ii. 14): “Through death he destroyed Him that had the power of death.”
          And thus the devil ruins his own kingdom while he thinks to confirm
          and enlarge it; and is defeated by his own policy, whereby he thought
          to continue the world under his chains, and deprive the Creator of the
          world of his purposed honor. What deeper counsel could he resolve upon
          for his own security, than to be instrumental in the death of him, who
          was God, the terror of the devil himself, and to bring the Redeemer of
          the world to expire with disgrace in the sight of a multitude of men?
          Thus did the wisdom of God shine forth in restoring us by methods
          seemingly repugnant to the end he aimed at, and above the suspicion of
          a subtle devil, whom he intended to baffle. Could he imagine that we
          should be healed by stripes, quickened by death, purified by blood,
          crowned by a cross, advanced to the highest honor by the lowest
          humility, comforted by sorrows, glorified by disgrace, absolved by
          condemnation, and made rich by poverty? That the sweetest honey should
          at once spring out of the belly of a dead lion, the lion of the tribe
          of Judah, and out of the bosom of the living God? How wonderful is
          this wisdom of God! that the Seed of the woman, born of a mean virgin,
          brought forth in a stable, spending his days in affliction, misery,
          and poverty, without any pomp and splendor, passing some time in a
          carpenter’s shop, with carpenter’s tools (Mark vi. 6), and afterwards
          exposed to a horrible and disgraceful death, should, by this way, pull
          down the gates of hell, subvert the kingdom of the devil, and be the
          hammer to break in pieces that power, which he had so long exercised
          over the world! Thus became he the author of our life, by being bound
          for a while in the chains of death, and arrived to a principality over
          the most malicious powers, by being a prisoner for us, and the anvil
          of their rage and fury.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The wisdom of God appears, in giving us this way the surest ground
          of comfort, and the strongest incentive to obedience. The rebel is
          reconciled, and the rebellion shamed; God is propitiated, and the
          sinner sanctified, by the same blood. What can more contribute to our
          comfort and confidence, than God’s richest gift to us? What can more
          enflame our love to him, than our recovery from death by the oblation
          of his Son to misery and death for us? It doth as much engage our duty
          as secure our happiness. It presents God glorious and gracious, and
          therefore every way fit to be trusted in regard of the interest of his
          own glory in it, and in regard of the effusions of his grace by it. It
          renders the creature obliged in the highest manner, and so awakens his
          industry to the strictest and noblest obedience. Nothing so effectual
          as a crucified Christ to wean us from sin, and stifle all motions of
          despair; a means, in regard of the justice signalized in it, to make
          man to hate the sin which had ruined him; and a means, in regard of
          the love expressed to make him delight in that law he had violated (2
          Cor. v. 14, 15). The love of Christ, and therefore the love of God
          expressed in it, constrains us no longer to live to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is a ground of the highest comfort and confidence in God.
          Since he hath given such an evidence of his impartial truth to his
          threatening for the honor of his justice, we need not question but he
          will be as punctual to his promise for the honor of his mercy. It is a
          ground of confidence in God, since he hath redeemed us in such a way
          as glorifies the steadiness of his veracity, as well as the severity
          of his justice; we may well trust him for the performance of his
          promise, since we have experience of the execution of his threatening;
          his merciful truth will as much engage him to accomplish the one, as
          his just truth did to inflict the other. The goodness which shone
          forth in weaker rays in the creation, breaks out with stronger beams
          in redemption. And the mercy which before the appearance of Christ was
          manifested in some small rivulets, diffuseth itself like a boundless
          ocean. That God, that was our Creator, is our Redeemer, the repairer
          of our breaches, and the restorer of our paths to dwell in. And the
          plenteous redemption from all iniquity, manifested in the incarnation
          and passion of the Son of God, is much more a ground of hope in the
          Lord than it was in past ages, when it could not be said, “The Lord
          hath, but the Lord shall, redeem Israel from all his iniquities” (Ps.
          cxxx. 8). It is a full warrant to cast ourselves into his arms.
        </p>
        <p>(2.) An incentive to obedience.</p>
        <p>
          [1.] The commands of the gospel require the obedience of the creature.
          There is not one precept in the gospel which interferes with any rule
          in the law, but strengthens it, and represents it in its true
          exactness: the heat to scorch us is allayed, but the light to direct
          us is not extinguished. Not the least allowance to any sin is granted;
          not the least affection to any sin is indulged. The law is tempered by
          the gospel, but not nulled and cast out of doors by it: it enacts that
          none but those that are sanctified, shall be glorified; that there
          must be grace here, if we expect glory hereafter; that we must not
          presume to expect an admittance to the vision of God’s face unless our
          souls be clothed with a robe of holiness (Heb. xii. 14). It requires
          an obedience to the whole law in our intention and purpose, and an
          endeavor to observe it in our actions; it promotes the honor of God,
          and ordains a universal charity among men; it reveals the whole
          counsel of God, and furnisheth men with the holiest laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] It presents to us the exactest pattern for our obedience. The
          redeeming person is not only a propitiation for the sin, but a pattern
          to the sinner (1 Pet. ii. 21). The conscience of man, after the fall
          of Adam, approved of the reason of the law, but by the corruption of
          nature man had no strength to perform the law. The possibility of
          keeping the law, by human nature, is evidenced by the appearance and
          life of the Redeemer, and an assurance given that it shall be advanced
          to such a state as to be able to observe it: we aspire to it in this
          life, and have hopes to attain it in a future; and, while we are here,
          the actor of our redemption is the copy for our imitation. The pattern
          to imitate is greater than the law to be ruled by. What a lustre did
          his virtues cast about the world! How attractive are his graces! With
          what high examples for all duties has he furnished us out of the copy
          of his life!
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] It presents us with the strongest motives to obedience (Tit. ii.
          11, 12): “The grace of God teaches us to deny ungodliness.” What
          chains bind us faster and closer than love? Here is love to our nature
          in his incarnation; love to us, though enemies, in his death and
          passion; encouragements to obedience by the proffers of pardon for
          former rebellions. By the disobedience of man, God introduceth his
          redeeming grace, and engageth his creature to more ingenuous and
          excellent returns than his innocent state could oblige him to. In his
          created state he had goodness to move him, he hath the same goodness
          now to oblige him as a creature, and a greater love and mercy to
          oblige him as a repaired creature; and the terror of justice is taken
          off, which might envenom his heart as a criminal. In his revolted
          state he had misery to discourage him; in his redeemed state he hath
          love to attract him. Without such a way, black despair had seized upon
          the creature exposed to a remediless misery, and God would have had no
          returns of love from the best of his earthly works; but if any sparks
          of ingenuity be left, they will be excited by the efficacy of this
          argument. The willingness of God to receive returning sinners, is
          manifested in the highest degree; and the willingness of a sinner to
          return to him in duty hath the strongest engagements. He hath done as
          much to encourage our obedience, as to illustrate his glory. We cannot
          conceive what could be done greater for the salvation of our souls,
          and consequently what could have been done, more to enforce our
          observance. We have a Redeemer, as man, to copy it to us, and as God,
          to perfect us in it. It would make the heart of any to tremble to
          wound him that hath provided such a salve for our sores, and to make
          grace a warrant for rebellion—motives capable to form rocks into a
          flexibleness. Thus is the wisdom of God seen in giving us a ground to
          the surest confidence, and furnishing us with incentives to the
          greatest obedience, by the horrors of wrath, death and sufferings of
          our Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The wisdom of God is apparent in the condition he hath settled for
          the enjoying the fruits of redemption: and this is faith, a wise and
          reasonable condition and the concomitants of it—
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) In that it is suited to man’s lapsed state and God’s glory.
          Innocence is not required here; that had been a condition impossible
          in its own nature after the fall. The rejecting of mercy is now only
          condemning, where mercy is proposed. Had the condition of perfection
          in works been required, it had rather been a condemnation than
          redemption. Works are not demanded, whereby the creature might ascribe
          anything to himself, but a condition, which continues in man a sense
          of his apostasy, abates all aspiring pride, and makes the reward of
          grace, not of debt; a condition, whereby mercy is owned, and the
          creature emptied; flesh silenced in the dust, and God set upon his
          throne of grace and authority; the creature brought to the lowest
          debasement, and Divine glory raised to the highest pitch. The creature
          is brought to acknowledge mercy, and seal to justice; to own the
          holiness of God, in the hatred of sin; the justice of God, in the
          punishment of sin; and the mercy of God, in the pardoning of sin: a
          condition that despoils nature of all its pretended excellency; beats
          down the glory of man at the foot of God (1 Cor. i. 29, 31). It
          subjects the reason and will of man to the wisdom and authority of
          God; it brings the creature to an unreserved submission and entire
          resignation. God is made the sovereign cause of all; the creature
          continued in his emptiness, and reduced to a greater dependence upon
          God than by a creation; depending upon him for a constant influx, for
          an entire happiness: a condition that renders God glorious in the
          creature, and the fallen creature happy in God; God glorious in his
          condescension to man, and man happy in his emptiness before God. Faith
          is made the condition of man’s recovery, that “the lofty looks of man
          might be humbled, and the haughtiness of man be pulled down” (Isa. ii.
          11); that every towering imagination might be levelled (2 Cor. x. 5).
          Man must have all from without doors; he must not live upon himself,
          but upon another’s allowance. He must stand to the provision of God,
          and be a perpetual suitor at his gates.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) A condition opposite to that which was the cause of the fall. We
          fell from God by an unbelief of the threatening; he recovers us by a
          belief of the promise; by unbelief we laid the foundation of God’s
          dishonor; by faith, therefore, God exalts the glory of his free grace.
          We lost ourselves by a desire of self‑dependence, and our return is
          ordered by way of self‑emptiness. It is reasonable we should be
          restored in a way contrary to that whereby we fell; we sinned by a
          refusal of cleaving to God; it is a part of Divine wisdom to restore
          us in a denial of our own righteousness and strength.797 Man having
          sinned by pride, the wisdom of God humbles him (saith one) at the very
          root of the tree of knowledge, and makes him deny his own
          understanding, and submit to faith, or else, forever to lose his
          desired felicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It is a condition suited to the common sentiment and custom of
          the world. There is more of belief than reason in the world. All
          instructors and masters in sciences and arts, require, first a belief
          in their disciples, and a resignation of their understandings and
          wills to them. And it is the wisdom of God to require that of man,
          which his own reason makes him submit to another which is his
          fellow‑creature. He, therefore, that quarrels with the condition of
          faith, must quarrel with all the world, since belief is the beginning
          of all knowledge;798 yea, and most of the knowledge in the world, may
          rather come under the title of belief, than of knowledge; for what we
          think we know this day, we may find from others such arguments as may
          stagger our knowledge, and make us doubt of that we thought ourselves
          certain of before: nay, sometimes we change our opinions ourselves
          without any instructor, and see a reason to entertain an opinion quite
          contrary to what we had before. And if we found a general judgment of
          others to vote against what we think we know, it would make us give
          the less credit to ourselves and our own sentiments. All knowledge in
          the world is only a belief, depending upon the testimony or arguings
          of others; for, indeed, it may be said of all men, as in Job (viii.
          9), “We are but of yesterday, and know nothing.” Since, therefore,
          belief is so universal a thing in the world, the wisdom of God
          requires that of us which every man must count reasonable, or render
          himself utterly ignorant of anything. It is a condition that is common
          to all religions. All religions are founded upon a belief: unless men
          did believe future things, they would not hope nor fear. A belief and
          resignation was required in all the idolatries in the world; so that
          God requires nothing but what a universal custom of the world gives
          its suffrage to the reasonableness of: indeed, justifying faith is not
          suited to the sentiments of men; but that faith which must precede
          justifying, a belief of the doctrine, though not comprehended by
          reason, is common to the custom of the world.799 It is no less madness
          not to submit our reason to faith, than not to regulate our fancies by
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) This condition of faith and repentance is suited to the
          conscience of men. The law of nature teaches us, that we are bound to
          believe every revelation from God, when it is made known to us: and
          not only to assent to it as true, but embrace it as good. This nature
          dictates, that we are as much obliged to believe God, because of his
          truth, as to love him, because of his goodness. Every man’s reason
          tells him, he cannot obey a precept, nor depend upon a promise, unless
          he believes both the one and the other. No man’s conscience but will
          inform him, upon hearing the revelation of God concerning his
          excellent contrivance of redemption, and the way to enjoy it, that it
          is very reasonable he should strip off all affections to sin, lie down
          in sorrow, and bewail what he hath done amiss against so tender a God.
          Can you expect that any man that promises you a great honor or a rich
          donative, should demand less of you than to trust his word, bear an
          affection to him, and return him kindness? Can any less be expected by
          a prince than obedience from a pardoned subject, and a redeemed
          captive? If you have injured any man in his body, estate, reputation,
          would you not count it a reasonable condition for the partaking of his
          clemency and forgiveness, to express a hearty sorrow for it, and a
          resolution not to fall into the like crime again? Such are the
          conditions of the gospel, suited to the consciences of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) The wisdom of God appears, in that this condition was only likely
          to attain the end. There are but two common heads appointed by
          God,—Adam and Christ: by one we are made a living soul, by the other a
          quickening spirit: by the one we are made sinners, by the other we are
          made righteous. Adam fell as a head, and all his members, his whole
          issue and posterity, fell with him, because they proceeded from him by
          natural generation. But since the second Adam cannot be our head by
          natural generation, there must be some other way of engrafting us in
          him, and uniting us to him as our Head, which must be moral and
          spiritual; this cannot rationally be conceived to be by any other way
          than what is suitable to a reasonable creature, and, therefore, must
          be by an act of the will, consent and acceptance, and owning the terms
          settled for an admission to that union. And this is that we properly
          call faith, and, therefore, called a receiving of him (John i. 12).
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] Now this condition of enjoying the fruits of redemption could not
          be a bare knowledge; for that is but only an act of the understanding,
          and doth not in itself include the act of the will, and so would have
          united only one faculty to him, not the whole soul: but faith is an
          act both of the understanding and will too; and principally of the
          will, which doth presuppose an act of the understanding: for there
          cannot be a persuasion in the will, without a proposition from the
          understanding. The understanding must be convinced of the truth and
          goodness of a thing, before the will can be persuaded to make any
          motion towards it; and, therefore, all the promises, invitations, and
          proffers, are suited to the understanding and will; to the
          understanding in regard of knowledge, to the will in regard of
          appetite; to the understanding as true, to the will as good; to the
          understanding as practical, and influencing the will.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] Nor could it be an entire obedience. That, as was said before,
          would have made the creature have some matter of boasting, and this
          was not suitable to the condition he was sunk into by the fall.
          Besides, man’s nature being corrupted, was rendered incapable to obey,
          and unable to have one thought of a due obedience (2 Cor. iii. 5).
          When man turned from God, and upon that was turned out of paradise,
          his return was impossible by any strength of his own; his nature was
          as much corrupted as his re‑entrance into paradise was prohibited.
          That covenant, whereby he stood in the garden, required a perfection
          of action and intention in the observance of all the commands of God:
          but his fall had cracked his ability to recover happiness by the terms
          and condition of an entire obedience; yet man being a person
          governable by a law, and capable of happiness by a covenant, if God
          would restore him, and enter into a covenant with him, we must suppose
          it to have some condition, as all covenants have. That condition could
          not be works, because man’s nature was polluted. Indeed, had God
          reduced man’s body to the dust, and his soul to nothing, and framed
          another man, he might have governed him by a covenant of works: but
          that had not been the same man that had revolted, and upon his revolt
          was stained and disabled. But suppose God had, by any transcendent
          grace, wholly purified him from the stain of his former transgression,
          and restored to him the strength and ability he had lost, might he not
          as easily have rebelled again? And so the condition would never have
          been accomplished, the covenant never have been performed, and
          happiness never have been enjoyed. There must be some other condition
          then in the covenant God would make for man’s security. Now faith is
          the most proper for receiving the promise of pardon of sin: belief of
          those promises is the first natural reflection that a malefactor can
          make upon a pardon offered him, and acceptance of it is the first
          consequent from that belief. Hence is faith entitled a persuasion of,
          and embracing the promises (Heb. xi. 13), and a receiving the
          atonement (Rom. v. 11). Thus the wisdom of God is apparent in annexing
          such a condition to the covenant, whereby man is restored, as answers
          the end of God for his glory, the state, conscience, and necessity of
          man, and had the greatest congruity to his recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. This wisdom of God is manifest in the manner of the publishing and
          propagating this doctrine of redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) In the gradual discoveries of it. Flashing a great light in the
          face of a sudden is amazing; should the sun glare in our eye in all
          its brightness on a sudden, after we have been in a thick darkness, it
          would blind us, instead of comforting us: so great a work as this must
          have several digestions. God first reveals of what seed the Redeeming
          Person should be, “the Seed of the woman” (Gen. iii. 15); then of what
          nation (Gen. xxvi. 4); then of what tribe (Gen. xlix. 12),—of the
          tribe of Judah; then of what family,—the family of David; then what
          works he was to do, what sufferings to undergo. The first predictions
          of our Saviour were obscure. Adam could not well see the redemption in
          the promise for the punishment of death which succeeded in the
          threatening; the promise exercised his faith, and the obscurity and
          bodily death, his humility. The promise made to Abraham was clearer
          than the revelations made before, yet he could not tell how to
          reconcile his redemption with his exile. God supported his faith by
          the promise, and exercised his humility by making him a pilgrim, and
          keeping him in a perpetual dependence upon him in all his motions. The
          declarations to Moses are brighter than those to Abraham: the
          delineations of Christ by David, in the Psalms, more illustrious than
          the former: and all those exceeded by the revelations made to the
          prophet Isaiah, and the other prophets, according as the age did
          approach wherein the Redeemer was to enter into his office. God
          wrapped up this gospel in a multitude of types and ceremonies fitted
          to the infant state of the church (Gal. iv. 3). An infant state is
          usually affected with sensible things; yet all those ceremonies were
          fitted to that great end of the gospel, which he would bring forth in
          time to the world. And the wisdom of God in them would be amazing, if
          we could understand the analogy between every ceremony in the law and
          the thing signified by it: as it cannot but affect a diligent reader
          to observe that little account of them we have by the apostle Paul,
          sprinkled in his epistles, and more largely in that to the Hebrews. As
          the political laws of the Jews flowed from the depth of the moral law,
          so their ceremonial did from the depth of evangelical counsels, and
          all of them had a special relation to the honor of God, and the
          debasing the creature. Though God formed the mass and matter of the
          world at the first creation at once, yet his wisdom took six days time
          for the disposing and adorning it. The more illustrious truths of God
          are not to be comprehended on a sudden by the weakness of men. Christ
          did not declare all truths to his disciples in the time of his life,
          because they were not able at that present to bear them (John xvi.
          12): “Ye cannot bear them now;” some were reserved for his
          resurrection, others for the coming of the Spirit, and the full
          discovery of all kept back for another world. This doctrine God
          figured out in the law, oracled by the prophets, and unveiled by
          Christ and his apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The wisdom of God appeared in using all proper means to render
          the belief of it easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] The most minute things that were to be transacted were predicted
          in the ancient foregoing age, long before the coming of the Redeemer.
          The vinegar and gall offered to him upon the cross, the parting his
          garments, the not breaking of his bones, the piercing of his hands and
          feet, the betraying of him, the slighting of him by the multitude, all
          were exactly painted and represented in variety of figures. There was
          light enough to good men not to mistake him, and yet not so plain as
          to hinder bad men from being serviceable to the counsels of God in the
          crucifying of him when he came.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] The translation of the Old Testament from the private language of
          the Jews, into the most public language of the world; that translation
          which we call Septuagint, from Hebrew into Greek, some years before
          the coming of Christ, that tongue being most diffused at that time, by
          reason of the Macedonian empire, raised by Alexander, and the
          university of Athens, to which other nations resorted for learning and
          education. This was a preparation for the sons of Japhet to “dwell in
          the tents of Shem.” By this was the entertainment of the gospel
          facilitated; when they compared the prophesies of the Old Testament
          with the declarations of the New, and found things so long predicted
          before they were transacted in the public view.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] By ordering concurrent testimonies, as to matter of fact, that
          the matter of fact was not deniable. That there was such a person as
          Christ, that his miracles were stupendous, that his doctrine did not
          incline to sedition, that he affected not worldly applause, that he
          did suffer at Jerusalem, was acknowledged by all; not a man among the
          greatest enemies of Christians was found that denied the matter of
          fact. And this great truth, that Christ is the Messiah and Redeemer,
          hath been with universal consent owned by all the professors of
          Christianity throughout the world: whatever bickerings there have been
          among them about some particular doctrines, they all centred in that
          truth of Christ’s being the Redeemer. The first publication of this
          doctrine was sealed by a thousand miracles, and so illustrious, that
          he was an utter stranger to the world that was ignorant of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] In keeping up some principles and opinions in the world to
          facilitate the belief of this, or render men inexcusable for rejecting
          of it. The incarnation of the son of God could not be so strange to
          the world, if we consider the general belief of the appearances800 of
          their gods among them; that the Epicureans and others, that denied any
          such appearances, were counted atheists.801 And Pythagoras was
          esteemed to be one, not of the inferior genii and lunar demons, but
          one of the higher gods, who appeared in a human body, for the curing
          and rectifying mortal life;802 and himself tells Abaris, the Scythian,
          that he was ἀνθρωπόμορφος, that he “took the flesh of man,” that men
          might not be astonished at him, and in a fright fly from his
          instructions. It was not therefore accounted an irrational thing among
          them, that God should be incarnate: but, indeed, the great
          stumbling‑block was a crucified God. But had they known the holy and
          righteous nature of God, the malice of sin, the universal corruption
          of human nature, the first threatening, and the necessity of
          vindicating the honor of the law, and clearing the justice of God, the
          notion of his crucifixion would not have appeared so incredible, since
          they believed the possibility of an incarnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another principle was that universal one of sacrifices for expiation,
          and rendering God propitious to man, and was practised among all
          nations. I remember not any wherein this custom did not prevail; for
          it did even among those people where the Jews, as being no trading
          nation, had not any commerce; and also in America, found out in these
          latter ages. It was not a law of nature; no man can find any such
          thing written in his own heart, but a tradition from Adam. Now that
          among the loss of so many other doctrines that were handed down from
          Adam to his immediate posterity, as, in particular, that of the “Seed
          of the woman,” which one would think a necessary appendix to that of
          sacrificing, this latter should be preserved as a fragment of an
          ancient tradition, seems to be an act of Divine wisdom, to prepare men
          for the entertainment of the doctrine of the great Sacrifice for the
          expiation of the sin of the world. And as the apostle forms his
          argument from the Jewish sacrifices, in the epistle to the Hebrews,
          for the convincing them of the end of the death of Christ, so did the
          ancient fathers make use of this practice of the heathen to convince
          them of the same doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          [5.] The wisdom of God appeared in the time and circumstances of the
          first solemn publication of the gospel by the apostles at Jerusalem.
          The relation you may read in Acts ii. 1‒12. The Spirit was given to
          the apostles on the day of Pentecost; a time wherein there were
          multitudes of Jews from all nations, not only near, but remote, that
          heard the great things of God spoken in the several languages of those
          nations where their habitations were fixed, and that by twelve
          illiterate men, that two or three hours before knew no language but
          that of their native country. It was the custom of the Jews, that
          dwelt among other nations, at a distance from Jerusalem, to assemble
          together at Jerusalem at the feast of Pentecost: and God pitched upon
          this season, that there might be witnesses of this miracle in many
          parts of the world: there were some of every nation under heaven (ver.
          5); that is, of that known part of the world, so saith the text.
          Fourteen several nations are mentioned; and proselytes as well as Jews
          by birth. They are called “devout men,” men of conscience, whose
          testimony would carry weight with it among their neighbors at their
          return, because of their reputation by their religious carriage.
          Again, this was not heard and seen by some of them at one time, and
          some at another, by some one hour, by others the next successively,803
          but altogether, in a solemn assembly, that the testimony of so many
          witnesses at a time, might be more valid, and the truth of the
          doctrine appear more illustrious and undeniable. And it must needs be
          astonishing to them, to hear that person magnified in so miraculous a
          manner, who had so lately been condemned by their countrymen as a
          malefactor. Wisdom consists in the timing of things. And in this
          circumstance doth the wisdom of God appear, in furnishing the apostles
          with the Spirit at such a time, and bringing forth such a miracle, as
          the gift of tongues, on a sudden, that every nation might hear in
          their own language the wonder of redemption, and as witnesses at their
          returns into their own countries, report it to others; that the credit
          they had, in their several places, might facilitate the belief and
          entertainment of the gospel, when the apostles, or others, should
          arrive to those several charges and dioceses appointed for them to
          preach the gospel in. Had this miracle been wrought in the presence
          only of the inhabitants of Judea, that understood only their own
          language, or one or two of the neighboring tongues, it had been
          counted by them rather a madness than a miracle. Or had they
          understood all the tongues which they spoke, the news of it had spread
          no further than the limits of their own habitations, and had been
          confined within the narrow bounds of the land of Judea. But now it is
          carried to several remote nations, where any of those auditors then
          assembled had their residence. As God chose the time of the Passover
          for the death of Christ, that there might be the greatest number of
          the inhabitants of the country, as witnesses of the matter of fact,
          the innocence and sufferings of Christ, so he chose the time of
          Pentecost for the first publishing the value and end of this blood to
          the world. Thus the evangelical law was given in a confluence of
          people from all parts and nations, because it was a covenant with all
          nations: and the variety of languages spoken by a company of poor
          Galileans, bred up at the lake of Tiberias, and in poor corners of
          Canaan, without the instructions of men for so great a skill, might
          well evidence to the hearers, that God that brought the confusion of
          languages first at Babel, did only work that cure of them, and combine
          all together at Jerusalem.

          (3.) The wisdom of God is seen in the instruments he employed in the
          publishing the gospel. He did not employ philosophers, but fishermen;
          used not acquired arts, but infused wisdom and courage. This treasure
          was put into, and preserved in earthen vessels, that the wisdom, as
          well as the power of God, might be magnified. The weaker the means are
          which attain the end, the greater is the skill of the conductor of
          them. Wise princes choose men of most credit, interest, wisdom, and
          ability, to be ministers of their affairs, and ambassadors to others.
          But what were these that God chose for so great a work, as the
          publishing a new doctrine to the world? What was their quality but
          mean, what was their authority without interest? What was their
          ability, without eminent parts for so great a work, but what Divine
          grace in a special manner endowed them with? Nay, what was their
          disposition to it? as dull and unwieldy. Witness the frequent rebukes
          for their slow‑heartedness, from their Master, when he conversed in
          the flesh with them. And one of the greatest of them, so fond of the
          Jewish ceremonies and Pharisaical principles, wherein he had been more
          than ordinarily principled, that he hated the Christian religion to
          extirpation, and the professors of it to death; by those ways which
          were out of the road of human wisdom, and would be accounted the
          greatest absurdity to be practised by men that have a repute for
          discretion, did God advance his wisdom (1 Cor. i. 25): “The
          foolishness of God is wiser than man.” By this means it was
          indisputably evidenced to unbiassed minds, that the doctrine was
          divine. It could not rationally be imagined, that instruments
          destitute of all human advantages, should be able to vanquish the
          world, confound Judaism, overturn heathenism, chase away the devils,
          strip them of their temples, alienate the minds of men from their
          several religions, which had been rooted in them by education, and
          established by a long succession. It could not, I say, reasonably be
          imagined to be without a supernatural assistance, an heavenly and
          efficacious working: whereas, had God taken a course agreeable to the
          prudence of man, and used those that had been furnished with learning,
          tipped with eloquence, and armed with human authority, the doctrines
          would have been thought to have been of a human invention, and to be
          some subtle contrivance for some unworthy and ambitious end: the
          nothingness and weakness of the instruments manifest them to be
          conducted by a Divine power, and declare the doctrine itself to be
          from heaven. When we see such feeble instruments proclaiming a
          doctrine repugnant to flesh and blood, sounding forth a crucified
          Christ to be believed in, and trusted on, and declaiming against the
          religion and worship under which the Roman empire had long flourished;
          exhorting them to the contempt of the world, preparation for
          afflictions, denying themselves, and their own honors, by the hopes of
          an unseen reward, things so repugnant to flesh and blood; and these
          instruments concurring in the same story, with an admirable harmony in
          all parts, and sealing this doctrine with their blood; can we upon all
          this, ascribe this doctrine to a human contrivance, or fix any lower
          author of it than the wisdom of heaven? It is the wisdom of God that
          carries on his own designs in methods most suitable to his own
          greatness, and different from the customs and modes of men, that less
          of humanity, and more of divinity might appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) The wisdom of God appears in the ways and manner, as well as in
          the instruments of its propagation, by ways seemingly contrary. You
          know how God had sent the Jews into captivity in Babylon, and though
          he struck off their chains, and restored them to their country, yet
          many of them had no mind to leave a country wherein they had been born
          and bred. The distance from the place of the original of their
          ancestors, and their affection to the country wherein they were born,
          might have occasioned their embracing the idolatrous worship of the
          place. Afterwards the persecutions of Antiochus scattered many of the
          Jews for their security into other nations; yet a great part, and
          perhaps the greatest, preserved their religion, and by that were
          obliged to come every year to Jerusalem to offer, and so were present
          at the effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and were
          witnesses of the miraculous effects of it. Had they not been dispersed
          by persecution, had they not resided in several countries, and been
          acquainted with their languages, the gospel had not so easily been
          diffused into several countries of the world. The first persecutions
          also raised against the church, propagated the gospel; the scattering
          of the disciples enflamed their courage, and dispersed the doctrine
          (Acts viii. 3), according to the prophecy of Daniel (xii. 4): “Many
          should run to and fro, and knowledge should be increased.” The flights
          and hurryings of men should enlarge the territories of the gospel.
          There was not a tribunal, but the primitive Christians were cited to;
          not a horrible punishment, but was inflicted upon them. Treated they
          were, as the dregs and offals of mankind, as the common enemies of the
          world; yet the flames of the martyrs brightened the doctrine, and the
          captivity of its professors made way for the throne of its empire. The
          imprisonment of the ark was the downfall of Dagon. Religion grew
          stronger by sufferings, and Christianity taller by injuries. What can
          this be ascribed to, but the conduct of a wisdom superior to that of
          men and devils, defeating the methods of human and hellish policy;
          thereby making the “wisdom of this world foolishness with God” (1 Cor.
          iii. 19)?
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The Use 1. Of Information. If wisdom be an excellency of the Divine
          nature; then,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Christ’s Deity may hence be asserted. Wisdom is the emphatical
          title of Christ in Scripture (Prov. viii. 12, 13, 31), where wisdom is
          brought in speaking as a distinct person; ascribing counsel, and
          understanding, and the knowledge of witty inventions to itself. He is
          called also the power of God, and the wisdom of God (1 Cor. i. 24).
          And the ancients generally understood that place (Col. ii. 3), “In him
          are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,” as an assertion of
          the Godhead of Christ, in regard of the infiniteness of his knowledge;
          referring wisdom to his knowledge of divine things; and knowledge to
          his understanding of all human things. But the natural sense of the
          place seems to be this, that all wisdom and knowledge is displayed by
          Christ in the gospel; and the words, ἐν αὐτῷ, refer either to Christ,
          or the mystery of God spoken of, (ver. 2). But the Deity of Christ, in
          regard of infinite wisdom, may be deduced from his creation of things,
          and his government of things; both which are ascribed to him in
          Scripture. The first ascribed to him (John i. 3): “All things were
          made by him;” and (ver. 27), “Without him was not any thing made, that
          was made.” The second (John v. 22): “The Father hath committed all
          judgment to the Son;” and both put together (Col. ii. 16, 17). Now
          since he hath the government of the world, he hath the perfections
          necessary to so great a work. As the creation of the world, which is
          ascribed to him, requires an infinite power, so the government of the
          world requires an infinite wisdom. That he hath the knowledge of the
          hearts of men, was proved in handling the omniscience of God. That
          knowledge would be to little purpose without wisdom to order the
          motions of men’s hearts, and conduct all the qualities and actions of
          creatures, to such an end as is answerable to a wise government; we
          cannot think so great an employment can be without an ability
          necessary for it. The government of men and angels is a great part of
          the glory of God; and if God should entrust the greatest part of his
          glory in hands unfit for so great a trust, it would be an argument of
          weakness in God, as it is in men, to pitch upon unfit instruments for
          particular charges; since God hath therefore committed to him his
          greatest glory, the conduct of all things for the highest end, he hath
          a wisdom requisite for so great an end, which can be no less than
          infinite. If then Christ were a finite person, he would not be capable
          of an infinite communication; he could not be a subject wherein
          infinite wisdom could be lodged; for the terms finite and infinite are
          so distant, that they cannot commence one another; finite can never be
          changed into infinite, no more than infinite can into finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Hence we may assert the right and fitness of God for the government
          of the world, as he is the wisest Being. Among men, those who are
          excellent in judgment, are accounted fittest to preside over, and give
          orders to others; the wisest in a city are most capable to govern a
          city; or at least, though ignorant men may bear the title, yet the
          advice of the soundest and skilfullest heads should prevail in all
          public affairs: we see in nature, that the eye guides the body, and
          the mind directs the eye. Power and wisdom are the two arms of
          authority; wisdom knows the end, and directs the means; power executes
          the means designed for such an end.804 The more splendid and strong
          those are in any, the more authority results from thence, for the
          conduct of others that are of an inferior orb; now God being
          infinitely excellent in both, his ability and right to the management
          of the world cannot be suspected; the whole world is but one
          commonwealth, whereof God is the monarch. Did the government of the
          world depend upon the election of men and angels, where could they
          pitch, or where would they find perfections capable of so great a
          work, but in the Supreme Wisdom? His wisdom hath already been apparent
          in those laws, whereby he formed the world into a civil society, and
          the Israelites into a commonwealth. The one suited to the consciences
          and reasons of all his subjects, and the other suited to the genius of
          that particular nation, drawn out of the righteousness of the moral
          law, and applicable to all cases that might arise among them in their
          government; so that Moses asserts, that the wisdom apparent in their
          laws enacted by God, as their chief magistrate, would render them
          famous among other nations, in regard of their wisdom, as well as
          their righteousness (Deut. iv. 6, 7, 9). Also, this perfection doth
          evidence, that God doth actually govern the world. It would not be a
          commendable thing for a man to make a curious piece of clock‑work, and
          take no care for the orderly motion of it. Would God display so much
          of his skill in framing the heaven and earth, and none in actual
          guidance of them to their particular and universal ends? Did he lay
          the foundation in order, and fit every stone in the building, make all
          things in weight and measure, to let them afterwards run at
          hap‑hazard? Would he bring forth his power to view in the creation,
          and let a more glorious perfection lie idle, when it had so large a
          field to move in? Infinite wisdom is inconsistent with inactivity. All
          prudence doth illustrate itself in untying the hardest knots, and
          disposing the most difficult affairs to a happy and successful issue.
          All those various arts and inventions among men which lend their
          assisting hand to one another, and those various employments their
          several geniuses lead them to, whereby they support one another’s
          welfare, are beams and instincts of Divine wisdom in the government of
          the world. He that “made all things in wisdom” (Ps. civ. 24), would
          not leave his works to act and move only according to their own folly,
          and idly behold them jumble together, and run counter to that end he
          designed them for; we must not fancy Divine wisdom to be destitute of
          activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Here we may see a ground of God’s patience. The most impotent
          persons are the most impatient, when unforeseen emergencies arise; or
          at events expected by them, when their feeble prudence was not a
          sufficient match to contest with them, or prevent them. But the wiser
          any man is, the more he bears with those things which seem to cross
          his intentions, because he knows he grasps the whole affair, and is
          sure of attaining the end he proposeth to himself; yet, as a finite
          wisdom can have but a finite patience, so an infinite wisdom possesses
          an infinite patience. The wise God intends to bring glory to himself,
          and good to some of his creatures, out of the greatest evils that can
          happen in the world, he beholds no exorbitant afflictions and
          monstrous actions, but what he can dispose to a good and glorious end,
          even to “work together for good to them that love God” (Rom. viii.
          28); and, therefore, doth not presently fall foul upon the actors,
          till he hath wrought out that temporary glory to himself, and good to
          his people which he designs. The times of ignorance God winked at,
          till he had brought his Son into the world, and manifested his wisdom
          in redemption, and when this was done he presseth men to a “speedy
          repentance” (Acts xvii. 30); that, as he forbore punishing their
          crimes, in order to the displaying his wisdom in the designed
          redemption; so when he had effected it, they must forbear any longer
          abusing his patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Hence appears the immutability of God in his decrees. He is not
          destitute of a power and strength to change his own purposes, but his
          infinite perfection of wisdom is a bar to his laying aside his eternal
          resolves and forming new ones (Isa. xlvi. 10); he resolves the end
          from the beginning, and his counsel stands; stands immovable, because
          it is his counsel. It is an impotent counsel, that is subject to a
          daily thwarting itself. Inconstant persons are accounted, by men,
          destitute of a due measure of prudence. If God change his mind it is
          either for the better or the worse; if for the better, he was not wise
          in his former purpose; if for the worse, he is not wise in his present
          resolve. No alteration can be without a reflection of weakness upon
          the former or present determination. God must either cease to be as
          wise as he was before, or begin to be wiser than he was before the
          change, which to think or imagine is to deny a Deity. If any man
          change his resolution, he is apprehensive of a flaw in his former
          purpose, and finds an inconvenience in it, which moves him to such a
          change, which must be either for want of foresight in himself, or want
          of a due consideration of the object of his counsel, neither of which
          can be imagined of God without a denial of the Deity. No, there are no
          blots and blemishes in his purposes and promises. Repentance, indeed,
          is an act of wisdom in the creature, but it presupposeth folly in his
          former actions, which is inconsistent with infinite perfection. Men
          are often too rash in promising; and, therefore, what they promise in
          haste, they perform at leisure, or not at all: they consider not
          before they vow, and make after‑inquiries, whether they had best stand
          to it. The only wise God needs not any after‑game: as he is
          sovereignly wise, he sees no cause of reversing anything, and wants
          not expedients for his own purpose; and as he is infinitely powerful,
          he hath no superior to hinder him from executing his will, and making
          his people enjoy the effects of his wisdom. If he had a recollection
          of thoughts, as man hath, and and saw a necessity to mend them, he
          were not infinitely wise in his first decrees: as in creation he
          looked back upon the several pieces of that goodly frame he had
          erected, and saw them so exact that he did not take up his pencil
          again to mend any particle of the first draught, so his promises are
          made with such infinite wisdom and judgment, that what he writes is
          irreversible and forever, as the decrees of the Medes and Persians.
          All the words of God are eternal because they are the births of
          righteousness and judgment (Hos. ii. 19); “I will betroth thee to me
          forever, in righteousness and judgment.” He is not of a wavering and
          flitting discretion: if he threatens, he wisely considers what he
          threatens; if he promises, he wisely considers what he promises; and
          therefore is immutable in both.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Hence it follows that God is a fit object for our trust and
          confidence: for God being infinitely wise, when he promises anything,
          he sees everything which may hinder, and everything which may promote
          the execution of it, so that he cannot discover anything afterwards
          that may move him to take up after‑thoughts: he hath more wisdom than
          to promise anything hand over head, or anything which he knows he
          cannot accomplish. Though God, as true, be the object of our trust,
          yet God, as wise, is the foundation of our trust. We trust him in his
          promise; the promise was made by mercy, and it is performed by truth;
          but wisdom conducts all means to the accomplishment of it. There are
          many men, whose honesty we can confide in, but whose discretion we are
          diffident of: but there is no defect, either of the one or the other,
          which may scare us from a depending upon God in our concerns. The
          words of man’s wisdom the apostle entitles “enticing” (1 Cor. ii. 4),
          in opposition to the words of God’s wisdom, which are firm, stable,
          and undeniable demonstrations. As the power of God is an encouragement
          of trust, because he is able to effect, so the wisdom of God comes
          into the rank of those attributes which support our faith. To put a
          confidence in him, we must be persuaded, not only that he is ignorant
          of nothing in the world, but that he is wise to manage the whole
          course of nature, and dispose of all his creatures, for the bringing
          his purposes and his promises to their designed perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Hence appears the necessity of a public review of the management of
          the world, and of a day of judgment. As a day of judgment may be
          inferred from many attributes of God, as his sovereignty, justice,
          omniscience, &amp;c., so, among the rest, from this of wisdom. How
          much of this perfection will lie unveiled and obscure, if the sins of
          men be not brought to view, whereby the ordering the unrighteous
          actions of men, by his directing and over‑ruling hand of providence,
          in subserviency to his own purposes and his people’s good, may appear
          in all its glory! Without such a public review, this part of wisdom
          will not be clearly visible; how those actions, which had a vile
          foundation in the hearts and designs of men, and were formed there to
          gratify some base lust, ambition, and covetousness, &amp;c. were, by a
          secret wisdom presiding over them, conducted to amazing ends. It is a
          part of Divine wisdom to right itself, and convince men of the
          reasonableness of its laws, and the unreasonableness of their
          contradictions to it. The execution of the sentence is an act of
          justice, but the conviction of the reasonableness of the sentence is
          an act of wisdom, clearing up the righteousness of the proceeding; and
          this precedes, and the other follows (Jude 15); “To convince all that
          are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds.” That wisdom which contrived
          satisfaction, as well as that justice which required it, is concerned
          in righting the law which was enacted by it. The wisdom of a sovereign
          Lawgiver is engaged not to see his law vilified and trampled on, and
          exposed to the lusts and affronts of men, without being concerned in
          vindicating the honor of it. It would appear a folly to enact and
          publish it, if there were not a resolution to right and execute it.
          The wisdom of God can no more associate iniquity and happiness
          together, than the justice of God can separate iniquity from
          punishment. It would be defective, if it did always tamely bear the
          insolences of offenders, without a time of remark of their crimes, and
          a justification of the precept, rebelliously spurned at. He would be
          unwise, if he were unjust; unrighteousness hath no better a title in
          Scripture than that of folly. It is no part of Wisdom to give birth to
          those laws which he will always behold ineffectual, and neither
          vindicate his law by a due execution of the penalty, nor right his own
          authority, contemned in the violation of his law, by a just revenge:
          besides, what wisdom would it be for the Sovereign Judge to lodge such
          a spokesman for himself as conscience in the soul of man, if it should
          be alway found speaking, and at length be found false in all that it
          speaks? There is, therefore, an apparent prospect of the day of
          account, from the consideration of this perfection of the Divine
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Hence we have a ground for a mighty reverence and veneration of the
          Divine Majesty. Who can contemplate the sparklings of this perfection
          in the variety of the works of his hands, and the exact government of
          all his creatures, without a raised admiration of the excellency of
          his Being, and a falling flat before him, in a posture of reverence to
          so great a Being? Can we behold so great a mass of matter, digested
          into several forms, so exact a harmony and temperament in all the
          creatures, the proportions of numbers and measures, and one creature
          answering the ends and designs of another, the distinct beauties of
          all, the perpetual motion of all things without checking one another;
          the variety of the nature of things, and all acting according to their
          nature with an admirable agreement, and all together, like different
          strings upon an instrument, emitting divers sounds, but all reduced to
          order in one delightful lesson;—I say, can we behold all this without
          admiring and adoring the Divine wisdom, which appears in all? And from
          the consideration of this, let us pass to the consideration of his
          wisdom in redemption, in reconciling divided interests, untying hard
          knots, drawing one contrary out of another; and we must needs
          acknowledge that the wisdom of all the men on earth, and angels in
          heaven, is worse than nothing and vanity in comparison of this vast
          Ocean. And as we have a greater esteem for those that invent some
          excellent artificial engines, what reverence ought we to have for him
          that hath stamped an unimitable wisdom upon all his works! Nature
          orders us to give honor to our superiors in knowledge, and confide in
          their counsels; but none ought to be reverenced as much as God, since
          none equals him in wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. If God be infinitely wise, it shows us the necessity of our address
          to him, and invocation of his Name. We are subject to mistakes, and
          often overseen; we are not able rightly to counsel ourselves. In some
          cases, all creatures are too short‑sighted to apprehend them, and too
          ignorant to give advice proper for them, and to contrive remedies for
          their ease; but with the Lord there is counsel (Jer. xxxii. 19), “He
          is great in counsel, and mighty in working;” great in counsel to
          advise us, mighty in working to assist us. We know not how to effect a
          design, or prevent an expected evil. We have an infinite Wisdom to go
          to, that is every way skilful to manage any business we desire, to
          avert any evil we fear, to accomplish anything we commit into his
          hands. When we know not what to resolve, he hath a counsel to “guide
          us” (Ps. lxxiii. 24). He is not more powerful to effect what is
          needful, than wise to direct what is fitting. All men stand in need of
          the help of God, as one man stands in need of the assistance of other
          men, and will not do anything without advice; and he that takes
          advice, deserves the title of a wise man, as well as he that gives
          advice. But no man needs so much the advice of another man, as all men
          need the counsel and assistance of God: neither is any man’s wit and
          wisdom so far inferior to the prudence and ability of an angel, as the
          wisdom of the wisest man and the most sharp‑sighted angel, is inferior
          to the infinite wisdom of God. We see, therefore, that it is best for
          us to go to the fountain, and not content ourselves with the streams;
          to beg advice from a wisdom that is infinite and infallible, rather
          than from that which is finite and fallible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 2. If wisdom be the perfection of the Divine Majesty, how
          prodigious is the contempt of it in the world? In general, all sin
          strikes at this attribute, and is in one part or other a degrading of
          it: the first sin directed its venom against this. As the devils
          endeavored to equal their Creator in power, so man endeavored to equal
          him in wisdom: both indeed scorned to be ruled by his order; but man
          evidently exalted himself against the wisdom of God, and aspired to be
          a sharer with him in his infinite knowledge; would not let him be the
          only wise God, but cherished an ambition to be his partner. Just as if
          a beam were able to imagine it might be as bright as the sun; or a
          spark fancy it could be as full fraught with heat as the whole element
          of fire. Man would not submit to the infinite wisdom of God in the
          prohibition of one single fruit in the garden, when by the right of
          his sovereign authority, he might have granted him only the use of
          one. All presumptuous sins are of this nature; they are, therefore,
          called reproaches of God (Num. xv. 30), “the soul that doth ought
          presumptuously, reproacheth the Lord.” All reproaches are either for
          natural, moral, or intellectual defects. All reproaches of God must
          imply either a weakness or unrighteousness in God: if unrighteousness,
          his holiness is denied; if weakness, his wisdom is blemished. In
          general, all sin strikes at this perfection two ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. As it defaceth the wise workmanship of God. Every sin is a
          deforming and blemishing our own souls, which, as they are the prime
          creatures in the lower world, so they have greater characters of
          Divine wisdom in the fabric of them: but this image of God is ruined
          and broken by sin. Though the spoiling of it be a scorn of his
          holiness, it is also an affront to his wisdom; for though his power
          was the cause of the production of so fair a piece, yet his wisdom was
          the guide of his power, and his holiness the pattern whereby he
          wrought it. His power effected it, and his holiness was exemplified in
          it; but his wisdom contrived it. If a man had a curious clock or
          watch, which had cost him many years pains and the strength of his
          skill to frame it; for another, after he had seen and considered it,
          to trample upon it, and crush it in pieces, would argue a contempt of
          the artificer’s skill. God hath shown infinite art in the creation of
          man; but sin unbeautifies man, and ravisheth his excellency. It cuts
          and slasheth the image of God stamped by divine wisdom, as though it
          were an object only of scorn and contempt. The sinner in every sin
          acts, as if he intended to put himself in a better posture, and in a
          fairer dress, than the wisdom of God hath put him in by creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the slighting his laws. The laws of God are highly rational;
          they are drawn from the depths of the Divine understanding, wherein
          there is no unclearness, and no defect. As his understanding
          apprehends all things in their true reason, so his will enjoins all
          things for worthy and wise ends. His laws are contrived by his wisdom
          for the happiness of man, whose happiness, and the methods to it, he
          understands better than men or angels can do. His laws being the
          orders of the wisest understanding, every breach of his law is a
          flying in the face of his wisdom. All human laws, though they are
          enforced by sovereign authority, yet they are, or ought to be, in the
          composing of them, founded upon reason, and should be particular
          applications of the law of nature to this or that particular
          emergency. The laws of God, then, who is summa ratio, are the birth of
          the truest reason; though the reason of every one of them may not be
          so clear to us. Every law, though it consists in an act of the will,
          yet doth pre‑suppose an act of the understanding. The act of the
          Divine understanding in framing the law, must be supposed to precede
          the act of his will in commanding the observance of that law. So every
          sin against the law, is not only against the will of God commanding,
          but the reason of God contriving, and a cleaving to our own reason,
          rather than the understanding or mind of God: as if God had mistaken
          in making his law, and we had more understanding to frame a better,
          and more conducing to our happiness: as if God were not wise enough to
          govern us, and prescribe what we should do, and what we should avoid;
          as if he designed not our welfare but our misfortune. Whereas, the
          precepts of God are not tyrannical edicts, or acts of mere will, but
          the fruits of counsel; and, therefore, every breach of them is a real
          declamation against his discretion and judgment, and preferring our
          own imaginations, or the suggestions of the devil, as our rule, before
          the results of Divine counsel. While we acknowledge him wise in our
          opinion, we speak him foolish by our practice; when, instead of being
          guided by him, we will guide ourselves. No man will question, but it
          is a controlling Divine wisdom, to make alterations in his precepts;
          dogmatically, either to add some of their own, or expunge any of his:
          and is it not a crime of the like reflection to alter them
          practically? When we will observe one part of the law, and not another
          part; but pick and choose where we please ourselves, as our humors and
          carnal interest prompt us; it is to charge that part of the law with
          folly, which we refuse to conform unto. The more cunning any man is in
          sin, the more his sin is against Divine wisdom, as if he thought to
          outwit God. He that receives the promises of God, and the “testimony
          of Christ, sets to his seal, that God is true” (John iii. 33). By the
          like strength of argument, it will undeniably follow, that he that
          refuseth obedience to his precepts, sets to his seal that God is
          foolish. Were they not rational, God would not enjoin them; and if
          they are rational, we are enemies to infinite wisdom, by not complying
          with them. If infinite prudence hath made the law, why is not every
          part of it observed; if it were not made with the best wisdom, why is
          any part of it observed? If the defacing of his image be any sin, as
          being a defaming his wisdom in creation, the breaking his law is no
          less a sin, as being a disgracing his wisdom in his administration.
          ’Tis upon this account, likely, that the Scripture so often counts
          sinners fools, since it is certainly inexcusable folly to contradict
          undeniable and infallible Wisdom; yet this is done in the least sin:
          and as he that breaks one tittle of the law, is deservedly accounted
          guilty of the breach of the whole (James ii. 10), so he that despiseth
          the least stamp of wisdom in the minutest part of the law, is
          deservedly counted as a contemner of it, in the frame of the whole
          statute‑book. But, in particular, the wisdom of God is affronted and
          invaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) By introducing new rules and modes of worship, different from
          Divine institutions. Is not this a manifest reflection on this
          perfection of God, as though he had not been wise enough to provide
          for his own honor, and model his own service, but stood in need of our
          directions, and the caprichios of our brains? Some have observed, that
          it is a greater sin in worship to do that we should not, than to omit
          what we should perform.805 The one seems to be out of weakness,
          because of the high exactness of the law; and the other out of
          impudence, accusing the wisdom of God of imperfection, and controlling
          it in its institutions. At best, it seems to be an imputation of human
          bashfulness to the Supreme Sovereign; as if he had been ashamed to
          prescribe all that was necessary to his own honor, but had left
          something to the ingenuity and gratitude of men. Man has, ever since
          the foolish conceit of his old ancestor Adam, presumed he could be as
          wise as God; and if he who was created upright entertained such
          conceits, much more doth man now, under a mass of corruption, so
          capable to foment them. This hath been the continual practice of men;
          not so much to reject what once they had received as Divine, but add
          something of their own inventions to it. The heathens renounced not
          the sacrificing of beasts for the expiation of their offences (which
          the old world had received by tradition from Adam, and the new world,
          after the deluge, from Noah). But they had blended that tradition with
          rites of their own, and offered creatures unclean in themselves, and
          not fit to be offered to an infinitely pure Being; for the distinction
          of clean and unclean was as ancient as Noah (Gen. viii. 20), yea,
          before (Gen. vii. 2). So the Jews did not discard what they had
          received from God, as circumcision, the Passover, and sacrifices; but
          they would mix a heap of heathenish rites with the ceremonies of
          Divine ordination, and practise things which he had not commanded, as
          well as things which he had enjoined them. And, therefore, it is
          observable, that when God taxeth them with sin, he doth not say, they
          brought in those things which he had forbidden into his worship; but
          those things which he had not commanded, and had given no order for,
          to intimate, that they were not to move a step without his rule (Jer.
          vii. 31): “They have built the high palaces of Tophet, which I
          commanded them not, neither came it into my heart;” and (Levit. x. 1);
          Nadab’s and Abihu’s strange fire was not commanded; so charging them
          with impudence and rashness in adding something of their own, after he
          had revealed to them the manner of his service, as if they were as
          wise as God. So loth is man to acknowledge the supremacy of Divine
          understanding, and be sensible of his own ignorance. So after the
          divulging of the gospel, the corruptors of religion did not fling off,
          but preserved the institutions of God, but painted and patched them up
          with pagan ceremonies; imposed their own dreams with as much force as
          the revelations of God. Thus hath the papacy turned the simplicity of
          the gospel into pagan pomp, and religion into politics; and revived
          the ceremonial law, and raked some limbs of it out of the grave, after
          the wisdom of God had rung her knell, and honorably interred her; and
          sheltered the heathenish superstitions in christian temples, after the
          power of the gospel had chased the devils, with all their trumpery,
          from their ancient habitations. Whence should this proceed, but from a
          partial atheism, and a mean deceit of the Divine wisdom? As though God
          had not understanding enough to prescribe the form of his own worship;
          and not wisdom enough to support it, without the crutches of human
          prudence. Human prudence is too low to parallel Divine wisdom; it is
          an incompetent judge of what is fit for an infinite Majesty. It is
          sufficiently seen in the ridiculous and senseless rights among the
          heathens; and the cruel and devilish ones fetched from them by the
          Jews. What work will human wisdom make with divine worship, when it
          will presume to be the director of it, as a mate with the wisdom of
          God! Whence will it take its measures, but from sense, humor and
          fancy? as though what is grateful and comely to a depraved reason,
          were as beautiful to an unspotted and Infinite Mind. Do not such tell
          the world, that they were of God’s cabinet council, since they will
          take upon them to judge, as well as God, what is well‑pleasing to him?
          Where will it have the humility to stop, if it hath the presumption to
          add any one thing to revealed modes of worship? How did God tax the
          Israelites with making idols “according to their own understanding”
          (Hos. xiii. 2)! imagining their own understandings to be of a finer
          make, and a perfecter mould than their Creator’s; and that they had
          fetched more light from the chaos of their own brains, than God had
          from eternity in his own nature. How slight will the excuse be, God
          hath not forbidden this, or that, when God shall silence men with the
          question, Where, or when did I command this, or that? There was no
          addition to be made under the law to the meanest instrument God had
          appointed in his service. The sacred perfume was not to have one
          ingredient more put into it, than what God had prescribed in the
          composition; nor was any man upon pain of death to imitate it; nor
          would God endure that sacrifices should be consumed with any other
          fire than that which came down from heaven. So tender is God of any
          invasions of his wisdom and authority. In all things of this nature,
          whatsoever voluntary humility and respect to God they may be disguised
          with, there is a swelling of the fleshly mind against infinite
          understanding, which the apostle nauseates (Col. ii. 18). Such
          mixtures have not been blessed by God: as God never prospered the
          mixtures of several kinds of creatures, to form and multiply a new
          species, as being a dissatisfaction with his wisdom as Creator; so he
          doth not prosper mixtures in worship, as being a conspiracy against
          his wisdom as a Lawgiver. The destruction of the Jews was judged by
          some of their doctors to be, for preferring human traditions before
          the written word; which they ground on (Isaiah xxix. 33): “Their fear
          for me was taught by the precepts of men.” The injunctions of men were
          the rule of their worship, and not the prescripts of my law.806 To
          conclude, such as make alterations in religion, different from the
          first institution, are intolerable busy bodies, that will not let God
          alone with his own affairs. Vain man would be wiser than his Maker,
          and be dabbling in that which is His sole prerogative.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In neglecting means instituted by God. When men have risings of
          heart against God’s ordinances, “they reject the counsel of the Lord
          against themselves,” or, in themselves (Luke vii. 30), ἠθέτησαν. They
          disannulled the wisdom of God, the spring of his ordinances. All
          neglects are disregards of Divine prescriptions, as impertinent and
          unavailable to that end for which they were appointed, as not being
          suited to the common dictates of reason; sometimes out of a voluntary
          humility, such as Peter’s was, when he denied Christ’s condescension
          to wash his feet (John xiii. 8), and thereby judged of the comeliness
          of his Master’s intention and action. Such as continually neglect the
          great institution of the Lord’s supper, out of a sense of
          unworthiness, are in the same rank with Peter, and do, as well as he,
          fall under the blame and reproof of Christ. Men would be saved, and
          use the means, but either means of their own appointment, or not at
          all the means of God’s ordering.807 They would have God’s wisdom and
          will condescend to theirs, and not theirs conformed to God’s; as if
          our blind judgments were fittest to make the election of the paths to
          happiness. Like Naaman, who, when he was ordered by the prophet, for
          the cure of his leprosy, to “wash seven times in Jordan,” would be the
          prophet’s director, and have him touch him with his hand; as if a
          patient, sick of a desperate disease, should prescribe to his skilful
          physician what remedies he should order for his cure, and make his own
          infirm reason, or his gust and palate, the rule, rather than the
          physician’s skill. Men’s inquiries are, “Who will show us any good?”
          They rather fasten upon any means than that which God hath
          ordained.808 We invert the order Divine wisdom hath established, when
          we would have God save us in our own way, not in his. It is the same
          thing as if we would have God nourish us without bread, and cure our
          disease without medicines, and increase our wealth without our
          industry, and cherish our souls without his word and ordinances. It is
          to demand of him an alteration of his methods, and a separation of
          that which he hath by his eternal judgment joined together. Therefore
          for a man to pray to God to save him when he will not use the means he
          hath appointed for salvation, when he slights the word, which is the
          instrument of salvation, is a contempt of the wisdom of Divine
          institutions. Also in omissions of prayer. When we consult not with
          God upon emergent occasions, we trust more to our own wisdom than
          God’s, and imply that we stand not in need of his conduct, but have
          ability to direct ourselves, and accomplish our ends without his
          guidance. Not seeking God is, by the prophet, taxed to be a reflection
          upon this perfection of God (Isa. xxxi. 1, 2): “They look not to the
          Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord” &amp;c. And the like charge
          he brings against them (Hos. viii. 9): “They are gone up to Assyria, a
          wild ass alone by himself, not consulting God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In censuring God’s revelations and actions, if they be not
          according to our schemes: when we will not submit to his plain will
          without penetrating into the unrevealed reason of it, nor adore his
          counsels without controlling them, as if we could correct both law and
          gospel, and frame a better method of redemption than that of God’s
          contriving. Thus men slighted the wisdom of God in the gospel, because
          it did not agree with that philosophical wisdom and reason they had
          sucked in by education from their masters (1 Cor. i. 21, 22), contrary
          to their practice in their superstitious worship, where the oracles
          they thought divine were entertained with reverence, not with dispute,
          and though ambiguous, were not counted ridiculous by the worshipper.
          How foolish is man in this wherein he would be accounted wise! Adam,
          in innocence, was unfit to control the doctrine of God when the eye of
          his reason was clear; and much more are we, since the depravation of
          our natures. The revelations of God tower above reason in its purity,
          much more above reason in its mud and earthiness. The rays of Divine
          wisdom are too bright for our human understandings, much more for our
          sinful understandings. It is base to set up reason, a finite
          principle, against an infinite wisdom; much baser to set up a depraved
          and purblind reason against an all‑seeing and holy wisdom. If we would
          have a reason for all that God speaks, and all that God acts, our
          wisdom must become infinite as his, or his wisdom become finite as
          ours. All the censures of God’s revelations arise from some
          prejudicate opinions, or traditional maxims, that have enthroned
          themselves in our minds, which are made the standard whereby to judge
          the things of God, and receive or reject them as they agree with, or
          dissent from, those principles (Col. ii. 8). Hence it was that the
          philosophers, in the primitive times, were the greatest enemies to the
          gospel: and the contempt of Divine wisdom, in making reason the
          supreme judge of Divine revelation, was the fruitful mother of the
          heresies in all ages springing up in the church, and especially of
          that Socinianism, that daily insinuates itself into the minds of men.
          This is a wrong to the wisdom of God. He that censures the words or
          actions of another, implies that he is, in his censure, wiser than the
          person censured by him. It is as insupportable to determine the truth
          of God’s plain dictates by our reason, as it is to measure the
          suitableness or unsuitableness of his actions by the humor of our
          will. We may sooner think to span the sun, or grasp a star, or see a
          gnat swallow a Leviathan, than fully understand the debates of
          eternity. To this we may refer too curious inquiries into Divine
          methods, and “intruding into those things which are not revealed”
          (Col. ii. 18). It is to affect a wisdom equal with God, and an
          ambition to be of his cabinet council. We are not content to be
          creatures, that is, to be every way below God; below him in wisdom, as
          well as power.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In prescribing God’s method of acting. When we pray for a thing
          without a due submission to God’s will; as if we were his counsellors,
          yea his tutors, and not his subjects, and God were bound to follow our
          humors, and be swayed according to the judgment of our ignorance; when
          we would have such a mercy which God thinks not fit to give, or have
          it in this method, which God designs to convey through another
          channel. Thus we would have the only wise God take his measures from
          our passions; such a controlling of God was Jonah’s anger about a
          gourd (chap. iv. 1): “It displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very
          angry.” We would direct Him how to dispose of us; as though he, that
          had infinite wisdom to contrive and rear the excellent fabric of the
          world, had not wisdom enough, without our discretions, to place us in
          a sphere proper for his own ends, and the use he intends us in the
          universe. All the speeches of men (would I had been in such an office,
          had such a charge; would I had such a mercy, in such a method, or by
          such instruments,) are entrenchments upon God’s wise disposal of
          affairs. This imposing upon God is a hellish disposition, and in hell
          we find it. The rich man in hell, that pretends some charity for his
          brethren on earth, would direct God a way to prevent their ruin, by
          sending one from the dead to school them, as a more effectual means
          than “Moses and the prophets” (Luke xvi. 29, 30). It is a temper also
          to be found on earth; what else was the language of Saul’s saving the
          Amalekites’ cattle against the plain command of God (1 Sam. xv. 15)?
          As if God in his fury had overshot himself and overlooked his altar,
          in depriving it of so great a booty for its service; as if it were an
          unwise thing in God, to lose the prey of so many stately cattle, that
          might make the altar smoke with their entrails, and serve to expiate
          the sins of the people; and therefore he would rectify that which he
          thought to be an oversight in God, and so magnifies his own prudence
          and discretion above the Divine. We will not let God act as he thinks
          fit, but will be directing him, and “teaching him knowledge” (Job.
          xxi. 22). As if God were a statue, an idol, that had eyes and saw not,
          hands, but acted not; and could be turned as an image may be, to what
          quarter of the heaven we please ourselves. The wisdom of God is
          unbiassed; he orders nothing but what is fittest for his end, and we
          would have our shallow brains the bias of God’s acting. And will not
          God resent such an indignity, as a reflection upon his wisdom as well
          as authority, when we intimate that we have better heads than he, and
          that he comes short of us in understanding?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In murmuring and impatience. One demands a reason, why he hath this
          or that cross? Why he hath been deprived of such a comfort, lost such
          a venture, languisheth under such a sickness, is tormented with such
          pains, oppressed by tyrannical neighbors, is unsuccessful in such
          designs? In these, and such like, the wisdom of God is questioned and
          defamed. All impatience is a suspicion, if not a condemnation of the
          prudence of God’s methods, and would make human feebleness and folly
          the rule of God’s dealing with his creatures. This is a presuming to
          instruct God, and a reproving him for unreasonableness in his
          proceedings, when his dealings with us do not exactly answer our
          fancies and wishes; as if God, who made the world in wisdom, wanted
          skill for the management of his creatures in it (Job xl. 2): “Shall he
          that contends with the Almighty, instruct him? he that reproveth God,
          let him answer it.” We that are not wise enough to know ourselves, and
          what is needful for us; presume to have wit enough to guide God in his
          dealing with us. The wisdom of God rendered Job more useful to the
          world by his afflictions, in making him a pattern of patience, than if
          he had continued him in a confluence of all worldly comforts, wherein
          he had been beneficial only in communicating his morsels to his poor
          neighbors. All murmuring is a fastening error upon unerring Wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. In pride and haughtiness of spirit. No proud man, but sets his
          heart “as the heart of God” (Ezek. xxviii. 2, 3). The wisdom of God
          hath given to men divers offices, set them in divers places; some have
          more honorable charges, some meaner. Not to give that respect their
          offices and places call for, is to quarrel with the wisdom of God, and
          overturn the rank and order wherein he hath placed things. It is unfit
          we should affront God in the disposal of his creatures, and intimate
          to him by our carriage, that he had done more wisely in placing
          another, and that he hath done foolishly in placing this or that man
          in such a charge. Sometimes men are unworthy the place they fill; they
          may be set there in judgment to themselves and others: but the wisdom
          of God in his management of things, is to be honored and regarded. It
          is an infringing the wisdom of God, when we have a vain opinion of
          ourselves, and are blind to others. When we think ourselves monarchs,
          and treat others as worms or flies in comparison of us. He who would
          reduce all things to his own honor, perverts the order of the world,
          and would constitute another order than what the wisdom of God hath
          established; and move them to an end contrary to the intention of God,
          and charges God with want of discretion and skill.
        </p>
        <p>7. Distrust of God’s promise is an impeachment of his wisdom.</p>
        <p>
          A secret reviling of it, as if he had not taken due consideration
          before he past his word; or a suspicion of his power, as if he could
          not accomplish his word. We trust the physician’s skill with our
          bodies, and the lawyer’s counsel with our estates; but are loath to
          rely upon God for the concerns of our lives. If he be wise to dispose
          of us, why do we distrust him? If we distrust him, why do we embrace
          an opinion of wisdom? Unbelief also is a contradiction to the wisdom
          of God in the gospel, &amp;c., but that I have already handled in a
          discourse of the nature of unbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 3. Of comfort. God hath an infinite wisdom, to conduct us in our
          affairs, rectify us in our mistakes, and assist us in our straits. It
          is an inestimable privilege to have a God in covenant with us; so
          wise, to communicate all good, to prevent all evil; who hath infinite
          ways to bring to pass his gracious intentions towards us. “How
          unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out” (Rom.
          xi. 33)! His judgments or decrees are incomprehensibly wise, and the
          ways of effecting them are as wise as his resolves effected by them.
          We can as little search into his methods of acting, as we can into his
          wisdom of resolving; both his judgments and ways are unsearchable.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Comfort in all straits and afflictions. There is a wisdom in
          inflicting them, and a wisdom in removing them. He is wise to suit his
          medicines to the humor of our disease, though he doth not to the humor
          of our wills: he cannot mistake the nature of our distemper, or the
          virtue of his own physic. Like a skilful physician, he sometimes
          prescribes bitter potions, and sometimes cheering cordials, according
          to the strength of the malady, and necessity of the patient, to reduce
          him to health. As nothing comes from him, but what is for our good, so
          nothing is acted by him in a rash and temerarious way. His wisdom is
          as infinite as his goodness; and as exact in managing, as his goodness
          is plentiful in streaming out to us. He understands our griefs, weighs
          our necessities, and no remedies are beyond the reach of his
          contrivance. When our feeble wits are bewildered in a maze, and at the
          end of their line for a rescue, the remedies unknown to us are not
          unknown to God. When we know not how to prevent a danger, the wise God
          hath a thousand blocks to lay in the way; when we know not how to free
          ourselves from an oppressive evil, he hath a thousand ways of relief.
          He knows how to time our crosses, and his own blessings. The heart of
          a wise God, as well as the heart of a wise man, discerns both time and
          judgment (Eccles. viii. 5). There is as much judgment in sending them,
          as judgment in removing them. How comfortable is it to think, that our
          distresses, as well as our deliverances, are the fruits of infinite
          wisdom! Nothing is done by him too soon or too slow; but in the true
          point of time, with all its due circumstances, most conveniently for
          his glory and our good. How wise is God to bring the glory of our
          salvation out of the depths of a seeming ruin. and make the evils of
          affliction subservient to the good of the afflicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In temptations, his wisdom is no less employed in permitting them,
          than in bringing them to a good issue. His wisdom in leading our
          Saviour to be tempted of the devil, was to fit him for our succor; and
          his wisdom in suffering us to be tempted, is to fit us for his own
          service, and our salvation. He makes a thorn in the flesh to be an
          occasion of a refreshing grace to the spirit, and brings forth cordial
          grapes from those pricking brambles, and magnifies his grace by his
          wisdom, from the deepest subtilties of hell. Let Satan’s intentions be
          what they will, he can be for him at every turn, to outwit him in his
          stratagems, to baffle him in his enterprises; to make him instrumental
          for our good, where he designs nothing but our hurt. The Lord hath his
          methods of deliverance from him (2 Pet. ii. 9). “The Lord knows how to
          deliver the godly out of temptation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In denials, or delays of answers of prayer. He is gracious to hear;
          but he is wise to answer in an acceptable time, and succor us in a day
          proper for our salvation (2 Cor. vi. 2). We have partial affections to
          ourselves, ignorance is natural to us (Rom. viii. 26). We ask we know
          not what, because we ask out of ignorance. God grants what he knows,
          what is fit for him to do, and fit for us to receive; and the exact
          season wherein it is fittest for him to bestow a mercy. As God would
          have us bring forth our fruit in season, so he will send forth his
          mercies in season. He is wise to suit his remedy to our condition, to
          time it so, as that we shall have an evident prospect of his wisdom in
          it; that more of Divine skill, and less of human, may appear in the
          issue. He is ready at our call; but he will not answer, till he see
          the season fit to reach out his hand. He is wise to prove our faith,
          to humble us under the sense of our own unworthiness, to wet our
          affections, to set a better estimate on the blessings prayed for, and
          that he may double the blessing, as we do our devotion: but when his
          wisdom sees us fit to receive his goodness, he grants what we stand in
          need of. He is wise to choose the fittest time, and faithful to give
          the best covenant mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In all evils threatened to the church by her enemies. He hath
          knowledge to foresee them, and wisdom to disappoint them (Job. v. 13);
          “He taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the
          froward is carried headlong.” The church hath the wisdom of God, to
          enter the lists with the policy of hell. He defeated the serpent in
          the first net he laid, and brought a glorious salvation out of hell’s
          rubbish, and is yet as skilful to disappoint the after‑game of the
          serpentine brood. The policy of hell, and the subtilty of the world,
          are no better than folly with God (1 Cor. iii. 19). All creatures are
          fools, as creatures, in comparison with the Creator. The angels he
          chargeth with folly, much more us sinners. Depraved understandings are
          not fit mates for a pure and unblemished mind. Pharaoh, with his
          wisdom, finds a grave in the sea; and Ahitophel’s plots are finished
          in his own murder. He breaks the enemies by his power, and orders them
          by his skill to be a feast to his people (Ps. lxxiv. 14); “Thou
          breakest the head of the leviathan, and gavest him to be meat to the
          people in the wilderness.” The spoils of the Egyptians’ carcasses,
          cast upon the shore, served the Israelites’ necessities (or were as
          meat to them); as being a deliverance the church might feed upon in
          all ages, in a wilderness condition, to maintain their faith, the
          vital principle of the soul. There is a wisdom superior to the
          subtilties of men, which laughs at their follies, and “hath them in
          derision” (Ps. ii. 4). “There is no wisdom or counsel against the
          Lord” (Prov. xxi. 30). You never question the wisdom of an artist to
          use his file, when he takes it into his hand. Wicked instruments are
          God’s axes and files; let him alone, he hath skill enough to manage
          them: God hath too much affection to destroy his people, and wisdom
          enough to beautify them by the worst tools he uses. He can make all
          things conspire to a perfect harmony for his own ends, and his
          people’s good, when they see no way to escape a danger feared, or
          attain a blessing wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 4. For Exhortation. 1. Meditate on the wisdom of God in creation
          and government. How little do we think of God when we behold his
          works! Our sense dwells upon the surface of plants and animals,
          beholds the variety of their colors, and the progress in their motion;
          our reason studies the qualities of them; our spirits seldom take a
          flight to the Divine wisdom which framed them. Our senses engross our
          minds from God, that we scarce have a thought free to bestow upon the
          Maker of them, but only on the by. The constancy of seeing things that
          are common stifles our admiration of God, due upon the sight of them.
          How seldom do we raise our souls as far as heaven, in our views of the
          order of the world, the revolutions of the seasons, the nature of the
          creatures that are common among us, and the mutual assistance they
          give to each other! Since God hath manifested himself in them, to
          neglect the consideration of them is to neglect the manifestation of
          God, and the way whereby he hath transmitted something of his
          perfections to our understanding. It renders men inexcusably guilty of
          not glorifying of God (Rom. i. 19, 20). We can never neglect the
          meditation of the creatures, without a blemish cast upon the Creator’s
          wisdom. As every river can conduct us to the sea, so every creature
          points us to an ocean of infinite wisdom. Not the minutest of them,
          but rich tracts of this may be observed in them, and a due sense of
          God result from them. They are exposed to our view, that something of
          God may be lodged in our minds; that, as our bodies extract their
          quintessence for our nourishment, so our minds may extract a
          quintessence for the Maker’s praise. Though God is principally to be
          praised, in and for Christ, yet, as grace doth not rase out the law of
          nature, so the operations of grace put not the dictates of nature to
          silence, nor suspend the homage due to God upon our inspection of his
          works. God hath given full testimonies of this perfection in the
          heavenly bodies, dispersing their light, and distributing their
          influences to every part of the world; in framing men into societies,
          giving them various dispositions for the preservation of governments;
          making some wise for counsel, others martial for action; changing old
          empires, and raising new. Which way soever we cast our eyes, we shall
          find frequent occasions to cry out, “O the depth of the riches, both
          of the wisdom and knowledge of God” (Rom. xi. 33)! To this purpose, we
          must not only look upon the bulk and outside of his works, but
          consider from what principles they were raised, in what order
          disposed, and the exact symmetry and proportion of their parts. When a
          man comes into a city or temple, and only considers the surface of the
          buildings, they will amaze his sense, but not better his
          understanding, unless he considers the methods of the work, and the
          art whereby it was erected.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) This was an end for which they were created. God did not make the
          world for man’s use only, but chiefly for his own glory; for man’s use
          to enjoy his creatures, and for his own glory to be acknowledged in
          his creatures, that we may consider his art in framing them, and his
          skill in disposing them, and not only gaze upon the glass without
          considering the image it represents, and acquainting ourselves whose
          image it is. The creatures were not made for themselves, but for the
          service of the Creator, and the service of man. Man was not made for
          himself, but for the service of the Lord that created him. He is to
          consider the beauty of the creation, that he may thereby glorify the
          Creator. He knows in part their excellency; the creatures themselves
          do not. If, therefore, man be idle and unobservant of them, he
          deprives God of the glory of his wisdom, which he should have by his
          creatures. The inferior creatures themselves cannot observe it. If man
          regard it not, what becomes of it? his glory can only be handed to him
          by man. The other creatures cannot be active instruments of his glory,
          because they know not themselves, and therefore cannot render him an
          active praise. Man is, therefore, bound to praise God for himself, and
          for all his creatures, because he only knows himself, and the
          perfections of the creatures, and the Author both of himself and them.
          God created such variety, to make a report of himself to us; we are to
          receive the report, and to reflect it back to him. To what purpose did
          he make so many things, not necessary, for the support and pleasure of
          our lives, but that we should behold him in them, as well as in the
          other? We cannot behold the wisdom of God in his own essence, and
          eternal ideas, but by the reflection of it in the creatures: as we
          cannot steadily behold the sun with our eye, but either through a
          glass, or by reflection of the image of it in the water. God would
          have us meditate on his perfections; he therefore chose the same day
          wherein he reviewed his work and rested from it, to be celebrated by
          man for the contemplation of him (Gen. ii. 2, 3), that we should
          follow his example, and rejoice, as himself did, in the frequent
          reviews of his wisdom and goodness in them. In vain would the
          creatures afford matter for this study, if they were wholly neglected.
          God offers something to our consideration in every creature. Shall the
          beams of God shine round about us, and strike our eyes, and not affect
          our minds? Shall we be like ignorant children, that view the pictures,
          or point to the letters in a book, without any sense and meaning? How
          shall God have the homage due to him from his works, if man hath no
          care to observe them? The 148th Psalm is an exhortation to this. The
          view of them should often extract from us a wonder of the like nature
          of that of David’s (Ps. civ. 24): “O Lord, how wonderful are thy
          works, in wisdom hast thou made them all!” The world was not created
          to be forgotten, nor man created to be unobservant of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If we observe not the wisdom of God in the views of the
          creatures, we do no more than brutes. To look upon the works of God in
          the world, is no higher an act than mere animals perform. The glories
          of heaven, and beauties of the earth, are visible to the sense of
          beasts and birds. A brute beholds the motion of a man, as it may see
          the wheels of a clock, but understands not the inward springs of
          motion; the end for which we move, or the soul that acts us in our
          motion; much less that Invisible Power which presides over the
          creatures, and conducts their motion. If a man do no more than this,
          he goes not a step beyond a brutish nature, and may very well
          acknowledge himself with Asaph, a foolish and ignorant beast before
          God (Ps. lxxiii. 22). The world is viewed by beasts, but the Author of
          it to be contemplated by man. Since we are in a higher rank than
          beasts, we owe a greater debt than beasts; not only to enjoy the
          creatures, as they do, but behold God in the creatures, which they
          cannot do. The contemplation of the reason of God in his works, is a
          noble and suitable employment for a rational creature: we have not
          only sense to perceive them, but souls to mind them. The soul is not
          to be without its operation: where the operation of sense ends, the
          work of the soul ought to begin. We travel over them by our senses, as
          brutes; but we must pierce further by our understandings, as men, and
          perceive and praise Him that lies invisible in his visible
          manufactures. Our senses are given us as servants to the soul, and our
          souls bestowed upon us for the knowledge and praise of their and our
          common Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This would be a means to increase our humility. We should then
          flag our wings, and vail our sails, and acknowledge our own wisdom to
          be as a drop to the ocean, and a shadow to the sun. We should have
          mean thoughts of the nothingness of our reason, when we consider the
          sublimity of the Divine wisdom. Who can seriously consider the sparks
          of infinite skill in the creature, without falling down at the feet of
          the Divine Majesty, and acknowledge himself a dark and foolish
          creature (Ps. viii. 4, 5)? When the Psalmist considered the heavens,
          the moon, and stars, and God’s ordination and disposal of them, the
          use that results from it is, “What is man, that thou art mindful of
          him?” We should no more think to mate him in prudence, or set up the
          spark of our reason to vie with the sun. Our reason would more
          willingly submit to the revelation, when the characters of Divine
          wisdom are stamped upon it, when we find his wisdom in creation
          incomprehensible to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It would help us in our acknowledgments of God, for his goodness
          to us. When we behold the wisdom of God in creatures below us, and how
          ignorant they are of what they possess, it will cause us to reflect
          upon the deeper impressions of wisdom in the frame of our own bodies
          and souls, an excellency far superior to theirs; this would make us
          admire the magnificence of his wisdom and goodness, sound forth his
          praise for advancing us in dignity above other works of his hands, and
          stamping on us, by infinite art, a nobler image of himself. And by
          such a comparison of ourselves with the creatures below us, we should
          be induced to act excellently, according to the nature of our souls;
          not brutishly, according to the nature of the creatures God hath put
          under our feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) By the contemplation of the creatures, we may receive some
          assistance in clearing our knowledge in the wisdom of redemption.
          Though they cannot of themselves inform us of it, yet since God hath
          revealed his redeeming grace, they can illustrate some particulars of
          it to us. Hence the Scripture makes use of the creatures, to set forth
          things of a higher orb to us: our Saviour is called a Sun, a Vine, and
          a Lion; the Spirit likened to a dove, fire, and water. The union of
          Christ and his church, is set forth by the marriage union of Adam and
          Eve. God hath placed in corporeal things the images of spiritual, and
          wrapped up in his creating wisdom the representations of his redeeming
          grace: whence some call the creatures, natural types of what was to be
          transacted in a new formation of the world, and allusions to what God
          intended in and by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) The meditation of God’s wisdom in the creatures is, in part, a
          beginning of heaven upon earth. No doubt but there will be a perfect
          opening of the model of Divine wisdom. Heaven is for clearing what is
          now obscure, and a full discovering of what seems at present intricate
          (Ps. xxxvi. 9): ‘In his light shall we see light:’ all the light in
          creation, government, and redemption. The wisdom of God in the new
          heavens, and the new earth, would be to little purpose, if that also
          were not to be regarded by the inhabitants of them. As the saints are
          to be restored to the state of Adam, and higher; so they are to be
          restored to the employment of Adam, and higher: but his employment
          was, to behold God in the creatures. The world was so soon depraved,
          that God had but little joy in, and man but little knowledge of his
          works. And since the wisdom of God in creation is so little seen by
          our ignorance here, would not God lose much of the glory of it, if the
          glorified souls should lose the understanding of it above? When their
          darkness shall be expelled, and their advantages improved; when the
          eye that Adam lost shall be fully restored, and with a greater
          clearness; when the creature shall be restored to its true end, and
          reason to its true perfection (Rom. viii. 21, 22); when the fountains
          of the depths of nature and government shall be opened, knowledge
          shall increase, and according to the increase of our knowledge, shall
          the admiration of Divine wisdom increase also. The wisdom of God in
          creation was not surely intended to lie wholly unobserved in the
          greatest part of it; but since there was so little time for the full
          observation of it, there will be a time wherein the wisdom of God
          shall enjoy a resurrection, and be fully contemplated by his
          understanding and glorified creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 2. Study and admire the wisdom of God in redemption. This is
          the duty of all Christians. We are not called to understand the great
          depth of philosophy; we are not called to a skill in the intricacies
          of civil government, or understand all the methods of physic; but we
          are called to be Christians, that is, studiers of Divine evangelical
          wisdom. There are first principles to be learned; but not those
          principles to be rested in without a further progress (Heb. vi. 1):
          “Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us
          go on to perfection.” Duties must be practised, but knowledge is not
          to be neglected. The study of Gospel mysteries, the harmony of Divine
          truths, the sparkling of Divine wisdom, in their mutual combination to
          the great ends of God’s glory and man’s salvation, is an incentive to
          duty, a spur to worship, and particularly to the greatest and highest
          part of worship, that part which shall remain in heaven; the
          admiration and praise of God, and delight in him. If we acquaint not
          ourselves with the impressions of the glory of Divine wisdom in it, we
          shall not much regard it as worthy our observance in regard of that
          duty. The gospel is a mystery; and, as a mystery, hath something great
          and magnificent in it worthy of our daily inspection; we shall find
          fresh springs of new wonders, which we shall be invited to adore with
          a religious astonishment. It will both raise and satisfy our longings.
          Who can come to the depths of “God manifested in the flesh?” How
          amazing is it, and unworthy of a slight thought, that the death of the
          Son of God should purchase the happy immortality of a sinful creature,
          and the glory of a rebel be wrought by the ignominy of so great a
          person! that our Mediator should have a nature whereby to covenant
          with his Father, and a nature whereby to be a Surety for the creature!
          How admirable is it, that the fallen creature should receive an
          advantage by the forfeiture of his happiness! How mysterious is it,
          that the Son of God should bow down to death upon a cross for the
          satisfaction of justice; and rise triumphantly out of the grave, as a
          declaration, that justice was contented and satisfied! that he should
          be exalted to heaven to intercede for us; and at last return into the
          world to receive us, and invest us with a glory forever with himself!
          Are these things worthy of a careless regard, or a blockish amazement?
          What understanding can pierce into the depths of the divine doctrine
          of the incarnation and birth of Christ; the indissoluble union of the
          two natures? What capacity is able to measure the miracles of that
          wisdom, found in the whole draught and scheme of the gospel? Doth it
          not merit, then, to be the object of our daily meditation? How comes
          it to pass, then, that we are so little curious to concern our
          thoughts in those wonders, that we scarce taste or sip of these
          delicacies? that we busy ourselves in trifles, and consider what we
          shall eat, and in what fashion we shall be dressed; please ourselves
          with the ingeniousness of a lace or feather; admire a moth‑eaten
          manuscript, or some half‑worn piece of antiquity, and think our time
          ill‑spent in the contemplating and celebrating that wherein God hath
          busied himself, and eternity is designed for the perpetual expressions
          of? How inquisitive are the blessed angels! with what vigor do they
          renew their daily contemplations of it, and receive a fresh
          contentment from it; still learning, and still inquiring (1 Pet. i.
          12)! Their eye is never off the mercy‑seat; they strive to see the
          bottom of it, and employ all the understanding they have to conceive
          the wonders of it. Shall the angels be ravished with it, and bend
          themselves down to study it, who have but little interest in it in
          comparison of us, for whom it was both contrived and dispensed;—and
          shall not our pains be greater for this hidden treasure? Is not that
          worthy the study of a rational creature, that is worthy the study of
          the angelical? There must indeed be pains; it is expressed by
          “digging” (Prov. ii. 4). A lazy arm will not sink to the depth of a
          mine. The neglect of meditating on it is inexcusable, since it hath
          the title and character of the wisdom of God. The ancient prophets
          searched into it, when it was folded up in shadows, when they saw only
          the fringes of Wisdom’s garment (1 Pet. i. 10); and shall not we,
          since the sun hath mounted up in our horizon, and sensibly scattered
          the light of the knowledge of this and the other perfections of God?
          As the Jewish sabbath was appointed to celebrate the perfections of
          God, discovered in creation, so is the Christian sabbath appointed to
          meditate on, and bless God, for the discovery of his perfections in
          redemption. Let us, therefore, receive it according to its worth: let
          it be our only rule to walk by. It is worthy to be valued above all
          other counsels; and we should never think of it without the doxology
          of the apostle, “To the only wise God be glory through Jesus Christ,
          for ever!” that our speculations may end in affectionate admirations,
          and thanksgivings, for that which is so full of wonders. What a little
          prospect should we have had of God, and the happiness of man, had not
          his wisdom and goodness revealed these things to us! The gospel is a
          marvellous light, and should not be regarded with a stupid ignorance,
          and pursued with a duller practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 3. Let none of us be proud of, or trust in our own wisdom.
          Man, by affecting wisdom out of the way of God, got a crack in his
          head, which hath continued five thousand years and upwards, and ever
          since our own wisdom and “knowledge hath perverted us” (Isa. xlvii.
          10). To be guided by this, is to be under the conduct of a blind
          leader, and follow a traitor and enemy to God and ourselves. Man’s
          prudence often proves hurtful to him: he often accomplisheth his ruin,
          while he designs his establishment; and finds his fall, where he
          thought to settle his fortune: such bad eyes hath human wisdom often
          in its own affairs. Those that have been heightened with a conceit of
          their own cunning, have at last proved the greatest fools. God
          delights to make “foolish the wisdom of this world” (1 Cor. i. 20).
          Thus God writ folly upon the crafty brains of Ahithophel, and
          simplicity upon the subtle projects of Herod against our Saviour; and
          the devil, the prince of carnal wisdom, was befooled into a furthering
          our redemption by his own projects to hinder it. Carnal policy,
          against the prescripts of Divine wisdom, never prospers: it is like an
          ignis fatuus, which leads men out of the way of duty, and out of the
          way of security, and perverts them into the mire and dangerous
          precipices. When Jeroboam would coin a religion to serve his interest
          of state, he tore up the foundations both of his kingdom and family.
          The way the Jews took to prevent a fresh invasion of the Romans, by
          the crucifying Christ, brought the judgment more swift upon them (John
          xi. 48). There is no man ruined here, or damned hereafter, but by his
          own wisdom and will. (Prov. iii. 5, 7), “The fear of the Lord, and
          departure from evil, are inconsistent with an overweening conceit of
          our own wisdom;” and leaning to our own understanding, is inconsistent
          with a trusting in the Lord with all our hearts. It is as much a
          deifying ourselves, to trust to our own wit, as it is a deifying the
          creature to affect or confide in it, superior to God or equally with
          him. The true way to wisdom is to be sensible of our own folly (1 Cor.
          iii. 18), “If any man be wise, let him become a fool.” He that
          distrusts his own guidance, will more securely and successfully follow
          the counsel of another in whom he confides. The more water, or any
          other liquor, is poured out of a vessel, the more air enters. The more
          we distrust our own wisdom, the more capable we are of the conduct of
          God’s. Had Jehoshaphat relied upon his own policy, he might have found
          a defeat when he met with a deliverance; but he disowned his own skill
          and strength in telling God, “We know not what to do, but our eyes are
          upon thee” (2 Chron. xx. 12). Let us, therefore, with Agur, disesteem
          our own understanding to esteem Divine. Human prudence is like a
          spider’s web, easily blown away, and swept down by the besom of some
          unexpected revolution. God, by his infinite wisdom, can cross the
          wisdom of man, and make a man’s own prudence hang in his own light.
          (Isa. xxix. 14), “The understanding of their prudent men shall be
          hid.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 4. Seek to God for wisdom. The wisdom we have by nature, is
          like the weeds the earth brings forth without tillage. Our wisdom
          since the fall, is the wisdom of the serpent, without the innocency of
          the dove: it flows from self‑love, runs into self‑interest. It is the
          wisdom of the flesh, and a prudence to manage means for the contending
          our lusts. Our best wisdom is imperfect, a mere nothing and vanity, in
          comparison of the Divine, as our beings are in comparison of his
          essence. We must go to God for a holy and innocent wisdom, and fill
          our cisterns from a pure fountain. The wisdom that was the glory of
          Solomon, was the donation of the Most High. (James i. 5), “If any man
          want wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
          upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” The faculty of
          understanding is from God by nature; but a heavenly light to direct
          the understanding is from God by grace. Children have an
          understanding, but stand in need of wise masters to rectify it, and
          form judicious notions in it. “There is a spirit in man, but the
          inspiration of the Almighty gives him understanding” (Job xxxii. 8).
          We must beg of God, wisdom. The gospel is the wisdom of God; the
          concerns of it great and mysterious, not to be known without a “new
          understanding” (1 John v. 20). A new understanding is not to be had
          but from the Creator of the first. The Spirit of God is the “searcher
          of the deep things of God;” the revealer of them to us, and the
          enlightener of our minds to apprehend them; and, therefore, called a
          “Spirit of wisdom and revelation” (Eph. i. 17). Christ is made wisdom
          to us, as well as righteousness; not only by imputation, but
          effusion.809 Seek to God, therefore, for that wisdom which is like the
          sun, and not that worldly wisdom which is like a shadow: for that
          wisdom whose effects are not so outwardly glorious, but inwardly
          sweet, seek it from him, and seek it in his word, that is, the
          transcript of Divine wisdom; “through his precepts understanding is to
          be had” (Ps. cxix. 104). As the wisdom of men appears in their laws,
          so doth the wisdom of God in his statutes. By this means we arrive to
          a heavenly sagacity. If these be rejected, what wisdom can there be in
          us? a dream and conceit only (Jer. viii): “They have rejected the word
          of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?” Who knows how to order any
          concerns as he ought, or any one faculty of his soul? Therefore,
          desire God’s direction in outward concerns, in personal, family, in
          private and public. He hath not only a wisdom for our salvation, but
          for our outward direction. He doth not only guide us in the one, and
          leave Satan to manage us in the other. Those that go with Saul to a
          witch of Endor, go to hell for craft, and prefer the wisdom of the
          hostile serpent before the holy counsel of a faithful Creator. If you
          want health in your body, you advise with a physician; if direction
          for your estate, you resort to a lawyer; if passage for a voyage, you
          address to a pilot; why not much more yourselves, your all, to a wise
          God? As Pliny said, concerning a wise man, “O, Sir, how many Catos are
          there in that wise person!” how much more wisdom than men or angels
          possess, is infinitely centered in the wise God!
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 5. Submit to the wisdom of God in all cases. What else was
          inculcated in the first precept, forbidding man to eat of the fruit of
          the “tree of knowledge of good and evil,” but that he should take heed
          of the swelling of his mind against the wisdom of God? It is a wisdom
          incomprehensible to flesh and blood; we should adore it in our minds,
          and resign up ourselves to it in our practice. How unreasonable are
          repinings against God, whereby a creature’s ignorance indicts and
          judges a Creator’s prudence! Were God weak in wisdom, and only mighty
          in power, we might suspect his conduct. Power without wisdom and
          goodness is an unruly and ruinous thing in the world. But God being
          infinite in one, as well as the other, we have no reason to be jealous
          of him, and repine against his methods; why should we quarrel with him
          that we are not as high, or as wealthy as others; that we have not
          presently the mercy we want? If he be wise, we ought to stay his time,
          and wait his leisure, because “he is a God of judgment” (Isa. xxx.
          18). Presume not to shorten the time which his discretion hath fixed;
          it is a folly to think to do it. By impatience we cannot hasten
          relief; we alienate him from us by debasing him to stand at our bar,
          disturb ourselves, lose the comfort of our lives, and the sweetness of
          his mercy. Submission to God we are in no case exempted from, because
          there is no case wherein God doth not direct all the acts of his will
          by counsel. Whatsoever is drawn by a straight rule must be right and
          straight; the rule that is right in itself, is the measure of the
          straightness of everything else; whatsoever is wrought in the world by
          God, must be wise, good, righteous; because God is essentially wisdom,
          goodness, and righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Submit to God, in his revelations. 1. Measure them not by reason:
          the truths of the gospel must be received with a self‑emptiness and
          annihilation of the creature. If our reason seems to lift up itself
          against revelation, because it finds no testimony for it in its own
          light, consider how crazy it is in natural and obvious things, and
          therefore sure it is not strong enough to enter into the depths of
          Divine wisdom: the wisdom of God in the gospel is too great an ocean
          to be contained or laved out by a cockleshell. It were not infinite,
          if it were not beyond our finite reach; our reason must as well stoop
          to his wisdom, as our wills to his sovereignty. How great a vanity is
          it for a glow‑worm to boast that it is as full of light as the sun in
          the firmament! for reason to leave its proper sphere, is to fall into
          confusion, and thicken its own darkness. We should settle ourselves in
          the belief of the Scripture, and confirm ourselves by a meditation on
          those many undeniable arguments for its Divine authority,—the
          fulfilling of its predictions, the antiquity of the writing, the
          holiness of the precepts, the heavenliness of the doctrine, the
          glorious effects it hath produced, and doth yet produce, different
          from human methods of success; and submit our reason to the voice of
          so high a majesty. 2. Not to be too curiously inquisitive into what is
          not revealed. There is something hid in whatsoever is revealed. We
          know the Son of God was begotten from eternity, but how he was
          begotten, we are ignorant. We know there is a union of the Divine
          nature with the human, and that the fulness of the Godhead dwells in
          him bodily; but the manner of its inhabitation we are in a great part
          ignorant of. We know that God hath chosen some and refused others, and
          that he did it with counsel; but the reason why he chose this man and
          not that, we know not; we can refer it to nothing but God’s sovereign
          pleasure. It is revealed that there will be a day wherein God shall
          judge the world; but the particular time is not revealed. We know that
          God created the world in time; but why he did not create the world
          millions of years before, we are ignorant of, and our reasons would be
          bewildered in their too much curiosity. If we ask why he did not
          create it before, we may as well ask why he did create it then? And
          may not the same question be asked, if the world had been created
          millions of years before it was? That he created it in six days, and
          not in an instant, is revealed; but why he did not do it in a moment,
          since we are sure he was able to do it, is not revealed. Are the
          reasons of a wise man’s proceedings hid from us? and shall we presume
          to dive into the reason of the proceedings of an only wise God, which
          he hath judged not expedient to discover to us? Some sparks of his
          wisdom he hath caused to issue out, to exercise and delight our minds;
          others he keeps within the centre of his own breast; we must not go
          about to unlock his cabinet. As we cannot reach to the utmost lines of
          his power, so we cannot grasp the intimate reasons of his wisdom. We
          must still remember, that which is finite can never be able to
          comprehend the reasons, motives, and methods of that which is
          infinite. It doth not become us to be resty, because God hath not
          admitted us into the debates of eternity. We are as little to be
          curious at what God hath hid, as to be careless of what God hath
          manifested. Too great an inquisitiveness beyond our line, is as much a
          provoking arrogance, as a blockish negligence of what is revealed, is
          a slighting ingratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Submit to God in his precepts and methods. Since they are the
          results of infinite wisdom, disputes against them are not tolerable;
          what orders are given out by infallible Wisdom are to be entertained
          with respect and reverence, though the reason of them be not visible
          to our purblind minds. Shall God have less respect from us than
          earthly princes, whose laws we observe without being able to pierce
          into the exact reason of them all? Since we know he hath not a will
          without an understanding, our observance of him must be without
          repining; we must not think to mend our Creator’s laws, and presume to
          judge and condemn his righteous statutes. If the flesh rise up in
          opposition, we must cross its motions, and silence its murmurings; his
          will should be an acceptable will to us, because it is a wise will in
          itself. God hath no need to impose upon us and deceive us; he hath
          just and righteous ways to attain his glory and his creatures’s good.
          To deceive us, would be to dishonor himself, and contradict his own
          nature. He cannot impose false injurious precepts, or unavailable to
          his subjects’ happiness; not false, because of his truth; not
          injurious, because of his goodness; not vain, because of his wisdom.
          Submit, therefore, to him in his precepts, and in his methods too. The
          honor of his wisdom, and the interest of our happiness, call for it.
          Had Noah disputed with God about building an ark, and listened to the
          scoffs of the senseless world, he had perished under the same fate,
          and lost the honor of a preacher and worker of righteousness. Had not
          the Israelites been their own enemies, if they had been permitted to
          be their own guides, and returned to the Egyptian bondage and
          furnaces, instead of a liberty and earthly felicity in Canaan? Had our
          Saviour gratified the Jews by descending from the cross, and freeing
          himself from the power of his adversaries, he might have had that
          faith from them which they promised him; but it had been a faith to no
          purpose, because without ground; they might have believed him to be
          the Son of God, but he could not have been the Saviour of the world.
          His death, the great ground and object of faith, had been
          unaccomplished; they had believed a God pardoning without a consent to
          his justice, and such a faith could not have rescued them from falling
          into eternal misery. The precepts and methods of Divine wisdom must be
          submitted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Submit to God in all crosses and revolutions. Infinite Wisdom
          cannot err in any of his paths, or step the least hair’s breadth from
          the way of righteousness: there is the understanding of God in every
          motion; an eye in every wheel, the wheel that goes over us and
          crusheth us. We are led by fancy more than reason: we know no more
          what we ask, or what is fit for us, than the mother of Zebedee’s
          children did, when she petitioned Christ for her sons’ advancement,
          when he came into his temporal kingdom (Matt. xx. 22): the things we
          desire might pleasure our fancy or appetite, but impair our health:
          one man complains for want of children, but knows not whether they may
          prove comforts or crosses: another for want of health, but knows not
          whether the health of his body may not prove the disease of his soul.
          We might lose in heavenly things, if we possess in earthly things what
          we long for. God, in regard of his infinite wisdom, is fitter to carve
          out a condition than we ourselves; our shallow reason and self‑love,
          would wish for those things that are injurious to God, to ourselves,
          to the world; but God always chooses what is best for his glory, and
          what is best for his creatures, either in regard to themselves, or as
          they stand in relation to him, or to others, as parts of the world. We
          are in danger from our self‑love, in no danger in complying with God’s
          wisdom: when Rachel would die, if she had no children, she had
          children, but death with one of them (Gen. xxx. 1). Good men may
          conclude, that whatsoever is done by God in them, or with them, is
          best and fittest for them; because by the covenant which makes over
          God to them, as their God, the conduct of his wisdom is assured to
          them as well as any other attribute: and, therefore, as God in every
          transaction appears as their God, so he appears as their wise
          Director, and by this wisdom he extracts good out of evil, makes the
          affliction which destroys our outward comforts consume our inward
          defilements; and the waves which threatened to swallow up the vessel,
          to cast it upon the shore: and when he hath occasion to manifest his
          anger against his people, his wisdom directs his wrath. In judgment he
          hath “a work to do upon Zion;” and when that work is done, he punishes
          the fruit of the “stout heart of the king of Assyria” (Isa. x. 12); as
          in the answers of prayer he doth give oftentimes “above what we ask or
          think” (Eph. iii. 20), so in outward concerns he doth above what we
          can expect, or by our short‑sightedness, conclude will be done. Let
          us, therefore, in all things, frame our minds to the Divine Wisdom,
          and say with the Psalmist (Ps. xlvii. 4): “The Lord shall choose our
          inheritance and condition for us.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhort. 6. Censure not God in any of his ways. Can we understand the
          full scope of Divine wisdom in creation, which is perfected before our
          eyes? Can we, by a rational knowledge, walk over the whole surface of
          the earth, and wade through the sea? Can we understand the nature of
          the heavens? Are all, or most, or the thousandth part of the particles
          of Divine skill, known by us, yea, or any of them thoroughly known?
          How can we, then, understand his deeper methods in things that are but
          of yesterday, that we have not had a time to view? We should not be
          too quick, or too rash, in our judgments of him: the best that we
          attain to, is but feeble conjectures at the designs of God. As there
          is something hid in whatsoever is revealed in his word, so there is
          something inaccessible to us in his works, as well as in his nature
          and Majesty. In our Saviour’s act in washing his disciples’ feet, he
          checked Peter’s contradiction (John xiii. 7): “What I do, thou knowest
          not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.” God were not infinitely wise
          if the reason of all his acts were obvious to our shallowness. He is
          no profound statesman, whose inward intention can be sounded by vulgar
          heads at the first act he starts in his designed method. The wise God
          is, in this, like wise men, that have not breasts like glasses of
          crystal, to discover all that they intend. There are “secrets of
          wisdom above our reach” (Job xi. 6); nay, when we see all his acts, we
          cannot see all the draughts of his skill in them. An unskilful hearer
          of a musical lesson may receive the melody with his ear, and
          understand not the rarities of the composition as it was wrought by
          the musician’s mind. Under the Old Testament there was more of Divine
          power, and less of his wisdom apparent in his acts: as his laws, so
          his acts, were more fitted to their sense. Under the New Testament
          there is more of wisdom, and less of power; as his laws, so his acts,
          are more fitted to a spiritual mind; wisdom is less discernible than
          power. Our wisdom, therefore, in this case, as it doth other things,
          consists in silence and expectation of the end and event of a work. We
          owe that honor to God that we do to men wiser than ourselves, to
          imagine he hath reason to do what he doth, though our shallowness
          cannot comprehend it. We must suffer God to be wiser than ourselves,
          and acknowledge that there is something sovereign in his ways not to
          be measured by the feeble reed of our weak understandings. And,
          therefore, we should acquiesce in his proceedings; take heed we be not
          found slanderers of God, but be adorers instead of censurers; and lift
          up our heads in admiration of him and his ways, instead of citing him
          to answer it at our bar. Many things in the first appearance may seem
          to be rash and unjust, which, in the issue, appear comely and regular.
          If it had been plainly spoke before that the Son of God should die,
          that a most holy person should be crucified, it would have seemed
          cruel to expose a son to misery; unjust to inflict punishment upon one
          that was no criminal; to join together exact goodness and physical
          evil; that the sovereign should die for the malefactor, and the
          observer of the law for the violators of it. But when the whole design
          is unravelled, what an admirable connexion is there of justice and
          mercy, love and wisdom, which before would have appeared absurd to the
          muddied reason of man! We see the gardener pulling up some delightful
          flowers by the roots, digging up the earth, overwhelming it with dung;
          an ignorant person would imagine him wild, out of his wits, and charge
          him with spoiling his garden: but when the spring is arrived, the
          spectator will acknowledge his skill in his former operations. The
          truth is, the whole design and methods of God are not to be judged by
          us in this world; the full declaration of the whole contexture is
          reserved for the other world, to make up a part of good men’s
          happiness in the amazing views of Divine wisdom, as well as the other
          perfections of his nature. We can no more perfectly understand his
          wisdom than we can his mercy and justice, till we see the last lines
          of all drawn, and the full expressions of them; we should therefore be
          sober and modest in the consideration of God’s ways; “his judgments
          are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.” The riches of his
          wisdom are past our counting, his depths not to be fathomed, yet they
          are depths of righteousness and equity; though the full manifestation
          of that equity, the grounds and methods of his proceedings are unknown
          to us. As we are too short fully to know God, so we are too ignorant
          fully to comprehend the acts of God: since he is a God of judgment, we
          should wait till we see the issue of his works (Isa. xxx. 18). And in
          the meantime, with the apostle in the text, give him the glory of all,
          in the same expressions, “To the only wise God be glory, through Jesus
          Christ for ever. Amen.”
