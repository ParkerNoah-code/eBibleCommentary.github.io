        <h2>DISCOURSE II.</h2>
        <p>ON PRACTICAL ATHEISM.</p>
        <p>
          Psalm xiv. 1.—The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They
          are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practical atheism is natural to man in his depraved state, and very
          frequent in the hearts and lives of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. He regards him as
          little as if he had no being. He said in his heart, not with his
          tongue, nor in his head: he never firmly thought it, nor openly
          asserted it. Shame put a bar to the first, and natural reason to the
          second; yet, perhaps, he had sometimes some doubts whether there were
          a God or no. He wished there were not any, and sometimes hoped there
          were none at all. He could not raze out the notion of a Deity in his
          mind, but he neglected the fixing the sense of God in his heart, and
          made it too much his business to deface and blot out those characters
          of God in his soul, which had been left under the ruins of original
          nature. Men may have atheistical hearts without atheistical heads.
          Their reasons may defend the notion of a Deity, while their hearts are
          empty of affection to the Deity. Job’s children may curse God in their
          hearts, though not with their lips.140
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no God. Most understand it of a denial of the providence of
          God, as I have said in opening the former doctrine. He denies some
          essential attribute of God, or the exercise of that attribute in the
          world.141 He that denies any essential attribute, may be said to deny
          the being of God. Whosoever denies angels or men to have reason and
          will, denies the human and angelical nature, because understanding and
          will are essential to both those natures; there could neither be angel
          nor man without them. No nature can subsist without the perfections
          essential to that nature, nor God be conceived of without his. The
          apostle tells us (Eph. ii. 12), that the Gentiles were “without God in
          the world.” So, in some sense, all unbelievers may be termed atheists;
          for rejecting the Mediator appointed by God, they reject that God who
          appointed him. But this is beyond the intended scope, natural atheism
          being the only subject; yet this is deducible from it. That the title
          of ἄθεοι doth not only belong to those who deny the existence of God,
          or to those who contemn all sense of a Deity, and would root the
          conscience and reverence of God out of their souls; but it belongs
          also to those who give not that worship to God which is due to him,
          who worship many gods, or who worship one God in a false and
          superstitious manner, when they have not right conceptions of God, nor
          intend an adoration of him according to the excellency of his nature.
          All those that are unconcerned for any particular religion fall under
          this character: though they own a God in general, yet are willing to
          acknowledge any God that shall be coined by the powers under whom they
          live. The Gentiles were without God in the world; without the true
          notion of God, not without a God of their own framing. This general or
          practical atheism is natural to men.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Not natural by created, but by corrupted nature. It is against
          nature, as nature came out of the hand of God; but universally
          natural, as nature hath been sophisticated and infected by the
          serpent’s breath. Inconsideration of God, or misrepresentation of his
          nature, are as agreeable to corrupt nature, as the disowning the being
          of a God is contrary to common reason. God is not denied, naturâ, sed
          vitiis.142
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is universally natural: “The wicked are estranged from the womb
          (Psalm lviii. 3). They go astray as soon as they be born: their poison
          is like the poison of a serpent.” The wicked, (and who by his birth
          hath a better title?) they go astray from the dictates of God and the
          rule of their creation as soon as ever they be born. Their poison is
          like the poison of a serpent, which is radically the same in all of
          the same species. It is seminally and fundamentally in all men, though
          there may be a stronger restraint by a divine hand upon some men than
          upon others. This principle runs through the whole stream of nature.
          The natural bent of every man’s heart is distant from God. When we
          attempt anything pleasing to God, it is like the climbing up a hill,
          against nature; when anything is displeasing to him, it is like a
          current running down the channel in its natural course; when we
          attempt anything that is an acknowledgment of the holiness of God, we
          are fain to rush, with arms in our hands, through a multitude of
          natural passions, and fight the way through the oppositions of our own
          sensitive appetite. How softly do we naturally sink down into that
          which sets us at a greater distance from God! There is no active,
          potent, efficacious sense of a God by nature. “The heart of the sons
          of men is fully set in them to do evil” (Eccl. viii. 11). The heart,
          in the singular number, as if there were but one common heart beat in
          all mankind, and bent, as with one pulse, with a joint consent and
          force to wickedness, without a sense of the authority of God in the
          earth, as if one heart acted every man in the world. The great apostle
          cites the text to verify the charge he brought against all mankind.143
          In his interpretation, the Jews, who owned one God, and were dignified
          with special privileges, as well as the Gentiles that maintained many
          gods, are within the compass of this character. The apostle leaves out
          the first part of the text, “The fool hath said in his heart,” but
          takes in the latter part, and the verses following. He charges all,
          because all, every man of them, was under sin—“There is none that
          seeks God;” and, ver. 19, he adds, “What the law saith, it speaks to
          those that are under the law,” that none should imagine he included
          only the Gentiles, and exempted the Jews from this description. The
          leprosy of atheism had infected the whole mass of human nature. No
          man, among Jews or Gentiles, did naturally seek God; and, therefore,
          all were void of any spark of the practical sense of the Deity. The
          effects of this atheism are not in all externally of an equal size;
          yet, in the fundamentals and radicals of it, there is not a hair’s
          difference between the best and the worst men that ever traversed the
          world. The distinction is laid either in common grace, bounding and
          suppressing it; or in special grace, killing and crucifying it. It is
          in every one either triumphant or militant, reigning or deposed. No
          man is any more born with sensible acknowledgments of God, than he is
          born with a clear knowledge of the nature of all the stars in the
          heavens, or plants upon the earth. None seeks after God.144 None seek
          God as his rule, as his end, as his happiness, which is a debt the
          creature naturally owes to God. He desires no communion with God; he
          places his happiness in anything inferior to God; he prefers
          everything before him, glorifies everything above him; he hath no
          delight to know him; he regards not those paths which lead to him; he
          loves his own filth better than God’s holiness; his actions are
          tinctured and dyed with self, and are void of that respect which is
          due from him to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The noblest faculty of man, his understanding, wherein the remaining
          lineaments of the image of God are visible; the highest operation of
          that faculty, which is wisdom, is, in the judgment of the Spirit of
          God, devilish, whilst it is earthly and sensual;145 and the wisdom of
          the best man is no better by nature; a legion of impure spirits
          possess it; devilish, as the devil, who, though he believe there is a
          God, yet acts as if there were none, and wishes he had no superior to
          prescribe him a law, and inflict that punishment upon him which his
          crimes have merited. Hence the poison of man by nature is said to be
          like the poison of a serpent,146 alluding to that serpentine
          temptation which first infected mankind, and changed the nature of man
          into the likeness of that of the devil; so that, notwithstanding the
          harmony of the world, that presents men not only with the notice of
          the being of a God, but darts into their minds some remarks of his
          power and eternity; yet the thoughts and reasonings of man are so
          corrupt, as may well be called diabolical, and as contrary to the
          perfection of God, and the original law of their nature, as the
          actings of the devil are; for since every natural man is a child of
          the devil, and is acted by the diabolical spirit, he must needs have
          that nature which his father hath, and the infusion of that venom
          which the spirit that acts him is possessed with, though the full
          discovery of it may be restrained by various circumstances (Eph. ii.
          2). To conclude: though no man, or at least very few, arrive to a
          round and positive conclusion in their hearts that there is no God,
          yet there is no man that naturally hath in his heart any reverence of
          God. In general, before I come to a particular proof, take some
          propositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. Actions are a greater discovery of a principle than words.
          The testimony of works is louder and clearer than that of words; and
          the frame of men’s hearts must be measured rather by what they do than
          by what they say. There may be a mighty distance between the tongue
          and the heart, but a course of actions is as little guilty of lying as
          interest is, according to our common saying. All outward impieties are
          the branches of an atheism at the root of our nature, as all
          pestilential sores are expressions of the contagion in the blood; sin
          is therefore frequently called ungodliness in our English dialect.
          Men’s practices are the best indexes of their principles: the current
          of a man’s life is the counterpart of the frame of his heart. Who can
          deny an error in the spring or wheels, when he perceives an error in
          the hand of the dial? Who can deny an atheism in the heart, when so
          much is visible in the life? The taste of the water discovers what
          mineral it is strained through. A practical denial of God is worse
          than a verbal, because deeds have usually more of deliberation than
          words; words may be the fruit of a passion, but a set of evil actions
          are the fruit and evidence of a predominant evil principle in the
          heart. All slighting words of a prince do not argue an habitual
          treason; but a succession of overt treasonable attempts signify a
          settled treasonable disposition in the mind. Those, therefore, are
          more deservedly termed atheists, who acknowledge a God, and walk as if
          there were none, than those (if there can be any such) that deny a
          God, and walk as if there were one. A sense of God in the heart would
          burst out in the life; where there is no reverence of God in the life,
          it is easily concluded there is less in the heart. What doth not
          influence a man when it hath the addition of the eyes, and censures of
          outward spectators, and the care of a reputation (so much the god of
          the world) to strengthen it and restrain the action, must certainly
          have less power over the heart when it is single, without any other
          concurrence. The flames breaking out of a house discover the fire to
          be much stronger and fiercer within. The apostle judgeth those of the
          circumcision, who gave heed to Jewish fables, to be deniers of God,
          though he doth not tax them with any notorious profaneness: (Tit. i.
          16), “They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him.” He
          gives them epithets contrary to what they arrogated to themselves.147
          They boasted themselves to be holy; the apostle calls them abominable:
          they bragged that they fulfilled the law, and observed the traditions
          of their fathers; the apostle calls them disobedient, or
          unpersuadable: they boasted that they only had the rule of
          righteousness, and a sound judgment concerning it; the apostle said
          they had a reprobate sense, and unfit for any good work; and judges
          against all their vain‑glorious brags, that they had not a reverence
          of God in their hearts; there was more of the denial of God in their
          works than there was acknowledgment of God in their words. Those that
          have neither God in their thoughts, nor in their tongues, nor in their
          works, cannot properly be said to acknowledge him. Where the honor of
          God is not practically owned in the lives of men, the being of God is
          not sensibly acknowledged in the hearts of men. The principle must be
          of the same kind with the actions; if the actions be atheistical, the
          principle of them can be no better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. All sin is founded in a secret atheism. Atheism is the
          spirit of every sin; all the floods of impieties in the world break in
          at the gate of a secret atheism, and though several sins may disagree
          with one another, yet, like Herod and Pilate against Christ, they join
          hand in hand against the interest of God. Though lusts and pleasures
          be diverse, yet they are all united in disobedience to him.148 All the
          wicked inclinations in the heart, and struggling motions, secret
          repinings, self‑applauding confidences in our own wisdom, strength,
          &amp;c., envy, ambition, revenge, are sparks from this latent fire;
          the language of every one of these is, I would be a Lord to myself,
          and would not have a God superior to me. The variety of sins against
          the first and second table, the neglects of God, and violences against
          man, are derived from this in the text; first, “The fool hath said in
          his heart,” and then follows a legion of devils. As all virtuous
          actions spring from an acknowledgment of God, so all vicious actions
          rise from a lurking denial of him: all licentiousness goes glib down
          where there is no sense of God. Abraham judged himself not secure from
          murder, nor his wife from defilement in Gerar, if there were no fear
          of God there.149 He that makes no conscience of sin has no regard to
          the honor, and, consequently, none to the being of God. “By the fear
          of God men depart from evil” (Prov. xvi. 6); by the non‑regarding of
          God men rush into evil. Pharaoh oppressed Israel because he “knew not
          the Lord.” If he did not deny the being of a Deity, yet he had such an
          unworthy notion of God as was inconsistent with the nature of a Deity;
          he, a poor creature, thought himself a mate for the Creator. In sins
          of omission we own not God, in neglecting to perform what he enjoins;
          in sins of commission we set up some lust in the place of God, and pay
          to that the homage which is due to our Maker. In both we disown him;
          in the one by not doing what he commands, in the other by doing what
          he forbids. We deny his sovereignty when we violate his laws; we
          disgrace his holiness when we cast our filth before his face; we
          disparage his wisdom when we set up another rule as the guide of our
          actions than that law he hath fixed; we slight his sufficiency when we
          prefer a satisfaction in sin before a happiness in him alone; and his
          goodness, when we judge it not strong enough to attract us to him.
          Every sin invades the rights of God, and strips him of one or other of
          his perfections. It is such a vilifying of God as if he were not God;
          as if he were not the supreme Creator and Benefactor of the world; as
          if we had not our being from him; as if the air we breathed in, the
          food we lived by, were our own by right of supremacy, not of donation.
          For a subject to slight his sovereign, is to slight his royalty; or a
          servant his master, is to deny his superiority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. III. Sin implies that God is unworthy of a being. Every sin is a
          kind of cursing God in the heart;150 an aim at the destruction of the
          being of God; not actually, but virtually; not in the intention of
          every sinner, but in the nature of every sin. That affection which
          excites a man to break His law, would excite him to annihilate his
          being if it were in his power. A man in every sin aims to set up his
          own will as his rule, and his own glory as the end of his actions
          against the will and glory of God; and could a sinner attain his end,
          God would be destroyed. God cannot outlive his will and his glory; God
          cannot have another rule but his own will, nor another end but his own
          honor. Sin is called a turning the back upon God,151 a kicking against
          him,152 as if he were a slighter person than the meanest beggar. What
          greater contempt can be shown to the meanest, vilest person, than to
          turn the back, lift up the heel, and thrust away with indignation? all
          which actions, though they signify that such a one hath a being, yet
          they testify also that he is unworthy of a being, that he is an
          unuseful being in the world, and that it were well the world were rid
          of him. All sin against knowledge is called a reproach of God.153
          Reproach is a vilifying a man as unworthy to be admitted into company.
          We naturally judge God unfit to be conversed with. God is the term
          turned from by a sinner; sin is the term turned to, which implies a
          greater excellency in the nature of sin than in the nature of God; and
          as we naturally judge it more worthy to have a being in our
          affections, so consequently more worthy to have a being in the world,
          than that infinite nature from whom we derive our beings and our all,
          and upon whom, with a kind of disdain, we turn our backs. Whosoever
          thinks the notion of a Deity unfit to be cherished in his mind by warm
          meditation, implies that he cares not whether he hath a being in the
          world or no. Now though the light of a Deity shines so clearly in man,
          and the stings of conscience are so smart, that he cannot absolutely
          deny the being of a God, yet most men endeavor to smother this
          knowledge, and make the notion of a God a sapless and useless thing
          (Rom. i. 28): “They like not to retain God in their knowledge.” It is
          said, “Cain went out from the presence of the Lord” (Gen. iv. 16);
          that is, from the worship of God. Our refusing or abhorring the
          presence of a man implies a carelessness whether he continue in the
          world or no; it is a using him as if he had no being, or as if we were
          not concerned in it. Hence all men in Adam, under the emblem of the
          prodigal, are said to go into a far country; not in respect of place,
          because of God’s omnipresence, but in respect of acknowledgment and
          affection: they mind and love anything but God. And the descriptions
          of the nations of the world, lying in the ruins of Adam’s fall, and
          the dregs of that revolt, is that they know not God. They forget God,
          as if there were no such being above them; and, indeed, he that doth
          the works of the devil, owns the devil to be more worthy of
          observance, and, consequently, of a being, than God, whose nature he
          forgets, and whose presence he abhors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. IV. Every sin in its own nature would render God a foolish and
          impure being. Many transgressors esteem their acts, which are contrary
          to the law of God, both wise and good: if so, the law against which
          they are committed, must be both foolish and impure. What a reflection
          is there, then, upon the Lawgiver! The moral law is not properly a
          mere act of God’s will considered in itself, or a tyrannical edict,
          like those of whom it may well be said, stat pro ratione voluntas: but
          it commands those things which are good in their own nature, and
          prohibits those things which are in their own nature evil; and
          therefore is an act of his wisdom and righteousness; the result of his
          wise counsel, and an extract of his pure nature; as all the laws of
          just lawgivers, are not only the acts of their will, but of a will
          governed by reason and justice, and for the good of the public,
          whereof they are conservators. If the moral commands of God were only
          acts of his will, and had not an intrinsic necessity, reason and
          goodness, God might have commanded the quite contrary, and made a
          contrary law, whereby that which we now call vice, might have been
          canonized for virtue: He might then have forbid any worship of him,
          love to him, fear of his name: He might then have commanded murders,
          thefts, adulteries. In the first he would have untied the link of duty
          from the creature, and dissolved the obligations of creatures to him,
          which is impossible to be conceived; for from the relation of a
          creature to God, obligations to God, and duties upon those
          obligations, do necessarily result. It had been against the rule of
          goodness and justice to have commanded the creature not to love him,
          and fear and obey him: this had been a command against righteousness,
          goodness, and intrinsic obligations to gratitude. And should murder,
          adulteries, rapines have been commanded instead of the contrary, God
          would have destroyed his own creation; he would have acted against the
          rule of goodness and order; he had been an unjust tyrannical governor
          of the world: public society would have been cracked in pieces, and
          the world become a shambles, a brothel‑house, a place below the common
          sentiments of a mere man. All sin, therefore, being against the law of
          God, the wisdom and holy rectitude of God’s nature is denied in every
          act of disobedience. And what is the consequence of this, but that God
          is both foolish and unrighteous in commanding that, which was neither
          an act of wisdom, as a governor, nor an act of goodness, as a
          benefactor to his creature? As was said before, presumptuous sins are
          called reproaches of God (Numb. xv. 30): “The soul that doth aught
          presumptuously reproacheth the Lord.” Reproaches of men are either for
          natural, moral, or intellectual defects. All reproaches of God must
          imply a charge, either of unrighteousness or ignorance: if of
          unrighteousness, it is a denial of his holiness; if of ignorance, it
          is a blemishing his wisdom. If God’s laws were not wise and holy, God
          would not enjoin them: and if they are so, we deny infinite wisdom and
          holiness in God by not complying with them. As when a man believes not
          God when he promises, he makes him a liar (1 John v. 10); so he that
          obeys not a wise and holy God commanding, makes him guilty either of
          folly or unrighteousness. Now, suppose you knew an absolute atheist
          who denied the being of a God, yet had a life free from any notorious
          spot or defilement; would you in reason count him so bad as the other
          that owns a God in being, yet lays, by his course of action, such a
          black imputation of folly and impurity upon the God he professeth to
          own—an imputation which renders any man a most despicable creature?
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. V. Sin in its own nature endeavors to render God the most
          miserable being. It is nothing but an opposition to the will of God:
          the will of no creature is so much contradicted as the will of God is
          by devils and men; and there is nothing under the heavens that the
          affections of human nature stand more point blank against, than
          against God. There is a slight of him in all the faculties of man; our
          souls are as unwilling to know him, as our wills are averse to follow
          him (Rom. viii. 7): “The carnal mind is enmity against God, it is not
          subject to the law of God, nor can be subject.” It is true, God’s will
          cannot be hindered of its effect, for then God would not be supremely
          blessed, but unhappy and miserable: all misery ariseth from a want of
          that which a nature would have, and ought to have: besides, if
          anything could frustrate God’s will, it would be superior to him: God
          would not be omnipotent, and so would lose the perfection of the
          Deity, and consequently the Deity itself; for that which did wholly
          defeat God’s will, would be more powerful than he. But sin is a
          contradiction to the will of God’s revelation, to the will of his
          precept: and therein doth naturally tend to a superiority over God,
          and would usurp his omnipotence, and deprive him of his blessedness.
          For if God had not an infinite power to turn the designs of it to his
          own glory, but the will of sin could prevail, God would be totally
          deprived of his blessedness. Doth not sin endeavor to subject God to
          the extravagant and contrary wills of men, and make him more a slave
          than any creature can be? For the will of no creature, not the meanest
          and most despicable creature, is so much crossed, as the will of God
          is by sin (Isa. xliii. 24): “Thou hast made me to serve with thy
          sins:” thou hast endeavored to make a mere slave of me by sin. Sin
          endeavors to subject the blessed God to the humor and lust of every
          person in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VI. Men sometimes in some circumstances do wish the not being of
          God. This some think to be the meaning of the text, “The fool hath
          said in his heart, There is no God,” that is, he wishes there were no
          God. Many tamper with their own hearts to bring them to a persuasion
          that there is no God: and when they cannot do that, they conjure up
          wishes that there were none. Men naturally have some conscience of
          sin, and some notices of justice (Rom. i. 32): “They know the judgment
          of God,” and they know the demerit of sin; “they know the judgment of
          God, and that they which do such things are worthy of death.” What is
          the consequent of this but fear of punishment; and what is the issue
          of that fear, but a wishing the Judge either unwilling or unable to
          vindicate the honor of his violated law? When God is the object of
          such a wish, it is a virtual undeifying of him: not to be able to
          punish, is to be impotent; not to be willing to punish, is to be
          unjust: imperfections inconsistent with the Deity. God cannot be
          supposed without an infinite power to act, and an infinite
          righteousness as the rule of acting. Fear of God is natural to all
          men; not a fear of offending him, but a fear of being punished by him:
          the wishing the extinction of God has its degree in men, according to
          the degree of their fears of his just vengeance: and though such a
          wish be not in its meridian but in the damned in hell, yet it hath its
          starts and motions in affrighted and awakened consciences on the
          earth: under this rank of wishers, that there were no God, or that God
          were destroyed, do fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Terrified consciences, that are Magor‑missabib, see nothing but
          matter of fear round about. As they have lived without the bounds of
          the law, they are afraid to fall under the stroke of his justice: fear
          wishes the destruction of that which it apprehends hurtful: it
          considers him as a God to whom vengeance belongs, as the Judge of all
          the earth.154 The less hopes such an one hath of his pardon, the more
          joy he would have to hear that his judge should be stripped of his
          life: he would entertain with delight any reasons that might support
          him in the conceit that there were no God: in his present state such a
          doctrine would be his security from an account: he would as much
          rejoice if there were no God to inflame an hell for him, as any guilty
          malefactor would if there were no judge to order a gibbet for him.
          Shame may bridle men’s words, but the heart will be casting about for
          some arguments this way, to secure itself: such as are at any time in
          Spira’s case, would be willing to cease to be creatures, that God
          might cease to be Judge. “The fool hath said in his heart, there is no
          Elohim, no Judge;” fancying God without any exercise of his judicial
          authority. And there is not any wicked man under anguish of spirit,
          but, were it within the reach of his power, would take away the life
          of God, and rid himself of his fears by destroying his Avenger.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Debauched persons are not without such wishes sometimes: an
          obstinate servant wishes his master’s death, from whom he expects
          correction for his debaucheries. As man stands in his corrupt nature,
          it is impossible but one time or other most debauched persons at least
          have some kind of velleities, or imperfect wishes. It is as natural to
          men to abhor those things which are unsuitable and troublesome, as it
          is to please themselves in things agreeable to their minds and humors;
          and since man is so deeply in love with sin, as to count it the most
          estimable good, he cannot but wish the abolition of that law which
          checks it, and, consequently, the change of the Lawgiver which enacted
          it; and in wishing a change in the holy nature of God, he wishes a
          destruction of God, who could not be God if he ceased to be immutably
          holy. They do as certainly wish that God had not a holy will to
          command them, as despairing souls wish that God had not a righteous
          will to punish them, and to wish conscience extinct for the
          molestations they receive from it, is to wish the power conscience
          represents out of the world also. Since the state of sinners is a
          state of distance from God, and the language of sinners to God is,
          “Depart from us;”155 they desire as little the continuance of his
          being, as they desire the knowledge of his ways; the same reason which
          moves them to desire God’s distance from them, would move them to
          desire God’s not being: since the greatest distance would be most
          agreeable to them, the destruction of God must be so too; because
          there is no greater distance from us, than in not being. Men would
          rather have God not to be, than themselves under control, that
          sensuality might range at pleasure; he is like a “heifer sliding from
          the yoke” (Hosea iv. 16). The cursing of God in the heart, feared by
          Job of his children, intimates a wishing God despoiled of his
          authority, that their pleasure might not be damped by his law.
          Besides, is there any natural man that sins against actuated
          knowledge, but either thinks or wishes that God might not see him,
          that God might not know his actions? And is not this to wish the
          destruction of God, who could not be God unless he were immense and
          omniscient?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Under this rank fall those who perform external duties only out of
          a principle of slavish fear. Many men perform those duties that the
          law enjoins, with the same sentiments that slaves perform their
          drudgery; and are constrained in their duties by no other
          considerations but those of the whip and the cudgel. Since, therefore,
          they do it with reluctancy, and secretly murmur while they seem to
          obey, they would be willing that both the command were recalled, and
          the master that commands them were in another world. The spirit of
          adoption makes men act towards God as a father, a spirit of bondage
          only eyes him as a judge. Those that look upon their superiors as
          tyrannical, will not be much concerned in their welfare; and would be
          more glad to have their nails pared, than be under perpetual fear of
          them. Many men regard not the Infinite Goodness in the service of him,
          but consider him as cruel, tyrannical, injurious to their liberty.
          Adam’s posterity are not free from the sentiments of their common
          father, till they are regenerate. You know what conceit was the hammer
          whereby the hellish Jael struck the nail into our first parents, which
          conveyed death, together with the same imagination to all their
          posterity (Gen. iii. 5): “God knows that in the day you eat thereof,
          your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and
          evil.” Alas, poor souls! God knew what he did when he forbade you that
          fruit; he was jealous you should be too happy; it was cruelty in him
          to deprive you of a food so pleasant and delicious. The apprehension
          of the severity of God’s commands riseth up no less in desires that
          there were no God over us, than Adam’s apprehension of envy in God for
          the restraint of one tree, moved him to attempt to be equal with God:
          fear is as powerful to produce the one in his posterity, as pride was
          to produce the other in the common root. When we apprehend a thing
          hurtful to us, we desire so much evil to it, as may render it
          incapable of doing us the hurt we fear. As we wish the preservation of
          what we love or hope for, so we are naturally apt to wish the not
          being of that whence we fear some hurt or trouble. We must not
          understand this as if any man did formally wish the destruction of
          God, as God. God in himself is an infinite mirror of goodness and
          ravishing loveliness; he is infinitely good, and so universally good,
          and nothing but good; and is therefore so agreeable to a creature, as
          a creature, that it is impossible that the creature, while it bears
          itself to God as a creature, should be guilty of this, but thirst
          after him and cherish every motion to him. As no man wishes the
          destruction of any creature, as a creature, but as it may conduce to
          something which he counts may be beneficial to himself; so no man
          doth, nor perhaps can wish the cessation of the being of God, as God;
          for then he must wish his own being to cease also; but as he considers
          him clothed with some perfections, which he apprehends as injurious to
          him, as his holiness in forbidding sin, his justice in punishing sin;
          and God being judged in those perfections, contrary to what the
          revolted creature thinks convenient and good for himself, he may wish
          God stripped of those perfections, that thereby he may be free from
          all fear of trouble and grief from him in his fallen state. In wishing
          God deprived of those, he wishes God deprived of his being; because
          God cannot retain his deity without a love of righteousness, and
          hatred of iniquity; and he could not testify his love to the one, or
          his loathing of the other, without encouraging goodness, and
          witnessing his anger against iniquity. Let us now appeal to ourselves,
          and examine our own consciences. Did we never please ourselves
          sometimes in the thoughts, how happy we should be, how free in our
          vain pleasures, if there were no God? Have we not desired to be our
          own lords, without control, subject to no law but our own, and be
          guided by no will but that of the flesh? Did we never rage against God
          under his afflicting hand? Did we never wish God stripped of his holy
          will to command, and his righteous will to punish? &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus much for the general. For the proof of this, many considerations
          will bring in evidence; most may be reduced to these two generals: Man
          would set himself up, first, as his own rule; secondly, as his own end
          and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Man would set himself up as his own rule instead of God. This will
          be evidenced in this method.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man naturally disowns the rule God sets him. 2. He owns any other
          rule rather than that of God’s prescribing. 3. These he doth in order
          to the setting himself up as his own rule. 4. He makes himself not
          only his own rule, but he would make himself the rule of God, and give
          laws to his Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Man naturally disowns the rule God sets him. It is all one to
          deny his royalty, and to deny his being. When we disown his authority,
          we disown his Godhead. It is the right of God to be the sovereign of
          his creatures, and it must be a very loose and trivial assent that
          such men have to God’s superiority over them, (and consequently to the
          excellency of his being, upon which that authority is founded) who are
          scarce at ease in themselves, but when they are invading his rights,
          breaking his bands, casting away his cords, and contradicting his
          will. Every man naturally is a son of Belial, would be without a yoke,
          and leap over God’s enclosures; and in breaking out against his
          sovereignty, we disown his being, as God, for to be God and sovereign
          are inseparable; he could not be God, if he were not supreme; nor
          could he be a Creator without being a Lawgiver. To be God and yet
          inferior to another, is a contradiction. To make rational creatures
          without prescribing them a law, is to make them without holiness,
          wisdom and goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is in man naturally an unwillingness to have any acquaintance
          with the rule God sets him (Psalm xiv. 2): “None that did understand
          and seek God.” The refusing instruction and casting his Word behind
          the back is a part of atheism.156 We are heavy in hearing the
          instructions either of law or gospel,157 and slow in the apprehension
          of what we hear. The people that God had hedged in from the wilderness
          of the world for his own garden, were foolish and did not know God;
          were sottish and had no understanding of him.158 The law of God is
          accounted a strange thing;159 a thing of a different climate, and a
          far country from the heart of man; wherewith the mind of man had no
          natural acquaintance, and had no desire to have any; or they regarded
          it as a sordid thing: what God accounts great and valuable, they
          account mean and despicable. Men may show a civility to a stranger,
          but scarce contract an intimacy: there can be no amicable agreement
          between the holy will of God and the heart of a depraved creature: one
          is holy, the other unholy; one is universally good, the other stark
          naught. The purity of the Divine rule renders it nauseous to the
          impurity of a carnal heart. Water and fire may as well friendly kiss
          each other and live together without quarrelling and hissing, as the
          holy will of God and the unregenerate heart of a fallen creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nauseating a holy rule is an evidence of atheism in the heart, as
          the nauseating wholesome food is of putrefied phlegm in the stomach.
          It is found more or less in every Christian, in the remainders, though
          not in a full empire. As there is a law in his mind whereby he
          delights in the law of God, so there is a law in his members whereby
          he wars against the law of God (Rom. vii. 22, 23, 25). How predominant
          is this loathing of the law of God, when corrupt nature is in its full
          strength, without any principle to control it! There is in the mind of
          such a one a darkness, whereby it is ignorant of it, and in the will a
          depravedness, whereby it is repugnant to it. If man were naturally
          willing and able to have an intimate acquaintance with, and delight in
          the law of God, it had not been such a signal favor for God to promise
          to “write the law in the heart.” A man may sooner engrave the
          chronicle of a whole nation, or all the records of God in the
          Scripture upon the hardest marble with his bare finger, than write one
          syllable of the law of God in a spiritual manner upon his heart. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Men are negligent in using the means for the knowledge of God’s
          will. All natural men are fools, who know not how to use the price God
          puts into their hands;160 they put not a due estimate upon
          opportunities and means of grace, and account that law folly which is
          the birth of an infinite and holy wisdom. The knowledge of God which
          they may glean from creatures, and is more pleasant to the natural
          gust of men, is not improved to the glory of God, if we will believe
          the indictment the apostle brings against the Gentiles.161 And most of
          those that have dived into the depths of nature, have been more
          studious of the qualities of the creatures, than of the excellency of
          the nature, or the discovery of the mind of God in them; who regard
          only the rising and motions of the star, but follow not with the wise
          men, its conduct to the King of the Jews. How often do we see men
          filled with an eager thirst for all other kind of knowledge, that
          cannot acquiesce in a twilight discovery, but are inquisitive into the
          causes and reasons of effects, yet are contented with a weak and
          languishing knowledge of God and his law, and are easily tired with
          the proposals of them! He now that nauseates the means whereby he may
          come to know and obey God, has no intention to make the law of God his
          rule. There is no man that intends seriously an end, but he intends
          means in order to that end: as when a man intends the preservation or
          recovery of his health, he will intend means in order to those ends,
          otherwise he cannot be said to intend his health; so he that is not
          diligent in using means to know the mind of God, has no sound
          intention to make the will and law of God his rule. Is not the inquiry
          after the will of God made a work by the bye, and fain to lacquey
          after other concerns of an inferior nature, if it hath any place at
          all in the soul? which is a despising the being of God. The notion of
          the sovereignty of God bears the same date with the notion of his
          Godhead; and by the same way that he reveals himself, he reveals his
          authority over us: whether it be by creatures without, or conscience
          within. All authority over rational creatures consists in commanding
          and directing: the duty of rational creatures in compliance with that
          authority consists in obeying. Where there is therefore a careless
          neglect of those means which convey the knowledge of God’s will and
          our duty, there is an utter disowning of God as our Sovereign and our
          rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) When any part of the mind and will of God breaks in upon men,
          they endeavor to shake it off: as a man would a sergeant that comes to
          arrest him, “they like not to retain God in their knowledge” (Rom. i.
          28). “A natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God;”
          that is, into his affection; he pusheth them back as men do
          troublesome and importunate beggars: they have no kindness to bestow
          upon it: they thrust with both shoulders against the truth of God,
          when it presseth in upon them; and dash as much contempt upon it as
          the Pharisees did upon the doctrine our Saviour directed against their
          covetousness. As men naturally delight to be without God in the world,
          so they delight to be without any offspring of God in their thoughts.
          Since the spiritual palate of man is depraved, divine truth is
          unsavory and ungrateful to us, till our taste and relish is restored
          by grace: hence men damp and quench the motions of the Spirit to
          obedience and compliance with the dictates of God; strip them of their
          life and vigor, and kill them in the womb. How unable are our memories
          to retain the substance of spiritual truth; but like sand in a glass,
          put in at one part and runs out at the other! Have not many a secret
          wish, that the Scripture had never mentioned some truths, or that they
          were blotted out of the Bible, because they face their consciences,
          and discourage those boiling lusts they would with eagerness and
          delight pursue? Methinks that interruption John gives our Saviour when
          he was upon the reproof of their pride, looks little better than a
          design to divert him from a discourse so much against the grain, by
          telling him a story of their prohibiting one to cast out devils,
          because he followed not them.162 How glad are men when they can raise
          a battery against a command of God, and raise some smart objection
          whereby they may shelter themselves from the strictness of it!
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) When men cannot shake off the notices of the will and mind of
          God, they have no pleasure in the consideration of them; which could
          not possibly be, if there were a real and fixed design to own the mind
          and law of God as our rule. Subjects or servants that love to obey
          their prince and master, will delight to read and execute their
          orders. The devils understand the law of God in their minds, but they
          loathe the impressions of it upon their wills: those miserable spirits
          are bound in chains of darkness, evil habits in their wills, that they
          have not a thought of obeying that law they know. It was an unclean
          beast under the law that did not chew the cud: it is a corrupt heart
          that doth not chew truth by meditation. A natural man is said not to
          know God, or the things of God; he may know them nationally, but he
          knows them not affectionately. A sensual soul can have no delight in a
          spiritual law. To be sensual and not to have the Spirit are
          inseparable (Jude 19). Natural men may indeed meditate upon the law
          and truth of God, but without delight in it; if they take any pleasure
          in it, it is only as it is knowledge, not as it is a rule; for we
          delight in nothing that we desire, but upon the same account that we
          desire it. Natural men desire to know God and some part of his will
          and law, not out of a sense of their practical excellency, but a
          natural thirst after knowledge: and if they have a delight, it is in
          the act of knowing, not in the object known, not in the duties that
          stream from that knowledge; they design the furnishing their
          understandings, not the quickening their affections,—like idle boys
          that strike fire, not to warm themselves by the heat, but sport
          themselves with the sparks; whereas a gracious soul accounts not only
          his meditation, or the operations of his soul about God and his will
          to be sweet, but he hath a joy in the object of that meditation.163
          Many have the knowledge of God, who have no delight in him or his
          will. Owls have eyes to perceive that there is a sun, but by reason of
          the weakness of their sight have no pleasure to look upon a beam of
          it: so neither can a man by nature love, or delight in the will of
          God, because of his natural corruption. That law that riseth up in men
          for conviction and instruction, they keep down under the power of
          corruption; making their souls not the sanctuary, but prison of truth
          (Rom. i. 18). They will keep it down in their hearts, if they cannot
          keep it out of their heads, and will not endeavor to know and taste
          the spirit of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) There is, further, a rising and swelling of the heart against the
          will of God. 1st. Internal. God’s law cast against a hard heart, is
          like a ball thrown against a stone wall, by reason of the resistance
          rebounding the further from it; the meeting of a divine truth and the
          heart of man, is like the meeting of two tides, the weaker swells and
          foams. We have a natural antipathy against a divine rule, and
          therefore when it is clapped close to our consciences, there is a
          snuffing at it, high reasonings against it, corruption breaks out more
          strongly: as water poured on lime sets it on fire by an
          antiperistasis, and the more water is cast upon it, the more furiously
          it burns; or as the sunbeams shining upon a dunghill make the steams
          the thicker, and the stench the noisomer, neither being the positive
          cause of the smoke in the lime, or the stench in the dunghill, but by
          accident the causes of the eruption: (Rom. vii. 8), “But sin taking
          occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of
          concupiscence, for without the law sin was dead.” Sin was in a
          languishing posture, as if it were dead, like a lazy garrison in a
          city, till, upon an alarm from the adversary, it takes arms, and
          revives its courage; all the sin in the heart gathers together its
          force to maintain its standing, like the vapors of the night, which
          unite themselves more closely to resist the beams of the rising sun.
          Deep conviction often provokes fierce opposition; sometimes disputes
          against a divine rule end in blasphemies: (Acts xiii. 45),
          “contradicting and blaspheming” are coupled together. Men naturally
          desire things that are forbidden, and reject things commanded, from
          the corruption of nature, which affects an unbounded liberty, and is
          impatient of returning under that yoke it hath shaken off, and
          therefore rageth against the bars of the law, as the waves roar
          against the restraint of a bank. When the understanding is dark, and
          the mind ignorant, sin lies as dead; “A man scarce knows he hath such
          motions of concupiscence in him, he finds not the least breath of
          wind, but a full calm in his soul; but when he is awakened by the law,
          then the viciousness of nature being sensible of an invasion of its
          empire, arms itself against the divine law, and the more the command
          is urged, the more vigorously it bends its strength, and more
          insolently lifts up itself against it;”164 he perceives more and more
          atheistical lusts than before; “all manner of concupiscence,” more
          leprous and contagious than before. When there are any motions to turn
          to God, a reluctancy is presently perceived; atheistical thoughts
          bluster in the mind like the wind, they know not whence they come, nor
          whither they go; so unapt is the heart to any acknowledgment of God as
          his ruler, and any re‑union with him. Hence men are said to resist the
          Holy Ghost (Acts vii. 51), to fall against it, as the word signifies,
          as a stone, or any ponderous body falls against that which lies in its
          way: they would dash to pieces, or grind to powder that very motion
          which is made for their instruction, and the Spirit too which makes
          it, and that not from a fit of passion, but an habitual repugnance;
          “Ye always resist,” &amp;c. 2d. External. It is a fruit of atheism in
          the fourth verse of this psalm, “Who eat up my people as they eat
          bread.” How do the revelations of the mind of God meet with
          opposition! and the carnal world like dogs bark against the shining of
          the moon; so much men hate the light, that they spurn at the lanthorns
          that bear it; and because they cannot endure the treasure, often fling
          the earthen vessels against the ground wherein it is held. If the
          entrance of truth render the market worse for Diana’s shrines, the
          whole city will be in an uproar.165 When Socrates upon natural
          principles confuted the heathen idolatry, and asserted the unity of
          God, the whole cry of Athens, a learned university, is against him;
          and because he opposed the public received religion, though with an
          undoubted truth, he must end his life by violence. How hath every
          corner of the world steamed with the blood of those that would
          maintain the authority of God in the world! The devil’s children will
          follow the steps of their father, and endeavor to bruise the heel of
          divine truth, that would endeavor to break the head of corrupt lust.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Men often seem desirous to be acquainted with the will of God,
          not out of any respect to his will, and to make it their rule, but
          upon some other consideration. Truth is scarce received as truth.
          There is more of hypocrisy than sincerity in the pale of the church,
          and attendance on the mind of God. The outward dowry of a religious
          profession, makes it often more desirable than the beauty. Judas was a
          follower of Christ for the bag, not out of any affection to the divine
          revelation. Men sometime pretend a desire to be acquainted with the
          will of God, to satisfy their own passions, rather than to conform to
          God’s will; the religion of such is not the judgment of the man, but
          the passion of the brute. Many entertain a doctrine for the person’s
          sake, rather than a person for the doctrine’s sake, and believe a
          thing because it comes from a man they esteem, as if his lips were
          more canonical than Scripture. The Apostle implies in the commendation
          he gives the Thessalonians,166 that some receive the word for human
          interest, not as it is in truth the word and will of God to command
          and govern their consciences by its sovereign authority; or else they
          have the “truth of God” (as St. James speaks of the faith of Christ)
          “with respect of persons;”167 and receive it not for the sake of the
          fountain, but of the channel; so that many times the same truth
          delivered by another, is disregarded, which, when dropping from the
          fancy and mouth of a man’s own idol, is cried up as an oracle. This is
          to make not God, but man the rule; for though we entertain that which
          materially is the truth of God, yet not formally as his truth, but as
          conveyed by one we affect; and that we receive a truth and not an
          error, we owe the obligation to the honesty of the instrument, and not
          to the strength and clearness of our own judgment. Wrong
          considerations may give admittance to an unclean, as well as a clean
          beast into the ark of the soul. That which is contrary to the mind of
          God, may be entertained, as well as that which is agreeable. It is all
          one to such that have no respect to God, what they have, as it is all
          one to a sponge to suck up the foulest water or the sweetest wine,
          when either is applied to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) Many that entertain the notions of the will and mind of God,
          admit them with unsettled and wavering affections. There is a great
          levity in the heart of man. The Jews that one day applaud our Saviour
          with hosannahs as their king, vote his crucifixion the next, and use
          him as a murderer. We begin in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Our
          hearts, like lute‑strings, are changed with every change of weather,
          with every appearance of a temptation; scarce one motion of God in a
          thousand prevails with us for a settled abode. It is a hard task to
          make a signature of those truths upon our affections, which will with
          ease pass current with our understandings; our affections will as soon
          lose them, as our understandings embrace them. The heart of man is
          “unstable as water.”168 Some were willing to rejoice in John’s light,
          which reflected a lustre on their minds; but not in his heat, which
          would have conveyed a warmth to their hearts; and the light was
          pleasing to them but for a season,169 while their corruptions lay as
          if they were dead, not when they were awakened. Truth may be admitted
          one day, and the next day rejected; as Austin saith of a wicked man,
          he loves the truth shining, but he hates the truth reproving. This is
          not to make God, but our own humor, our rule and measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7.) Many desire an acquaintance with the law and truth of God, with a
          design to improve some lust by it; to turn the word of God to be a
          pander to the breach of his law. This is so far from making God’s will
          our rule, that we make our own vile affections the rule of his law.
          How many forced interpretations of Scripture have been coined to give
          content to the lusts of men, and the divine rule forced to bend, and
          be squared to men’s loose and carnal apprehensions! It is a part of
          the instability or falseness of the heart, to “wrest the Scriptures to
          their own destruction;”170 which they could not do, if they did not
          first wring them to countenance some detestable error or filthy crime.
          In Paradise the first interpretation made of the first law of God, was
          point blank against the mind of the Lawgiver, and venomous to the
          whole race of mankind. Paul himself feared that some might put his
          doctrine of grace to so ill a use, as to be an altar and sanctuary to
          shelter their presumption (Rom. vi. 1, 15): “Shall we then continue in
          sin, that grace may abound?” Poisonous consequences are often drawn
          from the sweetest truths; as when God’s patience is made a topic
          whence to argue against his providence,171 or an encouragement to
          commit evil more greedily; as though because he had not presently a
          revenging hand, he had not an all‑seeing eye: or when the doctrine of
          justification by faith is made use of to depress a holy life; or God’s
          readiness to receive returning sinners, an encouragement to defer
          repentance till a death‑bed. A liar will hunt for shelter in the
          reward God gave the midwives that lied to Pharaoh for the preservation
          of the males of Israel, and Rahab’s saving the spies by false
          intelligence. God knows how to distinguish between grace and
          corruption, that may lie close together; or between something of moral
          goodness and moral evil, which may be mixed; we find their fidelity
          rewarded, which was a moral good; but not their lie approved, which
          was a moral evil. Nor will Christ’s conversing with sinners, be a plea
          for any to thrust themselves into evil company. Christ conversed with
          sinners, as a physician with diseased persons, to cure them, not
          approve them; others with profligate persons, to receive infection
          from them, not to communicate holiness to them. Satan’s children have
          studied their father’s art, who wanted not perverted Scripture to
          second his temptations against our Saviour.172 How often do carnal
          hearts turn divine revelation to carnal ends, as the sea fresh water
          into salt! As men subject the precepts of God to carnal interests, so
          they subject the truths of God to carnal fancies. When men will
          allegorize the word, and make a humorous and crazy fancy the
          interpreter of divine oracles, and not the Spirit speaking in the
          word; this is to enthrone our own imaginations as the rule of God’s
          law, and depose his law from being the rule of our reason; this is to
          rifle truth of its true mind and intent. ’Tis more to rob a man of his
          reason, the essential constitutive part of man, than of his estate;
          this is to refuse an intimate acquaintance with his will. We shall
          never tell what is the matter of a precept, or the matter of a
          promise, if we impose a sense upon it contrary to the plain meaning of
          it; thereby we shall make the law of God to have a distinct sense
          according to the variety of men’s imaginations, and so make every
          man’s fancy a law to himself. Now that this unwillingness to have a
          spiritual acquaintance with divine truth is a disowning God as our
          rule, and a setting up self in his stead, is evident; because this
          unwillingness respects truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. As it is most spiritual and holy. A fleshly mind is most contrary
          to a spiritual law, and particularly as it is a searching and
          discovering law, that would dethrone all other rules in the soul. As
          men love to be without a holy God in the world, so they love to be
          without a holy law, the transcript and image of God’s holiness in
          their hearts; and without holy men, the lights kindled by the Father
          of lights. As the holiness of God, so the holiness of the law most
          offends a carnal heart (Isa. xxx. 11): “Cause the Holy One of Israel
          to cease from before us, prophesy to us right things.” They could not
          endure God as a holy one. Herein God places their rebellion, rejecting
          him as their rule (ver. 9), “Rebellious children, that will not hear
          the law of the Lord.” The more pure and precious any discovery of God
          is, the more it is disrelished by the world: as spiritual sins are
          sweetest to a carnal heart, so spiritual truths are most distasteful.
          The more of the brightness of the sun any beam conveys, the more
          offensive it is to a distempered eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. As it doth most relate to, or lead to God. The devil directs his
          fiercest batteries against those doctrines in the word, and those
          graces in the heart, which most exalt God, debase man, and bring men
          to the lowest subjection to their Creator; such is the doctrine and
          grace of justifying faith. That men hate not knowledge as knowledge,
          but as it directs them to choose the fear of the Lord, was the
          determination of the Holy Ghost long ago (Prov. i. 29): “For that they
          hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord.” Whatsoever
          respects God, clears up guilt, witnesses man’s revolt to him, rouseth
          up conscience, and moves to a return to God, a man naturally runs
          from, as Adam did from God, and seeks a shelter in some weak bushes of
          error, rather than appear before it. Not that men are unwilling to
          inquire into and contemplate some divine truths which lie furthest
          from the heart, and concern not themselves immediately with the
          rectifying the soul: they may view them with such a pleasure as some
          might take in beholding the miracles of our Saviour, who could not
          endure his searching doctrine. The light of speculation may be
          pleasant, but the light of conviction is grievous; that which galls
          their consciences, and would affect them with a sense of their duty to
          God. Is it not easy to perceive, that when a man begins to be serious
          in the concerns of the honor of God and the duty of his soul, he feels
          a reluctancy within him, even against the pleas of conscience; which
          evidenceth that some unworthy principle has got footing in the hearts
          of men, which fights against the declarations of God without, and the
          impressions of the law of God within, at the same time when a man’s
          own conscience takes part with it, which is the substance of the
          apostle’s discourse, Rom. vii. 15, 16, &amp;c. Close discourses of the
          honor of God, and our duty to him, are irksome when men are upon a
          merry pin: they are like a damp in a mine, that takes away their
          breath; they shuffle them out as soon as they can, and are as
          unwilling to retain the speech of them in their mouths, as the
          knowledge of them in their hearts. Gracious speeches, instead of
          bettering many men, distemper them, as sometimes sweet perfumes affect
          a weak head with aches.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. As it is most contrary to self. Men are unwilling to acquaint
          themselves with any truth that leads to God, because it leads from
          self. Every part of the will of God is more or less displeasing, as it
          sounds harsh against some carnal interest men would set above God, or
          as a mate with him. Man cannot desire any intimacy with that law which
          he regards as a bird of prey, to pick out his right eye or gnaw off
          his right hand, his lust dearer than himself. The reason we have such
          hard thoughts of God’s will is, because we have such high thoughts of
          ourselves. It is a hard matter to believe or will that which hath no
          affinity with some principle in the understanding, and no interest in
          our will and passions: our unwillingness to be acquainted with the
          will of God ariseth from the disproportion between that and our
          corrupt hearts; “We are alienated from the life of God in our minds”
          (Eph. iv. 18, 19). As we live not like God, so we neither think or
          will as God; there is an antipathy in the heart of man against that
          doctrine which teaches us to deny ourselves and be under the rule of
          another; but whatsoever favors the ambition, lusts, and profits of
          men, is easy entertainable. Many are fond of those sciences which may
          enrich their understandings, and grate not upon their sensual
          delights. Many have an admirable dexterity in finding out
          philosophical reasons, mathematical demonstrations, or raising
          observations upon the records of history; and spend much time and many
          serious and affectionate thoughts in the study of them. In those they
          have not immediately to do with God, their beloved pleasures are not
          impaired; it is a satisfaction to self without the exercise of any
          hostility against it. But had those sciences been against self, as
          much as the law and will of God, they had long since been rooted out
          of the world. Why did the young man turn his back upon the law of
          Christ? because of his worldly self. Why did the Pharisees mock at the
          doctrine of our Saviour, and not at their own traditions? because of
          covetous self. Why did the Jews slight the person of our Saviour and
          put him to death, after the reading so many credentials of his being
          sent from heaven? because of ambitious self, that the Romans might not
          come and take away their kingdom. If the law of God were fitted to the
          humors of self, it would be readily and cordially observed by all men:
          self is the measure of a world of seeming religious actions; while God
          seems to be the object, and his law the motive, self is the rule and
          end (Zech. vii. 5): “Did you fast unto me,” &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As men discover their disowning the will of God as a rule by
          unwillingness to be acquainted with it, so they discover it, by the
          contempt of it after they cannot avoid the notions and some
          impressions of it. The rule of God is burthensome to a sinner; he
          flies from it as from a frightful bugbear, and unpleasant yoke: sin
          against the knowledge of the law is therefore called a going back from
          the commandment of God’s lips (Job xxiii. 12): “A casting God’s word
          behind them,”173 as a contemptible thing, fitter to be trodden in the
          dirt than lodged in the heart; nay it is a casting it off as an
          abominable thing, for so the word זנח signifies, Hos. viii. 3. “Israel
          hath cast off the thing that is good;” an utter refusal of God (Jer.
          xliv. 16): “As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name
          of the Lord, we will not hearken.” In the slight of his precepts his
          essential perfections are slighted. In disowning his will as a rule,
          we disown all those attributes which flow from his will, as goodness,
          righteousness, and truth. As an act of the divine understanding is
          supposed to precede the act of the divine will, so we slight the
          infinite reason of God. Every law, though it proceeds from the will of
          the lawgiver, and doth formally consist in an act of the will, yet it
          doth pre‑suppose an act of the understanding. If the commandment be
          holy, just, and good, as it is (Rom. vii. 12); if it be the image of
          God’s holiness, a transcript of his righteousness, and the efflux of
          his goodness; then in every breach of it, dirt is cast upon those
          attributes which shine in it; and a slight of all the regards he hath
          to his own honor, and all the provisions he makes for his creature.
          This atheism, or contempt of God, is more taken notice of by God than
          the matter of the sin itself; as a respect to God in a weak and
          imperfect obedience is more than the matter of the obedience itself,
          because it is an acknowledgment of God; so a contempt of God in an act
          of disobedience, is more than the matter of the disobedience. The
          creature stands in such an act not only in a posture of distance from
          God, but defiance of him; it was not the bare act of murder and
          adultery which Nathan charged upon David, but the atheistical
          principle which spirited those evil acts. The despising the
          commandment of the Lord was the venom of them.174 It is possible to
          break a law without contempt; but when men pretend to believe there is
          a God, and that this is the law of God, it shows a contempt of his
          majesty:175 men naturally account God’s laws too strict, his yoke too
          heavy, and his limits too strait; and he that liveth in a contempt of
          this law, curseth God in his life. How can they believe there is a
          God, who despise him as a ruler? How can they believe him to be a
          guide, that disdain to follow him? To think we firmly believe a God
          without living conformable to his law, is an idle and vain
          imagination. The true and sensible notion of a God cannot subsist with
          disorder and an affected unrighteousness. This contempt is seen,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In any presumptuous breach of any part of his law. Such sins are
          frequently called in Scripture, rebellions, which are a denial of the
          allegiance we owe to him. By a wilful refusal of his right in one
          part, we root up the foundation of that rule he doth justly challenge
          over us; his right is as extensive to command us in one thing, as in
          another; and if it be disowned in one thing, it is virtually disowned
          in all, and the whole statute book of God is contemned (James ii. 10,
          11): “Whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point,
          is guilty of all.” A willing breaking one part, though there be a
          willing observance of all the other points of it, is a breach of the
          whole; because the authority of God, which gives sanction to the
          whole, is slighted: the obedience to the rest is dissembled: for the
          love, which is the root of all obedience, is wanting; for “love is the
          fulfilling the whole law.”176 The rest are obeyed because they cross
          not carnal desire so much as the other, and so it is an observance of
          himself, not of God. Besides, the authority of God, which is not
          prevalent to restrain us from the breach of one point, would be of as
          little force with us to restrain us from the breach of all the rest,
          did the allurements of the flesh give us as strong a diversion from
          the one as from the other; and though the command that is transgressed
          be the least in the whole law, yet the authority which enjoins it is
          the same with that which enacts the greatest: and it is not so much
          the matter of the command, as the authority commanding which lays the
          obligation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the natural averseness to the declarations of God’s will and
          mind, which way soever they tend. Since man affected to be as God, he
          desires to be boundless; he would not have fetters, though they be
          golden ones, and conduce to his happiness. Though the law of God be a
          strength to them, yet they will not (Isa. xxx. 15): “In returning
          shall be your strength, and you would not.” They would not have a
          bridle to restrain them from running into the pit, nor be hedged in by
          the law, though for their security; as if they thought it too slavish
          and low‑spirited a thing to be guided by the will of another. Hence
          man is compared to a wild ass, that loves to “snuff up the wind in the
          wilderness at her pleasure,” rather than come under the guidance of
          God;177 from whatsoever quarter of the heavens you pursue her she will
          run to the other. The Israelites “could not endure what was
          commanded,”178 though in regard of the moral part, agreeable to what
          they found written in their own nature, and to the observance whereof
          they had the highest obligations of any people under heaven, since God
          had, by many prodigies, delivered them from a cruel slavery, the
          memory of which prefaced the Decalogue (Exod. xx. 2), “I am the Lord
          thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
          house of bondage.” They could not think of the rule of their duty, but
          they must reflect upon the grand incentive of it in their redemption
          from Egyptian thraldom; yet this people were cross to God, which way
          soever he moved. When they were in the brick kilns, they cried for
          deliverance; when they had heavenly manna, they longed for their
          onions and garlic. In Num. xiv. 3, they repent of their deliverance
          from Egypt, and talk of returning again to seek the remedy of their
          evils in the hands of their cruellest enemies, and would rather put
          themselves into the irons, whence God had delivered them, than believe
          one word of the promise of God for giving them a fruitful land; but
          when Moses tells them God’s order, that they should turn back by the
          way of the Red Sea,179 and that God had confirmed it by an oath, that
          they should not see the land of Canaan,180 they then run cross to this
          command of God, and, instead of marching towards the Red Sea, which
          they had wished for before, they will go up to Canaan, as in spite of
          God and his threatening: “We will go to the place which the Lord hath
          promised” (ver. 40), which Moses calls a transgressing the commandment
          of the Lord (ver. 41). They would presume to go up, notwithstanding
          Moses’ prohibition, and are smitten by the Amalekites. When God gives
          them a precept, with a promise to go up to Canaan, they long for
          Egypt; when God commands them to return to the Red Sea, which was
          nearer to the place they longed for, they will shift sides, and go up
          to Canaan;181 and when they found they were to traverse the solitudes
          of the desert, they took pet against God, and, instead of thanking him
          for the late victory against the Canaanites, they reproach him for his
          conduct from Egypt, and the manna wherewith he nourished them in the
          wilderness. They would not go to Canaan, the way God had chosen, nor
          preserve themselves by the means God had ordained. They would not be
          at God’s disposal, but complain of the badness of the way, and the
          lightness of manna, empty of any necessary juice to sustain their
          nature. They murmuringly solicit the will and power of God to change
          all that order which he had resolved in his counsel, and take another,
          conformable to their vain foolish desires; and they signified thereby
          that they would invade his conduct, and that he should act according
          to their fancy, which the psalmist calls a “tempting of God, and
          limiting the Holy One of Israel” (Psalm lxxviii. 41). To what point
          soever the declarations of God stand, the will of man turns the quite
          contrary way. Is not the carriage of this nation the best then in the
          world? a discovery of the depth of our natural corruption, how cross
          man is to God? And that charge God brings against them, may be brought
          against all men by nature, that they despise his judgments, and have a
          rooted abhorrency of his statutes in their soul (Lev. xxvi. 43). No
          sooner had they recovered from one rebellion, but they revolted to
          another; so difficult a thing it is for man’s nature to be rendered
          capable of conforming to the will of God. The carriage of this people
          is but a copy of the nature of mankind, and is “written for our
          admonition” (1 Cor. x. 11). From this temper men are said to make
          “void the law of God;”182 to make it of no obligation, an antiquated
          and moth‑eaten record. And the Pharisees, by setting up their
          traditions against the will of God, are said to make his law of “none
          effect;” to strip it of all its authority, as the word signifies,
          (Matt. xv. 6), ἠκυρώσατε.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We have the greatest slight of that will of God which is most for
          his honor and his greatest pleasure. It is the nature of man, ever
          since Adam, to do so (Hos. vi. 6, 7). God desired mercy and not a
          sacrifice; the knowledge of himself more than burnt offering; but
          they, like men as Adam, have transgressed the covenant, invade God’s
          rights, and not let him be Lord of one tree. We are more curious
          observers of the fringes of the law than of the greater concerns of
          it. The Jews were diligent in sacrifices and offerings, which God did
          not urge upon them as principals, but as types of other things; but
          negligent of the faith which was to be established by him. Holiness,
          mercy, pity, which concerned the honor of God, as governor of the
          world, and were imitations of the holiness and goodness of God, they
          were strangers to. This is God’s complaint (Isa. i. 11, 12, xvi. 17).
          We shall find our hearts most averse to the observation of those laws
          which are eternal, and essential to righteousness; such that he could
          not but command, as he is a righteous Governor; in the observation of
          which we come nearest to him, and express his image more clearly; as
          those laws for an inward and spiritual worship, a supreme affection to
          him. God, in regard of his righteousness and holiness of his nature,
          and the excellency of his being, could not command the contrary to
          these. But this part of his will our hearts most swell against, our
          corruption doth most snarl at; whereas those laws which are only
          positive, and have no intrinsic righteousness in them, but depend
          purely upon the will of the Lawgiver, and may be changed at his
          pleasure (which the other, that have an intrinsic righteousness in
          them, cannot), we better comply with, than that part of his will that
          doth express more the righteousness of his nature;183 such as the
          ceremonial part of worship, and the ceremonial law among the Jews. We
          are more willing to observe order in some outward attendances and
          glavering devotions, than discard secret affections to evil, crucify
          inward lusts and delightful thoughts. A “hanging down the head like a
          bullrush” is not difficult; but the “breaking the heart,” like a
          potter’s vessel, to shreds and dust (a sacrifice God delights in,
          whereby the excellency of God and the vileness of the creature is
          owned), goes against the grain; to cut off an outward branch is not so
          hard as to hack at the root. What God most loathes, as most contrary
          to his will, we most love: no sin did God so severely hate, and no sin
          were the Jews more inclined unto, than that of idolatry. The heathen
          had not changed their God, as the Jews had changed their glory (Jer.
          ii. 11); and all men are naturally tainted with this sin, which is so
          contrary to the holy and excellent nature of God. By how much the more
          defect there is of purity in our respects to God, by so much the more
          respect there is to some idol within or without us, to humor, custom,
          and interest, &amp;c. Never did any law of God meet with so much
          opposition as Christianity, which was the design of God from the first
          promise to the exhibiting the Redeemer, and from thence to the end of
          the world. All people drew swords at first against it. The Romans
          prepared yokes for their neighbors, but provided temples for the idols
          those people worshipped; but Christianity, the choicest design and
          most delightful part of the will of God, never met with a kind
          entertainment at first in any place; Rome, that entertained all
          others, persecuted this with fire and sword, though sealed by greater
          testimonies from heaven than their own records could report in favor
          of their idols.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In running the greatest hazards, and exposing ourselves to more
          trouble to cross the will of God, than is necessary to the observance
          of it. It is a vain charge men bring against the divine precepts, that
          they are rigorous, severe, difficult; when, besides the contradiction
          to our Saviour, who tells us his “yoke is easy,” and his “burthen
          light,” they thwart their own calm reason and judgment. Is there not
          more difficulty to be vicious, covetous, violent, cruel, than to be
          virtuous, charitable, kind? Doth the will of God enjoin that that is
          not conformable to right reason, and secretly delightful in the
          exercise and issue? And on the contrary, what doth Satan and the world
          engage us in, that is not full of molestation and hazard? Is it a
          sweet and comely thing to combat continually against our own
          consciences, and resist our own light, and commence a perpetual
          quarrel against ourselves, as we ordinarily do when we sin? They in
          the Prophet (Micah vi. 6‒8) would be at the expense of “thousands of
          rams, and ten thousand rivers of oil,” if they could compass them;
          yea, would strip themselves of their natural affection to their
          first‑born to expiate the “sin of their soul,” rather than to “do
          justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God;” things more conducible
          to the honor of God, the welfare of the world, the security of their
          souls, and of a more easy practice than the offerings they wished for.
          Do not men then disown God when they will walk in ways hedged with
          thorns, wherein they meet with the arrows of conscience, at every
          turn, in their sides; and slide down to an everlasting punishment,
          sink under an intolerable slavery, to contradict the will of God? when
          they will prefer a sensual satisfaction, with a combustion in their
          consciences, violation of their reasons, gnawing cares and weary
          travels before the honor of God, the dignity of their natures, the
          happiness of peace and health, which might be preserved at a cheaper
          rate, than they are at to destroy them?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In the unwillingness and awkwardness of the heart, when it is to
          pay God a service. Men “do evil with both hands earnestly,”184 but do
          good with one hand faintly; no life in the heart, nor any diligence in
          the hand. What slight and loose thoughts of God doth this
          unwillingness imply? It is a wrong to his providence, as though we
          were not under his government, and had no need of his assistance; a
          wrong to his excellency, as though there were no amiableness in him to
          make his service desirable; an injury to his goodness and power, as if
          he were not able or willing to reward the creatures’ obedience, or
          careless not to take notice of it; it is a sign we receive little
          satisfaction in him, and that there is a great unsuitableness between
          him and us.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) There is a kind of constraint in the first engagement. We are
          rather pressed to it than enter ourselves volunteers. What we call
          service to God is done naturally much against our wills; it is not a
          delightful food, but a bitter potion; we are rather haled, than run to
          it. There is a contradiction of sin within us against our service, as
          there was a contradiction of sinners without our Saviour against his
          doing the will of God. Our hearts are unwieldy to any spiritual
          service of God; we are fain to use a violence with them sometimes:
          Hezekiah, it is said, “walked before the Lord, with a perfect heart”
          (2 Kings xx. 9); he walked, he made himself to walk: man naturally
          cares not for a walk with God; if he hath any communion with him, it
          is with such a dulness and heaviness of spirit as if he wished himself
          out of his company. Man’s nature, being contrary to holiness, hath an
          aversion to any act of homage to God, because holiness must at least
          be pretended. In every duty wherein we have a communion with God,
          holiness is requisite: now as men are against the truth of holiness,
          because it is unsuitable to them, so they are not friends to those
          duties which require it, and for some space divert them from the
          thoughts of their beloved lusts. The word of the Lord is a yoke,
          prayer a drudgery, obedience a strange element. We are like fish, that
          “drink up iniquity like water,”185 and come not to the bank without
          the force of an angle; no more willing to do service for God, than a
          fish is of itself to do service for man. It is a constrained act to
          satisfy conscience, and such are servile, not son‑like performances,
          and spring from bondage more than affection; if conscience, like a
          task‑master, did not scourge them to duty, they would never perform
          it. Let us appeal to ourselves, whether we are not more unwilling to
          secret, closet, hearty duty to God, than to join with others in some
          external service; as if those inward services were a going to the
          rack, and rather our penance than privilege. How much service hath God
          in the world from the same principle that vagrants perform their task
          in Bridewell! How glad are many of evasions to back them in the
          neglect of the commands of God, of corrupt reasonings from the flesh
          to waylay an act of obedience, and a multitude of excuses to blunt the
          edge of the precept! The very service of God shall be a pretence to
          deprive him of the obedience due to him. Saul will not be ruled by
          God’s will in the destroying the cattle of the Amalekites, but by his
          own; and will impose upon the will and wisdom of God, judging God
          mistaken in his command, and that the cattle God thought fittest to be
          meat to the fowls, were fitter to be sacrifices on the altar.186 If we
          do perform any part of his will, is it not for our own ends, to have
          some deliverance from trouble? (Isa. xxvi. 16): “In trouble have they
          visited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon
          them.” In affliction, he shall find them kneeling in homage and
          devotion; in prosperity, he shall feel them kicking with contempt;
          they can pour out a prayer in distress, and scarce drop one when they
          are delivered.

        <p>
          (2.) There is a slightness in our service of God. We are loth to come
          into his presence; and when we do come, we are loth to continue with
          him. We pay not an homage to him heartily, as to our Lord and
          Governor; we regard him not as our Master, whose work we ought to do,
          and whose honor we ought to aim at. 1. In regard of the matter of
          service. When the torn, the lame, and the sick is offered to God;187
          so thin and lean a sacrifice, that you may have thrown it to the
          ground with a puff; so some understand the meaning of “you have
          snuffed at it.” Men have naturally such slight thoughts of the majesty
          and law of God, that they think any service is good enough for him,
          and conformable to his law. The dullest and deadest time we think
          fittest to pay God a service in; when sleep is ready to close our
          eyes, and we are unfit to serve ourselves, we think it a fit time to
          open our hearts to God. How few morning sacrifices hath God from many
          persons and families! Men leap out of their beds to their carnal
          pleasures or worldly employments, without any thought of their Creator
          and Preserver, or any reflection upon his will as the rule of our
          daily obedience. And as many reserve the dregs of their lives, their
          old age, to offer up their souls to God, so they reserve the dregs of
          the day, their sleeping time, for the offering up their service to
          him. How many grudge to spend their best time in the serving the will
          of God, and reserve for him the sickly and rheumatic part of their
          lives; the remainder of that which the devil and their own lusts have
          fed upon! Would not any prince or governor judge a present half eaten
          up by wild beasts, or that which died in a ditch, a contempt of his
          royalty? A corrupt thing is too base and vile for so great a King as
          God is, whose name is dreadful.188 When by age men are weary of their
          own bodies, they would present them to God; yet grudgingly, as if a
          tired body were too good for him, snuffing at the command for service.
          God calls for our best, and we give him the worst. 2. In respect of
          frame. We think any frame will serve God’s turn, which speaks our
          slight of God as a Ruler. Man naturally performs duty with an unholy
          heart, whereby it becomes an abomination to God (Prov. xxviii. 9): “He
          that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayers shall
          be an abomination to God.” The services which he commands, he hates
          for their evil frames or corrupt ends (Amos v. 21): “I hate, I despise
          your feast‑days, I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.” God
          requires gracious services, and we give him corrupt ones. We do not
          rouse up our hearts, as David called upon his lute and harp to awake
          (Psalm lvii. 8). Our hearts are not given to him; we put him off with
          bodily exercise. The heart is but ice to what it doth not affect. [1.]
          There is not that natural vigor in the observance of God, which we
          have in worldly business. When we see a liveliness in men in other
          things, change the scene into a motion towards God, how suddenly doth
          their vigor shrink and their hearts freeze into sluggishness! Many
          times we serve God as languishingly as if we were afraid he should
          accept us, and pray as coldly as if we were unwilling he should hear
          us, and take away that lust by which we are governed, and which
          conscience forces us to pray against; as if we were afraid God should
          set up his own throne and government in our hearts. How fleeting are
          we in divine meditation, how sleepy in spiritual exercises! but in
          other exercises active. The soul doth not awaken itself, and excite
          those animal and vital spirits, which it will in bodily recreations
          and sports; much less the powers of the soul: whereby it is evident we
          prefer the latter before any service to God. Since there is a fulness
          of animal spirits, why might they not be excited in holy duties as
          well as in other operations, but that there is a reluctancy in the
          soul to exercise its supremacy in this case, and perform anything
          becoming a creature in subjection to God as a Ruler? [2.] It is
          evident also in the distractions we have in his service. How loth are
          we to serve God fixedly one hour, nay a part of an hour,
          notwithstanding all the thoughts of his majesty, and the eternity of
          glory set before our eye! What man is there, since the fall of Adam,
          that served God one hour without many wanderings and unsuitable
          thoughts unfit for that service? How ready are our hearts to start out
          and unite themselves with any worldly objects that please us! [3.]
          Weariness in it evidenceth it. To be weary of our dulness signifies a
          desire, to be weary of service signifies a discontent, to be ruled by
          God. How tired are we in the performance of spiritual duties, when in
          the vain triflings of time we have a perpetual motion! How will many
          willingly revel whole nights, when their hearts will flag at the
          threshold of a religious service! like Dagon,189 lose both our heads
          to think, and hands to act, when the ark of God is present. Some in
          the Prophet wished the new moon and the Sabbath over, that they might
          sell their corn, and be busied again in their worldly affairs.190 A
          slight and weariness of the Sabbath, was a slight of the Lord of the
          Sabbath, and of that freedom from the yoke and rule of sin, which was
          signified by it. The design of the sacrifices in the new moon was to
          signify a rest from the tyranny of sin, and a consecration to the
          spiritual service of God. Servants that are quickly weary of their
          work, are weary of the authority of their master that enjoins it. If
          our hearts had a value for God, it would be with us as with the needle
          to the loadstone; there would be upon his beck a speedy motion to him,
          and a fixed union with him. When the judgments and affections of the
          saints shall be fully refined in glory, they shall be willing to
          behold the face of God, and be under his government to eternity,
          without any weariness: as the holy angels have owned God as their
          sovereign near these six thousand years, without being weary of
          running on his errands. But, alas, while the flesh clogs us, there
          will be some relics of unwillingness to hear his injunctions, and
          weariness in performing them; though men may excuse those things by
          extrinsic causes, yet God’s unerring judgment calls it a weariness of
          himself (Isaiah xliii. 22): “Thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob,
          but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.” Of this he taxeth his own
          people, when he tells them he would have the beasts of the field, the
          dragons and the owls—the Gentiles, that the Jews counted no better
          than such—to honor him and acknowledge him their rule in a way of duty
          (ver. 20, 21).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This contempt is seen in a deserting the rule of God, when our
          expectations are not answered upon our service. When services are
          performed from carnal principles, they are soon cast off when carnal
          ends meet not with desired satisfaction. But when we own ourselves
          God’s servants and God our Master, “our eyes will wait upon him till
          he have mercy on us.”191 It is one part of the duty we owe to God as
          our Master in heaven to continue in prayer (Col. iv. 1, 2); and by the
          same reason in all other service, and to watch in the same with
          thanksgiving: to watch for occasions of praise, to watch with
          cheerfulness for further manifestations of his will, strength to
          perform it, success in the performance, that we may from all draw
          matter of praise. As we are in a posture of obedience to his precepts,
          so we should be in a posture of waiting for the blessing of it. But
          naturally we reject the duty we owe to God, if he do not speed the
          blessing we expect from him. How many do secretly mutter the same as
          they in Job xxi. 15: “What is the Almighty that we should serve him,
          and what profit shall we have if we pray to him?” They serve not God
          out of conscience to his commands, but for some carnal profit; and if
          God make them to wait for it, they will not stay his leisure, but
          cease soliciting him any longer. Two things are expressed;—that God
          was not worthy of any homage from them,—“What is the Almighty that we
          should serve him?” and that the service of him would not bring them in
          a good revenue or an advantage of that kind they expected. Interest
          drives many men on to some kind of service, and when they do not find
          an advance of that, they will acknowledge God no more; but like some
          beggars, if you give them not upon their asking, and calling you good
          master, from blessing they will turn to cursing. How often do men do
          that secretly, practically, if not plainly, which Job’s wife advised
          him to, curse God, and cast off that disguise of integrity they had
          assumed! (Job ii. 9): “Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse
          God.” What a stir, and pulling, and crying is here! Cast off all
          thoughts of religious service, and be at daggers drawing with that
          God, who for all thy service of him has made thee so wretched a
          spectacle to men, and a banquet for worms. The like temper is
          deciphered in the Jews (Mal. iii. 14), “It is in vain to serve God,
          and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, that we have
          walked mournfully before the Lord?” What profit is it that we have
          regarded his statutes, and carried ourselves in a way of subjection to
          God, as our Sovereign, when we inherit nothing but sorrow, and the
          idolatrous neighbors swim in all kind of pleasures? as if it were the
          most miserable thing to acknowledge God? If men have not the benefits
          they expect, they think God unrighteous in himself, and injurious to
          them, in not conferring the favor they imagine they have merited; and
          if they have not that recompense, they will deny God that subjection
          they owe to him as creatures. Grace moves to God upon a sense of duty;
          corrupt nature upon a sense of interest. Sincerity is encouraged by
          gracious returns, but is not melted away by God’s delay or refusal.
          Corrupt nature would have God at its back, and steers a course of duty
          by hope of some carnal profit, not by a sense of the sovereignty of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. This contempt is seen in breaking promises with God. “One while the
          conscience of a man makes vows of new obedience, and perhaps binds
          himself with many an oath; but they prove like Jonah’s gourd,
          withering the next day after their birth. This was Pharaoh’s temper:
          under a storm he would submit to God, and let Israel go; but when the
          storm is ended, he will not be under God’s control, and Israel’s
          slavery shall be increased. The fear of Divine wrath makes many a
          sinner turn his back upon his sin, and the love of his ruling lust
          makes him turn his back upon his true Lord. This is from the
          prevalency of sin, that disputes with God for the sovereignty.”192
          When God hath sent a sharp disease, as a messenger to bind men to
          their beds, and make an interruption of their sinful pleasures, their
          mouths are full of promises of a new life, in hope to escape the just
          vengeance of God: the sense of hell, which strikes strongly upon them,
          makes them full of such pretended resolutions when they howl upon
          their beds. But if God be pleased in his patience to give them a
          respite, to take off the chains wherewith he seemed to be binding them
          for destruction, and recruit their strength, they are more earnest in
          their sins than they were in their promises of a reformation, as if
          they had got the mastery of God, and had outwitted him. How often doth
          God charge them of not returning to him after a succession of
          judgments!193 So hard it is, not only to allure, but to scourge men,
          to an acknowledgment of God as their Ruler!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider then, are we not naturally inclined to disobey the known will
          of God? Can we say, Lord, for thy sake we refrain the thing to which
          our hearts incline? Do we not allow ourselves to be licentious,
          earthly, vain, proud, revengeful, though we know it will offend him?
          Have we not been peevishly cross to his declared will? run counter to
          him and those laws which express most of the glory of his holiness? Is
          not this to disown him as our rule? Did we never wish there were no
          law to bind us, no precept to check our idols? What is this, but to
          wish that God would depose himself from being our governor, and leave
          us to our own conduct? or else to wish that he were as unholy as
          ourselves, as careless of his own laws as we are; that is, that he
          were no more a God than we, a God as sinful and unrighteous as
          ourselves? He whose heart riseth against the law of God to unlaw it,
          riseth against the Author of that law to undeify him. He that casts
          contempt upon the dearest thing God hath in the world, that which is
          the image of his holiness, the delight of his soul; that which he hath
          given a special charge to maintain, and that because it is holy, just,
          and good, would not stick to rejoice at the destruction of God
          himself. If God’s holiness and righteousness in the beam be despised,
          much more will an immense goodness and holiness in the fountain be
          rejected: he that wisheth a beam far from his eyes, because it offends
          and scorcheth him, can be no friend to the sun, from whence that beam
          doth issue. How unworthy a creature is man, since he only, a rational
          creature, is the sole being that withdraws itself from the rule of God
          in this earth! And how miserable a creature is he also, since,
          departing from the order of God’s goodness, he falls into the order of
          his justice; and while he refuseth God to be the rule of his life, he
          cannot avoid him being the Judge of his punishment! It is this is the
          original of all sin, and the fountain of all our misery. This is the
          first thing man disowns, the rule which God sets him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Man naturally owns any other rule rather than that of God’s
          prescribing. The law of God orders one thing, the heart of man desires
          another. There is not the basest thing in the world, but man would
          sooner submit to be guided by it, rather than by the holiness of God;
          and when anything that God commands crosses our own wills, we value it
          no more than we would the advice of a poor despicable beggar. How many
          are “lovers of pleasure, more than lovers of God!”194 To make
          something which contributes to the perfection of nature, as learning,
          wisdom, moral virtues, our rule, would be more tolerable; but to pay
          that homage to a swinish pleasure, which is the right of God, is an
          inexcusable contempt of him. The greatest excellency in the world is
          infinitely below God; much more a bestial delight, which is both
          disgraceful and below the nature of man. If we made the vilest
          creature on earth our idol, it is more excusable than to be the slave
          of a brutish pleasure. The viler the thing is that doth possess the
          throne in our heart, the greater contempt it is of him who can only
          claim a right to it, and is worthy of it. Sin is the first object of
          man’s election, as soon as the faculty whereby he chooses comes to
          exercise its power; and it is so dear to man, that it is, in the
          estimate of our Saviour, counted as the right hand, and the right eye,
          dear, precious, and useful members.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The rule of Satan is owned before the rule of God. The natural man
          would rather be under the guidance of Satan than the yoke of his
          Creator. Adam chose him to be his governor in Paradise. No sooner had
          Satan spoke of God in a way of derision (Gen. iii. 1, 5), “Yea, hath
          God said,” but man follows his counsel and approves of the scoff; and
          the greatest part of his posterity have not been wiser by his fall,
          but would rather ramble in the devil’s wilderness, than to stay in
          God’s fold. It is by the sin of man that the devil is become the god
          of the world, as if men were the electors of him to the government;
          sin is an election of him for a lord, and a putting the soul under his
          government. Those that live according to the course of the world, and
          are loth to displease it, are under the government of the prince of
          it. The greatest part of the works done in the world is to enlarge the
          kingdom of Satan. For how many ages were the laws whereby the greatest
          part of the world was governed in the affairs of religion, the fruits
          of his usurpation and policy? When temples were erected to him,
          priests consecrated to his service; the rites used in most of the
          worship of the world were either of his own coining, or the
          misapplying the rites God had ordained to himself, under the notion of
          a God: whence the apostle calls all idolatrous feasts the table of
          devils, the cup of devils, sacrifice to devils, fellowship with
          devils;195 devils being the real object of the pagan worship, though
          not formally intended by the worshipper; though in some parts of the
          Indies, the direct and peculiar worship is to the devil, that he might
          not hurt them. And though the intention of others was to offer to God,
          and not the devil, yet since the action was contrary to the will of
          God, he regards it as a sacrifice to devils. It was not the intention
          of Jeroboam to establish priests to the devil, when he consecrated
          them to the service of his calves, for Jehu afterwards calls them “the
          servants of the Lord” (2 Kings x. 23), “See if there be here none of
          the servants of the Lord,” to distinguish them from the servants of
          Baal; signifying that the true God was worshipped under those images,
          and not Baal, nor any of the gods of the heathens; yet the Scripture
          couples the calves and devils together, and ascribes the worship given
          to one to be given to the other: “He ordained him priests for the high
          places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made;”196
          so that they were sacrifices to devils, notwithstanding the intention
          of Jeroboam and his subjects that had set them up and worshipped them,
          because they were contrary to the mind of God, and agreeable to the
          doctrine and mind of Satan, though the object of their worship in
          their own intention were not the devil, but some deified man or some
          canonized saint. The intention makes not a good action; if so, when
          men kill the best servants of God with a design to do God service, as
          our Saviour foretells,197 the action would not be murder; yet who can
          call it otherwise, since God is wronged in the persons of his
          servants? Since most of the worship of the world, which men’s corrupt
          natures incline them to, is false and different from the revealed will
          of God, it is a practical acknowledgment of the devil, as the
          governor, by acknowledging and practising those doctrines, which have
          not the stamp of divine revelation upon them, but were minted by Satan
          to depress the honor of God in the world. It doth concern men, then,
          to take good heed, that in their acts of worship they have a divine
          rule; otherwise it is an owning the devil as the rule: for there is no
          medium; whatsoever is not from God, is from Satan. But to bring this
          closer to us, and consider that which is more common among us: men
          that are in a natural condition, and wedded to their lusts, are under
          the paternal government of Satan (John viii. 44): “Ye are of your
          father, the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.” If we
          divide sin into spiritual and carnal, which division comprehends all,
          the devil’s authority is owned in both; in spiritual, we conform to
          his example, because those he commits; in carnal, we obey his will,
          because those he directs: he acts the one, and sets us a copy; he
          tempts to the other, and gives us a kind of a precept. Thus man by
          nature being a willing servant of sin, is more desirous to be bound in
          the devil’s iron chain, than in God’s silken cords. What greater
          atheism can there be, than to use God as if he were inferior to the
          devil? to take the part of his greatest enemy, who drew all others
          into the faction against him? to pleasure Satan by offending God, and
          gratify our adversary with the injury of our Creator? For a subject to
          take arms against his prince with the deadliest enemy both himself and
          prince hath in the whole world, adds a greater blackness to the
          rebellion.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The more visible rule preferred before God in the world, is man.
          The opinion of the world is more our rule than the precept of God; and
          many men’s abstinence from sin is not from a sense of the Divine will,
          no, nor from a principle of reason, but from an affection to some man
          on whom they depend, or fear of punishment from a superior; the same
          principle with that in a ravenous beast, who abstains from what he
          desires, for fear only of a stick or club. Men will walk with the
          herds, go in fashion with the most, speak and act as the most do.
          While we conform to the world, we cannot perform a reasonable service
          to God, nor prove, nor approve practically what the good and
          acceptable will of God is; the apostle puts them in opposition to one
          another.198 This appears,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In complying more with the dictates of men, than the will of God.
          Men draw encouragement from God’s forbearance to sin more freely
          against him; but the fear of punishment for breaking the will of man
          lays a restraint upon them. The fear of man is a more powerful curb,
          to restrain men in their duty, than the fear of God; so we may please
          a friend, a master, a governor, we are regardless whether we please
          God or no; men‑pleasers are more than God‑pleasers; man is more
          advanced as a rule, than God, when we submit to human orders, and
          stagger and dispute against divine. Would not a prince think himself
          slighted in his authority, if any of his servants should decline his
          commands, by the order of one of his subjects? And will not God make
          the same account of us, when we deny or delay our obedience, for fear
          of one of his creatures? In the fear of man, we as little acknowledge
          God for our sovereign, as we do for our comforter (Isa. li. 12, 13):
          “I, even I, am he that comforteth you; who art thou, that thou
          shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die,” &amp;c. “and forgettest
          the Lord thy maker?” &amp;c. We put a slight upon God, as if he were
          not able to bear us out in our duty to him, and incapable to balance
          the strength of an arm of flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In observing that which is materially the will of God, not because
          it is his will, but the injunctions of men. As the word of God may be
          received, yet not as his word, so the will of God may be performed,
          yet not as his will; it is materially done, but not formally obeyed.
          An action, and obedience in that action, are two things; as when man
          commands the ceasing from all works of the ordinary calling on the
          Sabbath, it is the same that God enjoins: the cessation, or attendance
          of his servants on the hearing of the word, are conformable in the
          matter of it to the will of God; but it is only conformable in the
          obediential part of the acts to the will of man, when it is done only
          with respect to a human precept. As God hath a right to enact his laws
          without consulting his creature in the way of his government, so man
          is bound to obey those laws, without consulting whether they be
          agreeable to men’s laws or no. If we act the will of God because the
          will of our superiors concurs with it, we obey not God in that, but
          man, a human will being the rule of our obedience, and not the divine;
          this is to vilify God, and make him inferior to man in our esteem, and
          a valuing the rule of man above that of our Creator. Since God is the
          highest perfection and infinitely good, whatsoever rule he gives the
          creature must be good, else it cannot proceed from God. A base thing
          cannot be the product of an infinite excellency, and an unreasonable
          thing cannot be the product of an infinite wisdom and goodness;
          therefore, as the respecting God’s will before the will of man is
          excellent and worthy of a creature, and is an acknowledging the
          excellency, goodness, and wisdom of God, so the eying the will of man
          before and above the will of God, is on the contrary, a denial of all
          those in a lump, and a preferring the wisdom, goodness, and power of
          man in his law, above all those perfections of God in his. Whatsoever
          men do that looks like moral virtue or abstinence from vices, not out
          of obedience to the rule God hath set, but because of custom,
          necessity, example, or imitation, they may, in the doing of it, be
          rather said to be apes than Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In obeying the will of man when it is contrary to the will of God;
          as the Israelites willingly “walked after the commandment,”199 not of
          God, but of Jeroboam in the case of the calves, and “made the king’s
          heart glad with their lies.”200 They cheered him with their ready
          obedience to his command for idolatry (which was a lie in itself, and
          a lie in them) against the commandment of God, and the warnings of the
          prophets, rather than cheer the heart of God with their obedience to
          his worship instituted by him; nay, and when God offered them to cure
          them their wound, their iniquity breaks out afresh; they would neither
          have him as a lord to rule them, nor a physician to cure them (Hosea
          vii. 1): “When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of
          Ephraim was discovered.” The whole Persian nation shrunk at once from
          a duty due by the light of nature to the Deity, upon a decree that
          “neither God or man should be petitioned to for thirty days, but only
          their king;”201 one only, Daniel, excepted against it, who preferred
          his homage to God, above obedience to his prince. An adulterous
          generation is many times made the rule of men’s professions, as is
          implied in those words of our Saviour (Mark viii. 38): “Whosoever
          shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful
          generation:” own him among his disciples, and be ashamed of him among
          his enemies. Thus men are said to deny God (Tit. i. 16), when they
          “attend to Jewish fables and the precepts of men rather than the word
          of God;” when the decrees or canons of fallible men are valued at a
          higher rate, and preferred before the writings of the Holy Ghost by
          his apostles. As man naturally disowns the rule God sets him, and owns
          any other rule than that of God’s prescribing, so,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, He doth this in order to the setting himself up as his own
          rule; as though our own wills, and not God’s, were the true square and
          measure of goodness. We make an idol of our own wills, and as much as
          self is exalted, God is deposed; the more we esteem our own wills, the
          more we endeavor to annihilate the will of God; account nothing of
          him, the more we account of ourselves, and endeavor to render
          ourselves his superiors, by exalting our own wills. No prince but
          would look upon his authority as invaded, his royalty derided, if a
          subject should resolve to be a law to himself, in opposition to his
          known will; true piety is to hate ourselves, deny ourselves, and
          cleave solely to the service of God. To make ourselves our own rule,
          and the object of our chiefest love, is atheism. If self‑denial be the
          greatest part of godliness, the great letter in the alphabet of
          religion; self‑love is the great letter in the alphabet of practical
          atheism. Self is the great antichrist and anti‑God in the world, that
          sets up itself above all that is called God; self‑love is the captain
          of that black band (2 Tim. iii. 2): it sits in the temple of God, and
          would be adored as God. Self‑love begins; but denying the power of
          godliness, which is the same with denying the ruling power of God,
          ends the list. It is so far from bending to the righteous will of the
          Creator, that it would have the eternal will of God stoop to the humor
          and unrighteous will of a creature; and this is the ground of the
          contention between the flesh and spirit in the heart of a renewed man;
          flesh wars for the godhead of self, and spirit fights for the godhead
          of God; the one would settle the throne of the Creator, and the other
          maintain a law of covetousness, ambition, envy, lust, in the stead of
          God. The evidence of this will appear in these propositions:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This is natural to man as he is corrupted. What was the venom of
          the sin of Adam, is naturally derived with his nature to all his
          posterity. It was not the eating a forbidden apple, or the pleasing
          his palate that Adam aimed at, or was the chief object of his desire,
          but to live independently on his Creator, and be a God to himself
          (Gen. iii. 5): “You shall be as gods.” That which was the matter of
          the devil’s temptation, was the incentive of man’s rebellion; a
          likeness to God he aspired to in the judgment of God himself, an
          infallible interpreter of man’s thoughts; “Behold, man is become as
          one of us, to know good and evil,” in regard of self‑sufficiency and
          being a rule to himself. The Jews understand the ambition of man to
          reach no further than an equality with the angelical nature; but
          Jehovah here understands it in another sense; God had ordered man by
          this prohibition not to eat of the fruit of the “tree of knowledge of
          good and evil;” not to attempt the knowledge of good and evil of
          himself, but to wait upon the dictates of God; not to trust to his own
          counsels, but to depend wholly upon him for direction and guidance.
          Certainly he that would not hold off his hand from so small a thing as
          an apple, when he had his choice of the fruit of the garden, would not
          have denied himself anything his appetite had desired, when that
          principle had prevailed upon him; he would not have stuck at a greater
          matter to pleasure himself with the displeasing of God, when for so
          small a thing he would incur the anger of his Creator. Thus would he
          deify his own understanding against the wisdom of God, and his own
          appetite against the will of God. This desire of equality with God, a
          learned man202 thinks the apostle intimates (Phil. ii. 6): “Who being
          in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;” the
          Son’s being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal
          with God, implies that the robbery of sacrilege committed by our first
          parents, for which the Son of God humbled himself to the death of the
          cross, was an attempt to be equal with God, and depend no more upon
          God’s directions, but his own conduct; which could be no less than an
          invasion of the throne of God, and endeavor to put himself into a
          posture to be his mate. Other sins, adultery, theft, &amp;c. could not
          be committed by him at that time, but he immediately puts forth his
          hand to usurp the power of his Maker; this treason is the old Adam in
          every man. The first Adam contradicted the will of God to set up
          himself; the second Adam humbled himself, and did nothing but by the
          command and will of his Father. This principle wherein the venom of
          the old Adam lies, must be crucified to make way for the throne of the
          humble and obedient principle of the new Adam, or quickening Spirit;
          indeed sin in its own nature is nothing else but “a willing according
          to self, and contrary to the will of God;” lusts are therefore called
          the wills of the flesh and of the mind.203 As the precepts of God are
          God’s will, so the violation of these precepts is man’s will; and thus
          man usurps a godhead to himself, by giving that honor to his own will
          which belongs to God, appropriating the right of rule to himself, and
          denying it to his Creator. That servant that acts according to his own
          will, with a neglect of his master’s, refuseth the duty of a servant,
          and invades the right of his master. This self‑love and desire of
          independency on God has been the root of all sin in the world. The
          great controversy between God and man hath been, whether he or they
          shall be God; whether his reason or theirs, his will or theirs, shall
          be the guiding principle. As grace is the union of the will of God and
          the will of the creature, so sin is the opposition of the will of self
          to the will of God; “Leaning to our own understanding,” is opposed as
          a natural evil to “trusting in the Lord,”204 a supernatural grace. Men
          commonly love what is their own, their own inventions, their own
          fancies; therefore the ways of a wicked man are called the “ways of
          his own heart.”205 and the ways of a superstitious man his own devices
          (Jer. xviii. 11): “We will walk after our own devices;” we will be a
          law to ourselves; and what the Psalmist saith of the tongue, Our
          tongues are our own, who shall control us? is as truly the language of
          men’s hearts, Our wills are our own, who shall check us?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This is evident in the dissatisfaction of men with their own
          consciences when they contradict the desires of self. Conscience is
          nothing but an actuated or reflex knowledge of a superior power and an
          equitable law; a law impressed, and a power above it impressing it.
          Conscience is not the lawgiver, but the remembrancer to mind us of
          that law of nature imprinted upon our souls, and actuate the
          considerations of the duty and penalty, to apply the rule to our acts,
          and pass judgment upon matter of fact: it is to give the charge, urge
          the rule, enjoin the practice of those notions of right, as part of
          our duty and obedience. But man is as much displeased with the
          directions of conscience, as he is out of love with the accusations
          and condemning sentence of this officer of God: we cannot naturally
          endure any quick and lively practical thoughts of God and his will,
          and distaste our own consciences for putting us in mind of it: they
          therefore “like not to retain God in their knowledge,”206 that is, God
          in their own consciences; they would blow it out, as it is the candle
          of the Lord in them to direct them, and their acknowledgments of God,
          to secure themselves against the practice of its principles: they
          would stop all the avenues to any beam of light, and would not suffer
          a sparkle of divine knowledge to flutter in their minds, in order to
          set up another directing rule suited to the fleshly appetite: and when
          they cannot stop the light of it from glaring in their faces, they
          rebel against it, and cannot endure to abide in its paths.207 He
          speaks not of those which had the written word, or special
          revelations; but only a natural light or traditional, handed from
          Adam: hence are all the endeavors to still it when it begins to speak,
          by some carnal pleasures, as Saul’s evil spirit with a fit of music;
          or bribe it with some fits of a glavering devotion, when it holds the
          law of God in its commanding authority before the mind: they would
          wipe out all the impressions of it when it presses the advancement of
          God above self, and entertain it with no better compliment than Ahab
          did Elijah, “Hast thou found me, O my enemy?” If we are like to God in
          anything of our natural fabric, it is in the superior and more
          spiritual part of our souls. The resistance of that which is most like
          to God, and instead of God in us, is a disowning of the Sovereign
          represented by that officer. He that would be without conscience,
          would be without God, whose vicegerent it is, and make the sensitive
          part, which conscience opposes, his lawgiver. Thus a man, out of
          respect to sinful self, quarrels with his natural self, and cannot
          comport himself in a friendly behavior to his internal implanted
          principles: he hates to come under the rebukes of them, as much as
          Adam hated to come into the presence of God, after he turned traitor
          against him: the bad entertainment God’s deputy hath in us, reflects
          upon that God whose cause it pleads: it is upon no other account that
          men loathe the upright language of their own reasons in those matters,
          and wish the eternal silence of their own consciences, but as they
          maintain the rights of God, and would hinder the idol of self from
          usurping his godhead and prerogative. Though this power be part of a
          man’s self, rooted in his nature, as essential to him and inseparable
          from him as the best part of his being; yet he quarrels with it, as it
          is God’s deputy, and stickling for the honor of God in his soul, and
          quarrelling with that sinful self he would cherish above God. We are
          not displeased with this faculty barely as it exerciseth a
          self‑reflection; but as it is God’s vicegerent, and bears the mark of
          his authority in it. In some cases this self‑reflecting act meets with
          good entertainment, when it acts not in contradiction to self, but
          suitable to natural affections. As suppose a man hath in his passion
          struck his child, and caused thereby some great mischief to him, the
          reflection of conscience will not be unwelcome to him; will work some
          tenderness in him, because it takes the part of self and of natural
          affection; but in the more spiritual concerns of God it will be rated
          as a busy‑body.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Many, if not most actions, materially good in the world, are done
          more because they are agreeable to self, than as they are honorable to
          God. As the word of God may be heard not as his word,208 but as there
          may be pleasing notions in it, or discourses against an opinion or
          party we disaffect; so the will of God may be performed, not as his
          will, but as it may gratify some selfish consideration, when we will
          please God so far as it may not displease ourselves, and serve him as
          our Master, so far as his command may be a servant to our humor; when
          we consider not who it is that commands, but how short it comes of
          displeasing that sin which rules in our heart, pick and choose what is
          least burdensome to the flesh, and distasteful to our lusts. He that
          doth the will of God, not out of conscience of that will, but because
          it is agreeable to himself, casts down the will of God, and sets his
          own will in the place of it; takes the crown from the head of God, and
          places it upon the head of self. If things are done, not because they
          are commanded by God, but desirable to us, it is a disobedient
          obedience; a conformity to God’s will in regard of the matter, a
          conformity to our own will in regard of the motive; either as the
          things done are agreeable to natural and moral self, or sinful self.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1). As they are agreeable to natural or moral self. When men will
          practise some points of religion, and walk in the track of some divine
          precepts; not because they are divine, but because they are agreeable
          to their humor or constitution of nature; from the sway of a natural
          bravery, the bias of a secular interest, not from an ingenuous sense
          of God’s authority, or a voluntary submission to his will; as when a
          man will avoid excess in drinking, not because it is dishonorable to
          God, but as it is a blemish to his own reputation, or an impair of the
          health of his body: doth this deserve the name of an observance of the
          divine injunction, or rather an obedience to ourselves? Or when a man
          will be liberal in the distribution of his charity, not with an eye to
          God’s precept, but in compliance with his own natural compassion, or
          to pleasure the generosity of his nature: the one is obedience to a
          man’s own preservation; the other an obedience to the interest or
          impulse of a moral virtue. It is not respect to the rule of God, but
          the authority of self, and, at the best, is but the performance of the
          material part of the divine rule, without any concurrence of a
          spiritual motive or a spiritual manner. That only is a maintaining the
          rights of God, when we pay an observance to his rule, without
          examining the agreeableness of it to our secular interest, or
          consulting with the humor of flesh and blood; when we will not decline
          his service, though we find it cross, and hath no affinity with the
          pleasure of our own nature: such an obedience as Abraham manifested in
          his readiness to sacrifice his son; such an obedience as our Saviour
          demands in cutting off the right hand. When we observe anything of
          divine order upon the account of its suitableness to our natural
          sentiments, we shall readily divide from him, when the interest of
          nature turns its point against the interest of God’s honor; we shall
          fall off from him according to the change we find in our own humors.
          And can that be valued as a setting up the rule of God, which must be
          deposed upon the mutable interest of an inconstant mind? Esau had no
          regard to God in delaying the execution of his resolution to shorten
          his brother’s days, though he was awed by the reverence of his father
          to delay it; he considered, perhaps, how justly he might lie under the
          imputation of hastening crazy Isaac’s death, by depriving him of a
          beloved son. But had the old man’s head been laid, neither the
          contrary command of God, nor the nearness of a fraternal relation,
          could have bound his hands from the act, no more than they did his
          heart from the resolution (Gen. xxvii. 41): “Esau hated Jacob because
          of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him; and Esau said in his
          heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I
          slay my brother.” So many children, that expect at the death of their
          parents great inheritances of portions, may be observant of them, not
          in regard of the rule fixed by God, but to their own hopes, which they
          would not frustrate by a disobligement. Whence is it that many men
          abstain from gross sins, but in love to their reputation? Wickedness
          may be acted privately, which a man’s own credit puts a bar to the
          open commission of. The preserving his own esteem may divert him from
          entering into a brothel house, to which he hath set his mind before,
          against a known precept of his Creator. As Pharaoh parted with the
          Israelites, so do some men with their blemishing sins; not out of a
          sense of God’s rule, but the smart of present judgments, or fear of a
          future wrath. Our security then, and reputation, is set up in the
          place of God. This also may be, and is in renewed men, who have the
          law written in their hearts, that is, an habitual disposition to an
          agreement with the law of God; when what is done is with a respect to
          this habitual inclination, without eying the divine precept, which is
          appointed to be their rule. This also is to set up a creature, as
          renewed self is, instead of the Creator, and that law of his in his
          word, which ought to be the rule of our actions. Thus it is when men
          choose a moral life, not so much out of respect to the law of nature,
          as it is the law of God, but as it is a law become one with their
          souls and constitutions. There is more of self in this than
          consideration of God; for if it were the latter, the revealed law of
          God would, upon the same reason, be received as well as his natural
          law. From this principle of self, morality comes by some to be
          advanced above evangelical dictates.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) As they are agreeable to sinful self. Not that the commands of
          God are suited to bolster up the corruptions of men, no more than the
          law can be said to excite or revive sin:209 but it is like a scandal
          taken, not given; an occasion taken by the tumultuousness of our
          depraved nature. The Pharisees were devout in long prayers, not from a
          sense of duty, or a care of God’s honor; but to satisfy their
          ambition, and rake together fuel for their covetousness,210 that they
          might have the greater esteem and richer offerings, to free by their
          prayers the souls of deceased persons from purgatory; an opinion that
          some think the Jewish synagogue had then entertained,211 since some of
          their doctors have defended such a notion. Men may observe some
          precepts of God to have a better conveniency to break others. Jehu was
          ordered to cut off the house of Ahab. The service he undertook was in
          itself acceptable, but corrupt nature misacted that which holiness and
          righteousness commanded. God appointed it to magnify his justice, and
          check the idolatry that had been supported by that family; Jehu acted
          it to satisfy his revenge and ambition: he did it to fulfil his lust,
          not the will of God who enjoined him: Jehu applauds it as zeal; and
          God abhors it as murder, and therefore would avenge the blood of
          Jezreel on the house of Jehu (Hos. i. 4). Such kind of services are
          not paid to God for his own sake, but to ourselves for our lusts’
          sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This is evident in neglecting to take God’s direction upon emergent
          occasions. This follows the text, “None did seek God.” When we consult
          not with him, but trust more to our own will and counsel, we make
          ourselves our own governors and lords independent upon him; as though
          we could be our own counsellors, and manage our concerns without his
          leave and assistance; as though our works were in our own hands, and
          not in the “hands of God;”212 that we can by our own strength and
          sagacity direct them to a successful end without him. If we must
          “acquaint ourselves with God” before we decree a thing,213 then to
          decree a thing without acquainting God with it, is to prefer our
          purblind wisdom before the infinite wisdom of God: to resolve without
          consulting God, is to depose God and deify self, our own wit and
          strength. We would rather, like Lot, follow our own humor and stay in
          Sodom, than observe the angel’s order to go out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. As we account the actions of others to be good or evil, as they
          suit with, or spurn against our fancies and humors. Virtue is a crime,
          and vice a virtue, as it is contrary or concurrent with our humors.
          Little reason have many men to blame the actions of others, but
          because they are not agreeable to what they affect and desire; we
          would have all men take directions from us, and move according to our
          beck, hence that common speech in the world, Such an one is an honest
          friend. Why? because he is of their humor, and lackeys according to
          their wills. Thus we make self the measure and square of good and evil
          in the rest of mankind, and judge of it by our own fancies, and not by
          the will of God, the proper rule of judgment. Well then, let us
          consider: Is not this very common? are we not naturally more willing
          to displease God than displease ourselves, when it comes to a point
          that we must do one or other? Is not our own counsel of more value
          with us, than conformity to the will of the Creator? Do not our
          judgments often run counter to the judgment of God? Have his laws a
          greater respect from us, than our own humors? Do we scruple the
          staining his honor when it comes in competition with our own? Are not
          the lives of most men a pleasing themselves, without a repentance that
          ever they displeased God? Is not this to undeify God, to deify
          ourselves, and disown the propriety he hath in us by the right of
          creation and beneficence? We order our own ways by our own humors, as
          though we were the authors of our own being, and had given ourselves
          life and understanding. This is to destroy the order that God hath
          placed between our wills and his own, and a lifting up of the foot
          above the head; it is the deformity of the creature. The honor of
          every rational creature consists in the service of the First Cause of
          his being; as the welfare of every creature consists in the orders and
          proportionable motion of its members, according to the law of its
          creation. He that moves and acts according to a law of his own, offers
          a manifest wrong to God, the highest wisdom and chiefest good;
          disturbs the order of the world; nulls the design of the righteousness
          and holiness of God. The law of God is the rule of that order he would
          have observed in the world; he that makes another law his rule,
          thrusts out the order of the Creator, and establishes the disorder of
          the creature. But this will yet be more evident, in the fourth thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, Man would make himself the rule of God, and give laws to his
          Creator. We are willing God should be our benefactor, but not our
          ruler; we are content to admire his excellency and pay him a worship,
          provided he will walk by our rule. “This commits a riot upon his
          nature, To think him to be what we ourselve ‘would have him, and wish
          him to be’ (Psalm l. 21), we would amplify his mercy and contract his
          justice; we would have his power enlarged to supply our wants, and
          straitened when it goes about to revenge our crimes; we would have him
          wise to defeat our enemies, but not to disappoint our unworthy
          projects; we would have him all eye to regard our indigence, and blind
          not to discern our guilt; we would have him true to his promises,
          regardless of his precepts, and false to his threatenings; we would
          new mint the nature of God according to our models, and shape a God
          according to our own fancies, as he made us at first according to his
          own image;” instead of obeying him, we would have him obey us; instead
          of owning and admiring his perfections, we would have him strip
          himself of his infinite excellency, and clothe himself with a nature
          agreeable to our own. This is not only to set up self as the law of
          God, but to make our own imaginations the model of the nature of
          God.214 Corrupted man takes a pleasure to accuse or suspect the
          actions of God: we would not have him act conveniently to his nature;
          but act what doth gratify us, and abstain from what distastes us. Man
          is never well but when he is impeaching one or other perfection of
          God’s nature, and undermining his glory, as if all his attributes must
          stand indicted at the bar of our purblind reason: this weed shoots up
          in the exercise of grace. Peter intended the refusal of our Saviour’s
          washing his feet, as an act of humility, but Christ understands it to
          be a prescribing a law to himself, a correcting his love (John xiii.
          8, 9). This is evidenced,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the strivings against his law. How many men imply by their
          lives, that they would have God deposed from his government, and some
          unrighteous being step into his throne; as if God had or should change
          his laws of holiness into laws of licentiousness: as if he should
          abrogate his old eternal precepts, and enact contrary ones in their
          stead? What is the language of such practices, but that they would be
          God’s lawgivers and not his subjects? that he should deal with them
          according to their own wills, and not according to his righteousness?
          that they could make a more holy, wise, and righteous law than the law
          of God? that their imaginations, and not God’s righteousness, should
          be the rule of his doing good to them? (Jer. ix. 31): “They have
          forsaken my law, and walked after the imaginations of their own
          heart.” When an act is known to be a sin, and the law that forbids it
          acknowledged to be the law of God, and after this we persist in that
          which is contrary to it, we tax his wisdom as if he did not understand
          what was convenient for us; “we would teach God knowledge;”215 it is
          an implicit wish that God had laid aside the holiness of his nature,
          and framed a law to pleasure our lusts. When God calls for weeping and
          mourning, and girding with sackcloth upon approaching judgments, then
          the corrupt heart is for joy and gladness, eating of flesh and
          drinking of wine, because to‑morrow they should die;216 as if God had
          mistaken himself when he ordered them so much sorrow, when their lives
          were so near an end; and had lost his understanding when he ordered
          such a precept: disobedience is therefore called contention (Rom. ii.
          8): “Contentious, and obey not the truth:” contention against God,
          whose truth it is that they disobey; a dispute with him, which hath
          more of wisdom in itself, and conveniency for them, his truth of their
          imaginations. The more the love, goodness, and holiness of God appears
          in any command, the more are we naturally averse from it, and cast an
          imputation on him, as if he were foolish, unjust, cruel, and that we
          could have advised and directed him better. The goodness of God is
          eminent to us in appointing a day for his own worship, wherein we
          might converse with him, and he with us, and our souls be refreshed
          with spiritual communications from him; and we rather use it for the
          ease of our bodies, than the advancement of our souls, as if God were
          mistaken and injured his creature, when he urged the spiritual part of
          duty. Every disobedience to the law is an implicit giving law to him,
          and a charge against him that he might have provided better for his
          creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In disapproving the methods of God’s government of the world. If
          the counsels of Heaven roll not about according to their schemes,
          instead of adoring the unsearchable depths of his judgments, they call
          him to the bar, and accuse him, because they are not fitted to their
          narrow vessels, as if a nut‑shell could contain an ocean. As corrupt
          reason esteems the highest truths foolishness, so it counts the most
          righteous ways unequal. Thus we commence a suit against God, as though
          he had not acted righteously and wisely, but must give an account of
          his proceedings at our tribunal. This is to make ourselves God’s
          superiors, and presume to instruct him better in the government of the
          world; as though God hindered himself and the world, in not making us
          of his privy council, and not ordering his affairs according to the
          contrivances of our dim understandings. Is not this manifest in our
          immoderate complaints of God’s dealings with his church, as though
          there were a coldness in God’s affections to his church, and a glowing
          heat towards it only in us? Hence are those importunate desires for
          things which are not established by any promise, as though we would
          overrule and over persuade God to comply with our humor. We have an
          ambition to be God’s tutors and direct him in his counsels: “Who hath
          been his counsellor?” saith the apostle.217 Who ought not to be his
          counsellor? saith corrupt nature. Men will find fault with God in what
          he suffers to be done according to their own minds, when they feel the
          bitter fruit of it. When Cain had killed his brother, and his
          conscience racked him, how saucily and discontentedly doth he answer
          God! (Gen. iv. 9), “Am I my brother’s keeper?” Since thou dost own
          thyself the rector of the world, thou shouldst have preserved his
          person from my fury; since thou dost accept his sacrifice before my
          offering, preservation was due as well as acceptance. If this temper
          be found on earth, no wonder it is lodged in hell. That deplorable
          person under the sensible stroke of God’s sovereign justice, would
          oppose his nay to God’s will (Luke xvi. 30): “And he said, Nay, father
          Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead they will repent.” He
          would presume to prescribe more effectual means than Moses and the
          prophets, to inform men of the danger they incurred by their
          sensuality. David was displeased, it is said (2 Sam. vi. 8), when the
          Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah, not with Uzzah, who was the object
          of his pity, but with God, who was the inflicter of that punishment.
          When any of our friends have been struck with a rod, against our
          sentiments and wishes, have not our hearts been apt to swell in
          complaints against God, as though he disregarded the goodness of such
          a person, did not see with our eyes, and measure him by our esteem of
          him? as if he should have asked our counsel, before he had resolved,
          and managed himself according to our will, rather than his own. If he
          be patient to the wicked, we are apt to tax his holiness, and accuse
          him as an enemy to his own law. If he inflict severity upon the
          righteous, we are ready to suspect his goodness, and charge him to be
          an enemy to his affectionate creature. If he spare the Nimrods of the
          world, we are ready to ask, “Where is the God of judgment?”218 If he
          afflict the pillars of the earth, we are ready to question, where is
          the God of mercy? It is impossible, since the depraved nature of man,
          and the various interests and passions in the world, that infinite
          power and wisdom can act righteously for the good of the universe, but
          he will shake some corrupt interest or other upon the earth; so
          various are the inclinations of men, and such a weather‑cock judgment
          hath every man in himself, that the divine method he applauds this
          day, upon a change of his interest, he will cavil at the next. It is
          impossible for the just orders of God to please the same person many
          weeks, scarce many minutes together. God must cease to be God, or to
          be holy, if he should manage the concerns of the world according to
          the fancies of men. How unreasonable is it thus to impose laws upon
          God! Must God revoke his own orders? govern according to the dictates
          of his creature? Must God, who hath only power and wisdom to sway the
          sceptre, become the obedient subject of every man’s humor, and manage
          everything to serve the design of a simple creature? This is not to be
          God, but to set the creature in his throne: though this be not
          formally done, yet that it is interpretatively and practically done,
          is every hour’s experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In impatience in our particular concerns. It is ordinary with man
          to charge God in his complaints in the time of affliction. Therefore
          it is the commendation the Holy Ghost gives to Job (ch. i. 22), that
          in all this, that is, in those many waves that rolled over him, he did
          not charge God foolishly, he never spake nor thought anything unworthy
          of the majesty and righteousness of God; yet afterwards we find him
          warping; he nicknames the affliction to be God’s oppression of him,
          and no act of his goodness (x. 3): “Is it good for thee, that thou
          shouldst oppress?” He seems to charge God with injustice, for
          punishing him when he was not wicked, for which he appeals to God:
          “Thou knowest that I am not wicked” (ver. 7), and that God acted not
          like a Creator (ver. 8). If our projects are disappointed, what
          fretfulness against God’s management are our hearts racked with! How
          do uncomely passions bubble upon us, interpretatively at least wishing
          that the arms of his power had been bound, and the eye of his
          omniscience been hoodwinked, that we might have been left to our own
          liberty and designs? and this oftentimes when we have more reason to
          bless him than repine at him. The Israelites murmured more against God
          in the wilderness, with manna in their mouths, than they did at
          Pharaoh in the brick‑kilns, with their garlic and onions between their
          teeth. Though we repine at instruments in our afflictions, yet God
          counts it a reflection upon himself. The Israelites speaking against
          Moses, was, in God’s interpretation, a rebellion against himself:219
          and rebellion is always a desire of imposing laws and conditions upon
          those against whom the rebellion is raised. The sottish dealings of
          the vine‑dressers in Franconia with the statue of St. Urban, the
          protector of the vines, upon his own day, is an emblem of our dealing
          with God: if it be a clear day and portend a prosperous vintage, they
          honor the statue and drink healths to it; if it be a rainy day, and
          presage a scantiness, they daub it with dirt in indignation. We cast
          out our mire and dirt against God when he acts cross to our wishes,
          and flatter him when the wind of his providence joins itself to the
          tide of our interest. Men set a high price upon themselves, and are
          angry God values them not at the same rate, as if their judgment
          concerning themselves were more piercing than his. This is to disannul
          God’s judgment, and condemn him and count ourselves righteous, a ’tis
          Job xl. 8. This is the epidemical disease of human nature; they think
          they deserve caresses instead of rods, and upon crosses are more ready
          to tear out the heart of God, than reflect humbly upon their own
          hearts. When we accuse God, we applaud ourselves, and make ourselves
          his superiors, intimating that we have acted more righteously to him
          than he to us, which is the highest manner of imposing laws upon him;
          as that emperor accused the justice of God for snatching him out of
          the world too soon.220 What a high piece of practical atheism is this,
          to desire that infinite wisdom should be guided by our folly, and
          asperse the righteousness of God rather than blemish our own! Instead
          of silently submitting to his will and adoring his wisdom, we declaim
          against him, as an unwise and unjust governor: we would invert his
          order, make him the steward and ourselves the proprietors of what we
          are and have: we deny ourselves to be sinners, and our mercies to be
          forfeited.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is evidenced in envying the gifts and prosperities of others.
          Envy hath a deep tincture of practical atheism, and is a cause of
          atheism.221 We are unwilling to leave God to be the proprietor and do
          what he will with his own, and as a Creator to do what he pleases with
          his creatures. We assume a liberty to direct God what portions, when
          and how, he should bestow upon his creatures. We would not let him
          choose his own favorites, and pitch upon his own instruments for his
          glory; as if God should have asked counsel of us how he should dispose
          of his benefits. We are unwilling to leave to his wisdom the
          management of his own judgments to the wicked, and the dispensation of
          his own love to ourselves. This temper is natural: it is as ancient as
          the first age of the world. Adam envied God a felicity by himself, and
          would not spare a tree that he had reserved as a mark of his
          sovereignty. The passion that God had given Cain to employ against his
          sin, he turns against his Creator. He was wroth with God and with
          Abel;222 but envy was at the root, because his brother’s sacrifice was
          accepted and his refused. How could he envy his accepted person,
          without reflecting upon the Acceptor of his offering? Good men have
          not been free from it. Job questions the goodness of God, that he
          should shine upon the counsel of the wicked (Job x. 3). Jonah had too
          much of self, in fearing to be counted a false prophet, when he came
          with absolute denunciations of wrath;223 and when he could not bring a
          volley of destroying judgments upon the Ninevites, he would shoot his
          fury against his Master, envying those poor people the benefit, and
          God the honor of his mercy; and this after he had been sent into the
          whale’s belly to learn humiliation, which, though he exercised there,
          yet those two great branches of self‑pride and envy were not lopped
          off from him in the belly of hell; and God was fain to take pains with
          him, and by a gourd scarce makes him ashamed of his peevishness. Envy
          is not like to cease till all atheism be cashiered, and that is in
          heaven. This sin is an imitation of the devil, whose first sin upon
          earth was envy, as his first sin in heaven was pride. It is a wishing
          that to ourselves, which the devil asserted as his right, to give the
          kingdoms of the world to whom he pleased:224 it is an anger with God,
          because he hath not given us a patent for government. It utters the
          same language in disparagement of God, as Absalom did in reflection on
          his father: If I were king in Israel, justice should be better
          managed; if I were Lord of the world, there should be more wisdom to
          discern the merits of men, and more righteousness in distributing to
          them their several portions. Thus we impose laws upon God, and would
          have the righteousness of his will submit to the corruptions of ours,
          and have him lower himself to gratify our minds, rather than fulfil
          his own. We charge the Author of those gifts with injustice, that he
          hath not dealt equally; or with ignorance, that he hath mistook his
          mark. In the same breath that we censure him by our peevishness, we
          would guide him by our wills. This is an unreasonable part of atheism.
          If all were in the same state and condition, the order of the world
          would be impaired. Is God bound to have a care of thee, and neglect
          all the world besides? “Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?”225
          Joseph had reason to be displeased with his brothers, if they had
          muttered because he gave Benjamin a double portion, and the rest a
          single. It was unfit that they, who had deserved no gift at all,
          should prescribe him rules how to dispense his own doles; much more
          unworthy it is to deal so with God; yet this is too rife.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is evidenced in corrupt matter or ends of prayer and praise.
          When we are importunate for those things that we know not whether the
          righteousness, holiness, and wisdom of God can grant, because he hath
          not discovered his will in any promise to bestow them, we would then
          impose such conditions on God, which he never obliged himself to
          grant; when we pray for things not so much to glorify God, which ought
          to be the end of prayer, as to gratify ourselves. We acknowledge,
          indeed, by the act of petitioning, that there is a God; but we would
          have him ungod himself to be at our beck, and debase himself to serve
          our turns. When we desire those things which are repugnant to those
          attributes whereby he doth manage the government of the world; when,
          by some superficial services, we think we have gained indulgence to
          sins, which seems to be the thought of the strumpet, in her paying her
          vows, to wallow more freely in the mire of her sensual pleasures—“I
          have peace‑offerings with me; this day I have paid my vows, I have
          made my peace with God, and have entertainment for thee;”226 or when
          men desire God to bless them in the commission of some sin, as when
          Balak and Balaam offered sacrifices, that they might prosper in the
          cursing of the Israelites (Numb. xxv. 1, &amp;c.) So for a man to pray
          to God to save him, while he neglects the means of salvation appointed
          by God, or to renew him when he slights the word, the only instrument
          to that purpose; this is to impose laws upon God, contrary to the
          declared will and wisdom of God, and to desire him to slight his own
          institutions. When we come into the presence of God with lusts reeking
          in our hearts, and leap from sin to duty, we would impose the law of
          our corruption on the holiness of God. While we pray “the will of God
          may be done,” self‑love wishes its own will may be performed, as
          though God should serve our humors, when we will not obey his
          precepts. And when we make vows under any affliction, what is it often
          but a secret contrivance to bend and flatter him to our conditions? We
          will serve him if he will restore us; we think thereby to compound the
          business with him, and bring him down to our terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It is evidenced in positive and bold interpretations of the
          judgments of God in the world. To interpret the judgments of God to
          the disadvantage of the sufferer, unless it be an unusual judgment,
          and have a remarkable hand of God in it, and the sin be rendered
          plainly legible in the affliction, is a presumption of this nature.
          When men will judge the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with the
          sacrifices, greater sinners than others, and themselves righteous,
          because no drops of it were dashed upon them; or when Shimei, being of
          the house of Saul, shall judge according to his own interest, and
          desires David’s flight upon Absalom’s rebellion to be a punishment for
          invading the rights of Saul’s family, and depriving him of the
          succession in the kingdom,227 as if he had been of God’s privy
          council, when he decreed such acts of justice in the world. Thus we
          would fasten our own wills as a law or motive upon God, and interpret
          his acts according to the motions of self. Is it not too ordinary,
          when God sends an affliction upon those that bear ill‑will to us, to
          judge it to be a righting of our cause, to be a fruit of God’s concern
          for us in revenging our wrongs, as if we “had heard the secrets of
          God,” or, as Eliphaz saith, “had turned over the records of heaven?”
          (Job xv. 8.) This is a judgment according to self‑love, not a divine
          rule; and imposeth laws upon heaven, implying a secret wish that God
          would take care only of them, make our concerns his own, not in ways
          of kindness and justice, but according to our fancies; and this is
          common in the profane world, in those curses they so readily spit out
          upon any affront, as if God were bound to draw his arrows and shoot
          them into the heart of all their offenders at their beck and pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. It is evidenced, in mixing rules for the worship of God with those
          which have been ordered by him. Since men are most prone to live by
          sense, it is no wonder that a sensible worship, which affects their
          outward sense with some kind of amazement, is dear to them, and
          spiritual worship most loathsome. Pompous rites have been the great
          engine wherewith the devil hath deceived the souls of men, and wrought
          them to a nauseating the simplicity of divine worship, as unworthy the
          majesty and excellency of God.228 Thus the Jews would not understand
          the glory of the second temple in the presence of the Messiah, because
          it had not the pompous grandeur of that of Solomon’s erecting. Hence
          in all ages men have been forward to disfigure God’s models, and dress
          up a brat of their own; as though God had been defective in providing
          for his own honor in his institutions, without the assistance of his
          creature. This hath always been in the world; the old world had their
          imaginations, and the new world hath continued them. The Israelites in
          the midst of miracles, and under the memory of a famous deliverance,
          would erect a calf. The Pharisees, that sate in Moses’ chair, would
          coin new traditions, and enjoin them to be as current as the law of
          God.229 Papists will be blending the christian appointments with pagan
          ceremonies, to please the carnal fancies of the common people. “Altars
          have been multiplied” under the knowledge of the law of God.230
          Interest is made the balance of the conveniency of God’s injunctions.
          Jeroboam fitted a worship to politic ends, and posted up calves to
          prevent his subjects revolting from his sceptre, which might be
          occasioned by their resort to Jerusalem, and converse with the body of
          the people from whom they were separated.231 Men will be putting in
          their own dictates with God’s laws, and are unwilling he should be the
          sole Governor of the world without their counsel; they will not suffer
          him to be Lord of that which is purely and solely his concern. How
          often hath the practice of the primitive church, the custom wherein we
          are bred, the sentiments of our ancestors, been owned as a more
          authentic rule in matters of worship, than the mind of God delivered
          in his Word! It is natural by creation to worship God; and it is as
          natural by corruption for man to worship him in a human way, and not
          in a divine; is not this to impose laws upon God, to esteem ourselves
          wiser than he? to think him negligent of his own service, and that our
          feeble brains can find out ways to accommodate his honor, better than
          himself hath done? Thus do men for the most part equal their own
          imaginations to God’s oracles: as Solomon built a high place to Moloch
          and Chemoch, upon the Mount of Olives, to face on the east part
          Jerusalem and the temple;232 this is not only to impose laws on God,
          but also to make self the standard of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. It is evidenced, in suiting interpretations of Scripture to their
          own minds and humors. Like the Lacedæmonians, that dressed the images
          of their gods according to the fashion of their own country, we would
          wring Scripture to serve our own designs, and judge the law of God by
          the law of sin, and make the serpentine seed in us to be the
          interpreter of divine oracles: this is like Belshazzar to drink
          healths out of the sacred vessels. As God is the author of his law and
          word, so he is the best interpreter of it; the Scripture having an
          impress of divine wisdom, holiness, and goodness, must be regarded
          according to that impress, with a submission and meekness of spirit
          and reverence of God in it; but when, in our inquiries into the word,
          we inquire not of God, but consult flesh and blood, the temper of the
          times wherein we live, or the satisfaction of a party we side withal,
          and impose glosses upon it according to our own fancies, it is to put
          laws upon God, and make self the rule of him. He that interprets the
          law to bolster up some eager appetite against the will of the
          lawgiver, ascribes to himself as great an authority as he that enacted
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. In falling off from God after some fair compliances, when his will
          grateth upon us, and crosseth ours. They will walk with him as far as
          he pleaseth them, and leave him upon the first distaste, as though God
          must observe their humors more than they his will. Amos must be
          suspended from prophesying, because the “land could not bear his
          words,” and his discourses condemned their unworthy practices against
          God.233 The young man came not to receive directions from our Saviour,
          but expected a confirmation of his own rules, rather than an
          imposition of new.234 He rather cares for commendations than
          instructions, and upon the disappointment turns his back; “he was
          sad,” that Christ would not suffer him to be rich, and a Christian
          together; and leaves him because his command was not suitable to the
          law of his covetousness. Some truths that are at a further distance
          from us, we can hear gladly; but when the conscience begins to smart
          under others, if God will not observe our wills, we will, with Herod,
          be a law to ourselves.235 More instances might be
          observed.—Ingratitude is a setting up self, and an imposing laws on
          God. It is as much as to say, God did no more than he was obliged to
          do; as if the mercies we have were an act of duty in God, and not of
          bounty.—Insatiable desires after wealth: hence are those speeches
          (James iv. 13), “We will go into such a city, and buy and sell,
          &amp;c. to get gain;” as though they had the command of God, and God
          must lacquey after their wills. When our hearts are not contented with
          any supply of our wants, but are craving an overplus for our lust;
          when we are unsatisfied in the midst of plenty, and still like the
          grave, cry, Give, give.—Incorrigibleness under affliction, &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second main thing: As man would be a law to himself, so he
          would be his own end and happiness in opposition to God. Here four
          things shall be discoursed on. 1. Man would make himself his own end
          and happiness. 2. He would make anything his end and happiness rather
          than God. 3. He would make himself the end of all creatures. 4. He
          would make himself the end of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Man would make himself his own end and happiness. As God ought
          to be esteemed the first cause, in point of our dependence on him, so
          he ought to be our last end, in point of our enjoyment of him. When we
          therefore trust in ourselves, we refuse him as the first cause; and
          when we act for ourselves, and expect a blessedness from ourselves, we
          refuse him as the chiefest good, and last end, which is an undeniable
          piece of atheism; for man is a creature of a higher rank than others
          in the world, and was not made as animals, plants, and other works of
          the divine power, materially to glorify God, but a rational creature,
          intentionally to honor God by obedience to his rule, dependence on his
          goodness, and zeal for his glory. It is, therefore, as much a
          slighting of God, for man, a creature, to set himself up as his own
          end, as to regard himself as his own law. For the discovery of this,
          observe that there is a three‑fold self‑love.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Natural, which is common to us by the law of nature with other
          creatures, inanimate as well as animate, and so closely twisted with
          the nature of every creature, that it cannot be dissolved but with the
          dissolution of nature itself. It consisted not with the wisdom and
          goodness of God to create an unnatural nature, or to command anything
          unnatural, nor doth he; for when he commands us to sacrifice
          ourselves, and dearest lives for himself, it is not without a promise
          of a more noble state of being in exchange for what we lose. This
          self‑love is not only commendable, but necessary, as a rule to measure
          that duty we owe to our neighbor, whom we cannot love as ourselves, if
          we do not first love ourselves. God having planted this self‑love in
          our nature, makes this natural principle the measure of our affection
          to all mankind of the same blood with ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Carnal self‑love: when a man loves himself above God, in opposition
          to God, with a contempt of God; when our thoughts, affections,
          designs, centre only in our own fleshly interest, and rifle God of his
          honor, to make a present of it to ourselves: thus the natural
          self‑love, in itself good, becomes criminal by the excess, when it
          would be superior and not subordinate to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A gracious self‑love: when we love ourselves for higher ends than
          the nature of a creature, as a creature dictates, viz. in subserviency
          to the glory of God. This is a reduction of the revolted creature to
          his true and happy order; a Christian is therefore said to be “created
          in Christ to good works.”236 As all creatures were created, not only
          for themselves, but for the honor of God; so the grace of the new
          creation carries a man to answer this end, and to order all his
          operations to the honor of God, and his well‑pleasing. The first is
          from nature, the second from sin, the third from grace; the first is
          implanted by creation, the second the fruit of corruption, and the
          third is by the powerful operation of grace. This carnal self‑love is
          set up in the stead of God as our last end; like the sea, which all
          the little and great streams of our actions run to and rest in. And
          this is, 1. Natural. It sticks as close to us as our souls; it is as
          natural as sin, the foundation of all the evil in the world. As
          self‑abhorrency is the first stone that is laid in conversion, so an
          inordinate self‑love was the first inlet to all iniquity. As grace is
          a rising from self to centre in God, so is sin a shrinking from God
          into the mire of a carnal selfishness; since every creature is nearest
          to itself and next to God, it cannot fall from God, but must
          immediately sink into self;237 and, therefore, all sins are well said
          to be branches or modifications of this fundamental passion. What is
          wrath, but a defence and strengthening self against the attempts of
          some real or imaginary evil? Whence springs envy, but from a
          self‑love, grieved at its own wants in the midst of another’s
          enjoyment, able to supply it? What is impatience, but a regret that
          self is not provided for at the rate of our wish, and that it hath met
          with a shock against supposed merit? What is pride, but a sense of
          self‑worth, a desire to have self of a higher elevation than others?
          What is drunkenness, but a seeking a satisfaction for sensual self in
          the spoils of reason? No sin is committed as sin, but as it pretends a
          self‑satisfaction. Sin, indeed, may well be termed a man’s self,
          because it is, since the loss of original righteousness, the form that
          overspreads every part of our souls. The understanding assents to
          nothing false but under the notion of true, and the will embraceth
          nothing evil but under the notion of good; but the rule whereby we
          measure the truth and goodness of proposed objects, is not the
          unerring Word, but the inclinations of self, the gratifying of which
          is the aim of our whole lives. Sin and self are all one: what is
          called a living to sin in one place,238 is called a living to self in
          another: “That they that live should not live unto themselves.”239 And
          upon this account it is that both the Hebrew word, חטא, and the Greek
          word, ἁμαρτάνειν, used in Scripture to express sin, properly signify
          to miss the mark, and swerve from that white to which all our actions
          should be directed, viz. the glory of God. When we fell to loving
          ourselves, we fell from loving God; and, therefore, when the Psalmist
          saith (Psalm xiv. 2), there were none that sought God, viz. as the
          last end; he presently adds, “They are all gone aside,” viz. from
          their true mark, and therefore become filthy. 2. Since it is natural,
          it is also universal.240 The not seeking God is as universal as our
          ignorance of him. No man in a state of nature but hath it predominant;
          no renewed man on this side heaven but hath it partially. The one hath
          it flourishing, the other hath it struggling. If to aim at the glory
          of God as the chief end, and not to live to ourselves, be the greatest
          mark of the restoration of the divine image,241 and a conformity to
          Christ, who glorified not himself,242 but the Father;243 then every
          man, wallowing in the mire of corrupt nature, pays a homage to self,
          as a renewed man is biassed by the honor of God. The Holy Ghost
          excepts none from this crime (Phil. ii. 21): “All seek their own.” It
          is rare for them to look above or beyond themselves. Whatsoever may be
          the immediate subject of their thoughts and inquiries, yet the utmost
          end and stage is their profit, honor, or pleasure. Whatever it be that
          immediately possesses the mind and will, self sits like a queen, and
          sways the sceptre, and orders things at that rate, that God is
          excluded, and can find no room in all his thoughts (Psalm x. 4): “The
          wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God;
          God is not in all his thoughts.” The whole little world of man is so
          overflowed with a deluge of self, that the dove, the glory of the
          Creator, can find no place where to set its foot; and if ever it gain
          the favor of admittance, it is to disguise and be a vassal to some
          carnal project, as the glory of God was a mask for the murdering his
          servants. It is from the power of this principle that the difficulty
          of conversion ariseth: as there is no greater pleasure to a believing
          soul than the giving itself up to God, and no stronger desire in him,
          than to have a fixed and unchangeable will to serve the designs of his
          honor; so there is no greater torment to a wicked man, than to part
          with his carnal ends, and lay down the Dagon of self at the feet of
          the ark. Self‑love and self‑opinion in the Pharisees waylaid all the
          entertainment of truth (John v. 44): “They sought honor one of
          another, and not the honor which comes from God.” It is of so large an
          extent, and so insinuating nature, that it winds itself into the
          exercise of moral virtues, mixeth with our charity (Matt. vi. 2), and
          finds nourishment in the ashes of martyrdom (1 Cor. xiii. 3).
        </p>
        <p>This making ourselves our end will appear in a few things.</p>
        <p>
          1. In frequent self‑applauses, and inward overweening reflections.
          Nothing more ordinary in the natures of men, than a dotage on their
          own perfections, acquisitions, or actions in the world: “Most think of
          themselves above what they ought to think” (Rom. xii. 3, 4). Few think
          of themselves so meanly as they ought to think: this sticks as close
          to us as our skin; and as humility is the beauty of grace, this is the
          filthiest soil of nature. Our thoughts run more delightfully upon the
          track of our own perfections, than the excellency of God; and when we
          find anything of a seeming worth, that may make us glitter in the eyes
          of the world, how cheerfully do we grasp and embrace ourselves! When
          the grosser profanenesses of men have been discarded, and the floods
          of them dammed up, the head of corruption, whence they sprang, will
          swell the higher within, in self‑applauding speculations of their own
          reformation, without acknowledgment of their own weaknesses, and
          desires of divine assistance to make a further progress. “I thank God
          I am not like this publican;”244 a self‑reflection, with a contempt
          rather than compassion to his neighbor, is frequent in every Pharisee.
          The vapors of self‑affections, in our clouded understandings, like
          those in the air in misty mornings, alter the appearance of things,
          and make them look bigger than they are. This is thought by some to be
          the sin of the fallen angels, who, reflecting upon their own natural
          excellency superior to other creatures, would find a blessedness in
          their own nature, as God did in his, and make themselves the last end
          of their actions. It is from this principle we are naturally so ready
          to compare ourselves rather with those that are below us, than with
          those that are above us; and often think those that are above us
          inferior to us, and secretly glory that we are become none of the
          meanest and lowest in natural or moral excellencies. How far were the
          gracious penmen of the Scripture from this, who, when possessed and
          directed by the Spirit of God, and filled with a sense of him, instead
          of applauding themselves, publish upon record their own faults to all
          the eyes of the world! And if Peter, as some think, dictated the
          Gospel which Mark wrote as his amanuensis, it is observable that his
          crime in denying his Master is aggravated in that Gospel in some
          circumstances, and less spoken of his repentance than in the other
          evangelists: “When he thought thereon, he wept;”245 but in the other,
          “He went out and wept bitterly.”246 This is one part of atheism and
          self‑idolatry, to magnify ourselves with the forgetfulness, and to the
          injury of our Creator.

        <p>
          2. In ascribing the glory of what we do or have to ourselves, to our
          own wisdom, power, virtue, &amp;c. How flaunting is Nebuchadnezzar at
          the prospect of Babylon, which he had exalted to be the head of so
          great an empire! (Dan. iv. 30): “Is not this great Babylon that I have
          built? For,” &amp;c. He struts upon the battlements of his palace, as
          if there were no God but himself in the world, while his eye could not
          but see the heavens above him to be none of his own framing,
          attributing his acquisitions to his own arm, and referring them to his
          own honor, for his own delight; not for the honor of God, as a
          creature ought, nor for the advantage of his subjects, as the duty of
          a prince. He regards Babylon as his heaven, and himself as his idol,
          as if he were all, and God nothing. An example of this we have in the
          present age. But it is often observed, that God vindicates his own
          honor, brings the most heroical men to contempt and unfortunate ends,
          as a punishment of their pride, as he did here (Dan. iv. 31): “While
          the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,”
          &amp;c. This was Herod’s crime, to suffer others to do it:247 he had
          discovered his eloquence actively, and made himself his own end
          passively, in approving the flatteries of the people, and offered not
          with one hand to God the glory he received from his people with the
          other.248 Samosatenus is reported to put down the hymns which were
          sung for the glory of God and Christ, and caused songs to be sung in
          the temple for his own honor. When anything succeeds well, we are
          ready to attribute it to our own prudence and industry: if we meet
          with a cross, we fret against the stars and fortune, and second
          causes, and sometimes against God: as they curse God as well as their
          king (Isa. viii. 21), not acknowledging any defect in themselves. The
          Psalmist, by his repetition of, “Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy
          name give glory” (Psalm cxv. 1), implies the naturality of this
          temper, and the difficulty to cleanse our hearts from those
          self‑reflections. If it be angelical to refuse an undue glory stolen
          from God’s throne (Rev. xxii. 8, 9), it is diabolical to accept and
          cherish it. To seek our own glory is not glory (Prov. xxv. 27). It is
          vile, and the dishonor of a creature, who by the law of his creation
          is referred to another end. So much as we sacrifice to our own credit,
          to the dexterity of our hands, or the sagacity of our wit, we detract
          from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In desires to have self‑pleasing doctrines. When we cannot endure
          to hear anything that crosses the flesh; though the wise man tells us,
          it is better to hear the “rebuke of the wise, than the song of fools”
          (Eccles. vii. 5). If Hanani the seer reprove king Asa for not relying
          on the Lord, his passion shall be armed for self against the prophet,
          and arrest him a prisoner (2 Chron. xvi. 10). If Micaiah declare to
          Ahab the evil that shall befall him, Amon the governor shall receive
          orders to clap him up in a dungeon. Fire doth not sooner seize upon
          combustible matter than fury will be kindled, if self be but pinched.
          This interest of lustful self barred the heart of Herodias against the
          entertainment of the truth, and caused her savagely to dip her hands
          in the blood of the Baptist, to make him a sacrifice to that inward
          idol.249
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In being highly concerned for injuries done to ourselves, and
          little or not at all concerned for injuries done to God. How will the
          blood rise in us, when our honor and reputation is invaded, and scarce
          reflect upon the dishonor God suffers in our sight and hearing!
          Violent passions will transform us into Boanerges in the one case, and
          our unconcernedness render us Gallios in the other. We shall extenuate
          that which concerns God, and aggravate that which concerns ourselves.
          Nothing but the death of Jonathan, a first‑born and a generous son,
          will satisfy his father Saul, when the authority of his edict was
          broken by his tasting of honey, though he had recompensed his crime
          committed in ignorance by the purchase of a gallant victory. But when
          the authority of God was violated in saving the Amalekites’ cattle,
          against the command of a greater sovereign than himself, he can daub
          the business, and excuse it with a design of sacrificing. He was not
          so earnest in hindering the people from the breach of God’s command,
          as he was in vindicating the honor of his own:250 he could hardly
          admit of an excuse to salve his own honor; but in the concerns of
          God’s honor, pretend piety, to cloak his avarice. And it is often
          seen, when the violation of God’s authority, and the stain of our own
          reputation are coupled together, we are more troubled for what
          disgraces us than for what dishonors God. When Saul had thus
          transgressed, he is desirous that Samuel would turn again to preserve
          his own honor before the elders, rather than grieved that he had
          broken the command of God (ver. 30).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In trusting in ourselves. When we consult with our own wit and
          wisdom, more than inquire of God, and ask leave of him: as the
          Assyrian (Isa. x. 13), “By the strength of my hands I have done it,
          and by my wisdom; for I am prudent.” When we attempt things in the
          strength of our own heads, and parts, and trust in our own industry,
          without application to God for direction, blessing, and success, we
          affect the privilege of the Deity, and make gods of ourselves. The
          same language in reality with Ajax in Sophocles: “Others think to
          overcome with the assistance of the gods, but I hope to gain honor
          without them.” Dependence and trust is an act due from the creature
          only to God. Hence God aggravates the crime of the Jews in trusting in
          Egypt (Isa. xxxi. 3), “the Egyptians are men and not gods.” Confidence
          in ourselves is a defection from God (Jer. xvii. 5). And when we
          depart from and cast off God to depend upon ourselves, which is but an
          arm of flesh, we choose the arm of flesh for our God; we rob God of
          that confidence we ought to place in him, and that adoration which is
          due to him, and build it upon another foundation; not that we are to
          neglect the reason and parts God hath given us, or spend more time in
          prayer than in consulting about our own affairs, but to mix our own
          intentions in business, with ejaculations to heaven, and take God
          along with us in every motion: but certainly it is an idolizing of
          self, when we are more diligent in our attendance on our own wit, than
          fervent in our recourses to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The power of sinful self, above the efficacy of the notion of God,
          is evident in our workings for carnal self against the light of our
          own consciences. When men of sublime reason, and clear natural wisdom,
          are voluntary slaves to their own lusts, row against the stream of
          their own consciences, serve carnal self with a disgraceful and
          disturbing drudgery, making it their God, sacrificing natural self,
          all sentiments of virtue, and the quiet of their lives, to the
          pleasure, honor, and satisfaction of carnal self: this is a
          prostituting God in his deputy, conscience, to carnal affections, when
          their eyes are shut against the enlightenings of it, and their ears
          deaf to its voice, but open to the least breath and whisper of self; a
          debt that the creature owes supremely to God. Much more might be said,
          but let us see what atheism lurks in this, and how it entrencheth upon
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is usurping God’s prerogative. It is God’s prerogative to be his
          own end, and act for his own glory; because there is nothing superior
          to him in excellency and goodness to act for: he had not his being
          from anything without himself, whereby he should be obliged to act for
          anything but himself. To make ourselves then our last end, is to
          corrival God in his being the supreme good, and blessedness to
          himself: as if we were our own principle, the author of our own being,
          and were not obliged to a higher power than ourselves, for what we are
          and have. To direct the lines of all our motions to ourselves, is to
          imply that they first issued only from ourselves. When we are rivals
          to God in his chief end, we own or desire to be rivals to him in the
          principle of his being: this is to set ourselves in the place of God.
          All things have something without them, and above them as their end;
          all inferior creatures act for some superior order in the rank of
          creation; the lesser animals are designed for the greater, and all for
          man: man, therefore, for something nobler than himself. To make
          ourselves therefore our own end, is to deny any superior, to whom we
          are to direct our actions. God alone being the supreme Being, can be
          his own ultimate end: for if there were anything higher and better
          than God, the purity and righteousness of his own nature would cause
          him to act for and toward that as his chiefest mark: this is the
          highest sacrilege, to alienate the proper good and rights of God, and
          employ them for our own use; to steal from him his own honor, and put
          it into our own cabinets; like those birds that ravished the sacrifice
          from the altar and carried it to their own nests.251 When we love only
          ourselves, and act for no other end but ourselves, we invest ourselves
          with the dominion which is the right of God, and take the crown from
          his head. For as the crown belongs to the king, so to love his own
          will, to will by his own will and for himself, is the property of God;
          because he hath no other will, no other end above him to be the rule
          and scope of his actions. When therefore we are by self‑love
          transformed wholly into ourselves, we make ourselves our own
          foundation, without God and against God; when we mind our own glory
          and praise, we would have a royal state equal with God, who created
          all things for himself.252 What can man do more for God than he
          naturally doth for himself, since he doth all those things for himself
          which he should do for God? We own ourselves to be our own creators
          and benefactors, and fling off all sentiments of gratitude to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is a vilifying of God. When we make ourselves our end, it is
          plain language that God is not our happiness; we postpone God to
          ourselves, as if he were not an object so excellent and fit for our
          love as ourselves are (for it is irrational to make that our end,
          which is not God, and not the chiefest good); it is to deny him to be
          better than we, to make him not to be so good as ourselves, and so fit
          to be our chiefest good as ourselves are; that he hath not deserved
          any such acknowledgment at our hands by all that he hath done for us:
          we assert ourselves his superiors by such kind of acting, though we
          are infinitely more inferior to God than any creature can be to us.
          Man cannot dishonor God more than by referring that to his own glory,
          which God made for his own praise, upon account whereof he only hath a
          right to glory and praise, and none else. He thus “changeth the glory
          of the incorruptible God into a corruptible image;”253 a perishing
          fame and reputation, which extends but little beyond the limits of his
          own habitation; or if it doth, survives but a few years, and perishes
          at last with the age wherein he lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is as much as in us lies a destroying of God. By this temper we
          destroy that God that made us, because we destroy his intention and
          his honor. God cannot outlive his will and his glory: because he
          cannot have any other rule but his own will, or any other end but his
          own honor. The setting up self as our end puts a nullity upon the true
          Deity; by paying to ourselves that respect and honor which is due to
          God, we make the true God as no God. Whosoever makes himself a king of
          his prince’s rights and territories, manifests an intent to throw him
          out of his government. To choose ourselves as our end is to undeify
          God, since to be the last end of a rational creature is a right
          inseparable from the nature of the Deity; and therefore not to set
          God, but self always before us, is to acknowledge no being but
          ourselves to be God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The second thing, Man would make anything his end and
          happiness rather than God. An end is so necessary in all our actions,
          that he deserves not the name of a rational creature that proposeth
          not one to himself. This is the distinction between rational creatures
          and others; they act with a formal intention, whereas other creatures
          are directed to their end by a natural instinct, and moved by nature
          to what the others should be moved by reason: when a man, therefore,
          acts for that end which was not intended him by the law of his
          creation, nor is suited to the noble faculties of his soul, he acts
          contrary to God, overturns his order, and merits no better a title
          than that of an atheist. A man may be said two ways to make a thing
          his last end and chief good.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Formally. When he actually judges this or that thing to be his
          chiefest good, and orders all things to it. So man doth not formally
          judge sin to be good, or any object which is the incentive of sin to
          be his last end: this cannot be while he hath the exercise of his
          rational faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Virtually and implicitly. When he loves anything against the
          command of God, and prefers in the stream of his actions the enjoyment
          of that, before the fruition of God, and lays out more strength and
          expends more time in the gaining that, than answering the true end of
          his creation: when he acts so as if something below God could make him
          happy without God, or that God could not make him happy without the
          addition of something else. Thus the glutton makes a god of his
          dainties; the ambitious man of his honor; the incontinent man of his
          lust; and the covetous man of his wealth; and consequently esteems
          them as his chiefest good, and the most noble end, to which he directs
          his thoughts: thus he vilifies and lessens the true God, which can
          make him happy, in a multitude of false gods, that can only render him
          miserable. He that loves pleasure more than God, says in his heart
          there is no God but his pleasure. He that loves his belly more than
          God, says in his heart there is no God but his belly: their happiness
          is not accounted to lie in that God that made the world, but in the
          pleasure or profit they make their god. In this, though a created
          object be the immediate and subordinate term to which we turn, yet
          principally and ultimately, the affection to it terminates in self.
          Nothing is naturally entertained by us, but as it affects our sense or
          mingles with some promise of advantage to us. This is seen,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the fewer thoughts we have of God than of anything else. Did we
          apprehend God to be our chiefest good and highest end, should we
          grudge him the pains of a few days’ thoughts upon him? Men in their
          travels are frequently thinking upon their intended stage: but our
          thoughts run upon new acquisitions to increase our wealth, rear up our
          families, revenge our injuries, and support our reputation: trifles
          possess us; but “God is not in all our thoughts;”254 seldom the sole
          object of them. We have durable thoughts of transitory things, and
          flitting thoughts of a durable and eternal good. The covenant of grace
          engageth the whole heart to God, and bars anything else from
          engrossing it: but what strangers are God and the souls of most men!
          Though we have the knowledge of him by creation, yet he is for the
          most part an unknown God in the relations wherein he stands to us,
          because a God undelighted in: hence it is, as one observes, that
          because we observe not the ways of God’s wisdom, conceive not of him
          in his vast perfections, nor are stricken with an admiration of his
          goodness, that we have fewer good sacred poems, than of any other
          kind.255 The wits of men hang the wing when they come to exercise
          their reasons and fancies about God. Parts and strength are given us,
          as well as corn and wine to the Israelites, for the service of God;
          but those are consecrated to some cursed Baal.256 Like Venus in the
          Poet, we forsake heaven to follow some Adonis.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the greedy pursuit of the world.257 When we pursue worldly
          wealth or worldly reputation with more vehemency than the riches of
          grace, or the favor of God;—when we have a foolish imagination, that
          our happiness consists in them, we prefer earth before heaven, broken
          cisterns which can hold no water, before an ever‑springing fountain of
          glory and bliss; and, as though there were a defect in God, cannot be
          content with him as our portion, without an addition of something
          inferior to him;—when we make it our hopes, and say to the wedge,
          “Thou art my confidence;” and rejoice more because it is great, and
          because “our hand hath gotten much,” than in the privilege of
          communion with God and the promise of an everlasting fruition of
          him;258 this is so gross, that Job joins it with the idolatry of the
          sun and moon, which he purgeth himself of (xxxi. 26). And the apostle,
          when he mentions covetousness or covetous men, passes it not over
          without the title of idolatry to the vice, and idolater to the
          person;259 in that it is a preferring clay and dirt as an end more
          desirable than the original of all goodness, in regard of affection
          and dependence.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In a strong addictedness to sensual pleasures (Phil. iii. 19). Who
          make their “belly their god;” subjecting the truths of God to the
          maintenance of their luxury. In debasing the higher faculties to
          project for the satisfaction of the sensitive appetite as their chief
          happiness, whereby many render themselves no better than a rout of
          sublimated brutes among men, and gross atheists to God. When men’s
          thoughts run also upon inventing new methods to satisfy their bestial
          appetite, forsaking the pleasures which are to be had in God, which
          are the delights of angels, for the satisfaction of brutes. This is an
          open and unquestionable refusal of God for our end, when our rest is
          in them, as if they were the chief good, and not God.

          4. In paying a service, upon any success in the world, to instruments
          more than to God, their sovereign Author. When “they sacrifice to
          their net, and burn incense to their drag.”260 Not that the Assyrian
          did offer a sacrifice to his arms, but ascribed to them what was due
          only to God, and appropriated the victory to his forces and arms. The
          prophet alludes to those that worshipped their warlike instruments,
          whereby they had attained great victories; and those artificers who
          worshipped the tools by which they had purchased great wealth, in the
          stead of God; preferring them as the causes of their happiness, before
          God who governs the world. And are not our affections, upon the
          receiving of good things, more closely fixed to the instruments of
          conveyance, than to the chief Benefactor, from whose coffers they are
          taken? Do we not more delight in them, and hug them with a greater
          endearedness, as if all our happiness depended on them, and God were
          no more than a bare spectator? Just as if when a man were warmed by a
          beam, he should adore that and not admire the sun that darts it out
          upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In paying a respect to man more than God. When in a public
          attendance on his service, we will not laugh, or be garish, because
          men see us; but our hearts shall be in a ridiculous posture, playing
          with feathers and trifling fancies, though God see us; as though our
          happiness consisted in the pleasing of men, and our misery in a
          respect to God. There is no fool that saith in his heart, There is no
          God, but he sets up something in his heart as a god. This is,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A debasing of God, (1.) In setting up a creature. It speaks God
          less amiable than the creature, short of those perfections which some
          silly, sordid thing, which hath engrossed their affections, is
          possessed with; as if the cause of all being could be transcended by
          his creature, and a vile lust could equal, yea, surmount the
          loveliness of God. It is to say to God, as the rich to the poor (James
          ii. 3), “Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool;” it is to
          sink him below the mire of the world, to order him to come down from
          his glorious throne, and take his place below a contemptible creature,
          which, in regard of its infinite distance, is not to be compared with
          him. It strips God of the love that is due to him by the right of his
          nature and the greatness of his dignity; and of the trust that is due
          to him, as the First Cause and the chiefest good, as though he were
          too feeble and mean to be our blessedness. This is intolerable, to
          make that which is God’s footstool, the earth, to climb up into his
          throne; to set that in our heart which God hath made even below
          ourselves and put under our feet; to make that which we trample upon
          to dispose of the right God hath to our hearts.261 It is worse than if
          a queen should fall in love with the little image of the prince in the
          palace, and slight the beauty of his person; and as if people should
          adore the footsteps of a king in the dirt, and turn their backs upon
          his presence. (2.) It doth more debase him to set up a sin, a lust, a
          carnal affection as our chief end. To steal away the honor due to God,
          and appropriate it to that which is no work of his hands, to that
          which is loathsome in his sight, hath disturbed his rest, and wrung
          out his just breath to kindle a hell for its eternal lodging, a
          God‑dishonoring and a soul‑murdering lust, is worse than to prefer
          Barabbas before Christ. The baser the thing, the worse is the injury
          to him with whom we would associate it. If it were some generous
          principle, a thing useful to the world, that we place in an equality
          with, or a superiority above him, though it were a vile usage, yet it
          were not altogether so criminal; but to gratify some unworthy appetite
          with the displeasure of the Creator, something below the rational
          nature of man, much more infinitely below the excellent majesty of
          God, is a more unworthy usage of him. To advance one of the most
          virtuous nobles in a kingdom as a mark of our service and subjection,
          is not so dishonorable to a despised prince as to take a scabby beggar
          or a rotten carcase to place in his throne. Creeping things,
          abominable beasts, the Egyptian idols, cats and crocodiles, were
          greater abominations, and a greater despite done to God, than the
          image of jealousy at the gate of the altar.262 And let not any excuse
          themselves, that it is but one lust or one creature which is preferred
          as the end: is not he an idolater that worships the sun or moon, one
          idol, as well as he that worships the whole host of heaven? The
          inordinacy of the heart to one lust may imply a stronger contempt of
          him, than if a legion of lusts did possess the heart. It argues a
          greater disesteem, when he shall be slighted for a single vanity. The
          depth of Esau’s profaneness in contemning his birth‑right, and God in
          it, is aggravated by his selling it for one morsel of meat,263 and
          that none of the daintiest, none of the costliest—a mess of pottage;
          implying, had he parted with it at a greater rate, it had been more
          tolerable, and his profaneness more excusable. And it is reckoned as a
          high aggravation of the corruption of the Israelite judges (Amos ii.
          6), that they sold the poor for a pair of shoes; that is, that they
          would betray the cause of the poor for a bribe of no greater value
          than might purchase them a pair of shoes. To place any one thing as
          our chief end, though never so light, doth not excuse. He that will
          not stick to break with God for a trifle, a small pleasure, will leap
          the hedge upon a greater temptation. Nay, and if wealth, riches,
          friends, and the best thing in the world, our own lives, be preferred
          before God, as our chief happiness and end but one moment, it is an
          infinite wrong, because the infinite goodness and excellency of God is
          denied; as though the creature or lust we love, or our own life, which
          we prefer in that short moment before him, had a goodness in itself,
          superior to, and more desirable than the blessedness in God. And
          though it should be but one minute, and a man in all the period of his
          days, both before and after that failure, should actually and
          intentionally prefer God before all other things; yet he doth him an
          infinite wrong, because God in every moment is infinitely good, and
          absolutely desirable, and can never cease to be good, and cannot have
          the least shadow or change in him and his perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is a denying of God (Job xxxi. 26‒28): “If I beheld the sun when
          it shined, or the moon walking in its brightness, and my heart hath
          been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand; this also were
          iniquity to be punished by the judge, for I should have denied the
          Lord above.” This denial of God is not only the act of an open
          idolater, but the consequent of a secret confidence, and immoderate
          joy in worldly goods. This denial of God is to be referred to ver. 24,
          25. When a man saith to gold, “Thou art my confidence,” and rejoices
          because his wealth is great; he denies that God which is superior to
          all those, and the proper object of trust. Both idolatries are coupled
          here together; that which hath wealth and that which hath those
          glorious creatures in heaven for its object. And though some may think
          it a light sin, yet the crime being of deeper guilt, a denial of God,
          deserves a severer punishment, and falls under the sentence of the
          just Judge of all the earth, under that notion which Job intimates in
          those words, “This also were an iniquity to be punished by the Judge.”
          The kissing the hand to the sun, moon, or any idol, was an external
          sign of religious worship among those and other nations. This is far
          less than an inward hearty confidence, and an affectionate trust. If
          the motion of the hand be, much more the affection of the heart to an
          excrementitious creature, or a brutish pleasure, is a denial of God,
          and a kind of an abjuring of him, since the supreme affection of the
          soul is undoubtedly and solely the right of the Sovereign Creator, and
          not to be given in common to others, as the outward gesture may in a
          way of civil respect. Nothing that is an honor peculiar to God can be
          given to a creature, without a plain exclusion of God to be God; it
          being a disowning the rectitude and excellency of his nature. If God
          should command a creature such a love, and such a confidence in
          anything inferior to him, he would deny himself his own glory, he
          would deny himself to be the most excellent being. Can the Romanists
          be free from this, when they call the cross spem unicam, and say to
          the Virgin, In te Domina speravi, as Bonaventure? &amp;c. Good reason,
          therefore, have worldlings and sensualists, persons of immoderate
          fondness to anything in the world, to reflect upon themselves; since
          though they own the being of God, they are guilty of so great
          disrespect to him, that cannot be excused from the title of an
          unworthy atheism; and those that are renewed by the spirit of God, may
          here see ground of a daily humiliation for the frequent and too common
          excursions of their souls in creature confidences and affections,
          whereby they fall under the charge of an act of practical atheism,
          though they may be free from a habit of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Man would make himself the end of all creatures. Man would
          sit in the seat of God, and set his heart as the heart of God, as the
          Lord saith of Tyrus (Ezek. xxviii. 2). What is the consequence of
          this, but to be esteemed the chief good and end of other creatures? a
          thing that the heart of God cannot but be set upon, it being an
          inseparable right of the Deity, who must deny himself if he deny this
          affection of the heart. Since it is the nature of man, derived from
          his root, to desire to be equal with God, it follows that he desires
          no creature should be equal with him, but subservient to his ends and
          his glory. He that would make himself God, would have the honor proper
          to God. He that thinks himself worthy of his own supreme affection,
          thinks himself worthy to be the object of the supreme affection of
          others. Whosoever counts himself the chiefest good and last end, would
          have the same place in the thoughts of others. Nothing is more natural
          to man than a desire to have his own judgment the rule and measure of
          the judgments and opinions of the rest of mankind. He that sets
          himself in the place of the prince, doth, by that act, challenge all
          the prerogatives and dues belonging to the prince; and apprehending
          himself fit to be a king, apprehends himself also worthy of the homage
          and fealty of the subjects. He that loves himself chiefly, and all
          other things and persons for himself, would make himself the end of
          all creatures. It hath not been once or twice only in the world that
          some vain princes have assumed to themselves the title of gods, and
          caused divine adorations to be given to them, and altars to smoke with
          sacrifices for their honor. What hath been practised by one, is by
          nature seminally in all; we would have all pay an obedience to us, and
          give to us the esteem that is due to God. This is evident,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In pride. When we entertain a high opinion of ourselves, and act
          for our own reputes, we dispossess God from our own hearts; and while
          we would have our fame to be in every man’s mouth, and be admired in
          the hearts of men, we would chase God out of the hearts of others, and
          deny his glory a residence anywhere else, that our glory should reside
          more in their minds than the glory of God; that their thoughts should
          be filled with our achievements, more than the works and excellency of
          God, with our image, and not with the divine. Pride would paramount
          God in the affections of others, and justle God out of their souls;
          and by the same reason that man doth thus in the place where he lives,
          he would do so in the whole world, and press the whole creation from
          the service of their true Lord, to his own service. Every proud man
          would be counted by others as he counts himself, the highest, chiefest
          piece of goodness, and be adored by others, as much as he adores and
          admires himself. No proud man, in his self‑love, and self‑admiration,
          thinks himself in an error; and if he be worthy of his own admiration,
          he thinks himself worthy of the highest esteem of others, that they
          should value him above themselves, and value themselves only for him.
          What did Nebuchadnezzar intend by setting up a golden image, and
          commanding all his subjects to worship it, upon the highest penalty he
          could inflict, but that all should aim only at the pleasing his humor?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In using the creatures contrary to the end God has appointed. God
          created the world and all things in it, as steps whereby men might
          ascend to a prospect of him, and the acknowledgment of his glory; and
          we would use them to dishonor God, and gratify ourselves: he appointed
          them to supply our necessities, and support our rational delights, and
          we use them to cherish our sinful lusts. We wring groans from the
          creature in diverting them from their true scope to one of our own
          fixing, when we use them not in his service, but purely for our own,
          and turn those things he created for himself, to be instruments of
          rebellion against him to serve our turns, and hereby endeavor to
          defeat the ends of God in them, to establish our own ends by them:
          this is a high dishonor to God, a sacrilegious undermining of his
          glory,264 to reduce what God hath made to serve our own glory and our
          own pleasure; it perverts the whole order of the world, and directs it
          to another end than what God hath constituted, to another intention
          contrary to the intention of God; and thus man makes himself a God by
          his own authority. As all things were made by God, so they are for
          God; but while we aspire to the end of the creation, we deny and envy
          God the honor of being Creator; we cannot make ourselves the chief end
          of the creatures against God’s order, but we imply thereby that we
          were their first principle; for if we lived under a sense of the
          Creator of them while we enjoy them for our use, we should return the
          glory to the right owner. This is diabolical; though the devil, for
          his first affecting an authority in heaven, has been hurled down from
          the state of an angel of light into that of darkness, vileness, and
          misery, to be the most accursed creature living, yet he still aspires
          to mate God, contrary to the knowledge of the impossibility of success
          in it. Neither the terrors he feels, nor the future torments he doth
          expect, do a jot abate his ambition to be competitor with his Creator;
          how often hath he, since his first sin, arrogated to himself the honor
          of a God from the blind world, and attempted to make the Son of God,
          by a particular worship, count him as the “chiefest good and
          benefactor of the world!”265 Since all men by nature are the devil’s
          children, the serpent’s seed, they have something of this venom in
          their natures, as well as others of his qualities. We see that there
          may be, and is a prodigious atheism, lurking under the belief of a
          God; the devil knows there is a God, but acts like an atheist; and so
          do his children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, Man would make himself the end of God. This necessarily
          follows upon the former; whosoever makes himself his own law and his
          own end in the place of God, would make God the subject in making
          himself the sovereign; he that steps into the throne of a prince, sets
          the prince at his footstool; and while he assumes the prince’s
          prerogative, demands a subjection from him. The order of the creation
          has been inverted by the entrance of sin.266 God implanted an
          affection in man with a double aspect, the one to pitch upon God, the
          other to respect ourselves; but with this proviso, that our affection
          to God should be infinite, in regard of the object, and centre in him
          as the chiefest happiness and highest end. Our affections to ourselves
          should be finite, and refer ultimately to God as the original of our
          being; but sin hath turned man’s affections wholly to himself, whereas
          he should love God first, and himself in order to God; he now loves
          himself first, and God in order to himself; love to God is lost, and
          love to self hath usurped the throne. As God by “creation put all
          things under the feet of man,”267 reserving the heart for himself, man
          by corruption hath dispossessed God of his heart, and put him under
          his own feet. We often intend ourselves when we pretend the honor of
          God, and make God and religion a stale to some designs we have in
          hand; our Creator a tool for our own ends. This is evident,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In our loving God, because of some self‑pleasing benefits
          distributed by him. There is in men a kind of natural love to God, but
          it is but a secondary one, because God gives them the good things of
          this world, spreads their table, fills their cup, stuffs their
          coffers, and doth them some good turns by unexpected providences; this
          is not an affection to God for the unbounded excellency of his own
          nature, but for his beneficence, as he opens his hand for them; an
          affection to themselves, and those creatures, their gold, their honor,
          which their hearts are most fixed upon, without a strong spiritual
          inclination that God should be glorified by them in the use of those
          mercies. It is rather a disowning of God, than any love to him,
          because it postpones God to those things they love him for; this would
          appear to be no love, if God should cease to be their benefactor, and
          deal with them as a judge; if he should change his outward smiles into
          afflicting frowns, and not only shut his hand, but strip them of what
          he sent them. The motive of their love being expired, the affection
          raised by it must cease for want of fuel to feed it; so that God is
          beholden to sordid creatures of no value (but as they are his
          creatures) for most of the love the sons of men pretend to him. The
          devil spake truth of most men, though not of Job, when he said (Job i.
          9): “They love not God for naught;” but while he makes a hedge about
          them and their families, whilst he blesseth the works of their hands,
          and increaseth their honor in the land. It is like Peter’s sharp
          reproof of his Master, when he spake of the ill‑usage, even to death,
          he was to meet with at Jerusalem: “This shall not be unto thee.” It
          was as much out of love to himself, as zeal for his Master’s interest,
          knowing his Master could not be in such a storm without some drops
          lighting upon himself. All the apostasies of men in the world are
          witnesses to this; they fawn whilst they may have a prosperous
          profession, but will not bear one chip of the cross for the interest
          of God; they would partake of his blessings, but not endure the prick
          of a lance for him, as those, that admired the miracles of our
          Saviour, and shrunk at his sufferings. A time of trial discovers these
          mercenary souls to be more lovers of themselves than their Maker. This
          is a pretended love of friendship to God, but a real love to a lust,
          only to gain by God. A good man’s temper is contrary: “Quench hell,
          burn heaven,” said a holy man, “I will love and fear my God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is evident, in abstinence from some sins, not because they
          offend God, but because they are against the interest of some other
          beloved corruption, or a bar to something men hunt after in the world.
          When temperance is cherished not to honor God, but preserve a crazy
          carcase; prodigality forsaken, out of a humor of avarice; uncleanness
          forsaken, not out of a hatred of lust, but love to their money;
          declining a denial of the interest and truth of God, not out of
          affection to them, but an ambitious zeal for their own reputation.
          There is a kind of conversion from sin, when God is not made the term
          of it (Jer. iv. 1): “If thou wilt return, O Israel, return unto me,
          saith the Lord.”268 When we forbear sin as dogs do the meat they love:
          they forbear not out of a hatred of the carrion, but fear of the
          cudgel; these are as wicked in their abstaining from sin, as others
          are in their furious committing it. Nothing of the honor of God and
          the end of his appointments is indeed in all this, but the
          conveniences self gathers from them. Again, many of the motives the
          generality of the world uses to their friends and relations to draw
          them from vices, are drawn from self, and used to prop up natural or
          sinful self in them. Come, reform yourself, take other courses, you
          will smut your reputation and be despicable; you will destroy your
          estate, and commence a beggar; your family will be undone, and you may
          rot in a prison: not laying close to them the duty they owe to God,
          the dishonor which accrues to him by their unworthy courses, and the
          ingratitude to the God of their mercies; not that the other motives
          are to be laid aside and slighted. Mint and cummin may be tithed, but
          the weightier concerns are not to be omitted; but this shows that self
          is the bias, not only of men in their own course, but in their
          dealings with others; what should be subordinate to the honor of God,
          and the duty we owe to him, is made superior.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is evident, in performing duties merely for a selfish interest:
          making ourselves the end of religious actions, paying a homage to
          that, while we pretend to render it to God (Zech. vii. 5): “Did you at
          all fast unto me, even unto me?” Things ordained by God may fall in
          with carnal ends affected by ourselves; and then religion is not kept
          up by any interest of God in the conscience, but the interest of self
          in the heart: we then sanctify not the name of God in the duty, but
          gratify ourselves: God may be the object, self is the end; and a
          heavenly object is made subservient to a carnal design. Hypocrisy
          passes a compliment on God, and is called flattery (Psalm lxxviii.
          36): “They did flatter him with their lips,” &amp;c. They gave him a
          parcel of good words for their own preservation. Flattery, in the old
          notion among the heathens, is a vice more peculiar to serve our own
          turn and purvey for the belly: they knew they could not subsist
          without God, and therefore gave him a parcel of good words, that he
          might spare them, and make provision for them. Israel is an empty
          vine,269 a vine, say some, with large branches and few clusters, but
          brings forth fruit to himself: while they professed love to God with
          their lips, it was that God should promote their covetous designs, and
          preserve their wealth and grandeur;270 in which respect a hypocrite
          may be well termed a religious atheist, an atheist masked with
          religion. The chief arguments which prevail with many men to perform
          some duties and appear religious, are the same that Hamor and Shechem
          used to the people of their city to submit to circumcision, viz. the
          engrossing of more wealth (Gen. xxxiv. 21, 22): “If every male among
          us be circumcised, as they are circumcised, shall not their cattle and
          their substance, and every beast of theirs, be ours?” This is seen,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) In unwieldiness to religious duties where self is not concerned.
          With what lively thoughts will many approach to God, when a revenue
          may be brought in to support their own ends! But when the concerns of
          God only are in it, the duty is not the delight, but the clog; such
          feeble devotions, that warm not the soul, unless there be something of
          self to give strength and heat to them. Jonah was sick of his work,
          and run from God, because he thought he should get no honor by his
          message: God’s mercy would discredit his prophecy.271 Thoughts of
          disadvantage cut the very sinews of service. You may as well persuade
          a merchant to venture all his estate upon the inconstant waves without
          hopes of gain, as prevail with a natural man to be serious in duty,
          without expectation of some warm advantage. “What profit should we
          have if we pray to him?” is the natural question (Job xxi. 15). “What
          profit shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin?” (Job xxxv. 3). I
          shall have more good by my sin than by my service. It is for God that
          I dance before the ark, saith David, therefore I will be more vile (2
          Sam. vi. 22). It is for self that I pray, saith a natural man,
          therefore I will be more warm and quick. Ordinances of God are
          observed only as a point of interest, and prayer is often most
          fervent, when it is least godly, and most selfish; carnal ends and
          affections will pour out lively expressions. If there be no delight in
          the means that lead to God, there is no delight in God himself;
          because love is appetitus unionis, a desire of union; and where the
          object is desirable, the means that brings us to it would be
          delightful too.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) In calling upon God only in a time of necessity. How officious
          will men be in affliction, to that God whom they neglect in their
          prosperity! “When he slew them, then they sought him, and they
          returned and inquired after God, and they remembered that God was
          their rock” (Psalm lxxviii. 34). They remembered him under the
          scourge, and forgot him under his smiles: they visit the throne of
          grace, knock loud at heaven’s gates, and give God no rest for their
          early and importunate devotions when under distress: but when their
          desires are answered, and the rod removed, they stand aloof from him,
          and rest upon their own bottom, as Jer. ii. 31: “We are lords; we will
          come no more unto thee.” When we have need of him, he shall find us
          clients at his gate; and when we have served our turn, he hears no
          more of us: like Noah’s dove sent out of the ark, that returned to him
          when she found no rest on the earth, but came not back when she found
          a footing elsewhere. How often do men apply themselves to God, when
          they have some business for him to do for them! And then too, they are
          loth to put it solely into his hand to manage it for his own honor;
          but they presume to be his directors, that he may manage it for their
          glory. Self spurs men on to the throne of grace; they desire to be
          furnished with some mercy they want, or to have the clouds of some
          judgments which they fear blown over: this is not affection to God,
          but to ourselves: as the Romans worshipped a quartan ague as a
          goddess, and Timorem and Pallorem, fear and paleness, as gods; not out
          of any affection they had to the disease or the passion, but for fear
          to receive any hurt by them. Again, when we have gained the mercy we
          need, how little do we warm our souls with the consideration of that
          God that gave it, or lay out the mercy in his service! We are
          importunate to have him our friend in our necessities, and are
          ungratefully careless of him, and his injuries he suffers by us or
          others. When he hath discharged us from the rock where we stuck, we
          leave him, as having no more need of him, and able to do well enough
          without him; as if we were petty gods ourselves, and only wanted a
          lift from him at first. This is not to glorify God as God, but as our
          servant; not an honoring of God, but a self‑seeking: he would hardly
          beg at God’s door, if he could pleasure himself without him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) In begging his assistance to our own projects. When we lay the
          plot of our own affairs, and then come to God, not for counsel but
          blessing, self only shall give us counsel how to act; but because we
          believe there is a God that governs the world, we will desire him to
          contribute success. God is not consulted with till the counsel of self
          be fixed; then God must be the executor of our will. Self must be the
          principal, and God the instrument to hatch what we have contrived. It
          is worse when we beg of God to favor some sinful aim; the Psalmist
          implies this (Psalm lxvi. 18): “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
          Lord will not hear me.” Iniquity regarded as the aim in prayer,
          renders the prayer successless, and the suppliant an atheist, in
          debasing God to back his lust by his holy providence. The disciples
          had determined revenge; and because they could not act it without
          their Master, they would have him be their second in their vindictive
          passion (Luke ix. 55): “Call for fire from heaven.” We scarce seek God
          till we have modelled the whole contrivance in our own brains, and
          resolved upon the methods of performance; as though there were not a
          fulness of wisdom in God to guide us in our resolves, as well as power
          to breathe success upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) In impatience upon the refusal of our desires. How often do men’s
          spirits rise against God, when he steps not in with the assistance
          they want! If the glory of God swayed more with them than their
          private interest, they would let God be judge of his own glory, and
          rather magnify his wisdom than complain of his want of goodness.
          Selfish hearts will charge God with neglect of them, if he be not as
          quick in their supplies as they are in their desires; like those in
          Isa. lviii. 3, “Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest
          not? wherefore have we afflicted our souls, and thou takest no
          knowledge?” When we aim at God’s glory in our importunities, we shall
          fall down in humble submissions when he denies us; whereas self riseth
          up in bold expostulations, as if God were our servant, and had
          neglected the service he owed us, not to come at our call. We
          over‑value the satisfactions of self above the honor of God. Besides,
          if what we desire be a sin, our impatience at a refusal is more
          intolerable: it is an anger, that God will not lay aside his holiness
          to serve our corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) In the actual aims men have in their duties. In prayer for
          temporal things, when we desire health for our own ease, wealth for
          our own sensuality, strength for our revenge, children for the
          increase of our family, gifts for our applause; as Simon Magus did the
          Holy Ghost: or, when some of those ends are aimed at, this is to
          desire God not to serve himself of us, but to be a servant to our
          worldly interest, our vain glory, the greatening of our names, &amp;c.
          In spiritual mercies begged for; when pardon of sin is desired only
          for our own security from eternal vengeance; sanctification desired
          only to make us fit for everlasting blessedness; peace of conscience,
          only that we may lead our lives more comfortably in the world; when we
          have not actual intentions for the glory of God, or when our thoughts
          of God’s honor are overtopped by the aims of self‑advantage: not but
          that as God hath pressed us to those things by motives drawn from the
          blessedness derived to ourselves by them, so we may desire them with a
          respect to ourselves; but this respect must be contained within the
          due banks, in subordination to the glory of God, not above it, nor in
          an equal balance with it.272 That which is nourishing or medicinal in
          the first or second degree, is in the fourth or fifth degree mere
          destructive poison. Let us consider it seriously; though a duty be
          heavenly, doth not some base end smut us in it? [1.] How is it with
          our confessions of sin? Are they not more to procure our pardon, than
          to shame ourselves before God, or to be freed from the chains that
          hinder us from bringing him the glory for which we were created; or
          more to partake of his benefits, than to honor him in acknowledging
          the rights of his justice? Do we not bewail sin as it hath ruined us,
          not as it opposed the holiness of God? Do we not shuffle with God, and
          confess one sin, while we reserve another; as if we would allure God
          by declaring our dislike of one, to give us liberty to commit
          wantonness with another; not to abhor ourselves, but to daub with God.
          [2.] Is it any better in our private and family worship? Are not such
          assemblies frequented by some, where some upon whom they have a
          dependence may eye them, and have a better opinion of them, and
          affection to them? If God were the sole end of our hearts, would they
          not be as glowing under the sole eye of God, as our tongues or
          carriages are seemingly serious under the eye of man? Are not family
          duties performed by some that their voices may be heard, and their
          reputation supported among godly neighbors? [3.] Is not the charity of
          many men tainted with this end—self,273 as the Pharisees were, while
          they set the miserable object before them, but not the Lord; bestowing
          alms not so much upon the necessities of the people, as the friendship
          we owe them for some particular respects; or casting our bread upon
          those waters which stream down in the sight of the world, that our
          doles may be visible to them, and commended by them; or when we think
          to oblige God to pardon our transgressions, as if we merited it and
          heaven too at his hands, by bestowing a few pence upon indigent
          persons? And [4.] Is it not the same with the reproofs of men? Is not
          heat and anger carried out with full sail when our worldly interest is
          prejudiced and becalmed in the concerns of God? Do not many masters
          reprove their servants with more vehemency for the neglect of their
          trade and business, than the neglect of divine duties; and that upon
          religious arguments, pretending the honor of God that they may mind
          their own interest? But when they are negligent in what they owe to
          God, no noise is made, they pass without rebuke; is not this to make
          God and religion a stale to their own ends? It is a part of atheism
          not to regard the injuries done to God, as Tiberius,274 “Let God’s
          wrongs be looked to or cared for by himself.” [5.] Is it not thus in
          our seeming zeal for religion? as Demetrius and the craftsmen at
          Ephesus cried up aloud the greatness of Diana of the Ephesians, not
          out of any true zeal they had for her, but their gain, which was
          increased by the confluence of her worshippers, and the sale of her
          own shrines (Acts xix. 24, 28).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In making use of the name of God to countenance our sin. When we
          set up an opinion that is a friend to our lusts, and then dig deep
          into the Scripture to find crutches to support it, and authorize our
          practices; when men will thank God for what they have got by unlawful
          means, fathering the fruit of their cheating craft, and the simplicity
          of their chapmen upon God; crediting their cozenage by his name, as
          men do brass money, with a thin plate of silver, and the stamp and
          image of the prince. The Jews urge the law of God for the crucifying
          his Son (John xix. 7): “We have a law, and by that law he is to die,”
          and would make him a party in their private revenge. Thus often when
          we have faltered in some actions, we wipe our mouths, as if we sought
          God more than our own interest, prostituting the sacred name and honor
          of God, either to hatch or defend some unworthy lust against his
          word.275 Is not all this a high degree of atheism?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a vilifying God, an abuse of the highest good. Other sins
          subject the creature and outward things to them, but acting in
          religious services for self, subjects not only the highest
          concernments of men’s souls, but the Creator himself to the creature,
          nay, to make God contribute to that which is the pleasure of the
          devil, a greater slight than to cast the gifts of a prince to a herd
          of nasty swine. It were more excusable to serve ourselves of God upon
          the higher accounts, such that materially conduce to his glory; but it
          is an intolerable wrong to make him and his ordinances caterers for
          our own bellies, as they did:276 they sacrificed the נדבות of which
          the offerer might eat, not out of any reference to God, but love to
          their gluttony; not to please him, but feast themselves. The belly was
          truly made the god, when God was served only in order to the belly; as
          though the blessed God had his being, and his ordinances were enjoined
          to pleasure their foolish and wanton appetites; as though the work of
          God were only to patronize unrighteous ends, and be as bad as
          themselves, and become a pander to their corrupt affections.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Because it is a vilifying of God, it is an undeifying or dethroning
          God. It is an acting as if we were the lords, and God our vassal; a
          setting up those secular ends in the place of God, who ought to be our
          ultimate end in every action; to whom a glory is as due, as his mercy
          to us is utterly unmerited by us. He that thinks to cheat and put the
          fool upon God by his pretences, doth not heartily believe there is
          such a being. He could not have the notion of a God, without that of
          omniscience and justice; an eye to see the cheat, and an arm to punish
          it. The notion of the one would direct him in the manner of his
          services, and the sense of the other would scare him from the
          cherishing his unworthy ends. He that serves God with a sole respect
          to himself, is prepared for any idolatry; his religion shall warp with
          the times and his interest; he shall deny the true God for an idol,
          when his worldly interest shall advise him to it, and pay the same
          reverence to the basest image, which he pretends now to pay to God; as
          the Israelites were as real for idolatry under their basest princes,
          as they were pretenders to the true religion under those that were
          pious. Before I come to the use of this, give me leave to evince this
          practical atheism by two other considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Unworthy imaginations of God. “The fool hath said in his heart,
          There is no God:” that is, he is not such a God as you report him to
          be; this is meant by their being “corrupt,” in the second verse,
          corrupt being taken for playing the idolaters (Exod. xxxii. 7). We
          cannot comprehend God; if we could, we should cease to be finite; and
          because we cannot comprehend him, we erect strange images of him in
          our fancies and affections. And since guilt came upon us, because we
          cannot root out the notions of God, we would debase the majesty and
          nature of God, that we may have some ease in our consciences, and lie
          down with some comfort in the sparks of our own kindling. This is
          universal in men by nature. “God is not in all his thoughts;”277 not
          in any of his thoughts, according the excellency of his nature and
          greatness of his majesty. As the heathen did not glorify God as God,
          so neither do they conceive of God as God; they are all infected with
          some one or other ill opinion of him, thinking him not so holy,
          powerful, just, good, as he is, and as the natural force of the human
          understanding might arrive to. We join a new notion of God in our vain
          fancies, and represent him not as he is, but as we would have him to
          be, fit for our own use, and suited to our own pleasure. We set that
          active power of imagination on work, and there comes out a god (a
          calf) whom we own for a notion of God. Adam cast him into so narrow a
          mould, as to think that himself, who had newly sprouted up by his
          almighty power, was fit to be his corrival in knowledge, and had vain
          hopes to grasp as much as infiniteness; if he, in his first declining,
          begun to have such a conceit, it is no doubt but we have as bad under
          a mass of corruption. When holy Agur speaks of God, he cries out that
          he had not “the understanding of a man, nor the knowledge of the
          holy;”278 he did not think rationally of God, as man might by his
          strength at his first creation. There are as many carved images of God
          as there are minds of men, and as monstrous shapes as those
          corruptions into which they would transform him. Hence sprang,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Idolatry. Vain imaginations first set afloat and kept up this in
          the world. Vain imaginations of the God “whose glory they changed into
          the image of corruptible man.”279 They had set up vain images of him
          in their fancy, before they set up idolatrous representations of him
          in their temples; the likening him to those idols of wood and stone,
          and various metals, were the fruit of an idea erected in their own
          minds. This is a mighty debasing the Divine nature, and rendering him
          no better than that base and stupid matter they make the visible
          object of their adoration; equalling him with those base creatures
          they think worthy to be the representations of him. Yet how far did
          this crime spread itself in all corners of the world, not only among
          the more barbarous and ignorant, but the more polished and civilized
          nations! Judea only, where God had placed the ark of his presence,
          being free from it, in some intervals of time only after some sweeping
          judgment. And though they vomited up their idols under some sharp
          scourge, they licked them up again after the heavens were cleared over
          their heads: the whole book of Judges makes mention of it. And though
          an evangelical light hath chased that idolatry away from a great part
          of the world, yet the principle remaining coins more spiritual idols
          in the heart, which are brought before God in acts of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Hence all superstition received its rise and growth. When we mint a
          god according to our own complexion, like to us in mutable and various
          passions, soon angry and soon appeased, it is no wonder that we invent
          ways of pleasing him after we have offended him, and think to expiate
          the sin of our souls by some melancholy devotions and
          self‑chastisements. Superstition is nothing else but an unscriptural
          and unrevealed dread of God.280 When they imagined him a rigorous and
          severe master, they cast about for ways to mitigate him whom they
          thought so hard to be pleased: a very mean thought of him, as if a
          slight and pompous devotion could as easily bribe and flatter him out
          of his rigors, as a few good words or baubling rattles could please
          and quiet little children; and whatsoever pleased us, could please a
          God infinitely above us. Such narrow conceits had the Philistines,
          when they thought to still the anger of the God of Israel, whom they
          thought they possessed in the ark, with the present of a few golden
          mice.281 All the superstition this day living in the world is built
          upon this foundation: so natural it is to man to pull God down to his
          own imaginations, rather than raise his imaginations up to God. Hence
          doth arise also the diffidence of his mercy, though they repent;
          measuring God by the contracted models of their own spirits; as though
          his nature were as difficult to pardon their offences against him, as
          they are to remit wrongs done to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Hence springs all presumption, the common disease of the world. All
          the wickedness in the world, which is nothing else but presuming upon
          God, rises from the ill interpretations of the goodness of God,
          breaking out upon them in the works of creation and providence. The
          corruption of man’s nature engendered by those notions of goodness a
          monstrous birth of vain imaginations; not of themselves primarily, but
          of God; whence arose all that folly and darkness in their minds and
          conversations (Rom. i. 20, 21). They glorified him not as God, but,
          according to themselves, imagined him good that themselves might be
          bad; fancied him so indulgent, as to neglect his own honor for their
          sensuality. How doth the unclean person represent him to his own
          thoughts, but as a goat; the murderer as a tiger; the sensual person
          as a swine; while they fancy a God indulgent to their crimes without
          their repentance! As the image on the seal is stamped upon the wax, so
          the thoughts of the heart are printed upon the actions. God’s patience
          is apprehended to be an approbation of their vices, and from the
          consideration of his forbearance, they fashion a god that they believe
          will smile upon their crimes. They imagine a god that plays with them;
          and though he threatens doth it only to scare, but means not as he
          speaks. A god they fancy like themselves, that would do as they would
          do, not be angry for what they count a light offence (Psalm l. 21):
          “Thou thoughtest I was such a one as thyself;” that God and they were
          exactly alike as two tallies. “Our wilful misapprehensions of God are
          the cause of our misbehavior in all his worship. Our slovenly and lazy
          services tell him to his face what slight thoughts and apprehensions
          we have of him.”282 Compare these two together. Superstition ariseth
          from terrifying misapprehensions of God: presumption from
          self‑pleasing thoughts. One represents him only rigorous, and the
          other careless. One makes us over‑officious in serving him by our own
          rules; and the other over‑bold in offending him according to our
          humors. The want of a true notion of God’s justice makes some men
          slight him; and the want of a true apprehension of his goodness makes
          others too servile in their approaches to him. One makes us careless
          of duties, and the other makes us look on them rather as physic than
          food; an unsupportable penance, than a desirable privilege. In this
          case hell is the principle of duty performed to heaven. The
          superstitious man believes God hath scarce mercy to pardon; the
          presumptuous man believes he hath no such perfection as justice to
          punish. The one makes him insignificant to what he desires, kindness
          and goodness; the other renders him insignificant to what he fears,
          his vindictive justice. What between the idolater, the superstitious,
          the presumptuous person, God should look like no God in the world.
          These unworthy imaginations of God are likewise,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A vilifying of him. Debasing the Creator to be a creature of their
          own fancies; putting their own stamp upon him; and fashioning him not
          according to that beautiful image he impressed upon them by creation;
          but the defaced image they inherit by their fall, and which is worse,
          the image of the devil which spread itself over them at their revolt
          and apostasy. Were it possible to see a picture of God, according to
          the fancies of men, it would be the most monstrous being, such a God
          that never was, nor ever can be. We honor God when we have worthy
          opinions of him suitable to his nature; when we conceive of him as a
          being of unbounded loveliness and perfection. We detract from him when
          we ascribe to him such qualities as would be a horrible disgrace to a
          wise and good man as injustice and impurity. Thus men debase God when
          they invert his order, and would create him according to their image,
          as he first created them according to his own; and think him not
          worthy to be a God, unless he fully answer the mould they would cast
          him into, and be what is unworthy of his nature. Men do not conceive
          of God as he would have them; but he must be what they would have him,
          one of their own shaping.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This is worse than idolatry. The grossest idolater commits not a
          crime so heinous, by changing his glory into the image of creeping
          things and senseless creatures, as the imagining God to be as one of
          our sinful selves, and likening him to those filthy images we erect in
          our fancies. One makes him an earthly God, like an earthly creature;
          the other fancies him an unjust and impure God, like a wicked
          creature. One sets up an image of him in the earth, which is his
          footstool; the other sets up an image of him in the heart, which ought
          to be his throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is worse than absolute atheism, or a denial of God. “Dignius
          credimus non esse, quodcunque non ita fuerit, ut esse deberet,”283 was
          the opinion of Tertullian. It is more commendable to think him not to
          be, than to think him such a one as is inconsistent with his nature.
          Better to deny his existence, than deny his perfection. No wise man
          but would rather have his memory rot, than be accounted infamous, and
          would be more obliged to him that should deny that ever he had a being
          in the world, than to say he did indeed live, but he was a sot, a
          debauched person, and a man not to be trusted. When we apprehend God
          deceitful in his promises, unrighteous in his threatenings, unwilling
          to pardon upon repentance, or resolved to pardon notwithstanding
          impenitency: these are things either unworthy of the nature of God, or
          contrary to that revelation he hath given of himself. Better for a man
          never to have been born than be forever miserable; so better to be
          thought no God, than represented impotent or negligent, unjust or
          deceitful; which are more contrary to the nature of God than hell can
          be to the greatest criminal. In this sense perhaps the apostle affirms
          the Gentiles (Eph. ii. 12) to be such as are “without God in the
          world;” as being more atheists in adoring God under such notions as
          they commonly did, than if they had acknowledged no God at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This is evident by our natural desire to be distant from him, and
          unwillingness to have any acquaintance with him. Sin set us first at a
          distance from God; and every new act of gross sin estrangeth us more
          from him, and indisposeth us more for him: it makes us both afraid and
          ashamed to be near him. Sensual men were of this frame that Job
          discourseth of (ch. xxi. 7‒9, 14, 15). Where grace reigns, the nearer
          to God the more vigorous the motion; the nearer anything approaches to
          us, that is the object of our desires, the more eagerly do we press
          forward to it: but our blood riseth at the approaches of anything to
          which we have an aversion. We have naturally a loathing of God’s
          coming to us or our return to him: we seek not after him as our
          happiness; and when he offers himself, we like it not, but put a
          disgrace upon him in choosing other things before him. God and we are
          naturally at as great a distance, as light and darkness, life and
          death, heaven and hell. The stronger impression of God anything hath,
          the more we fly from it. The glory of God in reflection upon Moses’
          face scared the Israelites; they who had desired God to speak to them
          by Moses, when they saw a signal impression of God upon his
          countenance, were afraid to come near him, as they were before
          unwilling to come near to God.284 Not that the blessed God is in his
          own nature a frightful object; but our own guilt renders him so to us,
          and ourselves indisposed to converse with him; as the light of the sun
          is as irksome to a distempered eye, as it is in its own nature
          desirable to a sound one. The saints themselves have had so much
          frailty, that they have cried out, that they were undone, if they had
          any more than ordinary discoveries of God made unto them; as if they
          wished him more remote from them. Vileness cannot endure the splendor
          of majesty, nor guilt the glory of a judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have naturally, 1. No desire of remembrance of him, 2. Or converse
          with him, 3. Or thorough return to him, 4. Or close imitation of him:
          as if there were not any such being as God in the world; or as if we
          wished there were none at all; so feeble and spiritless are our
          thoughts of the being of a God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. No desire for the remembrance of him. How delightful are other
          things in our minds! How burdensome the memorials of God, from whom we
          have our being! With what pleasure do we contemplate the nature of
          creatures, even of flies and toads, while our minds tire in the search
          of Him, who hath bestowed upon us our knowing and meditating
          faculties! Though God shows himself to us in every creature, in the
          meanest weed as well as the highest heavens, and is more apparent in
          them to our reasons than themselves can be to our sense; yet though we
          see them, we will not behold God in them: we will view them to please
          our sense, to improve our reason in their natural perfections; but
          pass by the consideration of God’s perfections so visibly beaming from
          them. Thus we play the beasts and atheists in the very exercise of
          reason, and neglect our Creator to gratify our sense, as though the
          pleasure of that were more desirable than the knowledge of God. The
          desire of our souls is not towards his name and the remembrance of
          him,285 when we set not ourselves in a posture to feast our souls with
          deep and serious meditations of him; have a thought of him, only by
          the bye and away, as if we were afraid of too intimate acquaintance
          with him. Are not the thoughts of God rather our invaders than our
          guests; seldom invited to reside and take up their home in our hearts?
          Have we not, when they have broke in upon us, bid them depart from
          us,286 and warned them to come no more upon our ground; sent them
          packing as soon as we could, and were glad when they were gone? And
          when they have departed, have we not often been afraid they should
          return again upon us, and therefore looked about for other inmates,
          things not good, or if good, infinitely below God, to possess the room
          of our hearts before any thoughts of him should appear again? Have we
          not often been glad of excuses to shake off present thoughts of him,
          and when we have wanted real ones, found out pretences to keep God and
          our hearts at a distance? Is not this a part of atheism, to be so
          unwilling to employ our faculties about the giver of them, to refuse
          to exercise them in a way of a grateful remembrance of him; as though
          they were none of his gift, but our own acquisition; as though the God
          that truly gave them had no right to them, and he that thinks on us
          every day in a way of providence, were not worthy to be thought on by
          us in a way of special remembrance? Do not the best, that love the
          remembrance of him, and abhor this natural averseness, find, that when
          they would think of God, many things tempt them and turn them to think
          elsewhere? Do they not find their apprehensions too feeble, their
          motions too dull, and the impressions too slight? This natural atheism
          is spread over human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. No desire of converse with him. The word “remember” in the command
          for keeping holy the Sabbath‑day, including all the duties of the day,
          and the choicest of our lives, implies our natural unwillingness to
          them, and forgetfulness of them. God’s pressing this command with more
          reasons than the rest, manifests that man hath no heart for spiritual
          duties. No spiritual duty, which sets us immediately face to face with
          God, but in the attempts of it we find naturally a resistance from
          some powerful principle; so that everyone may subscribe to the speech
          of the apostle, that “when we would do good, evil is present with
          them.” No reason of this can be rendered, but the natural temper of
          our souls, and an affecting a distance from God under any
          consideration: for though our guilt first made the breach, yet this
          aversion to a converse with him steps up without any actual
          reflections upon our guilt, which may render God terrible to us as an
          offended judge. Are we not often also, in our attendance upon him,
          more pleased with the modes of worship which gratify our fancy, than
          to have our souls inwardly delighted with the object of worship
          himself? This is a part of our natural atheism. To cast such duties
          off by total neglect, or in part, by affecting a coldness in them, is
          to cast off the fear of the Lord.287 Not to call upon God, and not to
          know him, are one and the same thing (Jer. x. 25). Either we think
          there is no such Being in the world, or that he is so slight a one,
          that he deserves not the respect he calls for; or so impotent and
          poor, that he cannot supply what our necessities require.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. No desire of a thorough return to him. The first man fled from him
          after his defection, though he had no refuge to fly to but the grace
          of his Creator. Cain went from his presence, would be a fugitive from
          God rather than a suppliant to him; when by faith in, and application
          of the promised Redeemer, he might have escaped the wrath to come for
          his brother’s blood, and mitigated the sorrows he was justly sentenced
          to bear in the world. Nothing will separate prodigal man from
          commoning with swine; and make him return to his father, but an empty
          trough: have we but husks to feed on, we shall never think of a
          father’s presence. It were well if our sores and indigence would drive
          us to him; but when our strength is devoured, we will not “return to
          the Lord our God, nor seek him for all this.”288 Not his drawn sword,
          as a God of judgment, nor his mighty power, as a Lord, nor his open
          arms, as the Lord their God, could move them to turn their eyes and
          their hearts towards him. The more he invites us to partake of his
          grace, the further we run from him to provoke his wrath: the louder
          God called them by his prophets, the closer they stuck to their
          Baal.289 We turn our backs when he stretches out his hand, stop our
          ears when he lifts up his voice. We fly from him when he courts us,
          and shelter ourselves in any bush from his merciful hand that would
          lay hold upon us; nor will we set our faces towards him, till our way
          be hedged up with thorns, and not a gap left to creep out any
          by‑way.290 Whosoever is brought to a return, puts the Holy Ghost to
          the pain of striving; he is not easily brought to a spiritual
          subjection to God, nor persuaded to a surrender at a summons, but
          sweetly overpowered by storm, and victoriously drawn into the arms of
          God. God stands ready, but the heart stands off; grace is full of
          entreaties, and the soul full of excuses; Divine love offers, and
          carnal self‑love rejects. Nothing so pleases us as when we are
          farthest from him; as if anything were more amiable, anything more
          desirable, than himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. No desire of any close imitation of him. When our Saviour was to
          come as a refiner’s fire, to purify the sons of Levi, the cry is, “Who
          shall abide the day of his coming?” (Mal. iii. 2, 3.) Since we are
          alienated from the life of God, we desire no more naturally to live
          the life of God, than a toad, or any other animal, desires to live the
          life of a man. No heart that knows God but hath a holy ambition to
          imitate him. No soul that refuseth him for a copy, but is ignorant of
          his excellency. Of this temper is all mankind naturally. Man in
          corruption is as loth to be like God in holiness, as Adam, after his
          creation, was desirous to be like God in knowledge; his posterity are
          like their father, who soon turned his back upon his original copy.
          What can be worse than this? Can the denial of his being be a greater
          injury than this contempt of him; as if he had not goodness to deserve
          our remembrance, nor amiableness fit for our converse; as if he were
          not a Lord fit for our subjection, nor had a holiness that deserved
          our imitation? For the use of this:—
        </p>
        <p>Use I. It serves for information.</p>
        <p>
          1. It gives us occasion to admire the wonderful patience and mercy of
          God. How many millions of practical atheists breathe every day in his
          air, and live upon his bounty who deserve to be inhabitants in hell,
          rather than possessors of the earth! An infinite holiness is offended,
          an infinite justice is provoked; yet an infinite patience forbears the
          punishment, and an infinite goodness relieves our wants: the more we
          had merited his justice and forfeited his favor, the more is his
          affection enhanced, which makes his hand so liberal to us. At the
          first invasion of his rights, he mitigates the terror of the
          threatening which was set to defend his law, with the grace of a
          promise to relieve and recover his rebellious creature.291 Who would
          have looked for anything but tearing thunders, sweeping judgments, to
          raze up the foundations of the apostate world? But oh, how great are
          his bowels to his aspiring competitors! Have we not experimented his
          contrivances for our good, though we have refused him for our
          happiness? Has he not opened his arms, when we spurned with our feet;
          held out his alluring mercy, when we have brandished against him a
          rebellious sword? Has he not entreated us while we have invaded him,
          as if he were unwilling to lose us, who are ambitious to destroy
          ourselves? Has he yet denied us the care of his providence, while we
          have denied him the rights of his honor, and would appropriate them to
          ourselves? Has the sun forborne shining upon us, though we have shot
          our arrows against him? Have not our beings been supported by his
          goodness, while we have endeavored to climb up to his throne; and his
          mercies continued to charm us, while we have used them as weapons to
          injure him? Our own necessities might excite us to own him as our
          happiness, but he adds his invitations to the voice of our wants. Has
          he not promised a kingdom to those that would strip him of his crown,
          and proclaimed pardon upon repentance to those that would take away
          his glory? and hath so twisted together his own end, which is his
          honor, and man’s true end, which is his salvation, that a man cannot
          truly mind himself and his own salvation, but he must mind God’s
          glory; and cannot be intent upon God’s honor, but by the same act he
          promotes himself and his own happiness? so loth is God to give any
          just occasion of dissatisfaction to his creature, as well as dishonor
          to himself. All those wonders of his mercy are enhanced by the
          heinousness of our atheism; a multitude of gracious thoughts from him
          above the multitude of contempts from us.292 What rebels in actual
          arms against their prince, aiming at his life, ever found that favor
          from him; to have all their necessaries richly afforded them, without
          which they would starve, and without which they would be unable to
          manage their attempts, as we have received from God? Had not God had
          riches of goodness, forbearance, and long‑suffering, and infinite
          riches too, the despite the world had done him, in refusing him as
          their rule, happiness, and end, would have emptied him long ago.293
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It brings in a justification of the exercise of his justice. If it
          gives us occasion loudly to praise his patience, it also stops our
          mouths from accusing any acts of his vengeance. What can be too sharp
          a recompense for the despising and disgracing so great a Being? The
          highest contempt merits the greatest anger; and when we will not own
          him for our happiness, it is equal we should feel the misery of
          separation from him. If he that is guilty of treason deserves to lose
          his life, what punishment can be thought great enough for him that is
          so disingenuous as to prefer himself before a God so infinitely good,
          and so foolish as to invade the rights of one infinitely powerful? It
          is no injustice for a creature to be forever left to himself, to see
          what advantage he can make of that self he was so busily employed to
          set up in the place of his Creator. The soul of man deserves an
          infinite punishment for despising an infinite good; and it is not
          unequitable, that that self which man makes his rule and happiness
          above God, should become his torment and misery by the righteousness
          of that God whom he despised.

        <p>
          3. Hence ariseth a necessity of a new state and frame of soul, to
          alter an atheistical nature. We forget God; think of him with
          reluctancy; have no respect to God in our course and acts: this cannot
          be our original state. God, being infinitely good, never let man come
          out of his hands with this actual unwillingness to acknowledge and
          serve him; he never intended to dethrone himself for the work of his
          hands, or that the creature should have any other end than that of his
          Creator: as the apostle saith, in the case of the Galatians’ error
          (Gal. v. 8), “This persuasion came not of Him that called you;” so
          this frame comes not from him that created you: how much, therefore,
          do we need a restoring principle in us! Instead of ordering ourselves
          according to the will of God, we are desirous to “fulfil the wills of
          the flesh:”294 there is a necessity of some other principle in us to
          make us fulfil the will of God, since we were created for God, not for
          the flesh. We can no more be voluntarily serviceable to God, while our
          serpentine nature and devilish habits remain in us, than we can
          suppose the devil can be willing to glorify God, while the nature he
          contracted by his fall abides powerfully in him. Our nature and will
          must be changed, that our actions may regard God as our end, that we
          may delightfully meditate on him, and draw the motives of our
          obedience from him. Since this atheism is seated in nature, the change
          must be in our nature; since our first aspirings to the rights of God
          were the fruits of the serpent’s breath which tainted our nature,
          there must be a removal of this taint, whereby our natures may be on
          the side of God against Satan, as they were before on the side of
          Satan against God. There must be a supernatural principle before we
          can live a supernatural life, i. e. live to God, since we are
          naturally alienated from the life of God: the aversion of our natures
          from God, is as strong as our inclination to evil; we are disgusted
          with one, and pressed with the other; we have no will, no heart, to
          come to God in any service. This nature must be broken in pieces and
          new moulded, before we can make God our rule and our end: while men’s
          “deeds are evil” they cannot comply with God;295 much less while their
          natures are evil. Till this be done, all the service a man performs
          riseth from some “evil imagination of the heart, which is evil, only
          evil, and that continually;”296 from wrong notions of God, wrong
          notions of duty, or corrupt motives. All the pretences of devotion to
          God are but the adoration of some golden image. Prayers to God for the
          ends of self, are like those of the devil to our Saviour, when he
          asked leave to go into the herd of swine: the object was right,
          Christ; the end was the destruction of the swine, and the satisfaction
          of their malice to the owners; there is a necessity then that depraved
          ends should be removed, that that which was God’s end in our framing,
          may be our end in our acting, viz. his glory, which cannot be without
          a change of nature. We can never honor him supremely whom we do not
          supremely love; till this be, we cannot glorify God as God, though we
          do things by his command and order; no more, than when God employed
          the devil in afflicting Job.297 His performance cannot be said to be
          good, because his end was not the same with God’s; he acted out of
          malice, what God commanded out of sovereignty, and for gracious
          designs; had God employed an holy angel in his design upon Job, the
          action had been good in the affliction, because his nature was holy,
          and therefore his ends holy; but bad in the devil, because his ends
          were base and unworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We may gather from hence, the difficulty of conversion, and
          mortification to follow thereupon. What is the reason men receive no
          more impression from the voice of God and the light of his truth, than
          a dead man in the grave doth from the roaring thunder, or a blind mole
          from the light of the sun? It is because our atheism is as great as
          the deadness of the one, or the blindness of the other. The principle
          in the heart is strong to shut the door both of the thoughts and
          affections against God. If a friend oblige us, we shall act for him as
          for ourselves; we are won by entreaties; soft words overcome us; but
          our hearts are as deaf as the hardest rock at the call of God; neither
          the joys of heaven proposed by him can allure us, nor the flashed
          terrors of hell affright us to him, as if we conceived God unable to
          bestow the one or execute the other: the true reason is, God and self
          contest for the deity. The law of sin is, God must be at the
          footstool; the law of God is, sin must be utterly deposed. Now it is
          difficult to leave a law beloved for a law long ago discarded. The
          mind of man will hunt after anything; the will of man embrace
          anything: upon the proposal of mean objects the spirit of man spreads
          its wings, flies to catch them, becomes one with them: but attempt to
          bring it under the power of God, the wings flag, the creature looks
          lifeless, as though there were no spring of motion in it; it is as
          much crucified to God, as the holy apostle was to the world. The sin
          of the heart discovers its strength the more God discovers the
          “holiness of his will.”298 The love of sin hath been predominant in
          our nature, has quashed a love to God, if not extinguished it. Hence
          also is the difficulty of mortification. This is a work tending to the
          honor of God, the abasing of that inordinately aspiring humor in
          ourselves. If the nature of man be inclined to sin, as it is, it must
          needs be bent against anything that opposes it. It is impossible to
          strike any true blow at any lust till the true sense of God be
          re‑entertained in the soil where it ought to grow. Who can be
          naturally willing to crucify what is incorporated with him—his flesh?
          what is dearest to him—himself? Is it an easy thing for man, the
          competitor with God, to turn his arms against himself, that self
          should overthrow its own empire, lay aside all its pretensions to, and
          designs for, a godhead; to hew off its own members, and subdue its own
          affections? It is the nature of man to “cover his sin,” to hide it in
          his bosom,299 not to destroy it; and as unwillingly part with his
          carnal affections, as the legion of devils were with the man that had
          been long possessed; and when he is forced and fired from one, he will
          endeavor to espouse some other lust, as those devils desired to
          possess swine, when they were chased from their possession of that
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Here we see the reason of unbelief. That which hath most of God in
          it, meets with most aversion from us; that which hath least of God,
          finds better and stronger inclinations in us. What is the reason that
          the heart of man is more unwilling to embrace the gospel, than
          acknowledge the equity of the law? because there is more of God’s
          nature and perfection evident in the gospel than in the law; besides,
          there is more reliance on God, and distance from self, commanded in
          the gospel. The law puts a man upon his own strength, the gospel takes
          him off from his own bottom; the law acknowledges him to have a power
          in himself, and to act for his own reward; the gospel strips him of
          all his proud and towering thoughts,300 brings him to his due place,
          the foot of God; orders him to deny himself as his own rule,
          righteousness, and end, “and henceforth not to live to himself.”301
          This is the true reason why men are more against the gospel than
          against the law; because it doth more deify God, and debase man. Hence
          it is easier to reduce men to some moral virtue than to faith; to make
          men blush at their outward vices, but not at the inward impurity of
          their natures. Hence it is observed, that those that asserted that all
          happiness did arise from something in a man’s self, as the Stoics and
          Epicureans did, and that a wise man was equal with God, were greater
          enemies to the truths of the gospel than others (Acts xvii. 18),
          because it lays the axe to the root of their principal opinion, takes
          the one from their self‑sufficiency, and the other from their
          self‑gratification; it opposeth the brutish principle of the one,
          which placed happiness in the pleasures of the body, and the more
          noble principle of the other, which placed happiness in the virtue of
          the mind; the one was for a sensual, the other for a moral self; both
          disowned by the doctrine of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It informs us, consequently, who can be the Author of grace and
          conversion, and every other good work. No practical atheist ever yet
          turned to God, but was turned by God; and not to acknowledge it to God
          is a part of this atheism, since it is a robbing God of the honor of
          one of his most glorious works. If this practical atheism be natural
          to man ever since the first taint of nature in Paradise, what can be
          expected from it, but a resisting of the work of God, and setting up
          all the forces of nature against the operations of grace, till a day
          of power dawn and clear up upon the soul?302 Not all the angels in
          heaven, or men upon earth, can be imagined to be able to persuade a
          man to fall out with himself; nothing can turn the tide of nature, but
          a power above nature. God took away the sanctifying Spirit from man,
          as a penalty for the first sin; who can regain it but by his will and
          pleasure? who can restore it, but he that removed it? Since every man
          hath the same fundamental atheism in him by nature, and would be a
          rule to himself and his own end, he is so far from dethroning himself,
          that all the strength of his corrupted nature is alarmed up to stand
          to their arms upon any attempt God makes to regain the fort. The will
          is so strong against God, that it is like many wills twisted together
          (Eph. ii. 3), “Wills of the flesh;” we translate it the “desires of
          the flesh;” like many threads twisted in a cable, never to be snapped
          asunder by a human arm; a power and will above ours, can only untwist
          so many wills in a knot. Man cannot rise to an acknowledgment of God
          without God; hell may as well become heaven, the devil be changed into
          an angel of light. The devil cannot but desire happiness; he knows the
          misery into which he is fallen, he cannot be desirous of that
          punishment he knows is reserved for him. Why doth he not sanctify God,
          and glorify his Creator, wherein there is abundantly more pleasure
          than in his malicious course? Why doth he not petition to recover his
          ancient standing? he will not; there are chains of darkness upon his
          faculties; he will not be otherwise than he is; his desire to be god
          of the world sways him against his own interest, and out of love to
          his malice, he will not sin at a less rate to make a diminution of his
          punishment. Man, if God utterly refuseth to work upon him, is no
          better; and to maintain his atheism would venture a hell. How is it
          possible for a man to turn himself to that God against whom he hath a
          quarrel in his nature; the most rooted and settled habit in him being
          to set himself in the place of God? An atheist by nature can no more
          alter his own temper, and engrave in himself the divine nature, than a
          rock can carve itself into the statue of a man, or a serpent that is
          an enemy to man could or would raise itself to the nobility of the
          human nature. That soul that by nature would strip God of his rights,
          cannot, without a divine power, be made conformable to him, and
          acknowledge sincerely and cordially the rights and glory of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. We may here see the reason why there can be no justification by the
          best and strongest works of nature. Can that which hath atheism at the
          root justify either the action or person? What strength can those
          works have which have neither God’s law for their rule, nor his glory
          for their end? that are not wrought by any spiritual strength from
          him, nor tend with any spiritual affection to him? Can these be a
          foundation for the most holy God to pronounce a creature righteous?
          They will justify his justice in condemning, but cannot sway his
          justice to an absolution. Every natural man in his works picks and
          chooses; he owns the will of God no further than he can wring it to
          suit the law of his members, and minds not the honor of God, but as it
          jostles not with his own glory and secular ends. Can he be righteous
          that prefers his own will and his own honor before the will and honor
          of the Creator? However men’s actions may be beneficial to others,
          what reason hath God to esteem them, wherein there is no respect to
          him, but themselves; whereby they dethrone him in their thoughts,
          while they seem to own him in their religious works? Every day
          reproves us with something different from the rule; thousands of
          wanderings offer themselves to our eyes: can justification be expected
          from that which in itself is matter of despair?
        </p>
        <p>
          8. See here the cause of all the apostasy in the world. Practical
          atheism was never conquered in such; they are still “alienated from
          the life of God,” and will not live to God, as he lives to himself and
          his own honor.303 They loathe his rule, and distaste his glory; are
          loth to step out of themselves to promote the ends of another; find
          not the satisfaction in him as they do in themselves; they will be
          judges of what is good for them and righteous in itself, rather than
          admit of God to judge for them. When men draw back from truth to
          error, it is to such opinions which may serve more to foment and
          cherish their ambition, covetousness, or some beloved lust that
          disputes with God for precedency, and is designed to be served before
          him (John xii. 42, 43): “They love the praise of men more than the
          praise of God.” A preferring man before God was the reason they would
          not confess Christ, and God in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. This shows us the excellency of the gospel and christian religion.
          It sets man in his due place, and gives to God what the excellency of
          his nature requires. It lays man in the dust from whence he was taken,
          and sets God upon that throne where he ought to sit. Man by nature
          would annihilate God and deify himself; the gospel glorifies God and
          annihilates man. In our first revolt we would be like him in
          knowledge; in the means he hath provided for our recovery, he designs
          to make us like him in grace; the gospel shows ourselves to be an
          object of humiliation, and God to be a glorious object for our
          imitation. The light of nature tells us there is a God; the gospel
          gives us a more magnificent report of him; the light of nature
          condemns gross atheism, and that of the gospel condemns and conquers
          spiritual atheism in the hearts of men.
        </p>
        <p>Use II. Of exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          First, Let us labor to be sensible of this atheism in our nature, and
          be humbled for it. How should we lie in the dust, and go bowing under
          the humbling thoughts of it all our days! Shall we not be sensible of
          that whereby we spill the blood of our souls, and give a stab to the
          heart of our own salvation? Shall we be worse than any creature, not
          to bewail that which tends to our destruction? He that doth not lament
          it, cannot challenge the character of a Christian, hath nothing of the
          divine life and love planted in his soul. Not a man but shall one day
          be sensible, when the eternal God shall call him out to examination,
          and charge his conscience to discover every crime, which will then own
          the authority whereby it acted; when the heart shall be torn open, and
          the secrets of it brought to public view; and the world and man
          himself shall see what a viperous brood of corrupt principles and ends
          nested in his heart. Let us, therefore, be truly sensible of it, till
          the consideration draw tears from our eyes and sorrow from our souls;
          let us urge the thoughts of it upon our hearts till the core of that
          pride be eaten out, and our stubbornness changed into humility; till
          our heads become waters, and our eyes fountains of tears, and be a
          spring of prayer to God to change the heart, and mortify the atheism
          in it; and consider what a sad thing it is to be a practical atheist:
          and who is not so by nature?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Let us be sensible of it in ourselves. Have any of our hearts been
          a soil wherein the fear and reverence of God hath naturally grown?
          Have we a desire to know him, or a will to embrace him? Do we delight
          in his will, and love the remembrance of his name? Are our respects to
          him, as God, equal to the speculative knowledge we have of his nature?
          Is the heart, wherein he hath stamped his image, reserved for his
          residence? Is not the world more affected than the Creator of the
          world; as though that could contribute to us a greater happiness than
          the Author of it? Have not creatures as much of our love, fear, trust,
          nay, more, than God that framed both them and us? Have we not too
          often relied upon our own strength, and made a calf of our own wisdom,
          and said of God, as the Israelites of Moses, “As for this Moses we wot
          not what is become of him?” (Exod. xxxii. 1) and given oftener the
          glory of our good success to our drag and our net, to our craft and
          our industry, than to the wisdom and blessing of God? Are we, then,
          free from this sort of atheism?304 It is as impossible to have two
          Gods at one time in one heart, as to have two kings at one time in
          full power in one kingdom. Have there not been frequent neglects of
          God? Have we not been deaf whilst he hath knocked at our doors? slept
          when he hath sounded in our ears, as if there had been no such being
          as a God in the world? How many strugglings have been against our
          approaches to him! Hath not folly often been committed, with vain
          imaginations starting up in the time of religious service, which we
          would scarce vouchsafe a look to at another time, and in another
          business, but would have thrust them away with indignation? Had they
          stept in to interrupt our worldly affairs, they would have been
          troublesome intruders; but while we are with God they are acceptable
          guests. How unwilling have our hearts been to fortify themselves with
          strong and influencing considerations of God, before we addressed to
          him! Is it not too often that our lifelessness in prayer proceeds from
          this atheism; a neglect of seeing what arguments and pleas may be
          drawn from the divine perfections, to second our suit in hand, and
          quicken our hearts in the service? Whence are those indispositions to
          any spiritual duty, but because we have not due thoughts of the
          majesty, holiness, goodness, and excellency of God? Is there any duty
          which leads to a more particular inquiry after him, or a more clear
          vision of him, but our hearts have been ready to rise up and call it
          cursed rather than blessed? Are not our minds bemisted with an
          ignorance of him, our wills drawn by aversion from him, our affections
          rising in distaste of him? more willing to know anything than his
          nature, and more industrious to do anything than his will? Do we not
          all fall under some one or other of these considerations? Is it not
          fit, then, that we should have a sense of them? It is to be bewailed
          by us, that so little of God is in our hearts, when so many evidences
          of the love of God are in the creatures; that God should be so little
          our end, who hath been so much our benefactor; that he should be so
          little in our thoughts, who sparkles in everything which presents
          itself to our eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Let us be sensible of it in others. We ought to have a just
          execration of the too open iniquity in the midst of us; and imitate
          holy David, whose tears plentifully gushed out, “because men kept not
          God’s law.”305 And is it not a time to exercise this pious
          lamentation? Hath the wicked atheism of any age been greater, or can
          you find worse in hell, than we may hear of and behold on earth? How
          is the excellent Majesty of God adored by the angels in heaven,
          despised and reproached by men on earth, as if his name were published
          to be matter of their sport! What a gasping thing is a natural sense
          of God among men in the world! Is not the law of God, accompanied with
          such dreadful threatenings and curses, made light of, as if men would
          place their honor in being above or beyond any sense of that glorious
          Majesty? How many wallow in pleasures, as if they had been made men
          only to turn brutes, and their souls given them only for salt, to keep
          their bodies from putrefying? It is as well a part of atheism not to
          be sensible of the abuses of God’s name and laws by others, as to
          violate them ourselves: what is the language of a stupid senselessness
          of them, but that there is no God in the world whose glory is worth a
          vindication, and deserves our regards? That we may be sensible of the
          unworthiness of neglecting God as our rule and end, consider,
        </p>
        <p>1. The unreasonableness of it as it concerns God.</p>
        <p>
          1st. It is a high contempt of God. It is an inverting the order of
          things; a making God the highest to become the lowest; and self the
          lowest to become the highest: to be guided by every base companion,
          some idle vanity, some carnal interest, is to acknowledge an
          excellency abounding in them which is wanting in God; an equity in
          their orders, and none in God’s precepts; a goodness in their
          promises, and a falsity in God’s; as if infinite excellency were a
          mere vanity, and to act for God were the debasement of our reason; to
          act for self or some pitiful creature, or sordid lust, were the glory
          and advancement of it. To prefer any one sin before the honor of God,
          is as if that sin had been our creator and benefactor, as if it were
          the original cause of our being and support. Do not men pay as great a
          homage to that as they do to God? Do not their minds eagerly pursue
          it? Are not the revolvings of it, in their fancies, as delightful to
          them as the remembrance of God to a holy soul? Do any obey the
          commands of God with more readiness than they do the orders of their
          base affections? Did Peter leap more readily into the sea to meet his
          Master, than many into the jaws of hell to meet their Dalilahs? How
          cheerfully did the Israelites part with their ornaments for the sake
          of an idol, who would not have spared a moiety for the honor of their
          Deliverer!306 If to make God our end is the principal duty in nature,
          then to make ourselves, or anything else, our end, is the greatest
          vice in the rank of evils.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. It is a contempt of God as the most amiable object. God is
          infinitely excellent and desirable (Zech. ix. 17): “How great is his
          goodness, and how great is his beauty!” There is nothing in him but
          what may ravish our affections; none that knows him but finds
          attractives to keep them with him; He hath nothing in him which can be
          a proper object of contempt, no defects or shadow of evil; there is
          infinite excellency to charm us, and infinite goodness to allure
          us,—the Author of our being, the Benefactor of our lives. Why then
          should man, which is his image, be so base as to slight the beautiful
          Original which stamped it on him? He is the most lovely object;
          therefore to be studied, therefore to be honored, therefore to be
          followed. In regard of his perfection he hath the highest right to our
          thoughts. All other beings were eminently contained in his essence,
          and were produced by his infinite power. The creature hath nothing but
          what it hath from God. And is it not unworthy to prefer the copy
          before the original—to fall in love with a picture, instead of the
          beauty it represents? The creature which we advance to be our rule and
          end, can no more report to us the true amiableness of God, than a few
          colors mixed and suited together upon a piece of cloth, can the moral
          and intellectual loveliness of the soul of man. To contemn God one
          moment is more base than if all creatures were contemned by us
          forever; because the excellency of creatures is, to God, like that of
          a drop to the sea, or a spark to the glory of unconceivable millions
          of suns. As much as the excellency of God is above our conceptions, so
          much doth the debasing of him admit of unexpressible aggravations.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Consider the ingratitude in it. That we should resist that God with
          our hearts who made us the work of his hands, and count him as
          nothing, from whom we derive all the good that we are or have. There
          is no contempt of man but steps in here to aggravate our slighting of
          God; because there is no relation one man can stand in to another,
          wherein God doth not more highly appear to man. If we abhor the
          unworthy carriage of a child to a tender father, a servant to an
          indulgent master, a man to his obliging friend, why do men daily act
          that toward God which they cannot speak of without abhorrency, if
          acted by another against man? Is God a being less to be regarded than
          man, and more worthy of contempt than a creature?—“It would be strange
          if a benefactor should live in the same town, in the same house with
          us, and we never exchange a word with him; yet this is our case, who
          have the works of God in our eyes, the goodness of God in our being,
          the mercy of God in our daily food”307—yet think so little of him,
          converse so little with him, serve everything before him, and prefer
          everything above him? Whence have we our mercies but from his hand?
          Who, besides him, maintains our breath this moment? Would he call for
          our spirits this moment, they must depart from us to attend his
          command. There is not a moment wherein our unworthy carriage is not
          aggravated, because there is not a moment wherein he is not our
          Guardian, and gives us not tastes of a fresh bounty. And it is no
          light aggravation of our crime, that we injure him without whose
          bounty, in giving us our being, we had not been capable of casting
          contempt upon him: that he that hath the greatest stamp of his image,
          man, should deserve the character of the worst of his rebels: that he
          who hath only reason by the gift of God to judge of the equity of the
          laws of God, should swell against them as grievous, and the government
          of the Lawgiver as burdensome. Can it lessen the crime to use the
          principle wherein we excel the beasts to the disadvantage of God, who
          endowed us with that principle above the beasts?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a debasing of God beyond what the devil doth at present. He
          is more excusable in his present state of acting, than man is in his
          present refusing God for his rule and end. He strives against a God
          that exerciseth upon him a vindictive justice; we debase a God that
          loads us with his daily mercies. The despairing devils are excluded
          from any mercy or divine patience; but we are not only under the
          long‑suffering of his patience, but the large expressions of his
          bounty. He would not be governed by him when he was only his bountiful
          Creator: we refuse to be guided by him after he hath given us the
          blessing of creation from his own hand, and the more obliging
          blessings of redemption by the hand and blood of his Son. It cannot be
          imagined that the devils and the damned should ever make God their
          end, since he hath assured them he will not be their happiness; and
          shut up all his perfections from their experimental notice, but those
          of his power to preserve them, and his justice to punish them. They
          have no grant from God of ever having a heart to comply with his will,
          or ever having the honor to be actively employed for his glory. They
          have some plea for their present contempt of God, not in regard of his
          nature, for he is infinitely amiable, excellent and lovely, but in
          regard of his administration toward them. But what plea can man have
          for his practical atheism, who lives by his power, is sustained by his
          bounty, and solicited by his Spirit? What an ungrateful thing is it to
          put off the nature of man for that of devils, and dishonor God under
          mercy, as the devils do under his wrathful anger!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is an ungrateful contempt of God, who cannot be injurious to us.
          He cannot do us wrong, because he cannot be unjust (Gen. xviii. 25):
          “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” His nature doth as
          much abhor unrighteousness, as love a communicative goodness: he never
          commanded anything but what was highly conducible to the happiness of
          man. Infinite goodness can no more injure man than it can dishonor
          itself: it lays out itself in additions of kindness, and while we
          debase him, he continues to benefit us; and is it not an unparalleled
          ingratitude to turn our backs upon an object so lovely, an object so
          loving, in the midst of varieties of allurements from him? God did
          create intellectual creatures, angels and men, that he might
          communicate more of himself and his own goodness and holiness to man,
          than creatures of a lower rank were capable of. What do we do, by
          rejecting him as our rule and end, but cross, as much as in us lies,
          God’s end in our creation, and shut our souls against the
          communications of those perfections he was so willing to bestow? We
          use him as if he intended us the greatest wrong, when it is impossible
          for him to do any to any of his creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Consider the misery which will attend such a temper if it continue
          predominant. Those that thrust God away as their happiness and end,
          can expect no other but to be thrust away by him, as to any relief and
          compassion. A distance from God here can look for nothing, but a
          remoteness from God hereafter. When the devil, a creature of vast
          endowments, would advance himself above God, and instruct man to
          commit the same sin, he is “cursed above all creatures.”308 When we
          will not acknowledge him a God of all glory, we shall be separated
          from him as a God of all comfort: “All they that are afar off shall
          perish” (Psalm lxxiii. 27). This is the spring of all woe. What the
          Prodigal suffered, was because he would leave his father, and live of
          himself. Whosoever is ambitious to be his own heaven, will at last
          find his soul to become its own hell. As it loved all things for
          itself, so it shall be grieved with all things for itself. As it would
          be its own god against the right of God, it shall then be its own
          tormentor by the justice of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Watch against this atheism, and be daily employed in the
          mortification of it. In every action we should make the inquiry, What
          is the rule I observe? Is it God’s will or my own? Whether do my
          intentions tend to set up God or self? As much as we destroy this, we
          abate the power of sin: these two things are the head of the serpent
          in us, which we must be bruising by the power of the cross. Sin is
          nothing else but a turning from God, and centering in self, and most
          in the inferior part of self: if we bend our force against those two,
          self‑will and self‑ends, we shall intercept atheism at the spring
          head, take away that which doth constitute and animate all sin: the
          sparks must vanish if the fire be quenched which affords them fuel.
          They are but two short things to ask in every undertaking: Is God my
          rule in regard of his will? Is God my end in regard of his glory? All
          sin lies in the neglect of these, all grace lies in the practice of
          them. Without some degree of the mortification of these; we cannot
          make profitable and comfortable approaches to God. When we come with
          idols in our hearts, we shall be answered according to the multitude
          and the baseness of them too.309 What expectation of a good look from
          him can we have, when we come before him with undeifying thoughts of
          him, a petition in our mouths, and a sword in our hearts, to stab his
          honor? To this purpose,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Be often in the views of the excellencies of God. When we have no
          intercourse with God by delightful meditations, we begin to be
          estranged from him, and prepare ourselves to live without God in the
          world. Strangeness is the mother and nurse of disaffection: we slight
          men sometimes because we know them not. The very beasts delight in the
          company of men; when being tamed and familiar, they become acquainted
          with their disposition. A daily converse with God would discover so
          much of loveliness in his nature, so much of sweetness in his ways,
          that our injurious thoughts of God would wear off, and we should count
          it our honor to contemn ourselves and magnify him. By this means a
          slavish fear, which is both a dishonor to God and a torment to the
          soul,310 and the root of atheism, will be cast out, and an ingenuous
          fear of him wrought in the heart. Exercised thoughts on him would
          issue out in affections to him, which would engage our hearts to make
          him both our rule and our end. This course would stifle any
          temptations to gross atheism, wherewith good souls are sometimes
          haunted, by confirming us more in the belief of a God, and discourage
          any attempts to a deliberate practical atheism. We are not like to
          espouse any principle which is confuted by the delightful converse we
          daily have with him. The more we thus enter into the presence chamber
          of God, the more we cling about him with our affections, the more
          vigorous and lively will the true notion of God grow up in us, and be
          able to prevent anything which may dishonor him and debase our souls.
          Let us therefore consider him as the only happiness; set up the true
          God in our understandings; possess our hearts with a deep sense of his
          desirable excellency above all other things. This is the main thing we
          are to do in order to our great business: all the directions in the
          world, with the neglect of this, will be insignificant ciphers. The
          neglect of this is common, and is the basis of all the mischiefs which
          happen to the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Prize and study the Scripture. We can have no delight in meditation
          on him, unless we know him; and we cannot know him but by the means of
          his own revelation; when the revelation is despised, the revealer will
          be of little esteem. Men do not throw off God from being their rule,
          till they throw off Scripture from being their guide; and God must
          needs be cast off from being an end, when the Scripture is rejected
          from being a rule. Those that do not care to know his will, that love
          to be ignorant of his nature, can never be affected to his honor. Let
          therefore the subtleties of reason veil to the doctrine of faith, and
          the humor of the will to the command of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Take heed of sensual pleasures, and be very watchful and cautious
          in the use of those comforts God allows us. Job was afraid, when his
          “sons feasted, that they should curse God in their hearts.”311 It was
          not without cause that the apostle Peter joined sobriety with
          watchfulness and prayer (1 Pet. iv. 7): “The end of all things is at
          hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.”—A moderate use of
          worldly comforts.—Prayer is the great acknowledgment of God, and too
          much sensuality is a hindrance of this, and a step to atheism.
          Belshazzar’s lifting himself up against the Lord, and not glorifying
          of God, is charged upon his sensuality (Dan. v. 23). Nothing is more
          apt to quench the notions of God, and root out the conscience of him,
          than an addictedness to sensual pleasures. Therefore take heed of that
          snare.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Take heed of sins against knowledge. The more sins against
          knowledge are committed, the more careless we are, and the more
          careless we shall be of God and his honor; we shall more fear his
          judicial power; and the more we fear that, the more we shall disaffect
          that God in whose hand vengeance is, and to whom it doth belong.
          Atheism in conversation proceeds to atheism in affection, and that
          will endeavor to sink into atheism in opinion and judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sum of the whole.—And now consider in the whole what has been
          spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man would set himself up as his own rule. He disowns the rule of
          God, is unwilling to have any acquaintance with the rule God sets him,
          negligent in using the means for the knowledge of his will, and
          endeavors to shake it off when any notices of it break in upon him;
          when he cannot expel it, he hath no pleasure in the consideration of
          it, and the heart swells against it. When the notions of the will of
          God are entertained, it is on some other consideration, or with
          wavering and unsettled affections. Many times men design to improve
          some lust by his truth. This unwillingness respects truth as it is
          most spiritual and holy; as it most relates and leads to God; as it is
          most contrary to self. He is guilty of contempt of the will of God,
          which is seen in every presumptuous breach of his law; in the natural
          aversions to the declaration of his will and mind, which way soever he
          turns; in slighting that part of his will which is most for his honor;
          in the awkwardness of the heart when it is to pay God a service. A
          constraint in the first engagement, slightness in the service, in
          regard of the matter, in regard of the frame, without a natural vigor.
          Many distractions, much weariness, in deserting the rule of God, when
          our expectations are not answered upon our service, in breaking
          promises with God. Man naturally owns any other rule rather than that
          of God’s prescribing: the rule of Satan; the will of man; in complying
          more with the dictates of men than the will of God; in observing that
          which is materially so, not because it is his will, but the
          injunctions of men; in obeying the will of man when it is contrary to
          the will of God. This man doth in order to the setting up himself.
          This is natural to man as he is corrupted. Men are dissatisfied with
          their own consciences when they contradict the desires of self. Most
          actions in the world are done, more because they are agreeable to
          self, than as they are honorable to God; as they are agreeable to
          natural and moral self, or sinful self. It is evident in neglects of
          taking God’s directions upon emergent occasions; in counting the
          actions of others to be good or bad, as they suit with, or spurn
          against our fancies and humors. Man would make himself the rule of
          God, and give laws to his Creator, in striving against his law;
          disapproving of his methods of government in the world; in impatience
          in our particular concerns; envying the gifts and prosperity of
          others; corrupt matter or ends of prayer or praise; bold
          interpretations of the judgments of God in the world; mixing rules in
          the worship of God with those which have been ordained by him; suiting
          interpretations of Scripture with our own minds and humors; falling
          off from God after some fair compliances, when his will grates upon
          us, and crosseth ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Man would be his own end. This is natural and universal. This is
          seen in frequent self‑applauses and inward overweening reflections; in
          ascribing the glory of what we do or have to ourselves; in desire of
          self‑pleasing doctrines; in being highly concerned in injuries done to
          ourselves, and little or not at all concerned for injuries done to
          God; in trusting in ourselves; in workings for carnal self against the
          light of our own consciences: this is a usurping God’s prerogative,
          vilifying God, destroying God. Man would make anything his end or
          happiness rather than God. This appears in the fewer thoughts we have
          of him than of anything else; in the greedy pursuit of the world; in
          the strong addictedness to sensual pleasures; in paying a service,
          upon any success in the world, to instruments more than to God: this
          is a debasing God in setting up a creature, but more in setting up a
          base lust; it is a denying of God. Man would make himself the end of
          all creatures. In pride; using the creatures contrary to the end God
          hath appointed: this is to dishonor God, and it is diabolical. Man
          would make himself the end of God; in loving God, because of some
          self‑pleasing benefits distributed by him; in abstinence from some
          sins, because they are against the interest of some other beloved
          corruption; in performing duties merely for a selfish interest, which
          is evident in unwieldiness in religious duties, where self is not
          concerned; in calling upon God only in a time of necessity; in begging
          his assistance to our own projects after we have by our own craft,
          laid the plot; in impatience upon a refusal of our desires; in selfish
          aims we have in our duties: this is a vilifying God, a dethroning him;
          in unworthy imaginations of God, universal in man by nature. Hence
          spring idolatry, superstition, presumption, the common disease of the
          world. This is a vilifying God; worse than idolatry, worse than
          absolute atheism. Natural desires to be distant from him; no desires
          for the remembrance of him; no desires of converse with him; no
          desires of a thorough return to him; no desire of any close imitation
