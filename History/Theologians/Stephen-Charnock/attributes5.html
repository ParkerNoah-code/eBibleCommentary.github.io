        <h2>DISCOURSE V.</h2>
        <p>ON THE ETERNITY OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Psalm xc. 2.—Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou
          hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
          everlasting, thou art God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title of this psalm is a prayer; the author, Moses. Some think not
          only this, but the ten following psalms, were composed by him. The
          title wherewith he is dignified is, “The man of God,” as also in Deut.
          xxxiii. 1. One inspired by him to be his interpreter, and deliver his
          oracles; one particularly directed by him;532 one who as a servant did
          diligently employ himself in his master’s business, and acted for the
          glory of God;533 he was the minister of the Old Testament, and the
          prophet of the New.534
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two parts of this psalm. 1. A complaint of the frailty of
          man’s life in general (v. 3‒6); and then a particular complaint of the
          condition of the church (v. 8‒10). 2. A prayer (v. 12). But before he
          speaks of the shortness of human life, he fortifies them by the
          consideration of the refuge they had, and should find in God (v. 1):
          “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling‑place in all generations.” We have
          had no settled abode in the earth, since the time of Abraham’s being
          called out from Ur of the Chaldees. We have had Canaan in a promise,
          we have it not yet in possession; we have been exposed to the
          cruelties of an oppressing enemy, and the incommodities of a desert
          wilderness; we have wanted the fruits of the earth, but not the dews
          of heaven. “Thou hast been our dwelling‑place in all generations.”
          Abraham was under thy conduct; Isaac and Jacob under thy care; their
          posterity was multiplied by thee, and that under their oppressions.
          Thou hast been our shield against dangers, our security in the times
          of trouble; when we were pursued to the Red Sea, it was not a creature
          delivered us; and when we feared the pinching of our bowels in the
          desert, it was no creature rained manna upon us. Thou hast been our
          dwelling‑place; thou hast kept open house for us, sheltered us against
          storms, and preserved us from mischief, as a house doth an inhabitant
          from wind and weather; and that not in one or two, but in all
          generations. Some think an allusion is here made to the ark, to which
          they were to have recourse in all emergencies. Our refuge and defence
          hath not been from created things; not from the ark, but from the God
          of the ark. Observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God is a perpetual refuge and security to his people. His
          providence is not confined to one generation; it is not one age only
          that tastes of his bounty and compassion. His eye never yet slept, nor
          hath he suffered the little ship of his church to be swallowed up,
          though it hath been tossed upon the waves; he hath always been a haven
          to preserve us, a house to secure us; he hath always had compassions
          to pity us, and power to protect us; he hath had a face to shine, when
          the world hath had an angry countenance to frown.535 He brought Enoch
          home by an extraordinary translation from a brutish world; and when he
          was resolved to reckon with men for their brutish lives, he lodged
          Noah, the phœnix of the world, in an ark, and kept him alive as a
          spark in the midst of many waters, whereby to rekindle a church in the
          world; in all generations he is a dwelling‑place to secure his people
          here, or entertain them above. His providence is not wearied, nor his
          care fainting; he never wanted will to relieve us, “for he hath been
          our refuge,” nor ever can want power to support us, “for he is a God
          from everlasting to everlasting.” The church never wanted a pilot to
          steer her, and a rock to shelter her, and dash in pieces the waves
          which threaten her.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How worthy is it to remember former benefits, when we come to beg
          for new. Never were the records of God’s mercies so exactly revised,
          as when his people have stood in need of new editions of his power.
          How necessary are our wants to stir us up to pay the rent of
          thankfulness in arrear! He renders himself doubly unworthy of the
          mercies he wants, that doth not gratefully acknowledge the mercies he
          hath received. God scarce promised any deliverance to the Israelites,
          and they, in their distress, scarce prayed for any deliverance; but
          that from Egypt was mentioned on both sides, by God to encourage them,
          and by them to acknowledge their confidence in him. The greater our
          dangers, the more we should call to mind God’s former kindness. We are
          not only thankfully to acknowledge the mercies bestowed upon our
          persons, or in our age, but those of former times. “Thou hast been our
          dwelling‑place in all generations.” Moses was not living in the former
          generations, yet he appropriates the former mercies to the present
          age. Mercies, as well as generations, proceed out of the loins of
          those that have gone before. All mankind are but one Adam; the whole
          church but one body. In the second verse he backs his former
          consideration. 1. By the greatness of his power in forming the world.
          2. By the boundlessness of his duration: “From everlasting to
          everlasting.” As thou hast been our dwelling‑place, and expended upon
          us the strength of thy power and riches of thy love, so we have no
          reason to doubt the continuance on thy part, if we be not wanting on
          our parts; for the vast mountains and fruitful earth are the works of
          thy hands, and there is less power requisite for our relief, than
          there was for their creation; and though so much strength hath been
          upon various occasions manifested, yet thy arm is not weakened, for
          “from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.”536 Thou hast always
          been God, and no time can be assigned as the beginning of thy
          being.537 The mountains are not of so long a standing as thyself; they
          are the effects of thy power, and therefore cannot be equal to thy
          duration; since they are the effects, they suppose the precedency of
          their cause. If we would look back, we can reach no further than the
          beginning of the creation, and account the years from the first
          foundation of the world; but after that we must lose ourselves in the
          abyss of eternity; we have no cue to guide our thoughts; we can see no
          bounds in thy eternity. But as for man, he traverseth the world a few
          days, and by thy order pronounced concerning all men, returns to the
          dust, and moulders into the grave. By mountains, some understand
          angels, as being creatures of a more elevated nature; by earth, they
          understand human nature, the earth being the habitation of men. There
          is no need to divert in this place from the letter to such a sense.
          The description seems to be poetical, and amounts to this: he neither
          began with the beginning of time, nor will expire with the end of it;
          he did not begin when he made himself known to our fathers, but his
          being did precede the creation of the world, before any created being
          was formed, and any time settled.538 “Before the mountains were
          brought forth,” or before they were begotten or born; the word being
          used in those senses in Scripture; before they stood up higher than
          the rest of the earthly mass God had created. It seems that mountains
          were not casually cast up by the force of the deluge softening the
          ground, and driving several parcels of it together, to grow up into a
          massy body, as the sea doth the sand in several places; but they were
          at first formed by God. The eternity of God is here described,
        </p>
        <p>1. In his priority: “Before the world.”</p>
        <p>
          2. In the extension of his duration: “From everlasting to everlasting
          thou art God.” He was before the world, yet he neither began nor ends;
          he is not a temporary, but an eternal God; it takes in both parts of
          eternity, what was before the creation of the world, and what is
          after; though the eternity of God be one permanent state, without
          succession, yet the spirit of God, suiting himself to the weakness of
          our conception, divides it into two parts; one past before the
          foundation of the world, another to come after the destruction of the
          world; as he did exist before all ages, and as he will exist after all
          ages. Many truths lie couched in the verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The world hath a beginning of being: it was not from eternity, it
          was once nothing; had it been of a very long duration, some records
          would have remained of some memorable actions done of a longer date
          than any extant. 2. The world owes its being to the creating power of
          God: “Thou hast formed it” out of nothing into being; Thou, that is,
          God; it could not spring into being of itself; it was nothing; it must
          have a former. 3. God was in being before the world: the cause must be
          before the effect; that word which gives being, must be before that
          which receives being. 4. This Being was from eternity: “From
          everlasting.” 5. This Being shall endure to eternity: “To
          everlasting.” 6. There is but one God, one eternal: “From everlasting
          to everlasting, thou art God.” None else but one hath the property of
          eternity; the gods of the heathen cannot lay claim to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doct. God is of an eternal duration. The eternity of God is the
          foundation of the stability of the covenant, the great comfort of a
          Christian. The design of God in Scripture is, to set forth his dealing
          with men in the way of a covenant. The priority of God before all
          things begins the Bible: “In the beginning God created” (Gen. i. 1).
          His covenant can have no foundation, but in his duration before and
          after the world:539 and Moses here mentions his eternity, not only
          with respect to the essence of God, but to his federal providence; as
          he is the dwelling‑place of his people in all generations. The
          duration of God forever is more spoken of in Scripture than his
          eternity, à parte ante, though that is the foundation of all the
          comfort we can take from his immortality: if he had a beginning, he
          might have an end, and so all our happiness, hope and being would
          expire with him; but the Scripture sometimes takes notice of his being
          without beginning, as well as without end: “Thou art from everlasting”
          (Ps. xciii. 2); “Blessed be God from everlasting to everlasting” (Ps.
          xli. 13); “I was set up from everlasting” (Prov. viii. 23): if his
          wisdom were from everlasting, himself was from everlasting: whether we
          understand it of Christ the Son of God, or of the essential wisdom of
          God, it is all one to the present purpose. The wisdom of God supposeth
          the essence of God, as habits in creatures suppose the being of some
          power or faculty as their subject. The wisdom of God supposeth mind
          and understanding, essence and substance. The notion of eternity is
          difficult; as Austin said of time,540 if no man will ask me the
          question, what time is, I know well enough what it is; but if any ask
          me what it is, I know not how to explain it; so may I say of eternity;
          it is easy in the word pronounced, but hardly understood, and more
          hardly expressed; it is better expressed by negative than positive
          words. Though we cannot comprehend eternity, yet we may comprehend
          that there is an eternity; as, though we cannot comprehend the essence
          of God what he is, yet we may comprehend that he is; we may understand
          the notion of his existence, though we cannot understand the
          infiniteness of his nature; yet we may better understand eternity than
          infiniteness; we can better conceive a time with the addition of
          numberless days and years, than imagine a Being without bounds; whence
          the apostle joins his eternity with his power; “His eternal power and
          Godhead” (Rom. i. 20); because, next to the power of God, apprehended
          in the creature, we come necessarily by reasoning, to acknowledge the
          eternity of God. He that hath an incomprehensible power must needs
          have an eternity of nature; his power is most sensible in the
          creatures to the eye of man, and his eternity easily from thence
          deducible by the reason of man. Eternity is a perpetual duration,
          which hath neither beginning nor end; time hath both. Those things we
          say are in time that have beginning, grow up by degrees, have
          succession of parts; eternity is contrary to time, and is therefore a
          permanent and immutable state; a perfect possession of life without
          any variation; it comprehends in itself all years, all ages, all
          periods of ages; it never begins; it endures after every duration of
          time, and never ceaseth; it doth as much outrun time, as it went
          before the beginning of it: time supposeth something before it; but
          there can be nothing before eternity; it were not then eternity. Time
          hath a continual succession; the former time passeth away and another
          succeeds: the last year is not this year, nor this year the next. We
          must conceive of eternity contrary to the notion of time; as the
          nature of time consists in the succession of parts, so the nature of
          eternity in an infinite immutable duration. Eternity and time differ
          as the sea and rivers; the sea never changes place, and is always one
          water; but the rivers glide along, and are swallowed up in the sea; so
          is time by eternity.541 A thing is said to be eternal, or everlasting
          rather, in Scripture,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. When it is of a long duration, though it will have an end; when it
          hath no measures of time determined to it; so circumcision is said to
          be in the flesh for an “everlasting covenant” (Gen. xvii. 13); not
          purely everlasting, but so long as that administration of the covenant
          should endure. And so when a servant would not leave his master, but
          would have his ear bored, it is said, he should be a servant “forever”
          (Deut. xv. 17); i. e. till the jubilee, which was every fiftieth year:
          so the meat‑offering they were to offer is said to be “perpetual”
          (Lev. vi. 20); Canaan is said to be given to Abraham for an
          “everlasting” possession (Gen. xvii. 8); when as the Jews are expelled
          from Canaan, which is given a prey to the barbarous nations. Indeed
          circumcision was not everlasting; yet the substance of the covenant
          whereof this was a sign, viz., that God would be the God of believers,
          endures forever; and that circumcision of the heart, which was
          signified by circumcision of the flesh, shall remain forever in the
          kingdom of glory: it was not so much the lasting of the sign, as of
          the thing signified by it, and the covenant sealed by it: the sign had
          its abolition; so that the apostle is so peremptory in it, that he
          asserts, that if any went about to establish it, he excluded himself
          from a participation of Christ (Gal. v. 2). The sacrifices were to be
          perpetual, in regard to the thing signified by them; viz., the death
          of Christ, which was to endure in the efficacy of it: and the passover
          was to be “forever” (Exod. xii. 24), in regard of the redemption
          signified by it, which was to be of everlasting remembrance. Canaan
          was to be an everlasting possession, in regard of the glory of heaven
          typified, to be forever conferred upon the spiritual seed of Abraham.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When a thing hath no end, though it hath a beginning. So angels and
          souls are everlasting; though their being shall never cease, yet there
          was a time when their being began; they were nothing before they were
          something, though they shall never be nothing again, but shall live in
          endless happiness or misery. But that properly is eternal that hath
          neither beginning nor end; and thus eternity is a property of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this doctrine I shall show, I. How God is eternal, or in what
          respects eternity is his property. II. That he is eternal, and must
          needs be so. III. That eternity is only proper to God, and not common
          to him with any creature. IV. The use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. How God is eternal, or in what respects he is so. Eternity is a
          negative attribute, and is a denying of God any measures of time, as
          immensity is a denying of him any bounds of place. As immensity is the
          diffusion of his essence, so eternity is the duration of his essence;
          and when we say God is eternal, we exclude from him all possibility of
          beginning and ending, all flux and change. As the essence of God
          cannot be bounded by any place, so it is not to be limited by any
          time: as it is his immensity to be everywhere, so it is his eternity
          to be alway. As created things are said to be somewhere in regard of
          place, and to be present, past, or future, in regard of time; so the
          Creator in regard of place is everywhere, in regard of time is
          semper.542 His duration is as endless as his essence is boundless: he
          always was and always will be, and will no more have an end than he
          had a beginning; and this is an excellency belonging to the Supreme
          Being.543 As his essence comprehends all beings, and exceeds them, and
          his immensity surmounts all places; so his eternity comprehends all
          times, all durations, and infinitely excels them.544
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God is without beginning. “In the beginning” God created the world
          (Gen. i. 1). God was then before the beginning of it; and what point
          can be set wherein God began, if he were before the beginning of
          created things? God was without beginning, though all other things had
          time and beginning from him. As unity is before all numbers, so is God
          before all his creatures. Abraham called upon the name of the
          everlasting God (Gen. xxi. 33) the eternal God.545—It is opposed to
          the heathen gods, which were but of yesterday, new coined, and so new;
          but the eternal God was before the world was made. In that sense it is
          to be understood; “The mystery which was kept secret since the world
          began, but now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the
          prophets, according to the command of the everlasting God, made known
          to all nations for the obedience of faith” (Rom. xvi. 26). The gospel
          is not preached by the command of a new and temporary god, but of that
          God that was before all ages: though the manifestation of it be in
          time, yet the purpose and resolve of it was from eternity. If there
          were decrees before the foundation of the world, there was a Decreer
          before the foundation of the world. Before the foundation of the world
          he loved Christ as a Mediator; a fore‑ordination of him was before the
          foundation of the world (John xvii. 24); a choice of men, and
          therefore a Chooser before the foundation of the world (Eph. i. 4); a
          grace given in Christ before the world began (2 Tim. i. 9), and
          therefore a Donor of that grace. From those places, saith Crellius, it
          appears that God was before the foundation of the world, but they do
          not assert an absolute eternity; but to be before all creatures is
          equivalent to his being from eternity.546 Time began with the
          foundation of the world; but God being before time, could have no
          beginning in time. Before the beginning of the creation, and the
          beginning of time, there could be nothing but eternity; nothing but
          what was uncreated, that is, nothing but what was without beginning.
          To be in time is to have a beginning; to be before all time is never
          to have a beginning, but always to be; for as between the Creator and
          creatures there is no medium, so between time and eternity there is no
          medium. It is as easily deduced that he that was before all creatures
          is eternal, as he that made all creatures is God. If he had a
          beginning, he must have it from another, or from himself; if from
          another, that from whom he received his being would be better than he,
          so more a God than he. He cannot be God that is not supreme; he cannot
          be supreme that owes his being to the power of another. He would not
          be said only to have immortality as he is (1 Tim. vi. 16), if he had
          it dependent upon another; nor could he have a beginning from himself;
          if he had given beginning to himself, then he was once nothing; there
          was a time when he was not; if he was not, how could he be the Cause
          of himself? It is impossible for any to give a beginning and being to
          itself: if it acts it must exist, and so exist before it existed. A
          thing would exist as a cause before it existed as an effect. He that
          is not, cannot be the cause that he is; if, therefore, God doth exist,
          and hath not his being from another, he must exist from eternity.
          Therefore, when we say God is of and from himself, we mean not that
          God gave being to himself; but it is negatively to be understood that
          he hath no cause of existence without himself. Whatsoever number of
          millions of millions of years we can imagine before the creation of
          the world, yet God was infinitely before those; he is therefore called
          the “Ancient of Days” (Dan. vii. 9), as being before all days and
          time, and eminently containing in himself all times and ages. Though,
          indeed, God cannot properly be called ancient, that will testify that
          he is decaying, and shortly will not be; no more than he can be called
          young, which would signify that he was not long before. All created
          things are new and fresh; but no creature can find out any beginning
          of God: it is impossible there should be any beginning of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God is without end. He always was, always is, and always will be
          what he is. He remains always the same in being; so far from any
          change, that no shadow of it can touch him (James i. 17). He will
          continue in being as long as he hath already enjoyed it; and if we
          could add never so many millions of years together, we are still as
          far from an end as from a beginning; for “the Lord shall endure
          forever” (Ps. ix. 7). As it is impossible he should not be, being from
          all eternity, so it is impossible that he should not be to all
          eternity. The Scripture is most plentiful in testimonies of this
          eternity of God, à parte post, or after the creation of the world: he
          is said to “live forever” (Rev. iv. 9, 10). The earth shall perish,
          but God shall “endure forever,” and his “years shall have no end” (Ps.
          cii. 27). Plants and animals grow up from small beginnings, arrive to
          their full growth, and decline again, and have always remarkable
          alterations in their nature; but there is no declination in God by all
          the revolutions of time. Hence some think the incorruptibility of the
          Deity was signified by the shittim, or cedar wood, whereof the ark was
          made, it being of an incorruptible nature (Exod. xxv. 10). That which
          had no beginning of duration can never have an end, or any
          interruptions in it. Since God never depended upon any, what should
          make him cease to be what eternally he hath been, or put a stop to the
          continuance of his perfections? He cannot will his own destruction;
          that is against universal nature in all things to cease from being, if
          they can preserve themselves. He cannot desert his own being, because
          he cannot but love himself as the best and chiefest good. The reason
          that anything decays is either its own native weakness, or a superior
          power of something contrary to it. There is no weakness in the nature
          of God that can introduce any corruption, because he is infinitely
          simple without any mixture; nor can he be overpowered by anything
          else; a weaker cannot hurt him, and a stronger than he there cannot
          be; nor can he be outwitted or circumvented, because of his infinite
          wisdom.547 As he received his being from none, so he cannot be
          deprived of it by any: as he doth necessarily exist, so he doth
          necessarily always exist. This, indeed, is the property of God;
          nothing so proper to him as always to be. Whatsoever perfections any
          being hath, if it be not eternal, it is not divine. God only is
          immortal;548 he only is so by a necessity of nature. Angels, souls,
          and bodies too, after the resurrection, shall be immortal, not by
          nature, but grant; they are subject to return to nothing, if that word
          that raised them from nothing should speak them into nothing again. It
          is as easy with God to strip them of it, as to invest them with it;
          nay, it is impossible but that they should perish, if God should
          withdraw his power from preserving them, which he exerted in creating
          them; but God is immovably fixed in his own being; that as none gave
          him his life, so none can deprive him of his life, or the least
          particle of it. Not a jot of the happiness and life which God
          infinitely possesses can be lost; it will be as durable to
          everlasting, as it hath been possessed from everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is no succession in God. God is without succession or change.
          It is a part of eternity; “from everlasting to everlasting he is God,”
          i. e. the same. God doth not only always remain in being, but he
          always remains the same in that being: “thou art the same” (Ps. cii.
          27). The being of creatures is successive; the being of God is
          permanent, and remains entire with all its perfections unchanged in an
          infinite duration. Indeed, the first notion of eternity is to be
          without beginning and end, which notes to us the duration of a being
          in regard of its existence; but to have no succession, nothing first
          or last, notes rather the perfection of a being in regard of its
          essence. The creatures are in a perpetual flux; something is acquired
          or something lost every day. A man is the same in regard of existence
          when he is a man, as he was when he was a child; but there is a new
          succession of quantities and qualities in him. Every day he acquires
          something till he comes to his maturity; every day he loseth something
          till he comes to his period. A man is not the same at night that he
          was in the morning; something is expired, and something is added;
          every day there is a change in his age, a change in his substance, a
          change in his accidents. But God hath his whole being in one and the
          same point, or moment of eternity. He receives nothing as an addition
          to what he was before; he loseth nothing of what he was before; he is
          always the same excellency and perfection in the same infiniteness as
          ever. His years do not fail (Heb. i. 12), his years do not come and go
          as others do; there is not this day, to‑morrow, or yesterday, with
          him. As nothing is past or future with him in regard of knowledge, but
          all things are present, so nothing is past or future in regard of his
          essence. He is not in his essence this day what he was not before, or
          will be the next day and year what he is not now. All his perfections
          are most perfect in him every moment; before all ages, after all
          ages.549 As he hath his whole essence undivided in every place, as
          well as in an immense space, so he hath all his being in one moment of
          time, as well as in infinite intervals of time. Some illustrate the
          difference between eternity and time by the similitude of a tree, or a
          rock standing upon the side of a river, or shore of the sea; the tree
          stands always the same and unmoved, while the waters of the river
          glide along at the foot. The flux is in the river, but the tree
          acquires nothing but a diverse respect and relation of presence to the
          various parts of the river as they flow. The waters of the river press
          on, and push forward one another, and what the river had this minute,
          it hath not the same the next.550 So are all sublunary things in a
          continual flux. And though the angels have no substantial change, yet
          they have an accidental; for the actions of the angels this day are
          not the same individual actions which they performed yesterday: but in
          God there is no change; he always remains the same. Of a creature, it
          may be said he was, or he is, or he shall be; of God it cannot be said
          but only he is.551 He is what he always was, and he is what he always
          will be; whereas a creature is what he was not, and will be what he is
          not now. As it may be said of the flame of a candle, it is a flame;
          but it is not the same individual flame as was before, nor is it the
          same that will be presently after; there is a continual dissolution of
          it into air, and a continual supply for the generation of more. While
          it continues it may be said there is a flame; yet not entirely one,
          but in a succession of parts. So of a man it may be said, he is in a
          succession of parts; but he is not the same that he was, and will not
          be the same that he is. But God is the same, without any succession of
          parts and of time; of him it may be said, “He is.” He is no more now
          than he was, and he shall be no more hereafter than he is. God
          possesses a firm and absolute being, always constant to himself.552 He
          sees all things sliding under him in a continual variation; he beholds
          the revolutions in the world without any change of his most glorious
          and immovable nature. All other things pass from one state to another;
          from their original, to their eclipse and destruction; but God
          possesses his being in one indivisible point, having neither
          beginning, end, nor middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) There is no succession in the knowledge of God. The variety of
          successions and changes in the world make not succession, or new
          objects in the Divine mind; for all things are present to him from
          eternity in regard of his knowledge, though they are not actually
          present in the world, in regard of their existence. He doth not know
          one thing now, and another anon; he sees all things at once; “Known
          unto God are all things from the beginning of the world” (Acts xv.
          18); but in their true order of succession, as they lie in the eternal
          council of God, to be brought forth in time. Though there be a
          succession and order of things as they are wrought, there is yet no
          succession in God in regard of his knowledge of them. God knows the
          things that shall be wrought, and the order of them in their being
          brought upon the stage of the world; yet both the things and the order
          he knows by one act. Though all things be present with God, yet they
          are present to him in the order of their appearance in the world, and
          not so present with him as if they should be wrought at once. The
          death of Christ was to precede his resurrection in order of time;
          there is a succession in this; both at once are known by God; yet the
          act of his knowledge is not exercised about Christ as dying and rising
          at the same time; so that there is succession in things when there is
          no succession in God’s knowledge of them. Since God knows time, he
          knows all things as they are in time; he doth not know all things to
          be at once, though he knows at once what is, has been, and will be.
          All things are past, present, and to come, in regard of their
          existence; but there is not past, present, and to come, in regard of
          God’s knowledge of them,553 because he sees and knows not by any
          other, but by himself; he is his own light by which he sees, his own
          glass wherein he sees; beholding himself, he beholds all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) There is no succession in the decrees of God. He doth not decree
          this now, which he decreed not before; for as his works were known
          from the beginning of the world, so his works were decreed from the
          beginning of the world; as they are known at once, so they are decreed
          at once; there is a succession in the execution of them; first grace,
          then glory; but the purpose of God for the bestowing of both, was in
          one and the same moment of eternity. “He chose us in him before the
          foundation of the world, that we should be holy” (Eph. i. 4): The
          choice of Christ, and the choice of some in him to be holy and to be
          happy, were before the foundation of the world. It is by the eternal
          counsel of God all things appear in time; they appear in their order
          according to the counsel and will of God from eternity. The redemption
          of the world is after the creation of the world; but the decree
          whereby the world was created, and whereby it was redeemed, was from
          eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God is his own eternity. He is not eternal by grant, and the
          disposal of any other, but by nature and essence.554 The eternity of
          God is nothing else but the duration of God; and the duration of God
          is nothing else but his existence enduring.555 If eternity were
          anything distinct from God, and not of the essence of God, then there
          would be something which was not God, necessary to perfect God. As
          immortality is the great perfection of a rational creature, so
          eternity is the choice perfection of God, yea, the gloss and lustre of
          all others. Every perfection would be imperfect, if it were not always
          a perfection. God is essentially whatsoever he is, and there is
          nothing in God but his essence. Duration or continuance in being in
          creatures, differs from their being; for they might exist but for one
          instant, in which case they may be said to have being, but not
          duration, because all duration includes prius et posterius. All
          creatures may cease from being if it be the pleasure of God; they are
          not, therefore, durable by their essence, and therefore are not their
          own duration, no more than they are their own existence. And though
          some creatures, as angels, and souls, may be called everlasting, as a
          perpetual life is communicated to them by God; yet they can never be
          called their own eternity, because such a duration is not simply
          necessary, nor essential to them, but accidental, depending upon the
          pleasure of another; there is nothing in their nature that can hinder
          them from losing it, if God, from whom they received it, should design
          to take it away; but as God is his own necessity of existing, so he is
          his own duration in existing; as he doth necessarily exist by himself,
          so he will always necessarily exist by himself.556
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Hence all the perfections of God are eternal. In regard of the
          Divine eternity, all things in God are eternal; his power, mercy,
          wisdom, justice, knowledge. God himself were not eternal if any of his
          perfections, which are essential to him, were not eternal also; he had
          not else been a perfect God from all eternity, and so his whole self
          had not been eternal. If anything belonging to the nature of a thing
          be wanting, it cannot be said to be that thing which it ought to be.
          If anything requisite to the nature of God had been wanting one
          moment, he could not have been said to be an eternal God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. God is eternal. The Spirit of God in Scripture condescends to our
          capacities in signifying the eternity of God by days and years, which
          are terms belonging to time, whereby we measure it (Ps. cii. 27). But
          we must no more conceive that God is bounded or measured by time, and
          hath succession of days, because of those expressions, than we can
          conclude him to have a body, because members are ascribed to him in
          Scripture, to help our conceptions of his glorious nature and
          operations. Though years are ascribed to him, yet they are such as
          cannot be numbered, cannot be finished, since there is no proportion
          between the duration of God, and the years of men. “The number of his
          years cannot be searched out, for he makes small the drops of water;
          they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof” (Job xxxvi. 26,
          27). The numbers of the drops of rain which have fallen in all parts
          of the earth since the creation of the world, if subtracted from the
          number of the years of God, would be found a small quantity, a mere
          nothing, to the years of God. As all the nations in the world compared
          with God, are but as the “drop of a bucket, worse than nothing, than
          vanity” (Isa. xl. 15); so all the ages of the world, if compared with
          God, amount not to so much as the one hundred thousandth part of a
          minute; the minutes from the creation may be numbered, but the years
          of the duration of God being infinite, are without measure. As one day
          is to the life of man, so are a thousand years to the life of God. The
          Holy Ghost expresseth himself to the capacity of man, to give us some
          notion of an infinite duration, by a resemblance suited to the
          capacity of man.557 If a thousand years be but as a day to the life of
          God, then as a year is to the life of man, so are three hundred and
          sixty‑five thousand years to the life of God; and as seventy years are
          to the life of man, so are twenty‑five millions four hundred and fifty
          thousand years to the life of God. Yet still, since there is no
          proportion between time and eternity, we must dart our thoughts beyond
          all those; for years and days measure only the duration of created
          things, and of those only that are material and corporeal, subject to
          the motion of the heavens, which makes days and years.558 Sometimes
          this eternity is expressed by parts, as looking backward and forward;
          by the differences of time, “past, present, and to come” (Rev. i. 8),
          “which was, and is, and is to come” (Rev. iv. 8).559 Though this might
          be spoken of anything in being, though but for an hour, it was the
          last minute, it is now, and it will be the next minute; yet the Holy
          Ghost would declare something proper to God, as including all parts of
          time; he always was, is now, and always shall be. It might always be
          said of him, he was, and it may always be said of him, he will be;
          there is no time when he began, no time when he shall cease. It cannot
          be said of a creature he always was, he always is what he was, and he
          always will be what he is; but God always is what he was, and always
          will be what he is; so that it is a very significant expression of the
          eternity of God, as can be suited to our capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. His eternity is evident, by the name God gives himself (Exod. iii.
          14): “And God said unto Moses, I am that I am; thus shalt thou say to
          the children of Israel, ‘I Am hath sent me unto you.’” This is the
          name whereby he is distinguished from all creatures; I Am, is his
          proper name. This description being in the present tense, shows that
          his essence knows no past, nor future; if it were he was, it would
          intimate he were not now what he once was; if it were he will be, it
          would intimate he were not yet what he will be; but I Am; I am the
          only being, the root of all beings; he is therefore, at the greatest
          distance from not being, and that is eternal. So that is signifies his
          eternity, as well as his perfection and immutability. As I Am speaks
          the want of no blessedness, so it speaks the want of no duration; and
          therefore the French, wherever they find this word Jehovah, in the
          Scripture, which we translate Lord, and Lord eternal, render it the
          Eternal,—I am always and immutably the same. The eternity of God is
          opposed to the volubility of time, which is extended into past,
          present and to come. Our time is but a small drop, as a sand to all
          the atoms and small particles of which the world is made; but God is
          an unbounded sea of being. “I Am that I Am;” i. e. an infinite life; I
          have not that now, which I had not formerly; I shall not afterwards
          have that which I have not now; I am that in every moment which I was,
          and will be in all moments of time; nothing can be added to me,
          nothing can be detracted from me; there is nothing superior to him,
          which can detract from him; nothing desirable that can be added to
          him. Now if there were any beginning and end of God, any succession in
          him, he could not be “I Am;”560 for in regard of what was past, he
          would not be; in regard of what was to come, he is not yet; and upon
          this account a heathen argues well;561 of all creatures it may be said
          they were, or they will be; but of God it cannot be said anything else
          but est, God is, because he fills an eternal duration. A creature
          cannot be said to be, if it be not yet, nor if it be not now, but hath
          been.562 God only can be called “I Am;” all creatures have more of not
          being, than being; for every creature was nothing from eternity,
          before it was made something in time; and if it be incorruptible in
          its whole nature, it will be nothing to eternity after it hath been
          something in time; and if it be not corruptible in its nature, as the
          angels, or in every part of its nature, as man in regard of his soul;
          yet it hath not properly a being, because it is dependent upon the
          pleasure of God to continue it, or deprive it of it; and while it is,
          it is mutable, and all mutability is a mixture of not being. If God
          therefore be properly “I Am,” i. e. being, it follows that he always
          was; for if he were not always, he must, as was argued before, be
          produced by some other, or by himself; by another he could not; then
          he had not been God, but a creature; nor by himself, for then as
          producing, he must be before himself, as produced; he had been before
          he was. And he always will be; for being “I Am,” having all being in
          himself, and the fountain of all being to everything else, how can he
          ever have his name changed to I am not.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God hath life in himself (John v. 26): “The Father hath life in
          himself;” he is the “living God;” therefore “steadfast forever” (Dan.
          vi. 26). He hath life by his essence, not by participation. He is a
          sun to give light and life to all creatures, but receives not light or
          life from anything; and therefore he hath an unlimited life, not a
          drop of life, but a fountain; not a spark of a limited life, but a
          life transcending all bounds. He hath life in himself; all creatures
          have their life in him and from him. He that hath life in himself doth
          necessarily exist, and could never be made to exist; for then he had
          not life in himself, but in that which made him to exist, and gave him
          life. What doth necessarily exist therefore, exists from eternity;
          what hath being of itself could never be produced in time, could not
          want being one moment, because it hath being from its essence, without
          influence of any efficient cause. When God pronounced his name, “I Am
          that I Am,” angels and men were in being; the world had been created
          above two thousand four hundred years; Moses, to whom he then speaks,
          was in being; yet God only is, because he only hath the fountain of
          being in himself; but all that they were was a rivulet from him. He
          hath from nothing else, that he doth subsist; everything else hath its
          subsistence from him as their root, as the beam from the sun, as the
          rivers and fountains from the sea.563 All life is seated in God, as in
          its proper throne, in its most perfect purity. God is life; it is in
          him originally, radically, therefore eternally. He is a pure act,
          nothing but vigor and act; he hath by his nature that life which
          others have by his grant; whence the Apostle saith (1 Tim. vi. 16) not
          only that he is immortal, but he hath immortality in a full
          possession; fee simple, not depending upon the will of another, but
          containing all things within himself. He that hath life in himself,
          and is from himself, cannot but be. He always was, because he received
          his being from no other, and none can take away that being which was
          not given by another. If there were any space before he did exist,
          then there was something which made him to exist; life would not then
          be in him, but in that which produced him into being; he could not
          then be God, but that other which gave him being would be God.564 And
          to say God sprung into being by chance, when we see nothing in the
          world that is brought forth by chance, but hath some cause of its
          existence, would be vain; for since God is a being, chance, which is
          nothing, could not bring forth something; and by the same reason, that
          he sprung up by chance, he might totally vanish by chance. What a
          strange notion of a God would this be! such a God that had no life in
          himself but from chance! Since he hath life in himself, and that there
          was no cause of his existence, he can have no cause of his limitation,
          and can no more be determined to a time, than he can to a place. What
          hath life in itself, hath life without bounds, and can never desert
          it, nor be deprived of it; so that he lives necessarily, and it is
          absolutely impossible that he should not live; whereas all other
          things “live, and move, and have their being in him” (Acts xvii. 28);
          and as they live by his will, so they can return to nothing at his
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If God were not eternal, he were not immutable in his nature. It is
          contrary to the nature of immutability to be without eternity; for
          whatsoever begins, is changed in its passing from not being to being.
          It began to be what it was not; and if it ends, it ceaseth to be what
          it was; it cannot therefore be said to be God, if there were neither
          beginning or ending, or succession in it (Mal. iii. 6): “I am the
          Lord, I change not;” (Job xxxvii. 23): “Touching the Almighty, we
          cannot find him out.” God argues here, saith Calvin, from his
          unchangeable nature as Jehovah, to his immutability in his purpose.
          Had he not been eternal, there had been the greatest change from
          nothing to something. A change of essence is greater than a change of
          purpose. God is a sun glittering always in the same glory; no growing
          up in youth; no passing on to age. If he were not without succession,
          standing in one point of eternity, there would be a change from past
          to present, from present to future. The eternity of God is a shield
          against all kind of mutability. If anything sprang up in the essence
          of God that was not there before, he could not be said to be either an
          eternal, or an unchanged substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God could not be an infinitely perfect Being, if he were not
          eternal. A finite duration is inconsistent with infinite perfection.
          Whatsoever is contracted within the limits of time, cannot swallow up
          all perfections in itself. God hath an unsearchable perfection. “Canst
          thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto
          perfection?” (Job xi. 7.) He cannot be found out: he is infinite,
          because he is incomprehensible. Incomprehensibility ariseth from an
          infinite perfection, which cannot be fathomed by the short line of
          man’s understanding. His essence in regard of its diffusion, and in
          regard of its duration, is incomprehensible, as well as his action: if
          God, therefore, had beginning, he could not be infinite; if not
          infinite, he did not possess the highest perfection; because a
          perfection might be conceived beyond it. If his being could fail, he
          were not perfect; can that deserve the name of the highest perfection,
          which is capable of corruption and dissolution? To be finite and
          limited, is the greatest imperfection, for it consists in a denial of
          being. He could not be the most blessed Being if he were not always
          so, and should not forever remain so; and whatsoever perfections he
          had, would be soured by the thoughts, that in time they would cease,
          and so could not be pure affections, because not permanent; but “He is
          blessed from everlasting to everlasting” (Ps. xli. 13). Had he a
          beginning, he could not have all perfection without limitation; he
          would have been limited by that which gave him beginning; that which
          gave him being would be God, and not himself, and so more perfect than
          he: but since God is the most sovereign perfection, than which nothing
          can be imagined perfecter by the most capacious understanding, He is
          certainly “eternal;” being infinite, nothing can be added to him,
          nothing detracted from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. God could not be omnipotent, almighty, if he were not eternal. The
          title of almighty agrees not with a nature that had a beginning;
          whatsoever hath a beginning was once nothing; and when it was nothing,
          could act nothing: where there is no being there is no power. Neither
          doth the title of almighty agree with a perishing nature: he can do
          nothing to purpose, that cannot preserve himself against the outward
          force and violence of enemies, or against the inward causes of
          corruption and dissolution. No account is to be made of man, because
          “his breath is in his nostrils” (Isa. ii. 22); could a better account
          be made of God, if he were of the like condition? He could not
          properly be almighty, that were not always mighty; if he be
          omnipotent, nothing can impair him; he that hath all power, can have
          no hurt. If he doth whatsoever he pleaseth, nothing can make him
          miserable, since misery consists in those things which happen against
          our will.565 The almightiness and eternity of God are linked together:
          “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and ending, saith the Lord, which
          was, and which is, and which is to come, the Almighty” (Rev. i. 8):
          almighty because eternal, and eternal because almighty.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. God would not be the first cause of all if he were not eternal; but
          he is the first and the last; the first cause of all things, the last
          end of all things:566 that which is the first cannot begin to be; it
          were not then the first; it cannot cease to be: whatsoever is
          dissolved, is dissolved into that whereof it doth consist, which was
          before it, and then it was not the first. The world might not have
          been; it was once nothing; it must have some cause to call it out of
          nothing: nothing hath no power to make itself something; there is a
          superior cause, by whose will and power it comes into being, and so
          gives all the creatures their distinct forms.567 This power cannot but
          be eternal; it must be before the world; the founder must be before
          the foundation; and his existence must be from eternity; or we must
          say nothing did exist from eternity:568 and if there were no being
          from eternity, there could not now be any being in time. What we see,
          and what we are, must arise from itself or some other; it cannot from
          itself: if anything made itself, it had a power to make itself; it
          then had an active power before it had a being; it was something in
          regard of power, and was nothing in regard of existence at the same
          time. Suppose it had a power to produce itself, this power must be
          conferred upon it by another; and so the power of producing itself,
          was not from itself, but from another; but if the power of being was
          from itself, why did it not produce itself before? why was it one
          moment out of being?569 If there be any existence of things, it is
          necessary that that which was the “first cause,” should “exist from
          eternity.” Whatsoever was the immediate cause of the world, yet the
          first and chief cause wherein we must rest, must have nothing before
          it; if it had anything before it, it were not the first; he therefore
          that is the first cause, must be without beginning; nothing must be
          before him; if he had a beginning from some other, he could not be the
          first principle and author of all things; if he be the first cause of
          all things, he must give himself a beginning, or be from eternity: he
          could not give himself a beginning; whatsoever begins in time was
          nothing before, and when it was nothing, it could do nothing; it could
          not give itself anything, for then it gave what it had not, and did
          what it could not. If he made himself in time, why did he not make
          himself before? what hindered him? It was either because he could not,
          or because he would not; if he could not, he always wanted power, and
          always would, unless it were bestowed upon him, and then he could not
          be said to be from himself. If he would not make himself before, then
          he might have made himself when he would: how had he the power of
          willing and nilling without a being? Nothing cannot will or nill;
          nothing hath no faculties; so that it is necessary to grant some
          eternal being, or run into inextricable labyrinths and mazes. If we
          deny some eternal being, we must deny all being; our own being, the
          being of everything about us; unconceivable absurdities will arise.
          So, then, if God were the cause of all things, he did exist before all
          things, and that from eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Eternity is only proper to God, and not communicable. It is as
          great a madness to ascribe eternity to the creature, as to deprive the
          Lord of the creature of eternity.570 It is so proper to God, that when
          the apostle would prove the deity of Christ, he proves it by his
          immutability and eternity, as well as his creating power: “Thou art
          the same, and thy years shall not fail” (Heb. i. 10‒12). The argument
          had not strength, if eternity belonged essentially to any but God; and
          therefore he is said only to have “immortality” (1 Tim. vi. 16): all
          other things receive their being from him, and can be deprived of
          their being by him: all things depend on him; he of none: all other
          things are like clothes, which would consume if God preserved them
          not. Immortality is appropriated to God, i. e. an independent
          immortality. Angels and souls have an immortality, but by donation
          from God, not by their own essence; dependent upon their Creator, not
          necessary in their own nature: God might have annihilated them after
          he had created them; so that their duration cannot properly be called
          an eternity, it being extrinsical to them, and dependent upon the will
          of their Creator, by whom they may be extinguished; it is not an
          absolute and necessary, but a precarious immortality. Whatsoever is
          not God, is temporary; whatsoever is eternal, is God. It is a
          contradiction to say a creature can be eternal; as nothing eternal is
          created, so nothing created is eternal. What is distinct from the
          nature of God cannot be eternal, eternity being the essence of God.
          Every creature, in the notion of a creature, speaks a dependence on
          some cause, and therefore cannot be eternal. As it is repugnant to the
          nature of God not to be eternal, so it is repugnant to the nature of a
          creature to be eternal; for then a creature would be equal to the
          Creator, and the Creator, or the Cause, would not be before the
          creature, or effect.571 It would be all one to admit many gods, as
          many eternals; and all one to say, God can be created, as to say a
          creature can be uncreated, which is to be eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Creation is a producing something from nothing. What was once
          nothing, cannot therefore be eternal; not being was eternal; therefore
          its being could not be eternal, for it should be then before it was,
          and would be something when it was nothing. It is the nature of a
          creature to be nothing before it was created; what was nothing before
          it was, cannot be equal with God in an eternity of duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is no creature but is mutable, therefore not eternal. As it
          had a change from nothing to something, so it may be changed from
          being to not being. If the creature were not mutable, it would be most
          perfect, and so would not be a creature, but God; for God only is most
          perfect. It is as much the essence of a creature to be mutable, as it
          is the essence of God to be immutable. Mutability and eternity are
          utterly inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. No creature is infinite, therefore not eternal: to be infinite in
          duration is all one as to be infinite in essence. It is as reasonable
          to conceive a creature immense, filling all places at once, as
          eternal, extended to all ages; because neither can be without
          infiniteness, which is the property of the Deity.572 A creature may as
          well be without bounds of place, as limitations of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. No effect of an intellectual free agent can be equal in duration to
          its cause. The productions of natural agents are as ancient often as
          themselves; the sun produceth a beam as old in time as itself; but who
          ever heard of a piece of wise workmanship as old as the wise
          artificer? God produced a creature, not necessarily and naturally, as
          the sun doth a beam, but freely, as an intelligent agent. The sun was
          not necessary; it might be or not be, according to the pleasure of
          God. A free act of the will is necessary to precede in order of time,
          as the cause of such effects as are purely voluntary.573 Those causes
          that act as soon as they exist act naturally, necessarily, not freely,
          and cannot cease from acting. But suppose a creature might have
          existed by the will of God from eternity; yet, as some think, it could
          not be said absolutely, and in its own nature to be eternal, because
          eternity was not of the essence of it. The creature could not be its
          own duration; for though it were from eternity, it might not have been
          from eternity, because its existence depended upon the free will of
          God, who might have chose whether he would have created it or no. God
          only is eternal; “the first and the last, the beginning and the end;”
          who, as he subsisted before any creature had a being, so he will
          eternally subsist if all creatures were reduced to nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Use 1. Information. If God be of an eternal duration, then “Christ
          is God.” Eternity is the property of God, but it is ascribed to
          Christ: “He is before all things” (Col. i. 17), i. e. all created
          things; he is therefore no creature, and if no creature, eternal. “All
          things were created by him,” both in heaven and in earth, angels, as
          well as men, whether they be thrones or dominions (ver. 16). If all
          things were his creatures, then he is no creature; if he were, all
          things were not created by him, or he must create himself. He hath no
          difference of time; for he is “the same yesterday, to‑day, and
          forever:”574 the same, with the name of God, “I Am,” which signifies
          his eternity. He is no more to‑day than he was yesterday, nor will be
          any other to‑morrow than he is to‑day; and therefore Melchizedec,
          whose descent, birth, and death, father and mother, beginning and end
          of days, are not upon record, was a type of the existence of Christ
          without difference of time; “Having neither beginning of days nor end
          of life, but made like the Son of God” (Heb. vii. 3). The suppression
          of his birth and death was intended by the Holy Ghost as a type of the
          excellency of Christ’s person in regard of his eternity, and the
          duration of his charge in regard of his priesthood. As there was an
          appearance of an eternity in the suppression of the race of
          Melchisedec, so there is a true eternity in the Son of God. How could
          the eternity of the Son of God be expressed by any resemblance so
          well, as by such a suppression of the beginning and end of this great
          person, different from the custom of the Spirit of God in the Old
          Testament, who often records the generations and ends of holy men; and
          why might not this, which was a kind of a shadow of eternity, be a
          representation of the true eternity of Christ, as well as the
          restoration of Isaac to his father without death, is said to be a
          figure of the resurrection of Christ after a real death?575
          Melchisedec is only mentioned once (without any record of his
          extraction) in his appearance to Abraham after his victory, as if he
          came from heaven only for that action, and instantly disappeared
          again, as if he had been an eternal person. And Christ himself hints
          his own eternity: “I came forth from the Father, and am come into the
          world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father” (John xvi. 28).
          He goes to the Father as he came from the Father; he goes to the
          Father “for everlasting,” so he came from the Father “from
          everlasting;” there is the same duration in coming forth from the
          Father, as in returning to the Father. But more plainly: he speaks of
          a glory that he “had with the Father before the world was” (John xvii.
          5), when there was no creature in being. This is an actual glory, and
          not only in decree; for a decreed glory believers had, and why may not
          every one of them say the same words, “Father, glorify me with that
          glory which I had with thee before the world was,” if it were only a
          glory in decree? Nay, it may be said of every man, he was before the
          world was, because he was so in decree. Christ speaks of something
          peculiar to him, a glory in actual possession before the world was:
          “Glorify me, embrace, honor me as thy Son, whereas I have now been, in
          the eyes of the world, handled disgracefully as a servant.” If it were
          only in decree, why is not the like expression used of others in
          Scripture as well as of Christ? Why did he not use the same words for
          his disciples that were then with him, who had a glory in decree? His
          eternity is also mentioned in the Old Testament: “The Lord possessed
          me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old” (Prov. viii.
          22). If he were the work of God, he existed before himself, if he
          existed before all the works of God. It is so not properly meant of
          the essential wisdom of God, since the discourse runs in the name of a
          person; and several passages there are which belong not so much to the
          essential wisdom of God, as ver. 13: “The evil way and the froward
          mouth do I hate,” which belongs rather to the holiness of God, than to
          the essential wisdom of God; besides, it is distinguished from
          Jehovah, as possessed by him, “and rejoicing before him.” Yet plainer:
          “Out of thee,” i. e. Bethlehem, “shall he come forth to be Ruler in
          Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting,”
          מימי עולם “from the ways of eternity” (Mic. v. 2). There are two
          goings forth of Christ described, one from Bethlehem, in the days of
          his incarnation, and another from eternity. The Holy Ghost adds, after
          his prediction of his incarnation, his going out from everlasting,
          that none should doubt of his deity. If this going out from
          everlasting were only in the purpose of God, it might be said of
          David, and of every creature; and in Isa. ix. 6 he is particularly
          called the “everlasting,” or “eternal Father;” not the Father in the
          Trinity, but a Father to us; yet “eternal,” the “Father of eternity.”
          As he is the “mighty God,” so he is “the everlasting Father.” Can such
          a title be ascribed to any whose being depends upon the will of
          another, and may be dashed out at the pleasure of a superior? As the
          eternity of God is the ground of all religion, so the eternity of
          Christ is the ground of the Christian religion. Could our sins be
          perfectly expiated had he not an eternal divinity to answer for the
          offences committed against an eternal God? Temporary sufferings had
          been of little validity, without an infiniteness and eternity in his
          person to add weight to his passion.

          2. If God be eternal, he knows all things as present. All things are
          present to him in his eternity; for this is the notion of eternity, to
          be without succession.576 If eternity be one indivisible point, and is
          not diffused into preceding and succeeding parts, then that which is
          known in it or by it is perceived without any succession, for
          knowledge is as the substance of the person knowing; if that hath
          various actions and distinct from itself, then it understands things
          in differences of time as time presents them to view. But, since God’s
          being depends not upon the revolutions of time, so neither does his
          knowledge; it exceeds all motions of years and days, comprehends
          infinite spaces of past and future. God considers all things in his
          eternity in one simple knowledge, as if they were now acted before
          him: “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
          world;” ἀπ᾽ αἰῶνος, à seculo, “from eternity” (Acts xv. 18). God’s
          knowledge is co‑eternal with him; if he knows that in time which he
          did not not know from eternity, he would not be eternally perfect,
          since knowledge is the perfection of an intelligent nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How bold and foolish is it for a mortal creature to censure the
          counsels and actions of an eternal God, or be too curious in his
          inquisitions! It is by the consideration of the unsearchable number of
          the years of God that Elihu checks too bold inquiries: “who hath
          enjoined him his way, or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
          Behold, God is great, and we know him not; neither can the number of
          his years be searched out.”577 Eternity sets God above our inquiries
          and censures. Infants of a day old are not able to understand the acts
          of wise and gray heads: shall we, that are of so short a being and
          understanding as yesterday, presume to measure the motions of eternity
          by our scanty intellects? We that cannot foresee an unexpected
          accident which falls in to blast a well‑laid design, and run a ship
          many leagues back from the intended harbor; we cannot understand the
          reason of things we see done in time, the motions of the sea, the
          generation of rain, the nature of light, the sympathies and
          antipathies of the creatures; and shall we dare to censure the actions
          of an eternal God, so infinitely beyond our reach? The counsels of a
          boundless being are not to be scanned by the brain of a silly worm,
          that hath breathed but a few minutes in the world. Since eternity
          cannot be comprehended in time, it is not to be judged by a creature
          of time: “Let us remember to magnify his works which we behold,”
          because he is eternal, which is the exhortation of Elihu, backed by
          this doctrine of God’s eternity (Job xxxvi. 24), and not accuse any
          work of him who is the “Ancient of Days,” or presume to direct him of
          whose eternity we come infinitely short. Whenever, therefore, any
          unworthy notion of the counsels and works of God is suggested to us by
          Satan, or our own corrupt hearts, let us look backward to God’s
          eternal and our own short duration, and silence ourselves with the
          same question wherewith God put a stop to the reasoning of Job—“Where
          wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?” (Job xxxviii. 4),
          and reprove ourselves for our curiosity, since we are of so short a
          standing, and were nothing when the eternal God laid the first stone
          of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. What a folly and boldness is there in sin, since an eternal God is
          offended thereby! All sin is aggravated by God’s eternity. The
          blackness of the heathen idolatry was in changing the glory of the
          incorruptible God (Rom. i. 23); erecting resemblances of him contrary
          to his immortal nature; as if the eternal God, whose life is as
          unlimited as eternity, were like those creatures whose beings are
          measured by the short ell of time, which are of a corruptible nature,
          and daily passing on to corruption; they could not really deprive God
          of his glory and immortality, but they did in estimation. There is in
          the nature of every sin a tendency to reduce God to a not being. He
          that thinks unworthily of God, or acts unworthily towards him, doth
          (as much as in him lies) sully and destroy these two perfections of
          his, immutability and eternity. It is a carriage, as if he were as
          contemptible as a creature that were but of yesterday, and shall not
          remain in being to‑morrow. He that would put an end to God’s glory by
          darkening it, would put an end to God’s life by destroying it. He that
          should love a beast with as great an affection as he loves a man,
          contemns a rational nature; and he that loves a perishing thing with
          the same affection he should love an everlasting God, contemns his
          eternity; he debaseth the duration of God below that of the world. The
          low valuation of God speaks him in his esteem no better than withering
          grass, or a gourd, which lasts for a night; and the creature which
          possesses his affection, to be a good that lasts forever. How foolish,
          then, is every sin that tends to destroy a being that cannot destroy
          or desert himself; a Being, without whose eternity the sinner himself
          could not have had the capacity of a being to affront him! How base is
          that which would not let the works of God remain in their established
          posture! How much more base is not enduring the fountain and glory of
          all beings, that would not only put an end to the beauty of the world,
          but the eternity of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          5. How dreadful is it to lie under the stroke of an eternal God! His
          eternity is as great a terror to him that hates him, as it is a
          comfort to him that loves him; because he is the “living God, an
          everlasting king, the nations shall not be able to abide his
          indignation” (Jer. x. 10). Though God be least in their thoughts, and
          is made light of in the world, yet the thoughts of God’s eternity,
          when he comes to judge the world, shall make the slighters of him
          tremble. That the Judge and punisher lives forever, is the greatest
          grievance to a soul in misery, and adds an inconceivable weight to it,
          above what the infiniteness of God’s executive power could do without
          that duration. His eternity makes the punishment more dreadful than
          his power; his power makes it sharp, but his eternity renders it
          perpetual; ever to endure, is the sting at the end of every lash. And
          how sad is it to think that God lays his eternity to pawn for the
          punishment of obstinate sinners, and engageth it by an oath, that he
          will “whet his glittering sword,” that his “hand shall take hold of
          judgment,” that he will “render vengeance to his enemies, and a reward
          to them that hate him;” a reward proportioned to the greatness of
          their offences, and the glory of an eternal God! “I lift up my hand to
          heaven, and say, I live forever;” (Deut. xxxii. 40, 41): i. e., as
          surely as I live forever, I will whet my glittering sword. As none can
          convey good with a perpetuity, so none can convey evil with such a
          lastingness as God. It is a great loss to lose a ship richly fraught
          in the bottom of the sea, never to be cast upon the shore; but how
          much greater is it to lose eternally a sovereign God, which we were
          capable of eternally enjoying, and undergo an evil as durable as that
          God we slighted, and were in a possibility of avoiding! The miseries
          of men after this life are not eased, but sharpened, by the life and
          eternity of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 2. Of comfort. What foundation of comfort can we have in any of
          God’s attributes, were it not for his infiniteness and eternity,
          though he be “merciful, good, wise, faithful?” What support could
          there be, if they were perfections belonging to a corruptible God?
          What hopes of a resurrection to happiness can we have, or of the
          duration of it, if that God that promised it were not immortal to
          continue it, as well as powerful to effect it? His power were not
          Almighty, if his duration were not eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If God be eternal, his covenant will be so. It is founded upon the
          eternity of God; the oath whereby he confirms it, is by his life.
          Since there is none greater than himself, he swears by himself (Heb.
          vi. 13), or by his own life, which he engageth together with his
          eternity for the full performance; so that if he lives forever, the
          covenant shall not be disannulled; it is an “immutable counsel” (ver.
          16, 17). The immutability of his counsel follows the immutability of
          his nature. Immutability and eternity go hand in hand together. The
          promise of eternal life is as ancient as God himself in regard of the
          purpose of the promise, or in regard of the promise made to Christ for
          us. “Eternal life which God promised before the world began.” (Tit. i.
          2): As it hath an ante‑eternity, so it hath a post‑eternity; therefore
          the gospel, which is the new covenant published, is termed the
          “everlasting gospel” (Rev. xiv. 6), which can no more be altered and
          perish, than God can change and vanish into nothing; he can as little
          morally deny his truth, as he can naturally desert his life. The
          covenant is there represented in a green color, to note its perpetual
          verdure; the rainbow, the emblem of the covenant “about the throne,
          was like to an emerald” (Rev. iv. 3), a stone of a green color,
          whereas the natural rainbow hath many colors; this but one, to signify
          its eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If God be eternal, he being our God in covenant, is an eternal good
          and possession. “This God is our God forever and ever” (Ps. xlviii.
          14): “He is a dwelling‑place in all generations.” We shall traverse
          the world awhile, and then arrive at the blessings Jacob wished for
          Joseph, “the blessings of the everlasting hills” (Gen. xlix. 26). If
          an estate of a thousand pound per annum render a man’s life
          comfortable for a short term, how much more may the soul be swallowed
          up with joy in the enjoyment of the Creator, whose years never fail,
          who lives forever to be enjoyed, and can keep us in life forever to
          enjoy him! Death, indeed, will seize upon us by God’s irreversible
          order, but the immortal Creator will make him disgorge his morsel, and
          land us in a glorious immortality; our souls at their dissolution, and
          our bodies at the resurrection, after which they shall remain forever,
          and employ the extent of that boundless eternity, in the fruition of
          the sovereign and eternal God; for it is impossible that the believer,
          who is united to the immortal God that is from everlasting to
          everlasting, can ever perish; for being in conjunction with him who is
          an ever‑flowing fountain of life, he cannot suffer him to remain in
          the jaws of death. While God is eternal, and always the same, it is
          not possible that those that partake of his spiritual life, should not
          also partake of his eternal. It is from the consideration of the
          endlessness of the years of God that the church comforts herself that
          “her children shall continue, and their seed be established forever”
          (Ps. cii. 27, 28). And from the eternity of God Habakkuk (chap. i. 12)
          concludes the eternity of believers, “Art not thou from everlasting, O
          Lord, my God, my Holy One? we shall not die, O Lord.” After they are
          retired from this world, they shall live forever with God, without any
          change by the multitude of those imaginable years and ages that shall
          run forever. It is that God that hath neither beginning nor end, that
          is our God; who hath not only immortality in himself, but immortality
          to give out to others. As he hath “abundance of spirit” to quicken
          them (Mal. ii. 15), so he hath abundance of immortality to continue
          them. It is only in the consideration of this a man can with wisdom
          say, “Soul, take thy ease; thou hast goods laid up for many years”
          (Luke xii. 19, 20): to say it of any other possession is the greatest
          folly in the judgment of our Saviour. “Mortality shall be swallowed up
          of immortality;” “rivers of pleasure” shall be “for evermore.” Death
          is a word never spoken there by any; never heard by any in that
          possession of eternity; it is forever put out as one of Christ’s
          conquered enemies. The happiness depends upon the presence of God,
          with whom believers shall be forever present. Happiness cannot perish
          as long as God lives; he is the first and the last; the first of all
          delights, nothing before him; the last of all pleasures, nothing
          beyond him; a paradise of delights in every point, without a flaming
          sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The enjoyment of God will be as fresh and glorious after many ages,
          as it was at first. God is eternal, and eternity knows no change;
          there will then be the fullest possession without any decay in the
          object enjoyed. There can be nothing past, nothing future; time
          neither adds to it, nor detracts from it; that infinite fulness of
          perfection which flourisheth in him now, will flourish eternally,
          without any discoloring of it in the least, by those innumerable ages
          that shall run to eternity, much less any despoiling him of them: “He
          is the same in his endless duration” (Ps. cii. 27). As God is, so will
          the eternity of him be, without succession, without division; the
          fulness of joy will be always present; without past to be thought of
          with regret for being gone; without future to be expected with
          tormenting desires. When we enjoy God, we enjoy him in his eternity
          without any flux; an entire possession of all together, without the
          passing away of pleasures that may be wished to return, or expectation
          of future joys which might be desired to hasten. Time is fluid, but
          eternity is stable; and after many ages, the joys will be as savory
          and satisfying as if they had been but that moment first tasted by our
          hungry appetites. When the glory of the Lord shall rise upon you, it
          shall be so far from ever setting, that after millions of years are
          expired, as numerous as the sands on the sea‑shore, the sun, in the
          light of whose countenance you shall live, shall be as bright as at
          the first appearance; he will be so far from ceasing to flow, that he
          will flow as strong, as full, as at the first communication of himself
          in glory to the creature. God, therefore, as sitting upon his throne
          of grace, and acting according to his covenant, is like a
          jasper‑stone, which is of a green color, a color always delightful
          (Rev. iv. 3); because God is always vigorous and flourishing; a pure
          act of life, sparkling new and fresh rays of life and light to the
          creature, flourishing with a perpetual spring, and contenting the most
          capacious desire; forming your interest, pleasure, and satisfaction;
          with an infinite variety, without any change or succession; he will
          have variety to increase delights, and eternity to perpetuate them;
          this will be the fruit of the enjoyment of an infinite and eternal
          God: he is not a cistern, but a fountain, wherein water is always
          living, and never putrefies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If God be eternal, here is a strong ground of comfort against all
          the distresses of the church, and the threats of the church’s enemies.
          God’s abiding forever is the plea Jeremy makes for his return to his
          forsaken church: “Thou, O Lord, remainest forever; thy throne from
          generation to generation” (Lam. v. 19, 20). The church is weak;
          created things are easily cut off; what prop is there, but that God
          that lives forever? What, though Jerusalem lost its bulwarks, the
          temple were defaced, the land wasted; yet the God of Jerusalem sits
          upon an eternal throne, and from everlasting to everlasting there is
          no diminution of his power. The prophet intimates in this complaint,
          that it is not agreeable to God’s eternity to forget his people, to
          whom he hath from eternity borne good‑will. In the greatest
          confusions, the church’s eyes are to be fixed upon the eternity of
          God’s throne, where he sits as governor of the world. No creature can
          take any comfort in this perfection, but the church; other creatures
          depend upon God, but the church is united to him. The first discovery
          of the name “I am,” which signifies the divine eternity, as well as
          immutability, was for the comfort of the “oppressed Israelites in
          Egypt” (Exod. iii. 14, 15): it was then published from the secret
          place of the Almighty, as the only strong cordial to refresh them: it
          hath not yet, it shall not ever lose its virtue in any of the miseries
          that have, or shall successively befall the church. It is a comfort as
          durable as the God whose name it is; he is still “I Am;” and the same
          to the church, as he was then to his Israel. His spiritual Israel have
          a greater right to the glories of it, than the carnal Israel could
          have. No oppression can be greater than theirs; what was a comfort
          suited to that distress, hath the same suitableness to every other
          oppression. It was not a temporary name, but a name forever; his
          “memorial to all generations” (ver. 15), and reacheth to the church of
          the Gentiles with whom he treats as the God of Abraham; ratifying that
          covenant by the Messiah, which he made with Abraham, the father of the
          faithful. The church’s enemies are not to be feared; they may spring
          as the grass, but soon after do wither by their own inward principles
          of decay, or are cut down by the hand of God (Ps. xcii. 7‒9). They may
          be instruments of the anger of God, but “they shall be scattered as
          the workers of iniquity by the hand of the Lord, that is high for
          evermore” (ver. 8), and is engaged by his promise, to preserve a
          church in the world. They may threaten, but their breath may vanish as
          soon as their threatenings are pronounced; for they carry their breath
          in no surer a place than their own nostrils, upon which the eternal
          God can put his hand, and sink them with all their rage. Do the
          prophets and instructors of the church “live forever” (Zech. i. 5)?
          No: shall, then, the adversaries and disturbers of the church live
          forever? They shall vanish as a shadow; their being depends upon the
          eternal God of the faithful, and the everlasting Judge of the wicked.
          He that inhabits eternity is above them that inhabit mortality; and
          must, whether they will or no, “say to corruption, Thou art my father,
          and to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister” (Job xvii. 14.)
          When they will act with a confidence, as if they were living gods, he
          will not be mated; but evidence himself to be a living God above them.
          Why, then, should mortal men be feared in their frowns, when an
          immortal God hath promised protection in his word, and lives forever
          to perform it?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Hence follows another comfort; since God is eternal, he hath as
          much power as will to be as good as his word. His promises are
          established upon his eternity; and his perfection is a main ground of
          trust; “Trust in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is
          everlasting strength” (Isa. xxvi. 4). ביה יהוה צור עולמים His name is
          doubled; that name, Jah and Jehovah, which was always the strength of
          his people; and not a single one, but the strength or rock of
          eternities: not a failing, but an eternal truth and power; that as his
          strength is eternal, so our trust in him should imitate his eternity
          in its perpetuity; and therefore in the despondency of his people, as
          if God had forgot his promises, and made no account of them, or his
          word, and were weary of doing good, he calls them to reflect on what
          they had heard of his eternity, which is attended with immutability,
          who hath an infiniteness of power to perform his will, and an
          infiniteness of understanding to judge of the right seasons of it. His
          wisdom, will, truth, have always been, and will to eternity be the
          same (Isa. xl. 27, 28). He wants not life, any more than love, forever
          to help us; since his word is past, he will never fail us; since his
          life continues, he can never be out of a capacity to relieve us; and,
          therefore, whenever we foolishly charge him by our distrustful
          thoughts, we forget his love, which made the promise, and his eternal
          life, which can accomplish it. As his word is the bottom of our trust,
          and his truth is the assurance of his sincerity, so his eternity is
          the assurance of his ability to perform: “His word stands forever”
          (ver. 8). A man may be my friend this day, and be in another world
          to‑morrow; and though he be never so sincere in his word, yet death
          snaps his life asunder, and forbids the execution. But as God cannot
          die, so he cannot lie; because he is the eternity of Israel: “The
          strength of Israel will not lie, nor repent,” נצח perpetuity, or
          eternity of Israel (1 Sam. xv. 29). Eternity implies immutability; we
          could have no ground for our hopes, if we knew him not to be longer
          lived than ourselves. The Psalmist beats off our hands from trust in
          men, “because their breath goes forth, they return to their earth, and
          in that day their thoughts perish” (Ps. cxlvi. 3, 4). And if the God
          of Jacob were like them, what happiness could we have in making him
          our help? As his sovereignty in giving precepts had not been a strong
          ground of obedience, without considering him as an eternal lawgiver,
          who could maintain his rights; so his kindness in making the promises
          had not been a strong ground of confidence, without considering him as
          an eternal promiser, whose thoughts and whose life can never
          perish.578 And this may be one reason why the Holy Ghost mentions so
          often the post‑eternity of God, and so little his ante‑eternity;
          because that is the strongest foundation of our faith and hope, which
          respects chiefly that which is future, and not that which is past;
          yet, indeed, no assurance of his after‑eternity can be had, if his
          ante‑eternity be not certain. If he had a beginning, he may have an
          end; and if he had a change in his nature, he might have in his
          counsels; but since all the resolves of God are as himself is,
          eternal, and all the promises of God are the fruits of his counsel,
          therefore they cannot be changed; if he should change them for the
          better, he would not have been eternally wise, to know what was best;
          if for the worse, he had not been eternally good or just. Men may
          break their promises, because they are made without foresight; but
          God, that inhabits eternity, foreknows all things that shall be done
          under the sun, as if they had been then acting before him; and nothing
          can intervene, or work a change in his resolves; because the least
          circumstances were eternally foreseen by him. Though there may be
          variations, and changes to our sight, the wind may tack about, and
          every hour new and cross accidents happen; yet the eternal God, who is
          eternally true to his word, sits at the helm, and the winds and the
          waves obey him. And though he should defer his promise a thousand
          years, yet he is “not slack” (2 Pet. iii. 8, 9); for he defers it but
          a day to his eternity: and who would not with comfort stay a day in
          expectation of a considerable advantage?

          (1.) Let us be deeply affected with our sins long since committed.
          Though they are past with us, they are, in regard of God’s eternity,
          present with him; there is no succession in eternity, as there is in
          time. All things are before God at once; our sins are before him, as
          if committed this moment, though committed long ago. As he is what he
          is in regard of duration, so he knows what he knows in regard of
          knowledge. As he is not more than he was, nor shall not be any more
          than he is, so he always knew what he knows, and shall not cease to
          know what he now knows. As himself, so his knowledge, is one
          indivisible point of eternity. He knows nothing but what he did know
          from eternity; he shall know no more for the future than he now knows.
          Our sins being present with him in his eternity, should be present
          with us in our regard of remembrance of them, and sorrow for them.
          What though many years are lapsed, much time run out, and our
          iniquities almost blotted out of our memory; yet since a thousand
          years are, in God’s sight, and in regard of his eternity, but as a
          day—“A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is
          past, and as a watch in the night” (Ps. xc. 4)—they are before him.
          For suppose a man were as old as the world, above five thousand six
          hundred years; the sins committed five thousand years ago, are,
          according to that rule, but as if they were committed five days ago;
          so that sixty‑two years are but as an hour and a half; and the sins
          committed forty years since as if they were committed but this present
          hour. But if we will go further, and consider them but as a watch of
          the night, about three hours (for the night, consisting of twelve
          hours, was divided into set watches), then a thousand years are but as
          three hours in the sight of God; and then sins committed sixty years
          ago are but as if they were committed within this five minutes. Let
          none of us set light by the iniquities committed many years ago, and
          imagine that length of time can wipe out their guilt. No: let us
          consider them in relation to God’s eternity, and excite an inward
          remorse, as if they had been but the birth of this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Let the consideration of God’s eternity abate our pride. This is
          the design of the verses following the text: the eternity of God being
          so sufficient to make us understand our own nothingness, which ought
          to be one great end of man, especially as fallen. The eternity of God
          should make us as much disesteem ourselves, as the excellency of God
          made Job abhor himself (Job xlii. 5, 6). His excellency should humble
          us under a sense of our vanity, and his eternity under a sense of the
          shortness of our duration. If man compares himself with other
          creatures, he may be too sensible of his greatness; but if he compares
          himself with God, he cannot but be sensible of his baseness.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. In regard of our impotence to comprehend this eternity of God.
          How little do we know, how little can we know, of God’s eternity! We
          cannot fully conceive it, much less express it; we have but a brutish
          understanding in all those things, as Agur said of himself (Prov. xxx.
          7). What is infinite and eternal, cannot be comprehended by finite and
          temporary creatures; if it could, it would not be infinite and
          eternal;579 for to know a thing, is to know the extent and cause of
          it. It is repugnant to eternity to be known, because it hath no
          limits, no causes; the most soaring understanding cannot have a
          proportionable understanding of it. What disproportion is there
          between a drop of water and the sea in their greatness and motion; yet
          by a drop we may arrive to a knowledge of the nature of the sea, which
          is a mass of drops joined together; but the longest duration of times
          cannot make us know what eternity is, because there is no proportion
          between time and eternity. The years of God are as numberless as his
          thoughts (Ps. xl. 5), and our minds as far from reckoning the one as
          the other. If our understandings are too gross to comprehend the
          majesty of his infinite works, they are much more too short to
          comprehend the infiniteness of his eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. In regard of the vast disproportion of our duration to this
          duration of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] We have more of nothing than being. We were nothing from an
          unbegun eternity, and we might have been nothing to an endless
          eternity, had not God called us into being; and if he please we may be
          nothing by as short an annihilating word, as we were something by a
          creating word. As it is the prerogative of God to be, “I am that I
          am;” so it is the property of a creature to be, “I am not what I am;”
          I am not by myself what I am, but by the indulgence of another. I was
          nothing formerly; I may be nothing again, unless he that is “I Am”
          make me to subsist what I now am. Nothing is as much the title of the
          creature as being is the title of God. Nothing is so holy as God,
          because nothing hath being as God: “There is none holy as the Lord,
          for there is none besides thee” (1 Sam. ii. 2). Man’s life is an
          image, a dream, which are next to nothing; and if compared with God,
          worse than nothing; a nullity as well as a vanity, because “with God
          only is the fountain of life” (Ps. xxxvi. 9). The creature is but a
          drop of life from him, dependent on him: a drop of water is a nothing
          if compared with the vast conflux of waters and numberless drops in
          the ocean. How unworthy is it for dust and ashes, kneaded together in
          time, to strut against the Father of eternity! Much more unworthy for
          that which is nothing, worse than nothing, to quarrel with that which
          is only being, and equal himself with Him that inhabits eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] What being we have had a beginning. After an unaccountable
          eternity was run out, in the very dregs of time, a few years ago we
          were created, and made of the basest and vilest dross of the world,
          the slime and dust of the earth; made of that wherewith birds build
          their nests; made of that which creeping things make their habitation,
          and beasts trample upon. How monstrous is pride in such a creature, to
          aspire, as if he were the Father of eternity, and as eternal as God,
          and so his own eternity!
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] What being we have is but of a short duration in regard of our
          life in this world. Our life is in a constant change and flux; we
          remain not the same an entire day; youth quickly succeeds childhood,
          and age as speedily treads upon the heels of youth; there is a
          continual defluxion of minutes, as there is of sands in a glass. He is
          as a watch wound up at the beginning of his life, and from that time
          is running down, till he comes to the bottom; some part of our lives
          is cut off every day, every minute. Life is but a moment: what is past
          cannot be recalled, what is future cannot be ensured. If we enjoy this
          moment, we have lost that which is past, and shall presently lose this
          by the next that is to come. The short duration of men is set out in
          Scripture by such creatures as soon disappear: a worm (Job xxv. 6),
          that can scarce outlive a winter; grass, that withers by the summer
          sun. Life is a “flower,” soon withering (Job xiv. 2); a “vapor,” soon
          vanishing (James iv. 14); a “smoke,” soon disappearing (Ps. cii. 3).
          The strongest man is but compacted dust; the fabric must moulder; the
          highest mountain falls and comes to naught. Time gives place to
          eternity; we live now, and die to‑morrow. Not a man since the world
          began ever lived a day in God’s sight; for no man ever lived a
          thousand years. The longest day of any man’s life never amounted to
          twenty‑four hours in the account of divine eternity: a life of so many
          hundred years, with the addition “he died,” makes up the greatest part
          of the history of the patriarchs (Gen. v.); and since the life of man
          hath been curtailed, if any be in the world eighty years, he scarce
          properly lives sixty of them, since the fourth part of time is at
          least consumed in sleep. A greater difference there is between the
          duration of God and that of a creature, than between the life of one
          for a minute, and the life of one that should live as many years as
          the whole globe of heaven and earth, if changed into papers, could
          contain figures. And this life, though but of a short duration
          according to the period God hath determined, is easily cut off; the
          treasure of life is deposited in a brittle vessel. A small stone
          hitting against Nebuchadnezzar’s statue will tumble it down into a
          poor and nasty grave; a grape‑stone, the bone of a fish, a small fly
          in the throat, a moist damp, are enough to destroy an earthly
          eternity, and reduce it to nothing. What a nothing, then, is our
          shortness, if compared with God’s eternity; our frailty, with God’s
          duration! How humble, then, should perishing creatures be before an
          eternal God, with whom “our days are as a hand’s breadth, and our age
          as nothing!” (Ps. xxxix. 5.) The angels, that have been of as long a
          duration as heaven and earth, tremble before him; the heavens melt at
          his presence; and shall we, that are but of yesterday, approach a
          divine eternity with unhumbled souls, and offer the calves of our lips
          with the pride of devils, and stand upon our terms with him, without
          falling upon our faces, with a sense that we are but dust and ashes,
          and creatures of time? How easy is it to reason out man’s humility!
          but how hard is it to reason man into it!
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Let the consideration of God’s eternity take off our love and
          confidence from the world, and the things thereof. The eternity of God
          reproaches a pursuit of the world, as preferring a momentary pleasure
          before an everlasting God; as though a temporal world could be a
          better supply than a God whose years never fail. Alas! what is this
          earth men are so greedy of, and will get, though by blood and sweat?
          What is this whole earth, if we had the entire possession of it, if
          compared with the vast heavens, the seat of angels and blessed
          spirits? It is but as an atom to the greatest mountain, or as a drop
          of dew to the immense ocean. How foolish is it to prefer a drop before
          the sea, or an atom before the world! The earth is but a point to the
          sun; the sun with its whole orb, but a little part of the heavens if
          compared with the whole fabric. If a man had the possession of all
          those, there could be no comparison between those that have had a
          beginning, and shall have an end, and God who is without either of
          them. Yet how many are there that make nothing of the divine eternity,
          and imagine an eternity of nothing!
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] The world hath been but of a short standing. It is not yet six
          thousand years since the foundations of it were laid, and therefore it
          cannot have a boundless excellency, as that God, who hath been from
          everlasting, doth possess. If Adam had lived to this day, and been as
          absolute lord of his posterity, as he was of the other creatures, had
          it been a competent object to take up his heart? had he not been a
          madman, to have preferred this little created pleasure before an
          everlasting uncreated God? a thing that had a dependent beginning,
          before that which had an independent eternity?
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] The beauties of the world are transitory and perishing. The whole
          world is nothing else but a fluid thing; the fashion of it is a
          pageantry, “passing away” (1 Cor. vii. 31): though the glories of it
          might be conceived greater than they are, yet they are not consistent,
          but transient; there cannot be an entire enjoyment of them, because
          they grow up and expire every moment, and slip away between our
          fingers while we are using them. Have we not heard of God’s dispersing
          the greatest empires like “chaff before a whirlwind,” or as “smoke out
          of a chimney” (Hos. xiii. 3), which, though it appears as a compacted
          cloud, as if it would choke the sun, is quickly scattered into several
          parts of the air, and becomes invisible? Nettles have often been heirs
          to stately palaces, as God threatens Israel (Hos. ix. 6). We cannot
          promise ourselves over night anything the next day. A kingdom with the
          glory of a throne may be cut off in a morning (Hos. x. 15). The new
          wine may be taken from the mouth when the vintage is ripe; the
          devouring locust may snatch away both the hopes of that and the
          harvest (Joel i. 15); they are, therefore, things which are not, and
          nothing cannot be a fit object for confidence or affection; “Wilt thou
          set thy eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make
          themselves wings” (Prov. xxiii. 5). They are not properly beings,
          because they are not stable, but flitting. They are not, because they
          may not be the next moment to us what they are this: they are but
          cisterns, not springs, and broken cisterns, not sound and stable; no
          solidity in their substance, nor stability in their duration. What a
          foolish thing is it then, to prefer a transient felicity, a mere
          nullity, before an eternal God! What a senseless thing would it be in
          a man to prefer the map of a kingdom, which the hand of a child can
          tear in pieces, before the kingdom shadowed by it! How much more
          inexcusable is it to value things, that are so far from being eternal,
          that they are not so much as dusky resemblances of an eternity. Were
          the things of the world more glorious than they are, yet they are but
          as a counterfeit sun in a cloud, which comes short of the true sun in
          the heavens, both in glory and duration; and to esteem them before
          God, is inconceivably baser, than if a man should value a
          party‑colored bubble in the air, before a durable rock of diamonds.
          The comforts of this world are as candles, that will end in a snuff;
          whereas the felicity that flows from an eternal God, is like the sun,
          that shines more and more to a perfect day.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] They cannot therefore be fit for a soul, which was made to have
          an interest in God’s eternity. The soul being of a perpetual nature,
          was made for the fruition of an eternal good; without such a good it
          can never be perfect. Perfection, that noble thing, riseth not from
          anything in this world, nor is a title due to a soul while in this
          world; it is then they are said to be made perfect, when they arrive
          at that entire conjunction with the eternal God in another life (Heb.
          xii. 23). The soul cannot be ennobled by an acquaintance with these
          things, or established by a dependence on them; they cannot confer
          what a rational nature should desire, or supply it with what it wants.
          The soul hath a resemblance to God in a post‑eternity; why should it
          be drawn aside by the blandishments of earthly things, to neglect its
          true establishment, and lackey after the body, which is but the shadow
          of the soul, and was made to follow it and serve it? But while it
          busieth itself altogether in the concerns of a perishing body, and
          seeks satisfaction in things that glide away, it becomes rather a body
          than soul, descends below its nature, reproacheth that God who hath
          imprinted upon it an image of his own eternity, and loseth the comfort
          of the everlastingness of its Creator. How shall the whole world, if
          our lives were as durable as that, be a happy eternity to us, who have
          souls that shall survive all the delights of it, which must fry in
          those flames that shall fire the whole frame of nature at the general
          conflagration of the world? (2 Pet. iii. 10.)
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] Therefore let us provide for a happy interest in the eternity of
          God. Man is made for an eternal state. The soul hath such a perfection
          in its nature, that it is fit for eternity, and cannot display all its
          operations but in eternity. To an eternity it must go, and live as
          long as God himself lives. Things of a short duration are not
          proportioned to a soul made for an eternal continuance; to see that it
          be a comfortable eternity, is worth all our care. Man is a forecasting
          creature, and considers not only the present, but the future too, in
          his provisions for his family; and shall he disgrace his nature in
          casting off all consideration of a future eternity? Get possession,
          therefore, of the eternal God. “A portion in this life” is the lot of
          those who shall be forever miserable (Ps. xvii. 14). But God, “an
          everlasting portion,” is the lot of them that are designed for
          happiness. “God is my portion forever” (Ps. lxxiii. 26). “Time is
          short” (1 Cor. vii. 29). The whole time for which God designed this
          building of the world, is of a little compass; it is a stage erected
          for rational creatures to act their parts upon for a few thousand
          years; the greatest part of which time is run out; and then shall
          time, like a rivulet, fall into the sea of eternity, from whence it
          sprung. As time is but a slip of eternity, so it will end in eternity;
          our advantages consist in the present instant; what is past never
          promised a return, and cannot be fetched back by all our vows. What is
          future, we cannot promise ourselves to enjoy; we may be snatched away
          before it comes. Every minute that passeth, speaks the fewer
          remaining, till the time of death; and as we are every hour further
          from our beginning, we are nearer our end. The child born this day
          grows up, to grow nothing at last. In all ages there is “but a step
          between us and death,” as David said of himself (1 Sam. xx. 3). The
          little time that remains for the devil till the day of judgment,
          envenoms his wrath; he rageth, because “his time is short” (Rev. xii.
          12). The little time that remains between this moment and our death,
          should quicken our diligence to inherit the endless and unchangeable
          eternity of God.

          [5.] Often meditate on the eternity of God. The holiness, power, and
          eternity of God, are the fundamental articles of all religion, upon
          which the whole body of it leans; his holiness for conformity to him,
          his power and eternity for the support of faith and hope. The strong
          and incessant cries of the four beasts, representing that christian
          church, are “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
          and is to come” (Rev. iv. 8). Though his power is intimated, yet the
          chiefest are his holiness, three times expressed; and his eternity
          which is repeated, “who lives forever and ever” (ver. 9). This ought
          to be the constant practice in the church of the Gentiles, which this
          book chiefly respects; the meditation of his converting grace
          manifested to Paul, ravished the apostle’s heart; but not without the
          triumphant consideration of his immortality and eternity, which are
          the principal parts of the doxology: “Now unto the King eternal,
          immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and
          ever” (1 Tim. i. 15‒17). It could be no great transport to the spirit,
          to consider him glorious without considering him immortal. The
          unconfinedness of his perfections in regard of time, presents the soul
          with matter of the greatest complacency. The happiness of our souls
          depends upon his other attributes, but the perpetuity of it upon his
          eternity. Is it a comfort to view his immense wisdom; his overflowing
          goodness; his tender mercy; his unerring truth? What comfort were
          there in any of those, if it were a wisdom that could be baffled; a
          goodness that could be damped; a mercy that can expire; and a truth
          that can perish with the subject of it? Without eternity, what were
          all his other perfections, but as glorious, yet withering flowers; a
          great, but a decaying beauty? By a frequent meditation of God’s
          eternity, we should become more sensible of our own vanity and the
          world’s triflingness; how nothing should ourselves; how nothing would
          all other things appear in our eyes! how coldly should we desire them!
          how feebly should we place any trust in them! Should we not think
          ourselves worthy of contempt to dote upon a perishing glory, to expect
          support from an arm of flesh, when there is an eternal beauty to
          ravish us, an eternal arm to protect us? Asaph, when he considered God
          “a portion forever,” thought nothing of the glories of the earth, or
          the beauties of the created heavens, worth his appetite or
          complacency, but “God” (Ps. lxxiii. 25, 26). Besides, an elevated
          frame of heart at the consideration of God’s eternity, would batter
          down the strongholds and engines of any temptation: a slight
          temptation will not know where to find and catch hold of a soul high
          and hid in a meditation of it; and if it doth, there will not be
          wanting from hence preservatives to resist and conquer it. What
          transitory pleasures will not the thoughts of God’s eternity stifle?
          When this work busieth a soul, it is too great to suffer it to
          descend, to listen to a sleeveless errand from hell or the world. The
          wanton allurements of the flesh will be put off with indignation. The
          proffers of the world will be ridiculous when they are cast into the
          balance with the eternity of God, which sticking in our thoughts, we
          shall not be so easy a prey for the fowler’s gin. Let us, therefore,
          often meditate upon this, but not in a bare speculation, without
          engaging our affections, and making every notion of the divine
          eternity end in a suitable impression upon our hearts. This would be
          much like the disciples gazing upon the heavens at the ascension of
          their Master, while they forgot the practice of his orders (Acts i.
          11). We may else find something of the nature of God, and lose
          ourselves, not only in eternity, but to eternity.

          2. And hence the second part of the exhortation is, to something which
          concerns us with a respect to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) If God be eternal, how worthy is he of our choicest affections,
          and strongest desires of communion with him! Is not everything to be
          valued according to the greatness of its being! How, then, should we
          love him, who is not only lovely in his nature, but eternally lovely;
          having from everlasting all those perfections centered in himself,
          which appear in time! If everything be lovely, by how much more it
          partakes of the nature of God, who is the chief good; how much more
          infinitely lovely is God, who is superior to all other goods, and
          eternally so! Not a God of a few minutes, months, years, or millions
          of years; not of the dregs of time or the top of time, but of
          eternity; above time, inconceivably immense beyond time. The loving
          him infinitely, perpetually, is an act of homage due to him for his
          eternal excellency; we may give him the one, since our souls are
          immortal, though we cannot the other, because they are finite. Since
          he incloseth in himself all the excellencies of heaven and earth
          forever, he should have an affection, not only of time in this world,
          but of eternity in future; and if we did not owe him a love for what
          we are by him, we owe him a love for what he is in himself; and more
          for what he is, than for what he is to us. He is more worthy of our
          affections because he is the eternal God, than because he is our
          Creator; because he is more excellent in his nature, than in his
          transient actions; the beams of his goodness to us, are to direct our
          thoughts and affections to him; but his own eternal excellency ought
          to be the ground and foundation of our affections to him. And truly,
          since nothing but God is eternal, nothing but God is worth the loving;
          and we do but a just right to our love, to pitch it upon that which
          can always possess us and be possessed by us; upon an object that
          cannot deceive our affection, and put it out of countenance by a
          dissolution. And if our happiness consists in being like to God, we
          should imitate him in loving him as he loves himself, and as long as
          he loves himself; God cannot do more to himself than love himself; he
          can make no addition to his essence, nor diminution from it. What
          should we do less to an eternal Being, than to bestow affections upon
          him, like his own to himself; since we can find nothing so durable as
          himself, for which we should love it?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He only is worthy of our best service. The Ancient of Days is to
          be served before all that are younger than himself; our best obedience
          is due to him as a God of unconfined excellency; everything that is
          excellent deserves a veneration suitable to its excellency. As God is
          infinite, he hath right to a boundless service; as he is eternal, he
          hath right to a perpetual service: as service is a debt of justice
          upon the account of the excellency of his nature, so a perpetual
          service is as much a debt of justice upon the account of his eternity.
          If God be infinite and eternal, he merits an honor and comportment
          from his creatures, suited to the unlimited perfection of his nature,
          and the duration of his being. How worthy is the Psalmist’s
          resolution! “I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing
          praise to my God while I have any being” (Ps. civ. 33). It is the use
          he makes of the endless duration of the glory of God; and will extend
          to all other service as well as praise. To serve other things, or to
          serve ourselves, is too vast a service upon that which is nothing. In
          devoting ourselves to God, we serve him that is, that was, so as that
          he never began; is to come, so as that he never shall end; by whom all
          things are what they are; who hath both eternal knowledge to remember
          our service, and eternal goodness to reward it.
