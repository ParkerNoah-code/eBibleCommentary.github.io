        <h2>DISCOURSE XII.</h2>
        <p>ON THE GOODNESS OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Mark x. 18.—And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? There
          is none good but one, that is, God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words are part of a reply of our Saviour to the young man’s
          petition to him: a certain person came in haste, “running” as being
          eager for satisfaction, to entreat his directions, what he should do
          to inherit everlasting life; the person is described only in general
          (ver. 17), “There came one,” a certain man: but Luke describes him by
          his dignity (Luke xviii. 18), “A certain ruler;” one of authority
          among the Jews. He desires of him an answer to a legal question, “What
          he should do?” or, as Matthew hath it, “What good thing shall I do,
          that I may have eternal life” (Matt. xix. 16)? He imagined everlasting
          felicity was to be purchased by the works of the law; he had not the
          least sentiments of faith: Christ’s answer implies, there was no hopes
          of the happiness of another world by the works of the law, unless they
          were perfect, and answerable to every divine precept. He doth not seem
          to have any ill, or hypocritical intent in his address to Christ; not
          to tempt him, but to be instructed by him. He seems to come with an
          ardent desire, to be satisfied in his demand; he performed a solemn
          act of respect to him, he kneeled to him, γονυπετήσας, prostrated
          himself upon the ground; besides, Christ is said (ver. 21) to love
          him, which had been inconsistent with the knowledge Christ had of the
          hearts and thoughts of men, and the abhorrence he had of hypocrites,
          had he been only a counterfeit in this question. But the first reply
          Christ makes to him, respects the title of “Good Master,” which this
          ruler gave him in his salutation.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Some think, that Christ hereby would draw him to an
          acknowledgment of him as God; you acknowledge me “good;” how come you
          to salute me with so great a title, since you do not afford it to your
          greatest doctors? Lightfoot, in loc. observes, that the title of Rabbi
          bone is not in all the Talmud. You must own me to be God, since you
          own me to be “good:” goodness being a title only due, and properly
          belonging, to the Supreme Being. If you take me for a common man, with
          what conscience can you salute me in a manner proper to God? since no
          man is “good,” no, not one, but the heart of man is evil continually.
          The Arians used this place, to back their denying the Deity of Christ:
          because, say they, he did not acknowledge himself “good,” therefore he
          did not acknowledge himself God. But he doth not here deny his Deity,
          but reproves him for calling him good, when he had not yet confessed
          him to be more than a man.941 You behold my flesh, but you consider
          not the fulness of my Deity; if you account me “good,” account me God,
          and imagine me not to be a simple and a mere man.942 He disowns not
          his own Deity, but allures the young man to a confession of it. Why
          callest thou me good, since thou dost not discover any apprehensions
          of my being more than a man? Though thou comest with a greater esteem
          to me than is commonly entertained of the doctors of the chair, why
          dost thou own me to be “good,” unless thou own me to be God? If Christ
          had denied himself in this speech to be “good,” he had rather
          entertained this person with a frown and a sharp reproof for giving
          him a title due to God alone, than have received him with that
          courtesy and complaisance as he did.943 Had he said, there is none
          “good” but the Father, he had excluded himself; but in saying, there
          is none “good” but God, he comprehends himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. Others say, that Christ had no intention to draw him to an
          acknowledgment of his Deity, but only asserts his divine authority or
          mission from God. For which interpretation Maldonat calls Calvin an
          Arianizer.944 He doth not here assert the essence of his Deity, but
          the authority of his doctrine; as if he should have said, You do
          without ground give me the title of “good,” unless you believe I have
          a Divine commission for what I declare and act. Many do think me an
          impostor, an enemy of God, and a friend to devils; you must firmly
          believe that I am not so, as your rulers report me, but that I am sent
          of God, and authorized by him; you cannot else give me the title of
          good, but of wicked. And the reason they give for this interpretation,
          is, because it is a question, whether any of the apostles understood
          him, at this time, to be God, which seems to have no great strength in
          it; since not only the devil had publicly owned him to be the “Holy
          One of God” (Luke iv. 34), but John the Baptist had borne record, that
          he was the “Son of God” (John i. 32, 34); and before this time Peter
          had confessed him openly, in the hearing of the rest of the disciples,
          that he was “the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matt. xvi. 16).
          But I think Paræus’ interpretation is best, which takes in both those;
          either you are serious or deceitful in this address; if you are
          serious, why do you call me “good,” and make bold to fix so great a
          title upon one you have no higher thoughts of than a mere man? Christ
          takes occasion from hence, to assert God to be only and sovereignly
          “good:” “There is none good but God.”945 God only hath the honor of
          absolute goodness, and none but God merits the name of “good.” A
          heathen could say much after the same manner; All other things are far
          from the nature of good; call none else good but God, for this would
          be a profane error: other things are only good in opinion, but have
          not the true substance of goodness: he is “good” in a more excellent
          way than any creature can be denominated “good.”946
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God is only originally good, good of himself. All created goodness
          is a rivulet from this fountain, but Divine goodness hath no spring;
          God depends upon no other for his goodness; he hath it in, and of,
          himself: man hath no goodness from himself, God hath no goodness from
          without himself: his goodness is no more derived from another than his
          being: if we were good by any external thing, that thing must be in
          being before him, or after him; if before him, he was not then himself
          from eternity; if after him, he was not good in himself from eternity.
          The end of his creating things, then, was not to confer a goodness
          upon his creatures, but to partake of a goodness from his creatures.
          God is good by and in himself, since all things are only good by him;
          and all that goodness which is in creatures, is but the breathing of
          his own goodness upon them: they have all their loveliness from the
          same hand they have their being from. Though by creation God was
          declared good, yet he was not made good by any, or by all the
          creatures. He partakes of none, but all things partake of him. He is
          so good, that he gives all, and receives nothing; only good, because
          nothing is good but by him: nothing hath a goodness but from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God only is infinitely good. A boundless goodness that knows no
          limits, a goodness as infinite as his essence, not only good, but
          best; not only good, but goodness itself, the supreme inconceivable
          goodness. All things else are but little particles of God, small
          sparks from this immense flame, sips of goodness to this fountain.
          Nothing that is good by his influence can equal him who is good by
          himself: derived goodness can never equal primitive goodness. Divine
          goodness communicates itself to a vast number of creatures in various
          degrees; to angels, glorified spirits, men on earth, to every
          creature; and when it hath communicated all that the present world is
          capable of, there is still less displayed, than left to enrich another
          world. All possible creatures are not capable of exhausting the
          wealth, the treasures, that Divine bounty is filled with.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God is only perfectly good, because only infinitely good. He is
          good without indigence, because he hath the whole nature of goodness,
          not only some beams that may admit of increase of degree. As in him is
          the whole nature of entity, so in him is the whole nature of
          excellency. As nothing hath an absolute perfect being but God, so
          nothing hath an absolutely perfect goodness but God; as the sun hath a
          perfection of heat in it, but what is warmed by the sun is but
          imperfectly hot, and equals not the sun in that perfection of heat
          wherewith it is naturally endued. The goodness of God is the measure
          and rule of goodness in everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God only is immutably good. Other things may be perpetually good by
          supernatural power, but not immutably good in their own nature. Other
          things are not so good, but they may be bad; God is so good, that he
          cannot be bad. It was the speech of a philosopher, that it was a hard
          thing to find a good man, yea, impossible; but though it were possible
          to find a good man, he would be good but for some moment, or a short
          time: for though he should be good at this instant, it was above the
          nature of man to continue in a habit of goodness, without going awry
          and warping.947 But “the goodness of God endureth forever” (Ps. lii.
          1). God always glitters in goodness, as the sun, which the heathens
          called the visible image of the Divinity, doth with light. There is
          not such a perpetual light in the sun as there is a fulness of
          goodness in God; “no variableness” in him, as he is the “Father of
          Lights” (James i. 17).
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I come to the doctrine, that is, the chief scope of the words,
          some remarks may be made upon the young man’s question and carriage:
          “What must I do to inherit eternal life?”
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The opinion of gaining eternal life by the outward observation of
          the law, will appear very unsatisfactory to an inquisitive conscience.
          This ruler affirmed, and certainly did confidently believe, that he
          had fulfilled the law (ver. 20): “All this have I observed from my
          youth;” yet he had not any full satisfaction in his own conscience;
          his heart misgave, and started upon some sentiments in him, that
          something else was required, and what he had done might be too weak,
          too short to shoot heaven’s lock for him. And to that purpose he comes
          to Christ, to receive instructions for the piecing up whatsoever was
          defective. Whosoever will consider the nature of God, and the relation
          of a creature, cannot with reason think, that eternal life was of
          itself due from God as a recompense to Adam, had he persisted in a
          state of innocence. Who can think so great a reward due, for having
          performed that which a creature in that relation was obliged to do?
          Can any man think another obliged to convey an inheritance of a
          thousand pounds per annum upon his payment of a few farthings, unless
          any compact appears to support such a conceit? And if it were not to
          be expected in the integrity of nature, but only from the goodness of
          God, how can it be expected since the revolt of man, and the universal
          deluge of natural corruption? God owes nothing to the holiest
          creature; what he gives is a present from his bounty, not the reward
          of the creature’s merit. And the apostle defies all creatures, from
          the greatest to the least, from the tallest angel to the lowest shrub,
          to bring out any one creature that hath first given to God (Rom. xi.
          35); “Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him
          again?” The duty of the creature, and God’s gift of eternal life, is
          not a bargain and sale. God gives to the creature, he doth not
          properly repay; for he that repays hath received something of an equal
          value and worth before. When God crowns angels and men, he bestows
          upon them purely what is his own, not what is theirs by merit and and
          natural obligation: though indeed, what God gives by virtue of a
          promise made before, is, upon the performance of the condition, due by
          gracious obligation. God was not indebted to man in innocence, but
          every man’s conscience may now mind him that he is not upon the same
          level as in the state of integrity; and that he cannot expect anything
          from God, as the salary of his merit, but the free gift of Divine
          liberality. Man is obliged to the practice of what is good, both from
          the excellency of the Divine precepts, and the duty he owes to God;
          and cannot, without some declaration from God, hope for any other
          reward, than the satisfaction of having well acquitted himself.948
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is the disease of human nature, since its corruption, to hope
          for eternal life by the tenor of the covenant of works. Though this
          ruler’s conscience was not thoroughly satisfied with what he had done,
          but imagined he might, for all that, fall short of eternal life, yet
          he still hugs the imagination of obtaining it by doing (ver. 17);
          “What shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?” This is natural to
          corrupted man. Cain thought to be accepted for the sake of his
          sacrifice; and, when he found his mistake, he was so weary of seeking
          happiness by doing, that he would court misery by murdering. All men
          set too high a value upon their own services. Sinful creatures would
          fain make God a debtor to them, and be purchasers of felicity: they
          would not have it conveyed to them by God’s sovereign bounty, but by
          an obligation of justice upon the value of their works. The heathens
          thought God would treat men according to the merit of their services;
          and it is no wonder they should have this sentiment, when the Jews,
          educated by God in a wiser school, were wedded to that notion. The
          Pharisees were highly fond of it: it was the only argument they used
          in prayer for Divine blessing. You have one of them boasting of his
          frequency in fasting, and his exactness in paying his tithes (Luke
          xix. 12); as if God had been beholden to him, and could not, without
          manifest wrong, deny him his demand. And Paul confesseth it to be his
          own sentiment before his conversion; he accounted this “righteousness
          of the law gain to him” (Phil. iii. 7); he thought, by this, to make
          his market with God. The whole nation of the Jews affected it,949
          compassing sea and land to make out a righteousness of their own, as
          the Pharisees did to make proselytes. The Papists follow their steps,
          and dispute for justification by the merit of works, and find out
          another key of works of supererogation, to unlock heaven’s gate, than
          whatever the Scripture informed us of. It is from hence, also, that
          men are so ready to make faith, as a work, the cause of our
          justification. Man foolishly thinks he hath enough to set up himself
          after he hath proved bankrupt, and lost all his estate. This
          imagination is born with us, and the best Christians may find some
          sparks of it in themselves, when there are springings up of joy in
          their hearts, upon the more close performance of one duty than of
          another; as if they had wiped off their scores, and given God a
          satisfaction for their former neglects. “We have forsaken all, and
          followed thee,” was the boast of his disciples: “What shall we have,
          therefore?” was a branch of this root (Matt. xix. 27). Eternal life is
          a gift, not by any obligation of right, but an abundance of goodness;
          it is owing, not to the dignity of our works, but the magnificent
          bounty of the Divine nature, and must be sued for by the title of
          God’s promise, not by the title of the creature’s services. We may
          observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How insufficient are some assents to Divine truth, and some
          expressions of affection to Christ, without the practice of christian
          precepts. This man addressed Christ with a profound respect,
          acknowledging him more than an ordinary person, with a more
          reverential carriage than we read any of his disciples paid to him in
          the days of his flesh; he fell down at his feet, kissed his knees, as
          the custom was, when they would testify the great respect they had to
          any eminent person, especially to their rabbins. All this some think
          to be included in the word γονυπετήσας.950 He seems to acknowledge him
          the Messiah by giving him the title of “Good,” a title they did not
          give to their doctors of the chair; he breathes out his opinion, that
          he was able to instruct him beyond the ability of the law; he came
          with a more than ordinary affection to him, and expectation of
          advantage from him, evident by his departing sad, when his
          expectations were frustrated by his own perversity; it was a sign he
          had a high esteem of him from whom he could not part without marks of
          his grief. What was the cause of his refusing the instructions he
          pretended such an affection to receive? He had possessions in the
          world. How soon do a few drops of worldly advantages quench the first
          sparks of an ill‑grounded love to Christ! How vain is a complimental
          and cringing devotion, without a supreme preference of God, and
          valuation of Christ above every outward allurement. We may observe
          this,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We should never admit anything to be ascribed to us, which is
          proper to God. “Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one,
          that is, God.” If you do not acknowledge me God, ascribe not to me the
          title of Good. It takes off all those titles which fawning flatterers
          give to men, “mighty,” “invincible” to princes, “holiness” to the
          pope. We call one another good, without considering how evil; and
          wise, without considering how foolish; mighty, without considering how
          weak, and knowing, without considering how ignorant. No man, but hath
          more of wickedness than goodness; of ignorance than knowledge; of
          weakness than strength. God is a jealous God of his own honor; he will
          not have the creature share with him in his royal titles. It is a part
          of idolatry to give men the titles which are due to God; a kind of a
          worship of the creature together with the Creator. Worms will not
          stand out, but assault Herod in his purple, when he usurps the
          prerogative of God, and prove stiff and invincible vindicators of
          their Creator’s honor, when summoned to arms by the Creator’s word
          (Acts xii. 22, 23).
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. The observation which I intend to prosecute, is this:—Pure
          and perfect goodness is only the royal prerogative of God; goodness is
          a choice perfection of the Divine nature. This is the true and genuine
          character of God; he is good, he is goodness, good in himself, good in
          his essence, good in the highest degree, possessing whatsoever is
          comely, excellent, desirable; the highest good, because first good:
          whatsoever is perfect goodness, is God; whatsoever is truly goodness
          in any creature, is a resemblance of God.951 All the names of God are
          comprehended in this one of good. All gifts, all variety of goodness,
          are contained in him as one common good. He is the efficient cause of
          all good, by an overflowing goodness of his nature; he refers all
          things to himself, as the end, for the representation of his own
          goodness; “Truly God is good” (Ps. lxxiii. 1). Certainly, it is an
          undoubted truth; it is written in his works of nature, and his acts of
          grace (Exod. xxxiv. 6). “He is abundant in goodness.” And every thing
          is a memorial, not of some few sparks, but of his greater goodness
          (Ps. cxlv. 7). This is often celebrated in the Psalms, and men invited
          more than once, to sing forth the praises of it (Ps. cvii. 8, 15, 21,
          31). It may better be admired than sufficiently spoken of, or thought
          of, as it merits. It is discovered in all his works, as the goodness
          of a tree in all its fruits; it is easy to be seen, and more pleasant
          to be contemplated. In general,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. All nations in the world have acknowledged God good; Τὸ Ἀγαθὸν was
          one of the names the Platonists expressed him by; and good and God,
          are almost the same words in our language. All as readily consented in
          the notion of his goodness, as in that of his Deity. Whatsoever
          divisions or disputes there were among them in the other perfections
          of God, they all agreed in this without dispute, saith Synesius. One
          calls him Venus, in regard of his loveliness.952 Another calls him
          Ἐρώτα love, as being the band which ties all things together.953 No
          perfection of the Divine nature is more eminently, nor more speedily
          visible in the whole book of the creation, than this. His greatness
          shines not in any part of it, where his goodness doth not as
          gloriously glister: whatsoever is the instrument of his work, as his
          power; whatsoever is the orderer of his work, as his wisdom; yet
          nothing can be adored as the motive of his work, but the goodness of
          his nature. This only could induce him to resolve to create: his
          wisdom then steps in, to dispose the methods of what he resolved; and
          his power follows to execute, what his wisdom hath disposed, and his
          goodness designed. His power in making, and his wisdom in ordering,
          are subservient to his goodness; and this goodness, which is the end
          of the creation, is as visible to the eyes of men, as legible to the
          understanding of men, as his power in forming them, and his wisdom in
          tuning them. And as the book of creation, so the records of his
          government must needs acquaint them with a great part of it, when they
          have often beheld him, stretching out his hand, to supply the
          indigent, relieve the oppressed, and punish the oppressors, and give
          them, in their distresses, what might “fill their hearts with food and
          gladness.” It is this the apostle (Rom. i. 20, 21), means by his
          Godhead, which he links with his eternity and power, as clearly seen
          in the things that are made, as in a pure glass, “For the invisible
          things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
          understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
          Godhead.” The Godhead which comprehends the whole nature of God as
          discoverable to his creatures, was not known, yea, was impossible to
          be known, by the works of creation. There had been nothing then
          reserved to be manifested in Christ: but his goodness, which is
          properly meant there by his Godhead, was as clearly visible as his
          power. The apostle upbraids them with their unthankfulness, and argues
          their inexcusableness, because the arm of his power in creation made
          no due impression of fear upon their spirits, nor the beams of his
          goodness wrought in them sufficient sentiments of gratitude. Their not
          glorifying God, was a contempt of the former; and their not being
          thankful, was a slight of the latter. God is the object of honor, as
          he is powerful, and the object of thankfulness properly as he is
          bountiful. All the idolatry of the heathens, is a clear testimony of
          their common sentiment of the goodness of God: since the more
          eminently useful any person was in some advantageous invention for the
          benefit of mankind, they thought he merited a rank in the number of
          their deities. The Italians esteemed Pythagoras a god, because he was
          φιλανθρωπότατος:954 to be good and useful, was an approximation to the
          Divine nature. Hence it was, that when the Lystrians saw a resemblance
          of the Divine goodness in the charitable and miraculous cure of one of
          their crippled citizens, presently they mistook Paul and Barnabas for
          gods, and inferred from thence their right to divine worship,
          inquiring into nothing else but the visible character of their
          goodness and usefulness, to capacitate them for the honor of a
          sacrifice (Acts xiv. 8‒11). Hence it was, that they adored those
          creatures that were a common benefit, as the sun and moon, which must
          be founded upon a pre‑existent notion, not only of a Being, but of the
          bounty and goodness of God, which was naturally implanted in them, and
          legible in all God’s works. And the more beneficial anything was to
          them, and the more sensible advantages they received from it, the
          higher station they gave it in the rank of their idols, and bestowed
          upon it a more solemn worship: an absurd mistake to think everything
          that was sensibly good to them, to be God, clothing himself in such a
          form to be adored by them. And upon this account the Egyptians
          worshipped God under the figure of an ox; and the East Indians, in
          some parts of their country, deify a heifer, intimating the goodness
          of God, as their nourisher and preserver, in giving them corn, whereof
          the ox is an instrument in serving for ploughing, and preparing the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The notion of goodness is inseparable from the notion of a God. We
          cannot own the existence of God, but we must confess also the goodness
          of his nature. Hence, the apostle gives to his goodness the title of
          his Godhead, as if goodness and godhead were convertible terms (Rom.
          i. 20). As it is indissolubly linked with the being of a Deity, so it
          cannot be severed from the notion of it: we as soon undeify him by
          denying him good, as by denying him great: Optimus, Maximus, the best,
          greatest, was the name whereby the Romans entitled Him. His nature is
          as good, as it is majestic; so doth the Psalmist join them (Ps. cxlv.
          6, 7), “I will declare my greatness; they shall abundantly utter the
          memory of thy great goodness.” They considered his goodness before his
          greatness, in putting Optimus before Maximus; greatness without
          sweetness, is an unruly and affrighting monster in the world; like a
          vast turbulent sea, always casting out mire and dirt. Goodness is the
          brightness and loveliness of our majestical Creator. To fancy a God
          without it, is to fancy a miserable, scanty, narrow‑hearted, savage
          God, and so an unlovely, and horrible being: for he is not a God that
          is not good; he is not a God that is not the highest good: infinite
          goodness is more necessary to, and more straitly joined with an
          infinite Deity, than infinite power and infinite wisdom: we cannot
          conceive him God, unless we conceive him the highest good, having
          nothing superior to himself in goodness, as he hath nothing superior
          to himself in excellency and perfection. No man can possibly form a
          notion of God in his mind, and yet form a notion of something better
          than God; for whoever thinks anything better than God, fancieth a God
          with some defect: by how much the better he thinks that thing to be,
          by so much the more imperfect he makes God in his thoughts. This
          notion of the goodness of God was so natural, that some philosophers
          and others, being startled at the evil they saw in the world, fancied,
          besides a good God, an evil principle, the author of all punishments
          in the world. This was ridiculous; for those two must be of equal
          power, or one inferior to the other; if equal, the good could do
          nothing, but the evil one would restrain him; and the evil one could
          do nothing, but the good one would contradict him; so they would be
          always contending, and never conquering: if one were inferior to the
          other, then there would be nothing but what that superior ordered.
          Good, if the good one were superior; and nothing but evil, if the bad
          one were superior. In the prosecution of this, let us see.

          I. What this goodness is. II. Some propositions concerning the nature
          of it. III. That God is good. IV. The manifestation of it in creation,
          providence, and redemption. V. The use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. What this goodness is. There is a goodness of being, which is the
          natural perfection of a thing; there is the goodness of will, which is
          the holiness, and righteousness of a person; there is the goodness of
          the hand, which we call liberality, or beneficence, a doing good to
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We mean not by this, the goodness of his essence, or the perfection
          of his nature. God is thus good, because his nature is infinitely
          perfect; he hath all things requisite to the completing of a most
          perfect and sovereign Being. All good meets in his essence, as all
          water meets in the ocean. Under this notion all the attributes of God,
          which are requisite to so illustrious a Being, are comprehended. All
          things that are, have a goodness of being in them, derived to them by
          the power of God, as they are creatures; so the devil is good, as he
          is a creature of God’s making: he hath a natural goodness, but not a
          moral goodness: when he fell from God, he retained his natural
          goodness as a creature; because he did not cease to be, he was not
          reduced to that nothing, from whence he was drawn; but he ceased to be
          morally good, being stripped of his righteousness by his apostasy; as
          a creature, he was God’s work; as a creature, he remains still God’s
          work; and, therefore, as a creature, remains still good, in regard of
          his created being. The more of being anything hath, the more of this
          sort of natural goodness it hath; and so the devil hath more of this
          natural goodness than men have; because he hath more marks of the
          excellency of God upon him, in regard of the greatness of his
          knowledge, and the extent of his power, the largeness of his capacity,
          and the acuteness of his understanding, which are natural perfections
          belonging to the nature of an angel, though he hath lost his moral
          perfections. God is sovereignly and infinitely good in this sort of
          goodness. He is unsearchably perfect (Job xi. 7); nothing is wanting
          to his essence, that is necessary to the perfection of it; yet this is
          not that which the Scripture expresseth under the term of goodness,
          but a perfection of God’s nature as related to us, and which he
          poureth forth upon all his creatures, as goodness which flows from
          this natural perfection of the Deity.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Nor is it the same with the blessedness of God, but something
          flowing from his blessedness. Were he not first infinitely blessed,
          and full in himself, he could not be infinitely good and diffusive to
          us; had he not an infinite abundance in his own nature, he could not
          be overflowing to his creatures; had not the sun a fulness of light in
          itself, and the sea a vastness of water, the one could not enrich the
          world with its beams, nor the other fill every creek with its waters.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Nor is it the same with the holiness of God. The holiness of God is
          the rectitude of his nature, whereby he is pure, and without spot in
          himself; the goodness of God is the efflux of his will, whereby he is
          beneficial to his creatures: the holiness of God is manifest in his
          rational creatures; but the goodness of God extends to all the works
          of his hands. His holiness beams most in his law; his goodness
          reacheth to everything that had a being from him (Ps. cxlv. 9): “The
          Lord is good to all.” And though he be said in the same Psalm (ver.
          17) to be “holy in all his works,” it is to be understood of his
          bounty, bountiful in all his works; the Hebrew word signifying both
          holy and liberal, and the margin of the Bible reads it “merciful” or
          “bountiful.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Nor is this goodness of God the same with the mercy of God.
          Goodness extends to more objects than mercy; goodness stretcheth
          itself out to all the works of his hands; mercy extends only to a
          miserable object; for it is joined with a sentiment of pity,
          occasioned by the calamity of another. The mercy of God is exercised
          about those that merit punishment; the goodness of God is exercised
          upon objects that have not merited anything contrary to the acts of
          his bounty. Creation is an act of goodness, not of mercy; providence
          in governing some part of the world, is an act of goodness, not of
          mercy.955 The heavens, saith Austin, need the goodness of God to
          govern them, but not the mercy of God to relieve them; the earth is
          full of the misery of man, and the compassions of God; but the heavens
          need not the mercy of God to pity them, because they are not
          miserable; though they need the goodness and power of God to sustain
          them; because, as creatures, they are impotent without him. God’s
          goodness extends to the angels, that kept their standing, and to man
          in innocence, who in that state stood not in need of mercy. Goodness
          and mercy are distinct, though mercy be a branch of goodness; there
          may be a manifestation of goodness, though none of mercy. Some think
          Christ had been incarnate, had not man fallen: had it been so, there
          had been a manifestation of goodness to our nature, but not of mercy,
          because sin had not made our natures miserable. The devils are
          monuments of God’s creating goodness, but not of his pardoning
          compassions. The grace of God respects the rational creature; mercy
          the miserable creature; goodness all his creatures, brutes, and the
          senseless plants, as well as reasonable man.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. By goodness, is meant the bounty of God. This is the notion of
          goodness in the world; when we say a good man, we mean either a holy
          man in his life, or a charitable and liberal man in the management of
          his goods. A righteous man, and a good man, are distinguished (Rom. v.
          7). “For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet for a good man
          one would even dare to die;” for an innocent man, one as innocent of
          the crime as himself would scarce venture his life; but for a good
          man, a liberal, tender‑hearted man, that had been a common good in the
          place where he lived, or had done another as great a benefit as life
          itself amounts to, a man out of gratitude might dare to die. “The
          goodness of God is his inclination to deal well and bountifully with
          his creatures.”956 It is that whereby he wills there should be
          something besides himself for his own glory. God is good himself, and
          to himself, i. e. highly amiable to himself; and, therefore, some
          define it a perfection of God, whereby he loves himself and his own
          excellency; but as it stands in relation to his creatures, it is that
          perfection of God whereby he delights in his works, and is beneficial
          to them. God is the highest goodness, because he doth not act for his
          own profit, but for his creatures’ welfare, and the manifestation of
          his own goodness. He sends out his beams, without receiving any
          addition to himself, or substantial advantage from his creatures. It
          is from this perfection that he loves whatsoever is good, and that is
          whatsoever he hath made, “for every creature of God is good” (1 Tim.
          iv. 4); every creature hath some communications from him, which cannot
          be without some affection to them; every creature hath a footstep of
          Divine goodness upon it; God, therefore, loves that goodness in the
          creature, else he would not love himself. God hates no creature, no,
          not the devils and damned, as creatures; he is not an enemy to them,
          as they are the works of his hands; he is properly an enemy, that doth
          simply and absolutely wish evil to another; but God doth not
          absolutely wish evil to the damned; that justice that he inflicts upon
          them, the deserved punishment of their sin, is part of his goodness,
          as shall afterwards be shown.957 This is the most pleasant perfection
          of the Divine nature; his creating power amazes us; his conducting
          wisdom astonisheth us; his goodness, as furnishing us with all
          conveniences, delights us; and renders both his amazing power, and
          astonishing wisdom, delightful to us. As the sun, by effecting things,
          is an emblem of God’s power; by discovering things to us, is an emblem
          of his wisdom; but by refreshing and comforting us, is an emblem of
          his goodness; and without this refreshing virtue it communicates to
          us, we should take no pleasure in the creatures it produceth, nor in
          the beauties it discovers. As God is great and powerful, he is the
          object of our understanding; but as good and bountiful, he is the
          object of our love and desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The goodness of God comprehends all his attributes. All the acts of
          God are nothing else but the effluxes of his goodness, distinguished
          by several names, according to the objects it is exercised about. As
          the sea, though it be one mass of water, yet we distinguish it by
          several names, according to the shores it washeth, and beats upon; as
          the British and German Ocean, though all be one sea. When Moses longed
          to see his glory, God tells him, he would give him a prospect of his
          goodness (Ex. xxxiii. 19): “I will make all my goodness to pass before
          thee.” His goodness is his glory and Godhead, as much as is
          delightfully visible to his creatures, and whereby he doth benefit
          man: “I will cause my goodness,” or “comeliness,” as Calvin renders
          it, “to pass before thee;” what is this, but the train of all his
          lovely perfections springing from his goodness? the whole catalogue of
          mercy, grace, long‑suffering, abundance of truth, summed up in this
          one word (Ex. xxxiv. 6). All are streams from this fountain; he could
          be none of this, were he not first good. When it confers happiness
          without merit, it is grace; when it bestows happiness against merit,
          it is mercy; when he bears with provoking rebels, it is
          long‑suffering; when he performs his promise, it is truth; when it
          meets with a person to whom it is not obliged, it is grace; when he
          meets with a person in the world, to which he hath obliged himself by
          promise, it is truth;958 when it commiserates a distressed person, it
          is pity; when it supplies an indigent person, it is bounty; when it
          succors an innocent person, it is righteousness; and when it pardons a
          penitent person, it is mercy; all summed up in this one name of
          goodness; and the Psalmist expresseth the same sentiment in the same
          words (Ps. cxlv. 7, 8): “They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy
          great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. The Lord is
          gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy;
          the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over his works.”
          He is first good, and then compassionate. Righteousness is often in
          Scripture taken, not for justice, but charitableness; this attribute,
          saith one,959 is so full of God, that it doth deify all the rest, and
          verify the adorableness of him. His wisdom might contrive against us,
          his power bear too hard upon us; one might be too hard for an
          ignorant, and the other too mighty for an impotent creature; his
          holiness would scare an impure and guilty creature, but his goodness
          conducts them all for us, and makes them all amiable to us; whatever
          comeliness they have in the eye of a creature, whatever comfort they
          afford to the heart of a creature, we are obliged for all to his
          goodness. This puts all the rest upon a delightful exercise; this
          makes his wisdom design for us, and this makes his power to act for
          us; this veils his holiness from affrighting us, and this spirits his
          mercy to relieve us: all his acts towards man, are but the workmanship
          of this.960 What moved him at first to create the world out of
          nothing, and erect so noble a creature as man, endowed with such
          excellent gifts; was it not his goodness? what made him separate his
          Son to be a sacrifice for us, after we had endeavored to rase out the
          first marks of his favor; was it not a strong bubbling of goodness?
          What moves him to reduce a fallen creature to the due sense of his
          duty, and at last bring him to an eternal felicity; is it not, only
          his goodness? This is the captain attribute that leads the rest to
          act. This attends them, and spirits them in all his ways of acting.
          This is the complement and perfection of all his works; had it not
          been for this, which set all the rest on work, nothing of his wonders
          had been seen in creation, nothing of his compassions had been seen in
          redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thing is, some propositions to explain the nature of
          this goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He is good by his own essence. God is not only good in his essence,
          but good by his essence; the essence of “every created being is good;”
          so the unerring God pronounced everything which he had made (Gen. i.
          31). The essence of the worst creatures, yea, of the impure and savage
          devils, is good; but they are not good per essentiam, for then they
          could not be bad, malicious, and oppressive. God is good, as he is
          God; and therefore good by himself, and from himself, not by
          participation from another; he made everything good, but none made him
          good; since his goodness was not received from another, he is good by
          his own nature. He could not receive it from the things he created,
          they are later than he; since they received all from him, they could
          bestow nothing on him; and no God preceded him, in whose inheritance
          and treasures of goodness, he could be a successor; he is absolutely
          his own goodness, he needed none to make him good; but all things
          needed him, to be good by him. Creatures are good by being made so by
          him, and cleaving to him; he is good without cleaving to any goodness
          without him. Goodness is not a quality in him, but a nature; not a
          habit added to his essence, but his essence itself; he is not first
          God, and then afterwards good; but he is good as he is God; his
          essence, being one and the same, is formally and equally God and
          good.961 Αὐτάγαθον, “good of himself,” was one of the names the
          Platonists gave him. He is essentially good in his own nature, and not
          by any outward action which follows his essence. He is an independent
          Being, and hath nothing of goodness or happiness from anything without
          him, or anything he doth act about. If he were not good by his
          essence, he could not be eternally good, he could not be the first
          good; he would have something before him, from whence he derived that
          goodness wherewith he is possessed; nor could he be perfectly good,
          for he could not be equally good to that from whom he derived his
          goodness; no star, no splendid body, that derives light from the sun,
          doth equal that sun by which it is enlightened. Hence his goodness
          must be infinite, and circumscribed by no limits; the exercise of his
          goodness may be limited by himself; but his goodness, the principle,
          cannot; for since his essence is infinite, and his goodness is not
          distinguished from his essence, it is infinite also; if it were
          limited, it were finite; he cannot be bounded by anything without him;
          if so, then he were not God, because he would have something superior
          to him, to put bars in his way; if there were anything to fix him, it
          must be a good or evil being; good it cannot be, for it is the
          property of goodness to encourage goodness, not to bound it; evil it
          cannot be, for then it would extinguish goodness, as well as limit it;
          it would not be content with the circumscribing it, without destroying
          it; for it is the nature of every contrary, to endeavor the
          destruction of its opposite. He is essentially good by his own
          essence; therefore, good of himself; therefore, eternally good; and
          therefore, abundantly good.

        <p>
          2. God is the prime and chief goodness. Being good per se, and by his
          own essence, he must needs be the chief goodness, in whom there can be
          nothing but good, from whom there can proceed nothing but good, to
          whom all good whatsoever must be referred, as the final cause of all
          good. As he is the chief Being, so he is the chief good; and as we
          rise by steps from the existence of created things, to acknowledge one
          Supreme Being, which is God, so we mount by steps from the
          consideration of the goodness of created things, to acknowledge one
          Infinite Ocean of sovereign goodness, whence the streams of created
          goodness are derived. When we behold things that partake of goodness
          from another, we must acquiesce in one that hath goodness by
          participation from no other, but originally from himself, and
          therefore supremely in himself above all other things: so that, as
          nothing greater and more majestic can be imagined, so also nothing
          better and more excellent can be conceived than God. Nothing can add
          to him, or make him better than he is; nothing can detract from him,
          to make him worse; nothing can be added to him, nothing can be severed
          from him; no created good can render him more excellent; no evil, from
          any creature, can render him less excellent; “our goodness extends not
          to him” (Ps. xvi. 2); “wickedness may hurt a man, as we are, and our
          righteousness may profit the son of man; but, if we be righteous, what
          give we to Him, or what receives he at our hands” (Job xxxv. 7, 8)? as
          he hath no superior in place above him, so, being chief of all, he
          cannot be made better by any inferior to him. How can he be made
          better by any that hath from himself all that he hath? The goodness of
          a creature may be changed, but the goodness of the Creator is
          immutable; he is always like himself, so good that he cannot be evil,
          as he is so blessed that he cannot be miserable. Nothing is good but
          God, because nothing is of itself but God; as all things, being from
          nothing, are nothing in comparison of God, so all things, being from
          nothing, are scanty and evil in comparison of God. If anything had
          been, ex Deo, God being the matter of it, it had been as good as God
          is; but since the principle, whence all things were drawn, was
          nothing, though the efficient cause by which they were extracted from
          nothing was God, they are as nothing in goodness, and not estimable in
          comparison of God (Ps. lxxiii. 25): “Whom have I in heaven but thee?”
          &amp;c. God is all good; every creature hath a distinct variety of
          goodness: God distinctly pronounced every day’s work in the creation
          “good.” Food communicates the goodness of its nourishing virtue to our
          bodies; flowers the goodness of their odors to our smell; every
          creature a goodness of comeliness to our sight; plants the goodness of
          healing qualities for our cure; and all derive from themselves a
          goodness of knowledge, objectively to our understandings. The sun, by
          one sort of goodness, warms us; metals enrich us; living creatures
          sustain us, and delight us by another; all those have distinct kinds
          of goodness, which are eminently summed up in God, and are all but
          parts of his immense goodness. It is he that enlightens us by his sun,
          nourisheth us by bread (Matt. iv. 4): “It is not by bread alone that
          we live, but by the word of God.” It is all but his own supreme
          goodness, conveyed to us through those varieties of conduit‑pipes.
          “God is all good;” other things are good in their kind; as, a good
          man, a good angel, a good tree, a good plant; but God hath a good of
          all kinds eminently in his nature. He is no less all‑good, than he is
          almighty, and all‑knowing; as the sun contains in it all the light,
          and more light than is in all the clearest bodies in the world, so
          doth God contain in himself all the good, and more good than is in the
          richest creatures. Nothing is good, but as it resembles him; as
          nothing is hot, but as it resembles fire, the prime subject of heat.
          God is omnipotent, therefore no good can be wanting to him. If he were
          destitute of any which he could not have, he were not almighty: he is
          so good, that there is no mixture of anything which can be called not
          good in him; everything besides him wants some good, which others
          have. Nothing can be so evil as God is good. There can be no evil but
          there is some mixture of good with it; no nature so evil but there is
          some spark of goodness in it: but God is a good which hath no taint of
          evil; nothing can be so supreme an evil as God is supreme goodness. He
          is only good, without capacity of increase; he is all good, and
          unmixedly good; none good but God: a goodness, like the sun, that hath
          all light, and no darkness. That is the second thing; he is the
          supreme and chief goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This goodness is communicative. None so communicatively good as
          God. As the notion of God includes goodness, so the notion of goodness
          includes diffusiveness; without goodness he would cease to be a Deity,
          and without diffusiveness he would cease to be good. The being good is
          necessary to the being God; for goodness is nothing else, in the
          notion of it, but a strong inclination to do good; either to find or
          make an object, wherein to exercise itself, according to the
          propension of its own nature; and it is an inclination of
          communicating itself, not for its own interest, but the good of the
          object it pitcheth upon. Thus God is good by nature; and his nature is
          not without activity; he acts conveniently to his own nature (Ps.
          cxix. 68): “Thou art good, and dost good.” And nothing accrues to him,
          by the communications of himself to others, since his blessedness was
          as great before the frame of any creature as ever it was since the
          erecting of the world; so that the goodness of Christ himself
          increaseth not the lustre of his happiness (Ps. xvi. 2): “My goodness
          extends not to thee.” He is not of a niggardly and envious nature; he
          is too rich to have any cause to envy, and too good to have any will
          to envy; he is as liberal as he is rich, according to the capacity of
          the object about which his goodness is exercised. The Divine goodness,
          being the supreme goodness, is goodness in the highest degree of
          activity; not an idle, enclosed, pent up goodness, as a spring shut
          up, or a fountain sealed, bubbling up within itself, but bubbling out
          of itself: a fountain of gardens to water every part of his creation;
          “He is an ointment poured forth” (Cant. i. 3): nothing spreads itself
          more than oil, and takes up a larger space wheresoever it drops. It
          may be no less said of the goodness of God, as it is of the fulness of
          Christ (Eph. i. 23); “He fills all in all:” he fills rational
          creatures with understanding, sensitive nature with vigor and motion,
          the whole world with beauty and sweetness. Every taste, every touch of
          a creature, is a taste and touch of Divine goodness. Divine goodness
          offers itself in one spark in this creature, in another spark in the
          other creature, and altogether make up a goodness inconceivable by any
          creature. The whole mass, and extracted spirit of it, is infinitely
          short of the goodness of the Divine nature, imperfect shadows of that
          goodness which is in himself. Indeed, the more excellent anything is,
          the more nobly it acts; how remotely doth light, that excellent
          brightness of the creation, disperse itself! How doth that glorious
          creature, which God hath set in the heavens, spread its wings over
          heaven and earth, roll itself about the world, cast its beams upward
          and downward, insinuate into all corners, pierce the depths, and shoot
          up its rays into the heights, encircle the higher and lower creatures
          in its arms, reach out its communications to influence everything
          under the earth, as well as dart its beams of light and heat on things
          above, or upon the earth! “Nothing is hid from it” (Ps. xix. 6); not
          from its power, nor from its sweetness. How communicative also is
          water, a necessary and excellent creature! How active is it in a
          river, to nourish the living creatures engendered in its womb!
          refresheth every shore it runs by; promotes the propagation of fruits
          for the nourishment, and bestows a verdure upon the ground, for the
          delight of man; and where it cannot reach the higher ground in its
          substance, it doth by its vapors, mounted up and concocted by the sun,
          and gently distilled upon the earth, for the opening its womb to bring
          forth its fruits. God is more prone to communicate himself, than the
          sun to spread its wings, or the earth to mount up its fruits, or the
          water to multiply living creatures.962 Goodness is his nature. Hence
          were there internal communications of himself from eternity;
          diffusions of himself, without himself, in time, in the creation of
          the world, like a full vessel running over. He created the world that
          he might impart his goodness to something without him, and diffuse
          larger measures of his goodness, after he had laid the first
          foundation of it in his being; and therefore he created several sorts
          of creatures, that they might be capable of various and distinct
          measures of his liberality, according to the distinct capacities of
          their nature, but imparted most to the rational creature, because that
          is only capable of an understanding to know him, and will to embrace
          him. He is the highest goodness, and therefore a communicative
          goodness, and acts excellently according to his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God is necessarily good. None is necessarily good but God; he is as
          necessarily good, as he is necessarily God. His goodness is as
          inseparable from his nature as his holiness. He is good by nature, not
          only by will; as he is holy by nature, not only by will, he is good in
          his nature, and good in his actions; and as he cannot be bad in his
          nature, so he cannot be bad in his communications; he can no more act
          contrary to this goodness in any of his actions, than he can un‑God
          himself. It is not necessary that God should create a world; he was at
          his own choice whether he would create or no; but when he resolves to
          make a world, it is necessary that he should make it good, because he
          is goodness itself, and cannot act against his own nature. He could
          not create anything without goodness in the very act; the very act of
          creation, or communicating being to anything without himself, is in
          itself an act of goodness, as well as an act of power; had he not been
          good in himself, nothing could have been endued with any goodness by
          him. In the act of giving being, he is liberal; the being he bestows
          is a displaying his own liberality; he could not confer what he needs
          not, and which could not be deserved, without being bountiful; since
          what was nothing, could not merit to be brought into being, the very
          act of giving to nothing a being, was an act of choice goodness. He
          could not create anything without goodness as the motive, and the
          necessary motive; his goodness could not necessitate him to make the
          world, but his goodness could only move him to resolve to make a
          world; he was not bound to erect and fashion it because of his
          goodness, but he could not frame it without his goodness as the moving
          cause. He could not create anything, but he must create it good. It
          had been inconsistent with the supreme goodness of his nature, to have
          created only murderous, ravenous, injurious creatures; to have created
          a bedlam rather than a world: a mere heap of confusion would have been
          as inconsistent with his Divine goodness, as with his Divine wisdom.
          Again, when his goodness had moved him to make a creature, his
          goodness would necessarily move him to be beneficial to his creature;
          not that this necessity results from any merit in the creature, which
          he had framed; but from the excellency and diffusiveness of his own
          nature, and his own glory; the end for which he formed it, which would
          have been obscure, yea, nothing, without some degrees of his bounty.
          What occasion of acknowledgments and praise could the creature have
          for its being, if God had given him only a miserable being, while it
          was innocent in action? The goodness of God would not suffer him to
          make a creature, without providing conveniences for it, so long as he
          thought good to maintain its being, and furnishing it with that which
          was necessary to answer that end for which he created it; and his own
          nature would not suffer him to be unkind to his rational creature,
          while it was innocent. It had been injustice to inflict evil upon the
          creature, that had not offended, and had no relation to an offending
          creature; the nature of God could not have brought forth such an act:
          and, therefore, some say, that God, after he had created man, could
          not presently annihilate him, and take away his life and being.963 As
          a sovereign, he might do it; as Almighty, he was able to do it, as
          well as create him; but in regard of his goodness, he could not
          morally do it: for had he annihilated man as soon as ever he had made
          him, he had not made man for himself, and for his own glory; to be
          loved, worshipped, sought, and acknowledged by him. He would not then
          have been the end of man; he had created him in vain, and the world in
          vain, which he assures us he did not (Isa. xlv. 18, 19). And,
          certainly, if the gifts of God be without repentance, man could not
          have been annihilated after his creation, without repentance in God,
          without any cause, had not sin entered into the world. If God did not
          say to man, after sin had made its entrance into the world, “Seek ye
          me in vain,” he could not, because of his goodness, have said so to
          man in his innocence. As God is necessarily mind, so he is necessarily
          will; as he is necessarily knowing, so he is necessarily loving. He
          could not be blessed, if he did not know himself, and his own
          perfection; nor good, if he did not delight in himself, and his own
          perfections. And this goodness whereby he delights in himself, is the
          source of his delight in his creatures, wherein he sees the footsteps
          of himself. If he loves himself, he cannot but love the resemblance of
          himself, and the image of his own goodness. He loves himself, because
          he is the highest goodness and excellency; and loves everything as it
          resembles himself, because it is an efflux of his own goodness; and as
          he doth necessarily love himself, and his own excellency, so he doth
          necessarily love anything that resembles that excellency, which is the
          primary object of his esteem. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Though he be necessarily good, yet he is also freely good. The
          necessity of the goodness of his nature hinders not the liberty of his
          actions; the matter of his acting is not at all necessary, but the
          manner of his acting in a good and bountiful way, is necessary, as
          well as free.964 He created the world and man freely, because he might
          choose whether he would create it, but he created them good
          necessarily, because he was first necessarily good in his nature,
          before he was freely a Creator. When he created man, he freely gave
          him a positive law, but necessarily a wise and righteous law; because
          he was necessarily wise, and righteous, before he was freely a
          Lawgiver. When he makes a promise, he freely lets the word go out of
          his lips, but when he hath made it, he is necessarily a faithful
          performer; because he was necessarily true and righteous in his
          nature, before he was freely a promiser. God is necessarily good in
          his nature, but free in his communications of it; to make him
          necessarily to communicate his goodness in the first creation of the
          creature, would render him but impotent, good without liberty and
          without will; if the communications of it be not free, the eternity of
          the world must necessarily be concluded, which some anciently asserted
          from the naturalness of God’s goodness, making the world flow from God
          as light from the sun. God, indeed, is necessarily good, affectivé in
          regard of his nature, but freely good, affectivé, in regard of the
          effluxes of it to this or that particular subject he pitcheth on. He
          is not so necessarily communicative of his goodness as the sun of his
          light, or a tree of its cooling shade, that chooseth not its objects,
          but enlightens all indifferently, without any variation or
          distinction; this were to make God of no more understanding than the
          sun, to shine not where it pleaseth, but where it must. He is an
          understanding agent, and hath a sovereign right to choose his own
          subjects; it would not be a supreme goodness, if it were not a
          voluntary goodness. It is agreeable to the nature of the highest good,
          to be absolutely free, to dispense his goodness in what methods and
          measures he pleaseth, according to the free determinations of his own
          will, guided by the wisdom of his mind, and regulated by the holiness
          of his nature. He is not to “give an account of any of his matters”
          (Job xxxiii. 13); “He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
          he will have compassion on whom he will have compassion” (Rom. ix.
          15); and he will be good, to whom he will be good; when he doth act,
          he cannot but act well, so it is necessary; yet he may act this good
          or that good, to this or that degree, so it is free. As it is the
          perfection of his nature, it is necessary; as it is the communication
          of his bounty, it is voluntary. The eye cannot but see if it be open,
          yet it may glance upon this or that color, fix upon this or that
          object, as it is conducted by the will. God necessarily loves himself,
          because he is good, yet not by constraint, but freedom; because his
          affection to himself is from a knowledge of himself. He necessarily
          loves his own image, because it is his image; yet freely, because not
          blindly, but from motions of understanding and will. What necessity
          could there be upon him, to resolve to communicate his goodness? It
          could not be to make himself better by it, for he had a goodness
          incapable of any addition; he confers a goodness on his creatures, but
          reaps not a harvest of goodness to his own essence from his creatures.
          What obligation could there be from the creature, to confer a goodness
          on him to this or that degree, for this or that duration? If he had
          not created a man, nor angel, he had done them no wrong; if he had
          given them only a simple being, he had manifested a part of his
          goodness, without giving them a right to challenge any more of him; if
          he had taken away their beings after a time when he had answered his
          end, he had done them no injury: for what law obliged him to enrich
          them, and leave them in that being wherein he had invested them, but
          his sole goodness? Whatever sparks of goodness any creature hath, are
          the free effusions of God’s bounty, the offspring of his own
          inclination to do well, the simple favor of the donor; not purchased,
          not merited by the creature. God is as unconstrained in his liberty,
          in all his communications, as infinite in his goodness, the fountain
          of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This goodness is communicative with the greatest pleasure. Moses
          desired to see his glory, God assures him he should see his goodness
          (Exod. xxxiii. 18, 19); intimating that his goodness is his glory, and
          his glory his delight also. He sends not forth his blessings with an
          ill will; he doth not stay till they are squeezed from him; he
          prevents men with his blessings of goodness (Ps. xxi. 3); he is most
          delighted when he is most diffusive; and his pleasure in bestowing, is
          larger than his creature’s in possessing. He is not covetous of his
          own treasures. He lays up his goodness in order to laying it out with
          a complacency wholly divine. The jealousy princes have of their
          subjects makes them sparing of their gifts, for fear of giving them
          materials for rebellion: God’s foresight of the ill use men would make
          of his benefits damped him not in bestowing his largesses. He is
          incapable of envy; his own happiness can no more be diminished, than
          it can be increased. None can over‑top him in goodness, because
          nothing hath any good but what is derived from him; his gifts are
          without repentance: sorrow hath no footing in him, who is infinitely
          happy, as well as infinitely good. Goodness and envy are inconsistent.
          How unjustly, then, did the devil accuse God! What God gives out of
          goodness, he gives with joy and gladness. He did not only will that we
          should be, but rejoice that he had brought us into being; he rejoiced
          in his works (Ps. civ. 31), and his wisdom stood by him, “delighting
          in the habitable parts of the earth” (Prov. viii. 31). He beheld the
          world after its creation with a complacency, and still governs it with
          the same pleasure wherewith he reviewed it. Infinite cheerfulness
          attends infinite goodness. He would not give, if he had not a pleasure
          that others should enjoy his goodness; since he is better than
          anything, and more communicative than anything; he is more joyful in
          giving out, than the sun can be to run its race, in pouring forth
          light. He is said only to repent, and grieve, when men answer not the
          obligations and ends of his goodness; which would be their own
          felicity, as well as his glory. Though he doth not force greater
          degrees of his goodness upon those that neglect it, yet he denies them
          not to those that solicit him for it: it is always greater pleasure to
          him to impart upon the importunities of the creatures, than it is to a
          mother to reach out her breast to her crying and longing infant. He is
          not wearied by the solicitations of men; he is pleased with their
          prayers, because he is pleased with the imparting of his own goodness:
          he seems to be in travail with it, longing to be delivered of it into
          the lap of his creature. He is as much delighted with petitions for
          his liberality in bestowing his best goodness, as princes are weary of
          the craving of their subjects. None can be so desirous to squeeze
          those that are under them, as God is delighted to enlarge his hand
          towards them. It is the nature of his goodness to be glad of men’s
          solicitations for it, because they are significant valuations of it,
          and therefore fit occasions for him to bestow it. Since he doth not
          delight in the unhappiness of any of his creatures, he certainly
          delights in what may conduce unto their felicity. He doth with the
          same delight multiply the effects of his goodness where his wisdom
          sees it convenient, as he beheld the first‑fruits of his goodness with
          a complacency upon laying the top‑stone of the creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The displaying of this goodness was the motive and end of all his
          works of creation and providence.965 God being infinitely wise, would
          not act without the highest reason, and for the highest end. The
          reason that induced him to create, must be of as great an eminency as
          himself: the motive could not be taken without him, because there was
          nothing but himself in being; it must be taken, therefore, from within
          himself, and from some one of those most excellent perfections whereby
          we conceive him. But, upon the exact consideration of all of them,
          none can seem to challenge that honor of being the motive of them, to
          resolve the setting forth any work, but his own goodness; this being
          the first thing manifest in his creation, seems to be the first thing
          moving him to a resolution to create. Wisdom may be considered as
          directing, power considered as acting, but it is natural to reflect
          upon goodness as moving the one to direct, and the other to act. Power
          was the principle of his action, wisdom the rule of his action,
          goodness the motive of his action; principle and rule are awakened by
          the motive, and subservient to the end. That which is the most amiable
          perfection in the Divine nature, and that which he first took notice
          of, as the footsteps of them, in the distinct view of every day’s
          work, and the general view of the whole frame, seems to claim the best
          right to be entitled the motive and end of his creation of things. God
          could have no end but himself, because there was nothing besides
          himself. Again, the end of every agent is that which he esteems good,
          and the best good for that kind of action: since nothing is to be
          esteemed good but God, nothing can be the ultimate end of God but
          himself, and his own goodness. What a man wills chiefly is his end;
          but God cannot will any other thing but himself as his end, because
          there is nothing superior to himself in goodness. He cannot will
          anything that supremely serves himself and his own goodness as his
          end; for, if he did, that which he wills must be superior to himself
          in goodness, and then he is not God; or inferior to him in goodness,
          and then he would not be righteous, in willing that which is a lower
          good before a higher. God cannot will anything as his end of acting,
          but himself, without undeifying himself. God’s will being infinitely
          good, cannot move for anything but what is infinitely good; and,
          therefore, whatsoever God made, he made for himself (Prov. xvi. 4),
          that whatsoever he made might bear a badge of this perfection upon it,
          and be a discovery of his wonderful goodness: for the making things
          for himself doth not signify any indigence in God, that he made
          anything to increase his excellency (for that is capable of no
          addition), but to manifest his excellency. God possessing everything
          eminently in himself, did not create the world for any need he had of
          it; finite things were unable to make any accession to that which is
          infinite. Man, indeed, builds a house to be a shelter to him against
          wind and weather, and makes clothes to secure him from cold, and
          plants gardens for his recreation and health. God is above all those
          little helps; he did not make the world for himself in such a kind,
          but for himself, i. e. the manifestation of himself and the riches of
          his nature; not to make himself blessed, but to discover his own
          blessedness to his creatures, and to communicate something of it to
          them. He did not garnish the world with so much bounty, that he might
          live more happily than he did before, but that his rational creatures
          might have fit conveniences. As the end for which God demands the
          performance of our duty is not for his own advantage, but for our good
          (Deut. x. 13), so the end why he conferred upon us the excellency of
          such a being was for our good, and the discovery of his goodness to
          us; for had not God created the world, he had been wholly unknown to
          any but himself; he produced creatures, that he might be known: as the
          sun shines not only to discover other things, but to be seen itself in
          its beauty and brightness. God would create things, because he would
          be known in his glory and liberality; hence is it that he created
          intellectual creatures, because without them the rest of the creation
          could not be taken notice of: it had been in some sort in vain; for no
          nature lower than an understanding nature, was able to know the marks
          of God in the creation, and acknowledge him as God. In this regard,
          God is good above all creatures, because he intends only to
          communicate his goodness in creation, not to acquire any goodness, or
          excellency from them, as men do in their framing of things. God is
          all, and is destitute of nothing, and, therefore, nothing accrues to
          him by the creation, but the acknowledgment of his goodness. This
          goodness, therefore, must be the motive and end of all his works.
        </p>
        <p>III. The third thing, that God is good.</p>
        <p>
          1. The more excellent anything is in nature, the more of goodness and
          kindness it hath. For we see more of love and kindness in creatures
          that are endued with sense, to their descendants, than in plants, that
          have only a principle of growth. Plants preserve their seeds whole
          that are enclosed in them; animals look to their young only after they
          are dropped from them; yet, after some time, take no more notice of
          them than of a stranger that never had any birth from them. But man,
          that hath a higher principle of reason, cherisheth his offspring, and
          gives them marks of his goodness while he lives, and leaves not the
          world at the time of his death without some testimonies of it: much
          more must God, who is a higher principle than sense or reason, be
          “good” and bountiful to all his offspring. The more perfect anything
          is, the more it doth communicate itself. The sun is more excellent
          than the stars, and, therefore, doth more sensibly, more extensively,
          disperse its liberal beams than the stars do. And the better any man
          is, the more charitable he is; God being the most excellent nature,
          having nothing more excellent than himself, because nothing more
          ancient than himself, who is the Ancient of Days: there is nothing,
          therefore, better and more bountiful than himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He is the cause of all created goodness; he must therefore himself
          be the Supreme Good. What good is in the heavens, is the product of
          some Being above the earth; and those varieties of goodness in the
          earth, and several creatures, are somewhere in their fulness and
          union: that, therefore, which possesses all those scattered goodnesses
          in their fulness, must be all good, all that good which is displayed
          in creatures; therefore sovereignly best. Whatsoever natural or moral
          goodness there is in the world, in angels, or men, or inferior
          creatures, is a line drawn from that centre, the bubblings of that
          fountain. God cannot but be better than all, since the goodness that
          is in creatures is the fruit of his own. If he were not good, he could
          produce no good: he could not bestow what he had not. If the creature
          be “good,” as the apostle says “every creature is” (1 Tim. iv. 4), he
          must needs be better than all, because they have nothing but what is
          derived to them from him; and much more goodness than all, because
          finite beings are not capable of receiving into them, and containing
          in themselves, all that goodness which is in an Infinite Being; when
          we search for good in creatures, they come short of that satisfaction
          which is in God (Ps. iv. 6). As the certainty of a first principle of
          all things, is necessarily concluded from the being of creatures, and
          the upholding and sustaining power and virtue of God is concluded from
          the mutability of those things in the world; whence we infer, that
          there must be some stable foundation of those tottering things, some
          firm hinge upon which those changeable things do move, without which
          there would be no stability in the kinds of things, no order, no
          agreement, or union among them: so from the goodness of everything,
          and their usefulness to us, we must conclude him good, who made all
          those things. And since we find distinct goodnesses in the creature,
          we must conclude that one principle whence they did flow, excels in
          the glory of goodness: all those little glimmerings of goodness which
          are scattered in the creatures, as the image in the glass, represent
          the face, posture, motion of him whose image it is, but not in the
          fulness of life and spirit, as in the original; it is but a shadow at
          the best, and speaks something more excellent in the copy. As God hath
          an infiniteness of being above them, so he hath a supremacy of
          goodness beyond them: what they have, is but a participation from him;
          what he hath, must be infinitely supereminent above them. If anything
          be good by itself, it must be infinitely good, it would set itself no
          bounds; we must make as many gods, as particulars of goodness in the
          world: but being good by the bounty of another, that from whence they
          flow must be the chief goodness. It is God’s excellency and goodness,
          which, like a beam, pierceth all things: he decks spirits with reason,
          endues matter with form, furnisheth everything with useful
          qualities.966 As one beam of the sun illustrates fire, water, earth;
          so one beam of God enlightens and endows minds, souls, and universal
          nature: nothing in the world had its goodness from itself, any more
          than it had its being from itself. The cause must be richer than the
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>But that which I intend is the defence of this goodness.</p>
        <p>
          First, The goodness of God is not impaired by suffering sin to enter
          into the world, and man to fall thereby. It is rather a testimony of
          God’s goodness, that he gave man an ability to be happy, than any
          charge against his goodness, that he settled man in a capacity to be
          evil. God was first a benefactor to man, before man could be a rebel
          against God. May it not be inquired, whether it had not been against
          the wisdom of God, to have made a rational creature with liberty, and
          not suffer him to act according to the nature he was endowed with, and
          to follow his own choice for some time? Had it been wisdom to frame a
          free creature, and totally to restrain that creature from following
          its liberty? Had it been goodness, as it were, to force the creature
          to be happy against its will? God’s goodness furnished Adam with a
          power to stand; was it contrary to his goodness, to leave Adam to a
          free use of that power? To make a creature, and not let that creature
          act according to the freedom of his nature, might have been thought to
          have been a blot upon his wisdom, and a constraint upon the creature,
          not to make use of that freedom of his nature, which the Divine
          goodness had bestowed upon him. To what purpose did God make a law, to
          govern his rational creature, and yet resolve that creature should not
          have his choice, whether he would obey it or no? Had he been really
          constrained to observe it, his observation of it could no more have
          been called obedience, than the acts of brutes that have a kind of
          natural constraint upon them by the instinct of their nature, can be
          called obedience: in vain had God endowed a creature with so great and
          noble a principle as liberty. Had it been goodness in God, after he
          had made a reasonable creature, to govern him in the same manner as he
          does brutes by a necessary instinct? It was the goodness of God to the
          nature of men and angels, to leave them in such a condition, to be
          able to give him a voluntary obedience, a nobler offering than the
          whole creation could present him with; and shall this goodness be
          undervalued, and accounted mean, because man made an ill use of it,
          and turned it into wantonness? As the unbelief of man doth not
          diminish the redeeming grace of God (Rom. iii. 3), so neither doth the
          fall of man lessen the creating goodness of God. Besides, why should
          the permission of sin be thought more a blemish to his goodness, than
          the providing a way of redemption for the destroying the works of sin
          and the devil, be judged the glory of it, whereby he discovered a
          goodness of grace that surpassed the bounds of nature? If this were a
          thing that might seem to obscure or deface the goodness of God, in the
          permission of the fall of angels and Adam, it was in order to bring
          forth a greater goodness in a more illustrious pomp, to the view of
          the world (Rom. xi. 32): “God hath concluded them all in unbelief,
          that he might have mercy upon all.” But if nothing could be alleged
          for the defence of his goodness in this, it were most comely for an
          ignorant creature not to impeach his goodness, but adore him in his
          proceedings, in the same language the apostle doth (ver. 33): “O the
          depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
          unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Nor is his goodness prejudiced, by not making all things the
          equal subjects of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is true all things are not subjects of an equal goodness. The
          goodness of God is not so illustriously manifested in one thing as
          another. In the creation he hath dropped goodness upon some, in giving
          them beings and sense, and poured it upon others in endowing them with
          understanding and reason. The sun is full of light, but it hath a want
          of sense; brutes excel in the vigor of sense, but they are destitute
          of the light of reason; man hath a mind and reason conferred on him,
          but he hath neither the acuteness of mind, nor the quickness of motion
          equal with an angel. In providence also he doth give abundance, and
          opens his hand to some; to others he is more sparing: he gives greater
          gifts of knowledge to some, while he lets others remain in ignorance;
          he strikes down some, and raiseth others; he afflicts some with a
          continual pain, while he blesseth others with an uninterrupted health;
          he hath chosen one nation wherein to set up his gospel sun, and leaves
          another benighted in their own ignorance. “Known was God in Judea;
          they were a peculiar people alone of all the nations of the earth”
          (Deut. xiv. 2). He was not equally good to the angels: he held forth
          his hand to support some in their happy habitation, while he suffered
          others to sink in irreparable ruin; and he is not so diffusive here of
          his goodness to his own as he will be in heaven. Here their sun is
          sometimes clouded, but there all clouds and shades will be blown away,
          and melted into nothing: instead of drops here, there will be above
          rivers of life. Is any creature destitute of the open marks of his
          goodness, though all are not enriched with those signal characters
          which he vouchsafes to others? He that is unerring, pronounced
          everything good distinctly in its production, and the whole good in
          its universal perfection (Gen. i. 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). Though
          he made not all things equally good, yet he made nothing evil; and
          though one creature in regard of its nature may be better than
          another, yet an inferior creature, in regard of its usefulness in the
          order of the creation, may be better than a superior. The earth hath a
          goodness in bringing forth fruits, and the waters in the sea a
          goodness in multiplying food. That any of us have a being is goodness;
          that we have not so healthful a being as others is unequal, but not
          unjust goodness. He is good to all, though not in the same degree:
          “The whole earth is full of his mercy” (Ps. cxix. 64). A good man is
          good to his cattle, to his servants; he makes a provision for all, but
          he bestows not those floods of bounty upon them that he doth upon his
          children. As there are various gifts, but one Spirit (1 Cor. xii. 4),
          so there are various distributions, but from one goodness; the drops,
          as well as the fuller streams, are of the same fountain, and relish of
          the nature of it; and though he do not make all men partake of the
          riches of his grace after the corruption of their nature, is his
          goodness disgraced hereby? or doth he merit the title of cruelty? Will
          any diminish the goodness of a father for his not setting up his son
          after he hath foolishly and wilfully proved bankrupt; or not rather
          admire his liberality in giving him so large a stock to trade with
          when he first set him up in the world?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The goodness of God to creatures, is to be measured by their
          distinct usefulness to the common end. It were better for a toad or
          serpent to be a man, i. e. better for the creature itself, as it were
          advanced to a higher degree of being, but not better for the universe:
          he could have made every pebble a living creature, and every living
          creature a rational one; but that he made everything as we see, it was
          a goodness to the creature itself; but that he did not make it of a
          higher elevation in nature, was a part of his goodness to the rational
          creature. If all were rational creatures, there would have been
          wanting creatures of an inferior nature for their conveniency; there
          would have wanted the manifestation of the variety and “fulness of his
          goodness.” Had all things in the world been rational creatures, much
          of that goodness which he hath communicated to rational creatures
          would not have appeared: how could man have showed his skill in taming
          and managing creatures more mighty than himself? What materials would
          there have been to manifest the goodness of God, bestowed upon the
          reasonable creatures for framing excellent works and inventions? Much
          of the goodness of God had lain wrapt up from sense and understanding.
          All other things partake not of so great a goodness as man; yet they
          are so subservient to that goodness poured forth on man, that little
          of it could have been seen without them. Consider man, every member in
          his body hath a goodness in itself; but a greater goodness as referred
          to the whole, without which the goodness of the more noble part would
          not be manifested. The head is the most excellent member, and hath
          greater impressions of Divine goodness upon it, in regard that it is
          the organ of understanding: were every member of the body a head, what
          a deformed monster would man be! If he were all head, where would be
          feet for motion, and arms for action? Man would be fit only for
          thought, and not for exercise. The goodness of God in giving man so
          noble a part as the head, could not be known without a tongue, whereby
          to express the conception of his mind; and without feet and hands
          whereby to act much of what he conceives, and determines, and execute
          the resolves of his will; all those have a goodness in themselves, an
          honor, a comeliness from the goodness of God (1 Cor. xii. 22, 23), but
          not so great a goodness as the nobler part: yet, if you consider them
          in their functions, and refer them to that excellent member which they
          serve, their inferior goodness is absolutely necessary to the goodness
          of the other; without which, the goodness of the head and
          understanding would lie in obscurity, be insignificant to the whole
          world, and, in a great measure, to the person himself that wants such
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. “The goodness of God is more seen in this inequality.” If God were
          equally good to all, it would destroy commerce, unity, the links of
          human society, damp charity, and render that useless which is one of
          the noblest and delightfulest duties to be exercised here; it would
          cool prayer, which is excited by wants, and is a necessary
          demonstration of the creature’s dependence on God. But in this
          inequality every man hath enough in his enjoyments for praise, and in
          his wants, matter for his prayer. Besides the inequality of the
          creature is the ornament of the world; what pleasure could a garden
          afford if there were but one sort of flowers, or one sort of plants?
          far less than when there is variety to please the sight, and every
          other sense. Again, the freedom of Divine goodness, which is the glory
          of it, is evident hereby; had he been alike good to all, it would have
          looked like a necessary, not a free act; but by the inequality, it is
          manifest that he doth not do it by a natural necessity as the sun
          shines, but by a voluntary liberty, as being the entire Lord, and free
          disposer of his own goods; and that is the gift of the pleasure of his
          will, as well as the efflux of his nature, that he hath not a goodness
          without wisdom, but a wisdom as rich as his bounty.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The goodness of God could not be equally communicated to all, after
          their settlement in their several beings,—because they have not a
          capacity in their natures for it: he doth bestow the marks of his
          goodness according to that natural capacity of fitness he perceives in
          his creatures; as the water of the sea fills every creek and gulf with
          different measures, according to the compass each have to contain it;
          and as the sun doth disperse light to the stars above, and the places
          below, to some more, to some less, according to the measures of their
          reception. God doth not do good to all creatures according to the
          greatness of his own power, and the extent of his own wealth, but
          according to the capacity of the subject; not so much good as he can
          do, but so much good as the creature can receive. The creature would
          sink, if God would pour out all his goodness upon it; as Moses would
          have perished, if God should have shown him all his glory (Exod.
          xxxiii. 18, 20). He doth manifest more good to his reasonable
          creatures, because they are more capable of acknowledging, and setting
          forth his goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. God ought to be allowed the free disposal of his own goodness. Is
          not God the Lord of his own gifts; and will you not allow him the
          privilege of having some more peculiar objects of his love and
          pleasure, which you allow without blame to man, and use yourself
          without any sense of a crime? Is a prince esteemed good, though he be
          not equally bountiful to all his servants, nor equally gracious in
          pardoning all his rebels; and shall the goodness of the great
          Sovereign of the world be impeached, notwithstanding those mighty
          distributions of it, because he will act according to his own wisdom
          and pleasure, and not according to men’s fancies and humors? Must
          purblind reason be the judge and director how God shall dispose of his
          own, rather than his own infinite wisdom and sovereign will? Is God
          less good, because there are numberless nothings, which he is able to
          bring into being? He could create a world of more creatures than he
          hath done: doth he, therefore, wish evil to them, by letting them
          remain in that nothing from whence he could draw them? No; but he
          denies that good to them, which he is able, if he pleased, to confer
          upon them. If God doth not give that good to a creature which it wants
          by its own demerit, can he be said to wish evil to it; or, only to
          deny that goodness which the creature hath forfeited, and which is at
          God’s liberty to retain or disperse?967 Though God cannot but love his
          own image where he finds it, yet when this image is lost, and the
          devil’s image voluntary received, he may choose whether he will
          manifest his goodness to such a one or no. Will you not account that
          man liberal, that distributes his alms to a great company, though he
          rejects some? Much more will you account him good, if he rejects none
          that implore him, but dispenseth his doles to every one upon their
          petition: and is he not good, because he will not bestow a farthing
          upon those that address not themselves to him? God is so good, that he
          denies not the best good to those that seek him: he hath promised life
          and happiness to them that do so. Is he less good, because he will not
          distribute his goodness to those that despise him? Though he be good,
          yet his wisdom is the rule of dispensing his goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The severe punishment of offenders, and the afflictions he inflicts
          upon his servants, are no violations of his goodness. The notion of
          God’s vindictive justice is as naturally inbred, and implanted in the
          mind of man, as that of his goodness, and those two sentiments never
          shocked one another. The heathen never thought him bad, because he was
          just; nor unrighteous, because he was good. God being infinitely good,
          cannot possibly intend or act anything but what is good: “Thou art
          good, and thou doest good;” i. e. whatsoever thou dost is good,
          whatsoever it be, pleasant or painful to the creature (Ps. cxix. 68):
          punishments themselves are not a moral evil in the person that
          inflicts, though they are a natural evil in the person that suffers
          them.968 In ordering punishment to the wicked, good is added to evil;
          in ordering impunity to the wicked, evil is added to evil. To punish
          wickedness is right, therefore good: to leave men uncontrolled in
          their wickedness, is unrighteous, and therefore bad. But, again, shall
          his justice in some few judgments in the world, impeach his goodness,
          more than his wonderful patience to sinners is able to silence the
          calumnies against him? Is not his hand fuller of gracious doles, than
          of dreadful thunderbolts? Doth he not oftener seem forgetful of his
          justice, when he pours out upon the guilty the streams of his mercy,
          than to be forgetful of his goodness, when he sprinkles in the world
          some drops of his wrath?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, God’s judgments in the world, do not infringe his goodness;
          for,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The justice of God is a part of the goodness of his nature. God
          himself thought so, when he told Moses he would make all his goodness
          pass before him (Exod. xxxiii. 19): he leaves not out in that
          enumeration of the parts of it, his resolution, by no means to clear
          the guilty, but to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
          (Exod. xxxiv. 7). It is a property of goodness to hate evil, and,
          therefore, a property of goodness to punish it: it is no less
          righteousness to give according to the deserts of a person in a way of
          punishment, than to reward a person that obeys his precepts in a way
          of recompense. Whatsoever is righteous is good; sin is evil; and,
          therefore, whatsoever doth witness against it, is good; his goodness,
          therefore, shines in his justice, for without being just he could not
          be good. Sin is a moral disorder in the world: every sin is injustice:
          injustice breaks God’s order in the world; there is a necessity
          therefore of justice to put the world in order. Punishment orders the
          person committing the injury, who, when he will not be in the order of
          obedience, must be in the order of suffering for God’s honor. The
          goodness of all things which God pronounced so, consisted in their
          order and beneficial helpfulness to one another: when this order is
          inverted, the goodness of the creature ceaseth: if it be a bad thing
          to spoil this order, is it not a part of Divine goodness to reduce
          them into order, that they may be reduced in some measure to their
          goodness? Do we ever account a governor less in goodness, because he
          is exact in justice, and punisheth that which makes a disorder in his
          government? and is it a diminution of the Divine goodness, to punish
          that which makes a disorder in the world? As wisdom without goodness
          would be a serpentine craft, and issue in destruction; so goodness
          without justice would be impotent indulgence, and cast things into
          confusion. When Abel’s blood cried out for vengeance against Cain, it
          spake a good thing; Christ’s blood speaking better things than the
          blood of Abel, implies that Abel’s blood spake a good thing; the
          comparative implies a positive (Heb. xii. 24). If it were the goodness
          of that innocent blood to demand justice, it could not be a badness in
          the Sovereign of the world to execute it. How can God sustain the part
          of a good and righteous judge, if he did not preserve human society?
          and how would it be preserved, without manifesting himself by public
          judgments against public wrongs? Is there not as great a necessity
          that goodness should have instruments of judgment, as that there
          should be prisons, bridewells, and gibbets, in a good commonwealth?
          Did not the thunderbolts of God sometimes roar in the ears of men,
          they would sin with a higher hand than they do, fly more in the face
          of God, make the world as much a moral, as it was at first a natural
          chaos: the ingenuity of men would be damped, if there were not
          something to work upon their fears, to keep them in their due order.
          Impunity of the innocent person is worse than any punishment. It is a
          misery to want medicines for the cure of a sharp disease; and a mark
          of goodness in a prince to consult for the security of the political
          body, by cutting off a gangrened and corrupting member: and what
          prince would deserve the noble title of good, if he did not restrain,
          by punishment, those evils which impair the public welfare? Is it not
          necessary that the examples of sin, whereby others have been
          encouraged to wickedness, should be made examples of justice, whereby
          the same persons and others may be discouraged from what before they
          were greedily inclined unto? Is not a hatred of what is bad and
          unworthy, as much a part of Divine goodness, as a love to what is
          excellent, and bears a resemblance to himself? Could he possibly be
          accounted good, that should bear the same degree of affection to a
          prodigious vice, as to a sublime virtue? and should behave himself in
          the same manner of carriage to the innocent and culpable? could you
          account him good, if he did always with pleasure behold evil, and
          perpetually suffer the oppressions of the innocent under unpunished
          wickedness? How should we know the goodness of the Divine nature, and
          his affection to the goodness of his creature, if he did not by some
          acts of severity witness his implacable aversion against sin, and his
          care to preserve the good government of the world? If corrupted
          creatures should always be exempt from the effects of his indignation,
          he would declare himself not to be infinitely good, because he would
          not be really righteous. No man thinks it a natural vice in the sun,
          by the power of its scorching heat, to dry up and consume the
          unwholesome vapors of the air; nor are the demonstrations of Divine
          justice any blots upon his goodness, since they are both for the
          defence and glory of his holiness, and for the preservation of the
          beauty and order of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Is it not part of the goodness of God to make laws, and annex
          threatenings; and shall it be an impeachment of his goodness to
          support them? The more severe laws are made for deterring evil, the
          better is that prince accounted in making such provision for the
          welfare of the community. The design of laws, and the design of
          upholding the honor of those laws by the punishment of offenders, is
          to promote goodness and restrain evil; the execution of those laws
          must be therefore pursuant to the same design of goodness which first
          settled them. Would it not be contrary to goodness, to suffer that
          which was designed for the support of goodness, to be scorned and
          slighted? It would neither be prudence nor goodness, but folly and
          vice, to let laws, which were made to promote virtue, be broken with
          impunity. Would not this be to weaken virtue, and give a new life and
          vigor to vice? Not only the righteousness of the law itself, but the
          wisdom of the Lawgiver would be exposed to contempt, if the violations
          of it remained uncontrolled, and the violence offered by men passed
          unpunished. None but will acknowledge the Divine precepts to be the
          image of the righteousness of God, and beneficial for the common good
          of the world (Rom. vii. 12): “The law is holy, just, and good,” and so
          is every precept of it; the law is for no other end, but to keep the
          creature in subjection to, and dependence on God; this dependence
          could not be preserved without a law, nor that law be kept in
          reputation, without a penalty; nor would that penalty be significant
          without an execution. Every law loseth the nature of a law, without a
          penalty; and the penalty loseth its vigor, without the infliction of
          it: how can those laws attain their end, if the transgressions of them
          be not punished? Would not the wickedness of the men’s hearts be
          encouraged by such a kind of uncomely goodness? and all the
          threatenings be to no other end, than to engender vain and fruitless
          fears in the minds of men? Is it good for the majesty of God to suffer
          itself to be trampled on by his vassals? to suffer men, by their
          rebellion, to level his law with the wickedness of their own hearts;
          and by impunity slight his own glory, and encourage their
          disobedience? Who would give any man, any prince, any father, that
          should do so, the name of a good governor? If it were a fruit of
          Divine goodness to make laws, is it contrary to goodness to support
          the honor of them? It is every whit as rational and as good to
          vindicate the honor of his laws by justice, as at first to settle them
          by authority; as much goodness to vindicate it from contempt, as at
          first to enact it; as it is as much wisdom to preserve a law, as at
          first to frame it: shall his precepts be thought by him unworthy of a
          support, that were not thought by him unworthy to be made? The same
          reason of goodness that led him to enjoin them, will lead him to
          revenge them. Did evil appear odious to him, while he enacted this
          law; and would not his goodness, as well as his wisdom, appear odious
          to him, if he did never execute it? Would it not be a denial of his
          own goodness, to be led by the foolish and corrupt judgment of his
          creatures, and slight his own law, because his rebels spurn at it?
          Since he valued it before they could actually contemn it, would he not
          misjudge his own law and his own wisdom, discount from the true value
          of them, condemn his own acts, censure his precepts as unrighteous,
          and therefore evil and injurious? remove the differences between good
          and evil, look upon vice as virtue, and wickedness as righteousness,
          if he thought his commands unworthy a vindication? How can there be
          any support to the honor of his precepts, without sometimes executing
          the severity of his threatenings? And as to his threatenings of
          punishment for the breach of his laws, are they not designed to
          discourage wickedness, as the promises of reward were designed to
          encourage goodness? Hath he not multiplied the one, to scare men from
          sin, as well as the other, to allure men to obedience? Is not the same
          truth engaged to support the one, as well as the other; and how could
          he be abundant in goodness, if he were not abundant in truth (Exod.
          xxxiv. 6)? both are linked together; if he neglected his truth, he
          would be out of love with his own goodness; since it cannot be
          manifested in performing the promises to the obedient, if it be not
          also manifested in executing his threatenings upon the rebellious. Had
          not God annexed threatenings to his laws, he would have had no care of
          his own goodness. The order between God and the creature, wherein the
          declaration of his goodness consisted, might have been easily broken
          by his creature; man would have freed himself from subjection to God;
          been unaccountable to him, had this consisted with that infinite
          goodness whereby he loves himself, and loves his creatures. As
          therefore the annexing threatenings to his law, was a part of his
          goodness; the execution of them is so far from being a blemish, that
          it is the honor of his goodness. The rewards of obedience, and the
          punishment of disobedience, refer to the same end, viz. the due
          manifestation of the valuation of his own law, the glorifying his own
          goodness, which enjoined so beneficial a law for man, and the support
          of that goodness in the creatures, which by that law he demands
          righteously and kindly of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Hence it follows, That not to punish evil, would be a want of
          goodness to himself. The goodness of God is an indulgent goodness, in
          a way of wisdom and reason; not a fond goodness, in a way of weakness
          and folly: would it not be a weakness, always to bear with the
          impenitent? a want of expressing a goodness to goodness itself? Would
          not goodness have more reason to complain, for a want of justice to
          rescue it, than men have reason to complain, for the exercise of
          justice in the vindication of it? If God established all things in
          order, with infinite wisdom and goodness, and God silently beheld,
          forever, this order broken, would he not either charge himself with a
          want of power, or a want of will, to preserve the marks of his own
          goodness? Would it be a kindness to himself to be careless of the
          breaches of his own orders? His throne would shake, yea, sink from
          under him, if justice, whereby he sentenceth, and judgment, whereby he
          executes his sentence, were not the supports of it (Ps. lxxxix. 14).
          “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne,” מכון, the
          stability or foundation of thy throne. So, Ps. xciii. 2. Man would
          forget his relation to God; God would be unknown to be sovereign of
          the world, were he careless of the breaches of his own order (Ps. ix.
          16). “The Lord is known by the judgments which he executes;” is it not
          a part of his goodness, to preserve the indispensable order between
          himself and his creatures? His own sovereignty, which is good, and the
          subjection of the creature to him as sovereign, which is also good;
          the one would not be maintained in its due place, nor the other
          restrained in due limits, without punishment. Would it be a goodness
          in him to see goodness itself trampled upon constantly, without some
          time or other appearing for the relief of it? Is it not a goodness to
          secure his own honor, to prevent further evil? Is it not a goodness to
          discourage men by judgments, sometimes, from a contempt and ill use of
          his bounty; as well as sometimes patiently to bear with them, and wait
          upon them for a reformation? Must God be bad to himself, to be kind to
          his enemies? And shall it be accounted an unkindness, and a mark of
          evil in him, not to suffer himself to be always outraged and defied?
          The world is wronged by sin, as well as God is injured by it. How
          could God be good to himself, if he righted not his own honor? or be a
          good governor of the world, if he did not sometimes witness against
          the injuries it receives sometimes from the works of his hands? Would
          he be good to himself, as a God, to be careless of his own honor? or
          good, as the Rector of the world, and be regardless of the world’s
          confusion? That God should give an eternal good to that creature that
          declines its duty, and despiseth his sovereignty, is not agreeable to
          the goodness of his wisdom, or that of his righteousness. It is a part
          of God’s goodness to love himself. Would he love his sovereignty, if
          he saw it daily slighted, without sometimes discovering how much he
          values the honor of it? Would he have any esteem for his own goodness,
          if he beheld it trampled upon, without any will to vindicate it? Doth
          mercy deserve the name of cruelty, because it pleads against a
          creature that hath so often abused it, and hath refused to have any
          pity exercised towards it in a righteous and regular way? Is
          sovereignty destitute of goodness, because it preserves its honor
          against one that would not have it reign over him? Would he not seem,
          by such a regardlessness, to renounce his own essence, undervalue and
          undermine his own goodness, if he had not an implacable aversion to
          whatsoever is contrary to it? If men turn grace into wantonness, is it
          not more reasonable he should turn his grace into justice? All his
          attributes, which are parts of his goodness, engage him to punish sin;
          without it, his authority would be vilified, his purity stained, his
          power derided, his truth disgraced, his justice scorned, his wisdom
          slighted; he would be thought to have dissembled in his laws; and be
          judged, according to the rules of reason, to be void of true goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Punishment is not the primary intention of God. It is his goodness
          that he hath no mind to punish; and therefore he hath put a bar to
          evil, by his prohibitions and threatenings, that he might prevent sin,
          and, consequently, any occasions of severity against his creature.969
          The principal intention of God, in his law, was to encourage goodness,
          that he might reward it; and when, by the commission of evil, God is
          provoked to punish, and takes the sword into his hand, he doth not act
          against the nature of his goodness, but against the first intention of
          his goodness in his precepts, which was to reward; as a good judge
          principally intends, in the exercise of his office, to protect good
          men from violence, and maintain the honor of the laws, yet,
          consequently, to punish bad men, without which the protection of the
          good would not be secured, nor the honor of the law be supported; and
          a good judge, in the exercise of his office, doth principally intend
          the encouragement of the good, and wisheth there were no wickedness
          that might occasion punishment; and, when he doth sentence a
          malefactor, in order to the execution of him, he doth not act against
          the goodness of his nature, but pursuant to the duty of his place, but
          wisheth he had no occasion for such severity. Thus God seems to speak
          of himself (Isa. xxviii. 21); he calls the act of his wrath his
          “strange work, his strange act;” a work, not against his nature, as
          the Governor of the world, but against his first intention, as
          Creator, which was to manifest his goodness; therefore he moves with a
          slow pace in those acts, brings out his judgments with relentings of
          heart, and seems to cast out his thunderbolts with a trembling hand:
          “He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men” (Lam.
          iii. 33); and therefore he “delights not in the death of a sinner”
          (Ezek. xxxiii. 11); not in death, as death; in punishment, as
          punishment; but as it reduceth the suffering creature to the order of
          his precept, or reduceth him into order under his power, or reforms
          others who are spectators of the punishment upon a criminal of their
          own nature; God only hates the sin, not the sinner; he desires only
          the destruction of the one, not the misery of the other; the nature of
          a man doth not displease him, because it is a work of his own
          goodness, but the nature of the sinner displeaseth him, because it is
          a work of the sinner’s own extravagance.970 Divine goodness pitcheth
          not its hatred primarily upon the sinner, but upon the sin: but since
          he cannot punish the sin without punishing the subject to which it
          cleaves, the sinner falls under his lash. Whoever regards a good judge
          as an enemy to the malefactor, but as an enemy to his crime, when he
          doth sentence and execute him?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Judgments in the world have a goodness in them, therefore they are
          no impeachments of the goodness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) A goodness in their preparations. He sends not judgments without
          giving warnings; his justice is so far from extinguishing his
          goodness, that his goodness rather shines out in the preparations of
          his justice; he gives men time, and sends them messengers, to persuade
          them to another temper of mind, that he may change his hand, and
          exercise his liberality where he threatened his severity. When the
          heathen had presages of some evil upon their persons or countries,
          they took them for invitations to repentance, excited themselves to
          many acts of devotion, implored his favor, and often experimented it.
          The Ninevites, upon the proclamation of the destruction of their city
          by Jonah, fell to petitioning him, whereby they signified, that they
          thought him good, though he were just, and more prone to pity than
          severity; and their humble carriage caused the arrows he had ready
          against them to drop out of his hands (Jonah iii. 9, 10). When he
          brandisheth his sword, he wishes for some to stand in that gap, to
          mollify his anger, that he might not strike the fatal blow (Ezek.
          xxxii. 30); “I sought for a man among them that should make up the
          hedge, and stand in the gap before me in the land, that I should not
          destroy it.” He was desirous that his creatures might be in a capacity
          to receive the marks of his bounty.971 This he signified, not
          obscurely, to Moses (Exod. xxxii. 10), when he spoke to him to let him
          alone, that his anger might wax hot against the people, after they had
          made a golden calf and worshipped it. “Let me alone,” said God: not
          that Moses restrained him, saith Chrysostom, who spake nothing to him,
          but stood silent before him, and knew nothing of the people’s
          idolatry; but God would give him an occasion of praying for them, that
          he might exercise his mercy towards them; yet in such a manner, that
          the people, being struck with a sense of their crime, and the horror
          of Divine justice, they might be amended for the future, when they
          should understand that their death was not averted by their own merit
          or intercession, but by Moses, his patronage of them, and pleading for
          them; as we see sometimes masters and fathers angry with their
          servants and children, and preparing themselves to punish them, but
          secretly wish some friend to intercede for them, and take them out of
          their hands: there is a goodness shining in the preparations of his
          judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A goodness in the execution of them. They are good, as they shew
          God disaffected to evil, and conduce to the glory of his holiness, and
          deter others from presumptuous sins (Deut. x. 3): “I will be glorified
          in all that draw near unto me;”—in his judgment upon Nadab and Abihu,
          the sons of Aaron, for offering strange fire. By them God preserves
          the excellent footsteps of his own goodness in his creation and his
          law, and curbs the licentiousness of men, and contains them within the
          bounds of their duty. “Thy judgments are good,” saith the Psalmist
          (Ps. cxix. xxxix.); i. e. thy judicial proceedings upon the wicked;
          for he desires God there to turn away, by some signal act, the
          reproach the wicked cast upon him. Can there be any thing more
          miserable than to live in a world full of wickedness, and void of the
          marks of Divine goodness and justice to repress it? Were there not
          judgments in the world, men would forget God, be insensible of his
          government of the world, neglect the exercises of natural and
          christian duties; religion would be at its last gasp, and expire among
          them, and men would pretend to break God’s precepts by God’s
          authority. Are they not good, then, as they restrain the creature from
          further evils; affright others from the same crimes which they were
          inclinable to commit? He strikes some, to reform others that are
          spectators; as Apollonius tamed pigeons by beating dogs before them.
          Punishments are God’s gracious warnings to others, not to venture upon
          the crimes which they see attended with such judgments. The censers of
          Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, were to be wrought into plates for a
          covering of the altar, to abide there as a memento to others, not to
          approach to the exercise of the priestly office without an
          authoritative call from God (Numb. xvi. 38, 40); and those judgments
          exercised in the former ages of the world, were intended by Divine
          goodness for warnings, even in evangelical times. Lot’s wife was
          turned into a pillar of salt, to prevent men from apostasy; that use
          Christ himself makes of it, in the exhortation against “turning back”
          (Luke xvii. 32, 33). And (Ps. lviii. 10): “The righteous shall wash
          his feet in the blood of the wicked.” When God shall drench his sword
          in the blood of the wicked, the righteous shall take occasion from
          thence, to purify themselves, and reform their ways, and look to the
          paths of their feet. Would not impunity be hurtful to the world, and
          men receive encouragement to sin, if severities sometimes did not
          bridle them from the practice of their inclinations? Sometimes the
          sinner himself is reformed, and sometimes removed from being an
          example to others. Though thunder be an affrightening noise, and
          lightning a scaring flash, yet they have a liberal goodness in them,
          in shattering and consuming those contagious vapors which burden and
          infect the air, and thereby render it more clear and healthful. Again,
          there are few acts of Divine justice upon a people, but are in the
          very execution of them attended with demonstrations of his goodness to
          others; he is a protector of his own, while he is a revenger on his
          enemies; when he rides upon his horses in anger against some, his
          chariots are “chariots of salvation” to others (Hab. iii. 8). Terror
          makes way for salvation; the overthrow of Pharaoh and the strength of
          his nation, completed the deliverance of the Israelites. Had not the
          Egyptians met with their destruction, the Israelites had unavoidably
          met with their ruin, against all the promises God had made to them,
          and to the defamation of his former justice, in the former plagues
          upon their oppressors. The death of Herod was the security of Peter,
          and the rest of the maliced christians. The gracious deliverance of
          good men is often occasioned by some severe stroke upon some eminent
          persecutor; the destruction of the oppressor is the rescue of the
          innocent. Again, where is there a judgment but leaves more criminals
          behind than it sweeps away, that deserved to be involved in the same
          fate with the rest? More Egyptians were left behind to possess and
          enjoy the goodness of their fruitful land, than they were that were
          hurried into another world by the overflowing waves; is not this a
          mark of goodness as well as severity? Again, is it not a goodness in
          Him not to pour out judgments according to the greatness of his power?
          to go gradually to work with those whom he might in a moment blow to
          destruction with one breath of his mouth? Again, he sometimes
          exerciseth judgments upon some, to form a new generation for himself;
          he destroyed an old world, to raise a new one more righteous, as a man
          pulls down his old buildings to erect a sounder and more stately
          fabric. To sum up what hath been said in this particular; how could
          God be a friend to goodness, if he were not an enemy to evil? how
          could he shew his enmity to evil, without revenging the abuse and
          contempt of his goodness? God would rather have the repentance of a
          sinner than his punishment; but the sinner would rather expose himself
          to the severest frowns of God, than pursue those methods wherein he
          hath settled the conveyances of his kindness; “You will not come to me
          that you might have life,” saith Christ. How is eternity of punishment
          inconsistent with the goodness of God? nay, how can God be good
          without it? If wickedness always remain in the nature of man, is it
          not fit the rod should always remain on the back of men? Is it a want
          of goodness that keeps an incorrigible offender in chains in a
          bridewell? While sin remains, it is fit it should be punished; would
          not God else be an enemy to his own goodness, and shew favor to that
          which doth abuse it, and is contrary to it? He hath threatened eternal
          flames to sinners, that he might the more strongly excite them to a
          reformation of their ways, and a practice of his precepts. In those
          threatenings he hath manifested his goodness; and can it be bad in him
          to defend what his goodness hath commanded, and execute what his
          goodness hath threatened? His truth is also a part of his goodness;
          for it is nothing but his goodness performing that which it obliged
          him to do. That is the first thing; severe judgments in the world are
          no impeachments of his goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, The afflictions God inflicts upon his servants, are no
          violations of his goodness. Sometimes God afflicts men for their
          temporal and eternal good; for the good of their grace, in order to
          the good of their glory; which is a more excellent good, than
          afflictions can be an evil. The heathens reflected upon Ulysses’
          hardship, as a mark of Jupiter’s goodness and love to him, that his
          virtue might be more conspicuous. By strong persecutions brought upon
          the church, her lethargy is cured, her chaff purged, the glorious
          fruit of the gospel brought forth in the lives of her children; the
          number of her proselytes multiply, and the strength of her weak ones
          is increased, by the testimonies of courage and constancy which the
          stronger present to them in their sufferings. Do these good effects
          speak a want of goodness in God, who brings them into this condition?
          By those he cures his people of their corruptions, and promotes their
          glory, by giving them the honor of suffering for the truth, and
          raiseth their spirits to a divine pitch. The epistles of Paul to the
          Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, wrote by him while he was in
          Nero’s chains, seem to have a higher strain than some of those he
          wrote when he was at liberty. As for afflictions, they are marks of a
          greater measure of fatherly goodness than he discovers to those that
          live in an uninterrupted prosperity, who are not dignified with that
          glorious title of sons, as those are that “he chasteneth” (Heb. xii.
          6, 7). Can any question the goodness of the father that corrects his
          child to prevent his vice and ruin, and breed him up to virtue and
          honor? It would be a cruelty in a father leaving his child without
          chastisement, to leave him to that misery an ill education would
          reduce him to: “God judges us that we might not be condemned with the
          world” (1 Cor. xi. 32). Is it not a greater goodness to separate us
          from the world to happiness by his scourge, than to leave us to the
          condemnation of the world for our sins? Is it not a greater goodness
          to make us smart here, than to see us scorched hereafter? As he is our
          Shepherd, it is no part of his enmity or ill‑will to us, to make us
          feel sometimes the weight of his shepherd’s crook, to reduce us from
          our struggling. The visiting our transgressions with rods, and our
          iniquities with stripes, is one of the articles of the covenant of
          grace, wherein the greatest lustre of his goodness appears (Ps.
          lxxxix. 33). The advantage and gain of our afflictions is a greater
          testimony of his goodness to us, than the pain can be of his
          unkindness; the smart is well recompensed by the accession of clearer
          graces. It is rather a high mark of goodness, than an argument for the
          want of it, that he treats us as his children, and will not suffer us
          to run into that destruction we are more ambitious of, than the
          happiness he hath prepared for us, and by afflictions he fits us for
          the partaking of, by “imparting his holiness,” together with the
          inflicting his rod (Heb. xii. 10). That is the third thing, God is
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The fourth thing is the manifestation of this goodness in
          Creation, Redemption, and Providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, In Creation. This is apparent from what hath been said before,
          that no other attribute could be the motive of his creating, but his
          goodness; his goodness was the cause that he made any thing, and his
          wisdom was the cause that he made every thing in order and harmony. He
          pronounced “every thing good,” i. e. such as became his goodness to
          bring forth into being, and rested in them more, as they were stamps
          of his goodness, than as they were marks of his power, or beams of his
          wisdom. And if all creatures were able to answer to this question,
          What that was which created them? the answer would be, Almighty power,
          but employed by the motion of infinite goodness.972 All the varieties
          of creatures are so many apparitions of this goodness. Though God be
          one, yet he cannot appear as a God but in variety. As the greatness of
          power is not manifest but in variety of works, and an acute
          understanding not discovered but in variety of reasonings, so an
          infinite goodness is not so apparent as in variety of communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The creation proceeds from goodness. It is the goodness of God to
          extract such multitudes of things from the depths of nothing. Because
          God is good, things have a being; if he had not been good, nothing
          could have been good; nothing could have imparted that which it
          possessed not; nothing but goodness could have communicated to things
          an excellency, which before they wanted. Being is much more excellent
          than nothing. By this goodness, therefore, the whole creation was
          brought out of the dark womb of nothing; this formed their natures,
          this beautified them with their several ornaments and perfections,
          whereby everything was enabled to act for the good of the common
          world. God did not create things because he was a living Being, but
          because he was a good Being. No creature brought forth anything in the
          world merely because it is, but because it is good, and by a
          communicated goodness fitted for such a production. If God had been
          the creating principle of things only as he was a living Being, or as
          he was an understanding Being, then all things should have partaken of
          life and understanding, because all things were to bear some
          characters of the Deity upon them. If by understanding, solely, God
          were the Creator of all things, all things should have borne the mark
          of the Deity upon them, and should have been more or less
          understanding; but he created things as he was good, and by goodness
          he renders all things more or less like himself: hence everything is
          accounted more noble, not in regard of its being, but in regard of the
          beneficialness of its nature. The being of things was not the end of
          God in creating, but the goodness of their being. God did not rest
          from his works because they were his works, i. e. because they had a
          being; but because they had a good being (Gen. i.); because they were
          naturally useful to the universe: nothing was more pleasing to him,
          than to behold those shadows and copies of his own goodness in his
          works.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Creation was the first act of goodness without himself. When he was
          alone from eternity, he contented himself with himself, abounding in
          his own blessedness, delighting in that abundance; he was
          incomprehensively rich in the possession of an unstained felicity.973
          This creation was the first efflux of his goodness without himself:
          for the work of creation cannot be called a work of mercy.974 Mercy
          supposeth a creature miserable, but that which hath no being is
          subject to no misery; for to be miserable supposeth a nature in being,
          and deprived of that good which belongs to the pleasure and felicity
          of nature; but since there was no being, there could be no misery. The
          creation, therefore, was not an act of mercy, but an act of sole
          goodness; and, therefore, it was the speech of an heathen, that when
          God first set upon the creation of the world, he transformed himself
          into love and goodness, Εἰς ἔρωτα μεταβλῆθαι τὸν θεὸν μέλλοντα
          δημιουργεῖν.975 This led forth, and animated his power, the first
          moment it drew the universe out of the womb of nothing. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is not one creature but hath a character of his goodness. The
          whole world is a map to represent, and a herald to proclaim this
          perfection. It is as difficult not to see something of it in every
          creature with the eye of our minds, as it is not to see the beams of
          the shining sun with those off our bodies. “He is good to all” (Ps.
          cxlv. 9); he is, therefore, good in all; not a drop of the creation,
          but is a drop of his goodness. These are the colors worn upon the
          heads of every creature. As in every spark the light of the fire is
          manifested, so doth every grain of the creation wear the visible
          badges of this perfection. In all the lights, the Father of Lights
          hath made the riches of goodness apparent; no creature is silent in
          it; it is legible to all nations in every work of his hands. That, as
          it is said of Christ (Ps. xl. 7), “In the volume of thy book it is
          written of me:” In the volume of the book of the Scripture it is
          written of me, and my goodness in redemption: so it may be said of
          God, In the volume of the book of the creature it is written of me,
          and my goodness in creation. Every creature is a page in this book,
          whose “line is gone through all the earth, and their words to the end
          of the world” (Ps. xix. 4); though, indeed, the less goodness in some
          is obscured by the more resplendent goodness he hath imparted unto
          others. What an admirable piece of goodness is it to communicate life
          to a fly! How should we stand gazing upon it, till we turn our eye
          inwards, and view our own frame, which is much more ravishing!
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us see the goodness of God in the creation of man,—in the
          being and nature of man. God hath, with a liberal hand, conferred upon
          every creature the best being it was capable of in that station and
          order, and conducing to that end and use in the world he intended it
          for. But when you have run over all the measures of goodness God hath
          poured forth upon other creatures, you will find a greater fulness of
          it in the nature of man, whom he hath placed in a more sublime
          condition, and endued with choicer prerogatives, than other creatures:
          he was made but little lower than the angels, and much more loftily
          crowned with glory and honor than other creatures (Ps. viii. 5). Had
          it not been for Divine goodness, that excellent creature had lain
          wrapt up in the abyss of nothing; or if he had called it out of
          nothing, there might have been less of skill and less of goodness
          displayed in the forming of it, and a lesser kind of being imparted to
          it, than what he hath conferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How much of goodness is visible in his body! God drew out some part
          of the dust of the ground, and copied out this perfection, as well as
          that of his power, on that mean matter, by erecting it into the form
          of a man, quickening that earth by the inspiration of a “living soul”
          (Gen. ii. 7): of this matter he composed an excellent body, in regard
          of the majesty of the face, erectness of its stature, and grace of
          every part. How neatly hath he wrought this “tabernacle of clay, this
          earthly house,” as the apostle calls it (2 Cor. v. 1)! a curious
          wrought piece of needle‑work, a comely artifice (Ps. cxxxix. 15), an
          embroidered case for an harmonious lute. What variety of members, with
          a due proportion, without confusion, beautiful to sight, excellent for
          use, powerful for strength! It hath eyes to conduct its motion, to
          serve in matter for the food, and delight of the understanding; ears
          to let in the pleasure of sound, to convey intelligence of the affairs
          of the world, and the counsels of heaven, to a more noble mind. It
          hath a tongue to express and sound forth what the learned inhabitant
          in it thinks; and hands to act what the inward counsellor directs; and
          feet to support the fabric. It is tempered with a kindly heat, and an
          oily moisture for motion, and endued with conveyances for air, to
          qualify the fury of the heat, and nourishment to supply the decays of
          moisture. It is a cabinet fitted by Divine goodness for the enclosing
          a rich jewel; a palace made of dust, to lodge in it the viceroy of the
          world; an instrument disposed for the operations of the nobler soul
          which he intended to unite to that refined matter. What is there in
          the situation of every part, in the proportion of every member, in the
          usefulness of every limb and string to the offices of the body, and
          service of the soul; what is there in the whole structure that doth
          not inform us of the goodness of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But what is this to that goodness which shines in the nature of the
          soul? Who can express the wonders of that comeliness that is wrapped
          up in this mask of clay? A soul endued with a clearness of
          understanding and freedom of will: faculties no sooner framed, but
          they were able to produce the operation they were intended for; a soul
          that excelled the whole world, that comprehended the whole creation; a
          soul that evidenced the extent of its skill in giving names to all
          that variety of creatures which had issued out of the hand of Divine
          Power (Gen. ii. 19); a soul able to discover the nature of other
          creatures, and manage and conduct their motions. In the ruins of a
          palace we may see the curiosity displayed, and the cost expended in
          the building of it; in the ruins of this fallen structure, we still
          find it capable of a mighty knowledge; a reason able to regulate
          affairs, govern states, order more mighty and massy creatures, find
          out witty inventions; there is still an understanding to irradiate the
          other faculties, a mind to contemplate its own Creator, a judgment to
          discern the differences between good and evil, vice and virtue, which
          the goodness of God hath not granted to any lower creature. These
          excellent faculties, together with the power of self‑reflection, and
          the swiftness of the mind in running over the things of the creation,
          are astonishing gleams of the vast goodness of that Divine Hand which
          ennobled this frame. To the other creatures of this world, God had
          given out some small mites from his treasury; but in the perfections
          of man, he hath opened the more secret parts of his exchequer, and
          liberally bestowed those doles, which he hath not expended upon the
          other creatures on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Besides this, he did not only make man so noble a creature in his
          frame, but “he made him after his own image in holiness.” He imparted
          to him a spark of his own comeliness, in order to a communion with
          himself in happiness, had man stood his ground in his trial, and used
          those faculties well, which had been the gift of his Bountiful
          Creator: he “made man after his image,” after his own image (Gen. i.
          26, 27); that as a coin bears the image of the prince, so did the soul
          of man the “image of God:” not the image of angels, though the speech
          be in the plural number: “Let us make man.” It is not to a creature,
          but to a Creator; let “us,” that are his makers, make him in the image
          of his makers. God created man, angels did not create him; God created
          man in his “own” image, not, therefore, in the image of angels: the
          nature of God, and the nature of angels, are not the same. Where, in
          the whole Scripture, is man said to be made after the image of angels?
          God made man not in the image of angels, to be conformed to them as
          his prototype, but in the image of the blessed God, to be conformed to
          the Divine nature: that as he was conformed to the image of his
          holiness, he might also partake of the image of his blessedness,
          which, without it, could not be attained: for as the felicity of God
          could not be clear without an unspotted holiness, so neither can there
          be a glorious happiness without purity in the creature; this God
          provided for in his creation of man, giving him such accomplishments
          in those two excellent pieces of soul and body, that nothing was
          wanting to him but his own will, to instate him in an invariable
          felicity. He was possessed with such a nature by the hand of Divine
          Goodness, such a loftiness of understanding, and purity of faculties,
          that he might have been for ever happy as well as the standing angels:
          and he was placed in such a condition, that moved the envy of fallen
          spirits; he had as much grace bestowed upon him, as was proportionable
          to that covenant God then made with him: the tenor of which was, that
          his life should continue so long as his obedience, and his happiness
          endure so long as his integrity: and as God, by creation, had given
          him an integrity of nature, so he had given him a power to persist in
          it, if he would. Herein is the goodness of God displayed, that he made
          man after his own image.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. As to the life of man in this world, God, by an immense goodness,
          copied out in him the whole creation, and made him an abridgment of
          the higher and lower world,—a little world in a greater one. The link
          of the two worlds, of heaven and earth, as the spiritual and corporeal
          natures are united in him, the earth in the dust of his body, and the
          heavens in the crystal of his soul: he hath the upper springs of the
          life of angels in his reason, and the nether springs of the life of
          animals in his sense. God displayed those virtues in man, which he had
          discovered in the rest of the lower creation; but, besides the
          communication which he had with earth in his nature, God gave him a
          participation with heaven in his spirit. A mere bodily being he hath
          given to the heavens, earth, elements; a vegetative life, or a life of
          growth, he hath vouchsafed to the plants of the ground: he hath
          stretched out his liberality more to animals and beasts, by giving
          them sense. All these hath his goodness linked in man, being, life,
          sense, with a richer dole than any of those creatures have received in
          a rational, intellectual life, whereby he approacheth to the nature of
          angels. This some of the Jews understood (Gen. ii. 7): “God breathed
          into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul,”
          חיים, breath of lives, in the Hebrew; not one sort of life, but that
          variety of lives which he had imparted to other creatures: all the
          perfections scattered in other creatures do unitedly meet in man: so
          that Philo might well call him “every creature, the model of the whole
          creation:” his soul is heaven, and his body is earth.976 So that the
          immensity of his goodness to man, is as great as all that goodness you
          behold in sensitive and intelligible things.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. All this was free goodness. God eternally possessed his own
          felicity in himself, and had no need of the existence of anything
          without himself for his satisfaction. Man, before his being, could
          have no good qualities to invite God to make him so excellent a
          fabric: for, being nothing, he was as unable to allure and merit, as
          to bring himself into being; nay, he created a multitude of men, who,
          he foresaw would behave themselves in as ungrateful a manner, as if
          they had not been his creatures, but had bestowed that rich variety
          upon themselves without the hand of a superior Benefactor. How great
          is this goodness, that hath made us models of the whole creation, tied
          together heaven and earth in our nature, when he might have ranked us
          among the lower creatures of the earth, made us mere bodies as the
          stones, or mere animals as the brutes, and denied us those capacious
          souls, whereby we might both know him and enjoy him! What could man
          have been more, unless he had been the original, which was impossible?
          He could not be greater than to be an image of the Deity, an epitome
          of the whole. Well may we cry out with the Psalmist (Ps. viii. 1, 4),
          “O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name,” the name of thy
          goodness, “in all the earth!” How, more particularly in man! “What is
          man that thou art mindful of him?” What is a little clod of earth and
          dust, that thou shouldst ennoble him with so rich a nature, and
          engrave upon him such characters of thy immense Being?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The goodness of God appears in the conveniences he provided for,
          and gave to man. As God gave him a being morally perfect in regard of
          righteousness, so he gave him a being naturally perfect in regard of
          delightful conveniences, which was the fruit of excellent goodness;
          since there was no quality in man, to invite God to provide him so
          rich a world, nor to bestow upon him so comely a being.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The world was made for man. Since angels have not need of
          anything in this world, and are above the conveniences of earth and
          air, it will follow, that man, being the noblest creature on the
          earth, was the more immediate end of the visible creation. All
          inferior things are made to be subservient to those that have a more
          excellent prerogative of nature; and, therefore, all things for man,
          who exceeds all the rest in dignity: as man was made for the honor of
          God, so the world was made for the support and delight of man, in
          order to his performing the service due from him to God. The empire
          God settled man in as his lieutenant over the works of his hands, when
          he gave him possession of paradise, is a clear manifestation of it:
          God put all things under his feet, and gave him a deputed dominion
          over the rest of the creatures under himself, as the absolute
          sovereign (Ps. viii. 6‒8); “Thou madest him to have dominion over the
          works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet, all sheep
          and oxen; yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and
          the fish of the sea; yea, and whatsoever passeth over the paths of the
          sea.” What less is witnessed to by the calamity all creatures were
          subjected to by the corruption of man’s nature? Then was the earth
          cursed, and a black cloud flung upon the beauty of the creation, and
          the strength and vigor of it languisheth to this day under the curse
          of God (Gen. ii. 17, 18), and groans under that vanity the sin of man
          subjected it to (Rom. viii. 20, 22). The treasons of man against God
          brought misery upon that which was framed for the use of man: as when
          the majesty of a prince is violated by the treason and rebellion of
          his subjects, all that which belongs to them, and was, before the free
          gift of the prince to them, is forfeit; their habitations, palaces,
          cattle, all that belongs to them bear the marks of his sovereign fury:
          had not the delicacies of the earth been made for the use of man, they
          had not fallen under the indignation of God upon the sin of man. God
          crowned the earth with his goodness to gratify man; gave man a right
          to serve himself of the delightful creatures he had provided (Gen. i.
          28‒30); yea, and after man had forfeited all by sin, and God had
          washed again the creature in a deluge, he renews the creation, and
          delivers it again into the hand of man, binding all creatures to pay a
          respect to him, and recognise him as their Lord, either spontaneously,
          or by force; and commissions them all to fill the heart of man with
          “food and gladness” (Gen. ix. 2, 3): and he loves all creatures as
          they conduce to the good of, and are serviceable to, his prime
          creature, which he set up for his own glory: and therefore, when he
          loves a person, he loves what belongs to him: he takes care of Jacob
          and his cattle: of penitent Nineveh and their cattle (Jonah iv. 11):
          as when he sends judgments upon men he destroys their goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) God richly furnished the world for man. He did not only erect a
          stately palace for his habitation, but provided all kind of furniture
          as a mark of his goodness, for the entertainment of his creature, man:
          he arched over his habitation with a bespangled heaven, and floored it
          with a solid earth, and spread a curious wrought tapestry upon the
          ground where he was to tread, and seemed to sweep all the rubbish of
          the chaos to the two uninhabitable poles. When at the first creation
          of the matter the waters covered the earth, and rendered it
          uninhabitable for man, God drained them into the proper channels he
          had founded for them, and set a bound that they might not pass over,
          that they turn not again to “cover the earth” (Gen. i. 9). They fled
          and hasted away to their proper stations (Ps. civ. 7‒9), as if they
          were ambitious to deny their own nature, and content themselves with
          an imprisonment for the convenient habitation of Him who was to be
          appointed Lord of the world. He hath set up standing lights in the
          heaven, to direct our motion, and to regulate the seasons: the sun was
          created, that man might see to “go forth to his labor” (Ps. civ. 22,
          23): both sun and moon, though set in the heaven, were formed to “give
          light” on the earth (Gen. i. 15, 17). The air is his aviary, the sea
          and rivers his fish‑ponds, the valleys his granary, the mountains his
          magazine; the first afford man creatures for nourishment, the other
          metals for perfection: the animals were created for the support of the
          life of man; the herbs of the ground were provided for the maintenance
          of their lives; and gentle dews, and moistening showers, and, in some
          places, slimy floods appointed to render the earth fruitful, and
          capable to offer man and beast what was fit for their nourishment. He
          hath peopled every element with a variety of creatures both for
          necessity and delight; all furnished with useful qualities for the
          service of man. There is not the most despicable thing in the whole
          creation but it is endued with a nature to contribute something for
          our welfare: either as food to nourish us when we are healthful; or as
          medicine to cure us when we are distempered; or as a garment to clothe
          us when we are naked, and arm us against the cold of the season; or as
          a refreshment when we are weary; or as a delight when we are sad: all
          serve for necessity or ornament, either to spread our table, beautify
          our dwellings, furnish our closets, or store our wardrobes (Ps. civ.
          24): “The whole earth is full of his riches.” Nothing but by the rich
          goodness of God is exquisitely accommodated, in the numerous brood of
          things, immediately or mediately for the use of man; all, in the
          issue, conspire together to render the world a delightful residence
          for man; and, therefore, all the living creatures were brought by God
          to attend upon man after his creation, to receive a mark of his
          dominion over them, by the “imposition of their names” (Gen. ii. 19,
          20). He did not only give variety of senses to man, but provided
          variety of delightful objects in the world for every sense; the
          beauties of light and colors for our eye, the harmony of sounds for
          our ear, the fragrancy of odors for our nostrils, and a delicious
          sweetness for our palates: some have qualities to pleasure; all,
          everything, a quality to pleasure, one or other: he doth not only
          present those things to our view, as rich men do in ostentation their
          goods, he makes us the enjoyers as well as the spectators, and gives
          us the use as well as the sight; and, therefore, he hath not only
          given us the sight, but the knowledge of them: he hath set up a sun in
          the heavens, to expose their outward beauty and conveniences to our
          sight; and the candle of the Lord is in us, to expose their inward
          qualities and conveniences to our knowledge, that we might serve
          ourselves of, and rejoice in, all this furniture wherewith he hath
          garnished the world, and have wherewithal to employ the
          inquisitiveness of our reason, as well as gratify the pleasures of our
          sense; and, particularly, God provided for innocent man a delightful
          mansion‑house, a place of more special beauty and curiosity, the
          garden of Eden, a delightful paradise, a model of the beauties and
          pleasures of another world, wherein he had placed whatsoever might
          contribute to the felicity of a rational and animal life, the life of
          a creature composed of mire and dust, of sense and reason (Gen. ii.
          9). Besides the other delicacies consigned, in that place, to the use
          of man, there was a tree of life provided to maintain his being, and
          nothing denied, in the whole compass of that territory, but one tree,
          that of the knowledge of good and evil, which was no mark of an
          ill‑will in his Creator to him, but a reserve of God’s absolute
          sovereignty, and a trial of man’s voluntary obedience. What blur was
          it to the goodness of God, to reserve one tree for his own propriety,
          when he had given to man, in all the rest, such numerous marks of his
          rich bounty and goodness? What Israel, after man’s fall, enjoyed
          sensibly, Nehemiah calls “great goodness” (Neh. ix. 25). How
          inexpressible, then, was that goodness manifested to innocent man,
          when so small a part of it, indulged to the Israelites after the curse
          upon the ground, is called, as truly it merits, such great goodness!
          How can we pass through any part of this great city, and cast our eyes
          upon the well‑furnished shops, stored with all kinds of commodities,
          without reflections upon this goodness of God starting up before our
          eyes in such varieties, and plainly telling us that he hath
          accommodated all things for our use, suited things, both to supply our
          need, content a reasonable curiosity, and delight us in our aims at,
          and passage to, our supreme end!

          (3.) The goodness of God appears in the laws he hath given to man, the
          covenant he hath made with him. It had not been agreeable to the
          goodness of God to let a creature, governable by a law, be without a
          law to regulate him; his goodness then which had broke forth in the
          creation, had suffered an eclipse and obscurity in his government. As
          infinite goodness was the motive to create, so infinite goodness was
          the motive of his government. And this appears,
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] In the fitting the law to the nature of man. It was rather below
          than above his strength; he had an integrity in his nature to answer
          the righteousness of the precept. God created “man upright” (Eccles.
          vii. 29); his nature was suited to the law, and the law to his nature;
          it was not above his understanding to know it, nor his will to embrace
          it, nor his passions to be regulated by it. The law and his nature
          were like to exact straight lines, touching one another in every part
          when joined together. God exacted no more by his law than what was
          written by nature in his heart: he had a knowledge by creation to
          observe the law of his creation, and he fell not for want of a
          righteousness in his nature: he was enabled for more than was
          commanded him, but wilfully indisposed to less than he was able to
          perform. The precepts were easy, not only becoming the authority of a
          sovereign to exact, but the goodness of a father to demand, and the
          ingenuity of a creature and a son to pay. “His commands are not
          grievous” (1 John v. 3); the observance of them had filled the spirit
          of man with an extraordinary contentment. It had been no less a
          pleasure and a delightful satisfaction to have kept the law in a
          created state, than it is to keep it in some measure in a renewed
          state. The renewed nature finds a suitableness in the law to kindle a
          “delight” (Ps. i. 2): it could not then have anywise shook the nature
          of an upright creature, nor have been a burden too heavy for his
          shoulders to bear. Though he had not a grace given him above nature,
          yet he had not a law given him that surmounted his nature: it did not
          exceed his created strength, and was suited to the dignity and
          nobility of a rational nature. It was a “just law” (Rom. vii. 12),
          and, therefore, not above the nature of the subject that was bound to
          obey it. And had it been impossible to be observed, it had been
          unrighteous to be enacted: it had not been a matter of Divine praise,
          and that seven times a day; as it is, “Seven times a day do I praise
          thee, because of thy righteous judgments” (Ps. cxix. 164). The law was
          so righteous, that Adam had every whit as much reason to bless God in
          his innocence for the righteousness of it, as David had with the
          relics of enmity against it: his goodness shines so much in his law,
          as merits our praise of him, as he is a sovereign Lawgiver, as well as
          a gracious Benefactor, in the imparting to us a being.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] In fitting it for the happiness of man. For the satisfaction of
          his soul, which finds a reward in the very act of keeping it, (Ps.
          cxix. 165), “Great peace in the loving it;” for the preservation of
          human society, wherein consists the external felicity of man. It had
          been inconsistent with the Divine goodness to enjoin man anything that
          should be oppressive and uncomfortable. Bitterness cannot come from
          that which is altogether sweet: goodness would not have obliged the
          creature to anything, but what is not only free from damaging him, but
          wholly conducing to his welfare, and perfective of his nature.
          Infinite wisdom could not order anything but what was agreeable to
          infinite goodness. As his laws are the most rational, as being the
          contrivance of infinite wisdom; so they are the best, as being the
          fruit of infinite goodness. His laws are not only the acts of his
          sovereign authority, but the effluxes of his loving‑kindness, and the
          conductors of man to an enjoyment of a greater bounty: he minds as
          well the promotion of his creatures’ felicity, as the asserting his
          own authority; as good princes make laws for their subjects’ benefit
          as well as their own honor. What was said of a more difficult and
          burdensome law long after man’s fall, may much more be said of the
          easy law of nature in the state of man’s innocence, that it was “for
          our good” (Deut. x. 12, 13). He never pleaded with the Israelites for
          the observation of his commands upon the account of his authority, so
          much as upon the score of their benefit by them (Deut. iv. 40; xii.
          28). And when his precepts were broken, he seems sometimes to be more
          grieved for men’s impairing their own felicity by it, than for their
          violating his authority: “O, that thou hadst hearkened to my
          commandments, then had thy peace been as a river!” (Isa. xlviii. 18).
          Goodness cannot prescribe a thing prejudicial: whatsoever it enjoins,
          is beneficial to the spiritual and eternal happiness of the rational
          creature: this was both the design of the law given, and the end of
          the law. Christ, in his answer to the young man’s question, refers him
          to the moral law, which was the law of nature in Adam, as that whereby
          eternal life was to be gained: which evidenceth, that when the law was
          first given as the covenant of works, it was for the happiness of man;
          and the end of giving it was, that man might have eternal life by it:
          there would else be no strength or truth in that answer of Christ to
          that Ruler. And, therefore, Stephen calls the law given by Moses,
          which was the same with the law of nature in Adam, “the living
          oracles” (Acts vii. 38). He enjoined men’s services to them not simply
          for his own glory, but his glory in men’s welfare: as if there were
          any being better than himself, his goodness and righteousness would
          guide him to love that better than himself; because it is good and
          righteous to love that best which is most amiable: so, if there were
          any that could do us more good, and shower down more happiness upon us
          than himself, he would be content we should obey that as sovereign,
          and steer our course according to his laws: “If God be God, follow
          him; but if Baal, then follow him” (1 Kings xviii. 21). If the
          observance of the precepts of Baal be more beneficial to you; if you
          can advance your nature by his service, and gain a more mighty crown
          of happiness than by mine, follow him with all my heart: I never
          intended to enjoin you anything to impair, but increase your
          happiness. The chief design of God in his law is the happiness of the
          subject; and obedience is intended by him as a means for the attaining
          of happiness, as well as preserving his own sovereignty: this is the
          reason why he wished that Israel had walked in his ways, “that their
          time might have endured forever” (Ps. lxxxi. 13, 15, 16). And by the
          same reason, this was his intendment in his law given to man, and his
          covenant made with man at the creation, that he might be fed with the
          finest part of his bounty, and be satisfied with honey out of the
          eternal Rock of Ages. To paraphrase his expression there:—The goodness
          of God appears further,
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] In engaging man to obedience by promises and threatenings. A
          threatening is only mentioned (Gen. ii. 17), but a promise is implied:
          if eternal death were fixed for transgression, eternal life was
          thereby designed for obedience: and that it was so, the answer of
          Christ to the Ruler evidenceth, that the first intendment of the
          precept was the eternal life of the subject, ordered to obey it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. God might have acted, in settling his law, only as a sovereign.
          Though he might have dealt with man upon the score of his absolute
          dominion over him as his creature, and signified his pleasure upon the
          right of his sovereignty, threatening only a penalty if man
          transgressed, without the promising a bountiful acknowledgment of his
          obedience by a reward as a benefactor: yet he would treat with man in
          gentle methods, and rule him in a track of sweetness as well as
          sovereignty: he would preserve the rights of his dominion in the
          authority of his commands, and honor the condescensions of his
          goodness in the allurements of a promise. He that might have solely
          demanded a compliance with his will, would kindly article with him, to
          oblige him to observe him out of love to himself as well as duty to
          his Creator; that he might have both the interest of avoiding the
          threatened evil to affright him, and the interest of attaining the
          promised good to allure him to obedience. How doth he value the title
          of Benefactor above that of a Lord, when he so kindly solicits, as
          well as commands; and engageth to reward that obedience which he might
          have absolutely claimed as his due, by enforcing fears of the severest
          penalty! His sovereignty seems to stoop below itself for the elevation
          of his goodness; and he is pleased to have his kindness more taken
          notice of than his authority. Nothing imported more condescension than
          his bringing forth his law in the nature of a covenant, whereby he
          seems to humble himself, and veil his superiority to treat with man as
          his equal, that the very manner of his treatment might oblige him in
          the richest promises he made to draw him, and the startling
          threatenings he pronounced to link him to his obedience: and,
          therefore, is it observable, that when after the transgression of Adam
          God comes to deal with him, he doth not do it in that thundering
          rigor, which might have been expected from an enraged sovereign, but
          in a gentle examination (Gen. iii. 11, 13): “Hast thou eaten of the
          tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?” To the
          woman, he said no more than, “What is this that thou hast done?” And
          in the Scripture we find, when he cites the Israelites before him for
          their sin, he expostulates with them not so much upon the absolute
          right he had to challenge their obedience, as upon the equity and
          reasonableness of his law which they had transgressed; that by the
          same argument of sweetness, wherewith he would attract them to their
          duty, he might shame them after their offence (Isa. i. 2; Ezek. xviii.
          25).
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. By the threatenings he manifests his goodness as well as by his
          promises. He promises that he might be a rewarder, and threatens that
          he might not be a punisher; the one is to elevate our hope, and the
          other to excite our fear, the two passions whereby the nature of man
          is managed in the world. He imprints upon man sentiments of a misery
          by sin, in his thundering commination, that he might engage him the
          more to embrace and be guided by the motives of sweetness in his
          gracious promises. The design of them was to preserve man in his due
          bounds, that God might not have occasion to blow upon him the flames
          of his justice; to suppress those irregular passions, which the nature
          of man (though created without any disorder) was capable of
          entertaining upon the appearance of suitable objects; and to keep the
          waves from swelling upon any turning wind, that so man, being modest
          in the use of the goodness God had allowed him, might still be capable
          of fresh streams of Divine bounty, without ever falling under his
          righteous wrath for any transgression. What a prospect of goodness is
          in this proceeding, to disclose man’s happiness to be as durable as
          his innocence; and set before a rational creature the extremest misery
          due to his crime, to affright him from neglecting his Creator, and
          making unworthy returns to his goodness! What could be done more by
          goodness to suit that passion of fear which was implanted in the
          nature of man, than to assure him he should not degenerate from the
          righteousness of his nature, and violate the authority of his Creator,
          without falling from his own happiness, and sinking into the most
          deplorable calamity!
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. The reward he promised manifests yet further his goodness to man.
          It was his goodness to intend a reward to man; no necessity could
          oblige God to reward man, had he continued obedient in his created
          state: for in all rewards which are truly merited, beside some kind of
          equality to be considered between the person doing service and the
          person rewarding, and also between the act performed and the reward
          bestowed, there must also be considered the condition of the person
          doing the service, that he is not obliged to do it as a duty, but is
          at his own choice whether to offer it or no. But man, being wholly
          dependent on God in his being and preservation, having nothing of his
          own, but what he had received from the hands of Divine bounty, his
          service was due by the strongest obligation to God (1 Cor. iv. 7). But
          there was no natural engagement on God to return a reward to him; for
          man could return nothing of his own but that only which he had
          received from his Creator. It must be pure goodness that gives a
          gracious reward for a due debt, to receive his own from man, and
          return more than he had received. A Divine reward doth far surmount
          the value of a rational service. It was, therefore, a mighty goodness
          to stipulate with man, that upon his obedience he should enjoy an
          immortality in that nature. The article on man’s part was obedience,
          which was necessarily just, and founded in the nature of man; he had
          been unjust, ungrateful, and violated all laws of righteousness, had
          he committed any act unworthy of one that had been so great a subject
          of Divine liberality.977 But the article on God’s part, of giving a
          perpetual blessedness to innocent man, was not founded upon rules of
          strict justice and righteousness, for that would have argued God to be
          a debtor to man; but that God cannot be to the work of his hands, that
          had received the materials of his being and acting from him, as the
          vessel doth from the potter. But this was founded only on the goodness
          of the Divine nature, whereby he cannot but be kind to an innocent and
          holy creature. The nature of God inclined him to it by the rules of
          goodness, but the service of man could not claim it by the rules of
          justice without a stipulation; so that the covenant whereby God
          obliged himself to continue the happiness of man upon the continuance
          of his obedience, in the original of it, springs from pure goodness;
          though the performance of it, upon the fulfilling condition required
          in the creature, was founded upon the rules of righteousness and
          truth, after Divine goodness had brought it forth. God did create man
          for a reward and happiness; now God’s implanting in the nature of man
          a desire after happiness, and some higher happiness than he had in
          creation invested him in, doth evidence that God did not create man
          only for his own service, but for his attaining a greater happiness.
          All rational creatures are possessed with a principle of seeking after
          good, the highest good, and God did not plant in man this principle in
          vain; it had not been goodness to put this principle in man, if he had
          designed never to bestow a happiness on man for his obedience: this
          had been repugnant to the goodness and wisdom of God; and the
          Scripture doth very emphatically express the felicity of man to be the
          design of God in the first forming him and moulding him a creature, as
          well as working him a new creature; “He that hath wrought us for the
          self‑same thing is God” (2 Cor. v. 1, 5): he framed this earthly
          tabernacle for a residence in an eternal habitation, and a better
          habitation than an earthly paradise. What we expect in the
          resurrection, that very same thing God did in creation intend us for;
          but since the corruption of our natures, we must undergo a dissolution
          of our bodies, and may have just reason of a despondency, since sin
          hath seemed to change the course of God’s bounty, and brought us under
          a curse. He hath given us the earnest of his Spirit, as an assurance
          that he will perform that very self‑same thing, the conferring that
          happiness upon renewed creatures for which he first formed man in
          creation, when he compacted his earthly tabernacle of the dust of the
          ground, and reared it up before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. It was a mighty goodness that God should give man an eternal
          reward. That an eternity of reward was promised, is implied in the
          death that was threatened upon transgression: whatsoever you conceive
          the threatened death to be, either for nature, or duration upon
          transgression; of the same nature and duration you must suppose the
          life to be, which is implied upon his constancy in his integrity. As
          sin would render him an eternal object of God’s hatred, so his
          obedience would render him an eternally amiable object to his Creator,
          as the standing angels are preserved and confirmed in an entire
          felicity and glory. Though the threatening be only expressed by God
          (Gen. ii. 17), yet the other is implied, and might easily be concluded
          from it by Adam. And one reason why God only expressed the
          threatening, and not the promise, was, because man might collect some
          hopes and expectations of a perpetual happiness from that image of God
          which he beheld in himself, and from the large provision he had made
          for him in the world, and the commission given him to increase and
          multiply, and to rule as a lord over his other works; whereas he could
          not so easily have imagined himself capable of being exposed to such
          an extraordinary calamity as an eternal death, without some
          signification of it from God. It is easily concludable, that eternal
          life was supposed to be promised, to be conferred upon him if he
          stood, as well as eternal death to be inflicted on him if he
          rebelled.978 Now this eternal life was not due to his nature, but it
          was a pure beam, and gift of Divine goodness; for there was no
          proportion between man’s service in his innocent estate, and a reward
          so great both for nature and duration: it was a higher reward than can
          be imagined either due to the nature of man, or upon any natural right
          claimable by his obedience. All that could be expected by him was but
          a natural happiness, not a supernatural: as there was no necessity
          upon the account of natural righteousness, so there was no necessity
          upon the account of the goodness of God to elevate the nature of man
          to a supernatural happiness, merely because he created him: for though
          it be necessary for God, when he would create, in regard of his
          wisdom, to create for some end, yet it was not necessary that end
          should be a supernatural end and happiness, since a natural
          blessedness had been sufficient for man. And though God, in creating
          angels and men intellectual and rational creatures, did make them
          necessary for himself and his own glory, yet it was not necessarily
          for him to order either angels or men to such a felicity as consists
          in a clear vision, and so high a fruition, of himself: for all other
          things are made by him for himself, and yet not for the vision of
          himself, God might have created man only for a natural happiness,
          according to the perfection of his natural faculties, and had dealt
          bountifully with him, if he had never intended him a supernatural
          blessedness and an eternal recompense: but what a largeness of
          goodness is here, to design man, in his creation, for so rich a
          blessedness as an eternal life, with the fruition of himself! He hath
          not only given to man all things which are necessary, but designed for
          man that which the poor creature could not imagine: he garnished the
          earth for him, and garnished him for an eternal felicity, had he not,
          by slighting the goodness of God, stripped himself of the present, and
          forfeited his future blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, The manifestation of this goodness in Redemption. The whole
          gospel is nothing but one entire mirror of Divine goodness: the whole
          of redemption is wrapped up in that one expression of the angels’ song
          (Luke ii. 14), “Good‑will towards men.” The angels sang but one song
          before, which is upon record, but the matter of it seems to be the
          wisdom of God chiefly in creation (Job xxxviii. 7; compare chap. ix.
          5, 6, 8, 9). The angels are there meant by the “morning stars;” the
          visible stars of heaven were not distinctly formed when the
          foundations of the earth were laid: and the title of the sons of God
          verifies it, since none but creatures of understanding are dignified
          in Scripture with that title. There they celebrate his wisdom in
          creation; here his goodness in redemption, which is the entire matter
          of the song.
        </p>
        <p>
          i. Goodness was the spring of redemption. All and every part of it
          owes only to this perfection the appearance of it in the world. This
          only excited wisdom to bring forth from so great an evil as the
          apostasy of man, so great a good as the recovery of him. When man fell
          from his created goodness, God would evidence that he could not fall
          from his infinite goodness: that the greatest evil could not surmount
          the ability of his wisdom to contrive, nor the riches of his bounty to
          present us a remedy for it. Divine Goodness would not stand by a
          spectator, without being reliever of that misery man had plunged
          himself into; but by astonishing methods it would recover him to
          happiness, who had wrested himself out of his hands, to fling himself
          into the most deplorable calamity: and it was the greater, since it
          surmounted those natural inclinations, and those strong provocations
          which he had to shower down the power of his wrath. What could be the
          source of such a procedure, but this excellency of Divine nature,
          since no violence could force him, nor was there any merit to persuade
          to such a restoration? This, under the name of his “love,” is rendered
          the sole cause of the redeeming death of the Son: it was to commend
          his love with the highest gloss, and in so singular a manner that had
          not its parallel in nature, nor in all his other works, and reaches in
          the brightness of it beyond the manifested extent of any other
          attribute (Rom. v. 8). It must be only a miraculous goodness that
          induced him to expose the life of his Son to those difficulties in the
          world, and death upon the cross, for the freedom of sordid rebels: his
          great end was to give such a demonstration of the liberality of his
          nature, as might be attractive to his creature, remove its shakings
          and tremblings, and encourage its approaches to him. It is in this he
          would not only manifest his love, but assume the name of “Love.” By
          this name the Holy Ghost calls him, in relation to this good will
          manifested in his Son (1 John iv. 8, 9), “God is love.” In this is
          manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his
          only‑begotten Son into the world, that we might “live through him.” He
          would take the name he never expressed himself in before. He was
          Jehovah, in regard of the truth of his promise; so he would be known
          of old: he is Goodness, in regard of the grandeur of his affection in
          the mission of his Son: and, therefore, he would be known by the name
          of Love now, in the days of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          ii. It was a pure goodness. He was under no obligation to pity our
          misery, and repair our ruins: he might have stood to the terms of the
          first covenant, and exacted our eternal death, since we had committed
          an infinite transgression: he was under no tie to put off the robes of
          a judge for the bowels of a father, and erect a mercy‑seat above his
          tribunal of justice.979 The reparation of man had no necessary
          connexion with his creation; it follows not, that because Goodness had
          extracted us from nothing by a mighty power, that it must lift us out
          of wilful misery by a mighty grace. Certainly that God who had no need
          of creating us, had far less need of redeeming us: for, since he
          created one world, he could have as easily destroyed it, and reared
          another. It had not been unbecoming the Divine Goodness or Wisdom, to
          have let man perpetually wallow in that sink wherein he had plunged
          himself, since he was criminal by his own will, and, therefore,
          miserable by his own fault: nothing could necessitate this reparation.
          If Divine Goodness could not be obliged by the angelical dignity to
          repair that nature, he is further from any obligation by the meanness
          of man to repair human nature. There was less necessity to restore man
          than to restore the fallen angels. What could man do to oblige God to
          a reparation of him, since he could not render him a recompense for
          his goodness manifested in his creation? He must be much more impotent
          to render him a debtor for the redemption of him from misery. Could it
          be a salary for anything we had done? Alas! we are so far from
          meriting it, that by our daily demerits, we seem ambitious to put a
          stop to any further effusions of it: we could not have complained of
          him, if he had left us in the misery we had courted, since he was
          bound by no law to bestow upon us the recovery we wanted. When the
          apostle speaks of the gospel of “redemption,” he giveth it the title
          of the “gospel of the blessed God” (2 Tim. i. 11). It was the gospel
          of a God abounding in his own blessedness, which received no addition
          by man’s redemption; if he had been blessed by it, it had been a
          goodness to himself, as well as to the creature: it was not an
          indigent goodness needing the receiving anything from us; but it was a
          pure goodness, streaming out of itself, without bringing anything into
          itself for the perfection of it: there was no goodness in us to be the
          motive of his love, but his goodness was the fountain of our benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          iii. It was a distinct goodness of the whole Trinity. In the creation
          of man we find a general consultation (Gen. i. 26), without those
          distinct labors and offices of each person, and without those raised
          expressions and marks of joy and triumph as at man’s restoration. In
          this there are distinct functions; the grace of the Father, the merit
          of the Son, and the efficacy of the Spirit. The Father makes the
          promise of redemption, the Son seals it with his blood, and the Spirit
          applies it. The Father adopts us to be his children, the Son redeems
          us to be his members, and the Spirit renews us to be his temples. In
          this the Father testifies himself well‑pleased in a voice; the Son
          proclaims his own delight to do the will of God, and the Spirit
          hastens, with the wing of a dove, to fit him for his work, and
          afterwards, in his apparition in the likeness of fiery tongues,
          manifests his zeal for the propagation of the redeeming gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          iv. The effects of it proclaim His great goodness. It is by this we
          are delivered from the corruption of our nature, the ruin of our
          happiness, the deformity of our sins, and the punishment of our
          transgressions; he frees us from the ignorance wherewith we were
          darkened and from the slavery wherein we were fettered. When he came
          to make Adam’s process after his crime, instead of pronouncing the
          sentence of death he had merited, he utters a promise that man could
          not have expected; his kindness swells above his provoked justice,
          and, while he chaseth him out of paradise, he gives him hopes of
          regaining the same, or a better habitation; and is, in the whole, more
          ready to prevent him with the blessings of his goodness, than charge
          him with the horror of his crimes (Gen. iii. 15). It is a goodness
          that pardons us more transgressions than there are moments in our
          lives, and overlooks as many follies as there are thoughts in our
          heart: he doth not only relieve our wants, but restores us to our
          dignity. It is a greater testimony of goodness to instate a person in
          the highest honors, than barely to supply his present necessity: it is
          an admirable pity whereby he was inclined to redeem us, and an
          incomparable affection whereby he was resolved to exalt us. What can
          be desired more of him than his goodness hath granted? He hath sought
          us out when we were lost, and ransomed us when we were captives; he
          hath pardoned us when we were condemned, and raised us when we were
          dead. In creation he reared us from nothing, in redemption he delivers
          our understanding from ignorance and vanity, and our wills from
          impotence and obstinacy, and our whole man from a death worse than
          that nothing he drew us from by creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          v. Hence we may consider the height of this goodness in redemption to
          exceed that in creation. He gave man a being in creation, but did not
          draw him from inexpressible misery by that act. His liberality in the
          gospel doth infinitely surpass what we admire in the works of nature;
          his goodness in the latter is more astonishing to our belief, than his
          goodness in creation is visible to our eye. There is more of his
          bounty expressed in that one verse, “So God loved the world, that he
          gave his only begotten Son” (John iii. 16), than there is in the whole
          volume of the world: it is an incomprehensible so; a so that all the
          angels in heaven cannot analyse; and few comment upon, or understand,
          the dimensions of this so. In creation he formed an innocent creature
          of the dust of the ground; in redemption he restores a rebellious
          creature by the blood of his Son: it is greater than that goodness
          manifested in creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. In regard of the difficulty in effecting it. In creation, mere
          nothing was vanquished to bring us into being; in redemption, sullen
          enmity was conquered for the enjoyment of our restoration; in
          creation, he subdued a nullity to make us creatures; in redemption,
          his goodness overcomes his omnipotent justice to restore us to
          felicity. A word from the mouth of Goodness inspired the dust of men’s
          bodies with a living soul; but the blood of his Son must be shed, and
          the laws of natural affection seems to be overturned, to lay the
          foundation of our renewed happiness. In the first, heaven did but
          speak, and the earth was formed; in the second, heaven itself must
          sink to earth, and be clothed with dusty earth, to reduce man’s dust
          to its original state.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. This goodness is greater than that manifested in creation, in
          regard of its cost. This was a more expensive goodness than what was
          laid out in creation. “The redemption of one soul is precious” (Ps.
          xlix. 8), much more costly than the whole fabric of the world, or as
          many worlds as the understandings of angels in their utmost extent can
          conceive to be created. For the effecting of this, God parts with his
          dearest treasure, and his Son eclipses his choicest glory. For this,
          God must be made man, Eternity must suffer death, the Lord of angels
          must weep in a cradle, and the Creator of the world must hang like a
          slave; he must be in a manger in Bethlehem, and die upon a cross on
          Calvary; unspotted righteousness must be made sin, and unblemished
          blessedness be made a curse. He was at no other expense than the
          breath of his mouth to form man; the fruits of the earth could have
          maintained innocent man without any other cost; but his broken nature
          cannot be healed without the invaluable medicine of the blood of God.
          View Christ in the womb and in the manger, in his weary steps and
          hungry bowels, in his prostrations in the garden, and in his clodded
          drops of bloody sweat; view his head pierced with a crown of thorns,
          and his face besmeared with the soldiers’ slabber; view him in his
          march to Calvary, and his elevation on the painful cross, with his
          head hanged down, and his side streaming blood; view him pelted with
          the scoffs of the governors, and the derisions of the rabble; and see,
          in all this, what cost Goodness was at for man’s redemption! In
          creation, his power made the sun to shine upon us, and, in redemption,
          his bowels sent a Son to die for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. This goodness of God in redemption is greater than that manifested
          in creation, in regard of man’s desert of the contrary. In the
          creation, as there was nothing without him to allure him to the
          expressions of his bounty, so there was nothing that did damp the
          inclinations of his goodness: the nothing from whence the world was
          drawn, could never merit, nor demerit a being, because it was nothing;
          as there was nothing to engage him, so there was nothing to disoblige
          him; as his favor could not be merited, so neither could his anger be
          deserved. But in this he finds ingratitude against the former marks of
          his goodness, and rebellion against the sweetness of his
          sovereignty,—crimes unworthy of the dews of goodness, and worthy of
          the sharpest strokes of vengeance; and therefore the Scripture
          advanceth the honor of it above the title of mere goodness, to that of
          “grace” (Rom. i. 2; Titus ii. 11); because men were not only unworthy
          of a blessing, but worthy of a curse. An innocent nothing more
          deserves creation, than a culpable creature deserves an exemption from
          destruction. When man fell, and gave occasion to God to repent of his
          created work, his ravishing goodness surmounted the occasions he had
          of repenting, and the provocations he had to the destruction of his
          frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. It was a greater goodness than was expressed towards the angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A greater goodness than was expressed towards the standing angels.
          The Son of God did no more expose his life for the confirmation of
          those that stood, than for the restoration of those that fell; the
          death of Christ was not for the holy angels, but for simple man; they
          needed the grace of God to confirm them, but not the death of Christ
          to restore or preserve them; they had a beloved holiness to be
          established by the powerful grace of God, but not any abominable sin
          to be blotted out by the blood of God; they had no debt to pay but
          that of obedience; but we had both a debt of obedience to the
          precepts, and a debt of suffering to the penalty, after the fall.
          Whether the holy angels were confirmed by Christ, or no, is a
          question: some think they were, from Colos. i. 20, where “things in
          heaven” are said to be “reconciled;” but some think, that place
          signifies no more than the reconciliation of things in heaven, if
          meant of the angels, to things on earth, with whom they were at enmity
          in the cause of their Sovereign; or the reconciliation of things in
          heaven to God, is meant the glorified saints, who were once in a state
          of sin, and whom the death of Christ upon the cross reached, though
          dead long before. But if angels were confirmed by Christ, it was by
          him not as a slain sacrifice, but as a sovereign Head of the whole
          creation, appointed by God to gather all things into one; which some
          think to be the intendment of Eph. i. 10, where all things, as well
          those in heaven, as those in earth, are said to be “gathered together
          in one, in Christ.” Where is a syllable in Scripture of his being
          crucified for angels, but only for sinners? Not for the confirmation
          of the one, but the reconciliation of the other; so that the goodness
          whereby God continued those blessed spirits in heaven, through the
          effusions of his grace, is a small thing to the restoring us to our
          forfeited happiness, through the streams of Divine blood. The
          preserving a man in life is a little thing, and a smaller benefit than
          the raising a man from death. The rescuing a man from an ignominious
          punishment, lays a greater obligation than barely to prevent him from
          committing a capital crime. The preserving a man standing upon the top
          of a steep hill, is more easy than to bring a crippled and phthisical
          man, from the bottom to the top. The continuance God gave to the
          angels, is not so signal a mark of his goodness as the deliverance he
          gave to us; since they were not sunk into sin, nor by any crime fallen
          into misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His goodness in redemption is greater than any goodness expressed
          to the fallen angels. It is the wonder of his goodness to us, that he
          was mindful of fallen man, and careless of fallen angels; that he
          should visit man, wallowing in death and blood, with the dayspring
          from on high, and never turn the Egyptian darkness of devils into
          cheerful day; when they sinned, Divine thunder dashed them into hell;
          when man sinned, Divine blood wafts the fallen creature from his
          misery: the angels wallow in their own blood forever, while Christ is
          made partaker of our blood, and wallows in his blood, that we might
          not forever corrupt in ours; they tumbled down from heaven, and Divine
          goodness would not vouchsafe to catch them; man tumbles down, and
          Divine goodness holds out a hand drenched in the blood of Him, that
          was from the foundations of the world, to lift us up (Heb. ii. 16). He
          spared not those dignified spirits, when they revolted; and spared not
          punishing his Son for dusty man, when he offended; when he might as
          well forever have let man lie in the chains wherein he had entangled
          himself, as them. We were as fit objects of justice as they, and they
          as fit objects of goodness as we; they were not more wretched by their
          fall than we; and the poverty of our nature rendered us more unable to
          recover ourselves, than the dignity of theirs did them; they were his
          Reuben, his first‑born; they were his might, and the beginning of his
          strength; yet those elder sons he neglected, to prefer the younger;
          they were the prime and golden pieces of creation, not laden with
          gross matter, yet they lie under the ruins of their fall, while man,
          lead in comparison of them, is refined for another world. They seemed
          to be fitter objects of Divine goodness, in regard of the eminency of
          their nature above the human; one angel excelled in endowments of mind
          and spirit, vastness of understanding, greatness of power, all the
          sons of men; they were more capable to praise him, more capable to
          serve him; and because of the acuteness of their comprehension, more
          able to have a due estimate of such a redemption, had it been afforded
          them; yet that goodness which had created them so comely, would not
          lay itself out in restoring the beauty they had defaced. The promise
          was of bruising the serpent’s head for us, not of lifting up the
          serpent’s head with us; their nature was not assumed, nor any command
          given them to believe or repent; not one devil spared, not one
          apostate spirit recovered, not one of those eminent creatures
          restored; every one of them hath only a prospect of misery, without
          any glimpse of recovery; they were ruined under one sin, and we
          repaired under many. All His redeeming goodness was laid out upon man
          (Ps. cxliv. 3); “What is man that thou takest knowledge of him; and
          the Son of man, that thou makest account of him?” Making account of
          him above angels; as they fell without any tempting them, so God would
          leave them to rise, without any assisting them. I know the schools
          trouble themselves to find out the reasons of this peculiarity of
          grace to man, and not to them; because the whole human nature fell,
          but only a part of the angelical; the one sinned by a seduction, and
          the other by a sullenness, without any tempter; every angel sinned by
          his own proper will, whereas Adam’s posterity sinned by the will of
          the first man, the common root of all. God would deprive the devil of
          any glory in the satisfaction of his envious desire to hinder man from
          attainment and possession of that happiness which himself had lost.
          The weakness of man below the angelical nature might excite the Divine
          mercy; and since all the things of the lower world were created for
          man, God would not lose the honor of his works, by losing the
          immediate end for which he framed them. And finally, because in the
          restoration of angels, there would have been only a restoration of one
          nature, that was not comprehensive of the nature of inferior things;
          but after all such conjectures, man must sit down, and acknowledge
          Divine goodness to be the only spring, without any other motive. Since
          Infinite Wisdom could have contrived a way for redemption for fallen
          angels, as well as for fallen man, and restored both the one and the
          other; why might not Christ have assumed their nature as well as ours,
          into the unity of the Divine person, and suffered the wrath of God in
          their nature for them, as well as in his human soul for us? It is as
          conceivable that two natures might have been assumed by the Son of
          God, as well as three souls be in man distinct, as some think there
          are.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To enhance this goodness yet higher; it was a greater goodness to
          us, than was for a time manifested to Christ himself. To demonstrate
          his goodness to man, in preventing his eternal ruin, he would for a
          while withhold his goodness from his Son, by exposing his life as the
          price of our ransom; not only subjecting him to the derisions of
          enemies, desertions of friends, and malice of devils, but to the
          inexpressible bitterness of his own wrath in his soul, as made an
          offering for sin. The particle so (John iii. 16), seems to intimate
          this supremacy of goodness; He “so loved the world, that he gave his
          only begotten Son.” He so loved the world, that he seemed for a time
          not to love his Son in comparison of it, or equal with it. The person
          to whom a gift is given is, in that regard, accounted more valuable
          than the gift or present made to him: thus God valued our redemption
          above the worldly happiness of the Redeemer, and sentenceth him to an
          humiliation on earth, in order to our exaltation in heaven; he was
          desirous to hear him groaning, and see him bleeding, that we might not
          groan under his frowns, and bleed under his wrath; he spared not him,
          that he might spare us; refused not to strike him, that he might be
          well pleased with us; drenched his sword in the blood of his Son, that
          it might not forever be wet with ours, but that his goodness might
          forever triumph in our salvation; he was willing to have his Son made
          man, and die, rather than man should perish, who had delighted to ruin
          himself; he seemed to degrade him for a time from what he was.980 But
          since he could not be united to any but to an intellectual creature,
          he could not be united to any viler and more sordid creature than the
          earthly nature of man: and when this Son, in our nature, prayed that
          the cup might pass from him, Goodness would not suffer it, to show how
          it valued the manifestation of itself, in the salvation of man, above
          the preservation of the life of so dear a person.
        </p>
        <p>In particular, wherein this goodness appears:—</p>
        <p>
          1st. The first resolution to redeem, and the means appointed for
          redemption, could have no other inducement but Divine goodness. We
          cannot too highly value the merit of Christ; but we must not so much
          extend the merit of Christ, as to draw a value to eclipse the goodness
          of God; though we owe our redemption and the fruits of it to the death
          of Christ, yet we owe not the first resolutions of redemption, and
          assumption of our nature, the means of redemption, to the merit of
          Christ. Divine goodness only, without the association of any merit,
          not only of man, but of the Redeemer himself, begat the first purpose
          of our recovery; he was singled out, and predestinated to be our
          Redeemer, before he took our nature to merit our redemption. “God sent
          his Son,” is a frequent expression in the Gospel of St. John (John
          iii. 34; v. 24; xvii. 3). To what end did God send Christ, but to
          redeem? The purpose of redemption, therefore, preceded the pitching
          upon Christ as the means and procuring cause of it, i. e. of our
          actual redemption, but not of the redeeming purpose; the end is always
          in intention before the means.981 “God so loved the world, that he
          gave his only begotten Son;” the love of God to the world was first in
          intention, and the order of nature, before the will of giving his Son
          to the world. His intention of saving was before the mission of a
          Saviour; so that this affection rose, not from the merit of Christ,
          but the merit of Christ was directed by this affection. It was the
          effect of it, not the cause. Nor was the union of our nature with his
          merited by him; all his meritorious acts were performed in our nature;
          the nature, therefore, wherein he performed it, was not merited; that
          grace which was not, could not merit what it was; he could not merit
          that humanity, which must be assumed before he could merit anything
          for us, because all merit for us must be offered in the nature which
          had offended. It is true “Christ gave himself,” but by the order of
          Divine goodness; he that begat him, pitched upon him, and called him
          to this great work (Heb. v. 5); he is therefore called “the Lamb of
          God,” as being set apart by God to be a propitiating and appeasing
          sacrifice. He is the “Wisdom of God,” since from the Father he reveals
          the counsel and order of redemption. In this regard he calls God “his
          God” in the prophet (Isa. xlix. 4), and in the evangelist (John xx.
          17); though he was big with affection for the accomplishment, yet he
          came not to do his “own will,” but the will of Divine goodness; his
          own will it was, too, but not principally, as being the first wheel in
          motion, but subordinate to the eternal will of Divine bounty. It was
          by the will of God that he came, and by his will he drank the dreggy
          cup of bitterness. Divine justice laid “upon him the iniquity of us
          all,” but Divine goodness intended it for our rescue; Divine goodness
          singled him out, and set him apart; Divine goodness invited him to it;
          Divine goodness commanded him to effect it, and put a law into his
          heart, to bias him in the performing of it; Divine goodness sent him,
          and Divine goodness moved justice to bruise him; and, after his
          sacrifice, Divine goodness accepted him, and caressed him for it. So
          earnest was it for our redemption, as to give out special and
          irreversible orders: death was commanded to be endured by him for us,
          and life commanded to be imparted by him to us (John x. 16, 18). If
          God had not been the mover, but had received the proposal from
          another, he might have heard it, but was not bound to grant it; his
          sovereign authority, was not under any obligation to receive another’s
          sponsion for the miserable criminal. As Christ is the head of man, so
          “God is the head of Christ” (1 Cor. xi. 3); he did nothing but by his
          directions, as he was not a Mediator, but by the constitution of
          Divine goodness. As a “liberal man deviseth liberal things” (Isa. ii.
          8), so did a bountiful God devise a bountiful act, wherein his
          kindness and love as a Saviour appeared: he was possessed with the
          resolutions to manifest his goodness in Christ, “in the beginning of
          his way” (Prov. viii. 22, 23), before he descended to the act of
          creation. This intention of goodness preceded his making that creature
          man, who, he foresaw, would fall, and, by his fall, disjoint and
          entangle the whole frame of the world, without such a provision.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. In God’s giving Christ to be our Redeemer, he gave the highest
          gift that it was possible for Divine goodness to bestow. As there is
          not a greater God than himself to be conceived, so there is not a
          greater gift for this great God to present to his creatures: never did
          God go farther, in any of his excellent perfections, than this. It is
          such a dole that cannot be transcended with a choicer; he is, as it
          were, come to the last mite of his treasure; and though he could
          create millions of worlds for us, he cannot give a greater Son to us.
          He could abound in the expressions of his power, in new creations of
          worlds, which have not yet been seen, and in the lustre of his wisdom
          in more stately structures; but if he should frame as many worlds as
          there are mites of dust and matter in this, and make every one of them
          as bright and glorious as the sun, though his power and wisdom would
          be more signalized, yet his goodness could not, since he hath not a
          choicer gift to bless those brighter worlds withal, than he hath
          conferred upon this: nor can immense goodness contrive a richer means
          to conduct those worlds to happiness, than he hath both invented for
          this world, and presented it with. It cannot be imagined, that it can
          extend itself farther than to give a gift equal with himself; a gift
          as dear to him as himself. His wisdom, had it studied millions of
          eternities (excuse the expression, since eternity admits of no
          millions, it being an interminable duration), it could have found out
          no more to give; this goodness could have bestowed no more, and our
          necessity could not have required a greater offering for our relief.
          When God intended, in redemption, the manifestation of his highest
          goodness, it could not be without the donation of the choicest gift;
          as, when he would insure our comfort, he swears “by himself,” because
          he cannot swear “by a greater” (Heb. vi. 13): so, when we would insure
          our happiness, he gives us his Son, because he cannot give a greater,
          being equal with himself. Had the Father given himself in person, he
          had given one first in order, but not greater in essence and glorious
          perfections: it could have been no more than the life of God, and
          should then have been laid down for us; and so it was now, since the
          human nature did not subsist but in his Divine person.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a greater gift than worlds, or all things purchased by him.
          What was this gift but “the image of his person, and the brightness of
          his glory” (Heb. i. 3)? What was this gift but one as rich as eternal
          blessedness could make him? What was this gift, but one that possessed
          the fulness of earth, and the more immense riches of heaven? It is a
          more valuable present, than if he presented us with thousands of
          worlds of angels and inferior creatures, because his person is
          incomparably greater, not only than all conceivable, but
          inconceivable, creations; we are more obliged to him for it, than if
          he had made us angels of the highest rank in heaven, because it is a
          gift of more value than the whole angelical nature, because he is an
          infinite person, and therefore infinitely transcends whatsoever is
          finite, though of the highest dignity. The wounds of an Almighty God
          for us are a greater testimony of goodness, than if we had all the
          other riches of heaven and earth. This perfection had not appeared in
          such an astonishing grandeur, had it pardoned us without so rich a
          satisfaction; that had been pardon to our sin, not a God of our
          nature. “God so loved the world” that he pardoned it, had not sounded
          so great and so good, as God so loved the world, that he “gave his
          only‑begotten Son.” Est aliquid in Christo formosius Servatore. There
          is something in Christ more excellent and comely than the office of a
          Saviour; the greatness of his person is more excellent, than the
          salvation procured by his death: it was a greater gift than was
          bestowed upon innocent Adam, or the holy angels. In the creation, his
          goodness gave us creatures for our use: in our redemption, his
          goodness gives us what was dearest to him for our service, our
          Sovereign in office to benefit us, as well as in a royalty to govern
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It was a greater gift, because it was his own Son, not an angel. It
          had been a mighty goodness to have given one of the lofty seraphims; a
          greater goodness to have given the whole corporation of those glorious
          spirits for us, those children of the Most High: but he gave that Son,
          whom he commands “all the angels to worship” (Heb. i. 6), and all men
          to adore, and pay the “lowest homage to” (Ps. ii. 12); that Son that
          is to be honored by us, as we “honor the Father” (John v. 23); that
          Son which was his “delight” (Prov. viii. 30); his delights in the
          Hebrew, wherein all the delights of the Father were gathered in one,
          as well as of the whole creation; and not simply a Son, but an
          only‑begotten Son, upon which Christ lays the stress with an emphasis
          (1 John iii. 16). He had but one Son in heaven or earth, one Son from
          an unviewable eternity, and that one Son he gave for a degenerate
          world; this son he consecrated for “evermore a Priest” (Heb. vii. 28).
          “The word of the oath makes the Son;” the peculiarity of his Sonship
          heightens the goodness of the Donor. It was no meaner a person that he
          gave to empty himself of his glory, to fulfil an obedience for us,
          that we might be rendered happy partakers of the Divine nature. Those
          that know the natural affection of a father to a son, must judge the
          affection of God the Father to the Son infinitely greater, than the
          affection of an earthly father to the son of his bowels. It must be an
          unparalleled goodness, to give up a Son that he loved with so ardent
          an affection, for the redemption of rebels: abandon a glorious Son to
          a dishonorable death, for the security of those that had violated the
          laws of righteousness, and endeavored to pull the sovereign crown from
          his head. Besides, being an only Son, all those affections centered in
          him, which in parents would have been divided among a multitude of
          children: so, then, as it was a testimony of the highest faith and
          obedience in “Abraham to offer up his only‑begotten son to God” (Heb.
          xi. 17); so it was the triumph of Divine goodness, to give so great,
          so dear a person, for so little a thing as man; and for such a piece
          of nothing and vanity, as a sinful world.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And this Son given to rescue us by his death. It was a gift to us;
          for our sakes he descended from his throne, and dwelt on earth; for
          our sakes he was “made flesh,” and infirm flesh; for our sakes he was
          “made a curse,” and scorched in the furnace of his Father’s wrath; for
          our sakes he went naked, armed only with his own strength, into the
          lists of that combat with the devils, that led us captive. Had he
          given him to be a leader for the conquest of some earthly enemies, it
          had been a great goodness to display his banners, and bring us under
          his conduct; but he sent him to lay down his life in the bitterest and
          most inglorious manner, and exposed him to a cursed death for our
          redemption from that dreadful curse, which would have broken us to
          pieces, and irreparably have crushed us. He gave him to us, to suffer
          for us as a man, and redeem us as a God; to be a sacrifice to expiate
          our sin by translating the punishment upon himself, which was merited
          by us. Thus was he made low to exalt us, and debased to advance us,
          “made poor to enrich us” (2 Cor. viii. 9); and eclipsed to brighten
          our sullied natures, and wounded, that he might be a physician for our
          languishments. He was ordered to taste the bitter cup of death, that
          we might drink of the rivers of immortal life and pleasures: to submit
          to the frailties of the human nature, that we might possess the
          glories of the divine: he was ordered to be a sufferer, that we might
          be no longer captives; and to pass through the fire of Divine wrath,
          that he might purge our nature from the dross it had contracted. Thus
          was the righteous given for sin, the innocent for criminals, the glory
          of heaven for the dregs of earth, and the immense riches of a Deity
          expended to restock man.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And a Son that was exalted for what he had done for us by the order
          of Divine goodness. The exaltation of Christ was no less a signal mark
          of his miraculous goodness to us, than of his affection to him: since
          he was obedient by Divine goodness to die for us, his advancement was
          for his obedience to those orders. The name given to him “above every
          name” (Phil. ii. 8, 9), was a repeated triumph of this perfection;
          since his passion was not for himself, he was wholly innocent, but for
          us who were criminal. His advancement was not only for himself as
          Redeemer, but for us as redeemed: Divine goodness centered in him,
          both in his cross and in his crown; for it was for the “purging our
          sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high” (Heb. i.
          3): and the whole blessed society of principalities and powers in
          heaven admire this goodness of God, and ascribe to him “honor, glory,
          and power” for advancing the “Lamb slain” (Rev. v. 11‒13). Divine
          goodness did not only give him to us, but gave him power, riches,
          strength, and honor, for manifesting this goodness to us, and opening
          the passages for its fuller conveyances to the sons of men. Had not
          God had thoughts of a perpetual goodness, he would not have settled
          him so near him, to manage our cause, and testified so much affection
          to him on our behalf. This goodness gave him to be debased for us, and
          ordered him to be enthroned for us: as it gave him to us bleeding, so
          it would give him to us triumphing; that as we have a share by grace
          in the merits of his humiliation, we might partake also of the glories
          of his coronation; that, from first to last, we may behold nothing but
          the triumphs of Divine goodness to fallen man.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In bestowing this gift on us, Divine goodness gives whole God to
          us. Whatsoever is great and excellent in the Godhead, the Father gives
          us, by giving us his Son: the Creator gives himself to us in his Son
          Christ. In giving creatures to us, he gives the riches of earth; in
          giving himself to us, he gives the riches of heaven, which surmount
          all understanding: it is in this gift he becomes our God, and passeth
          over the title of all that he is for our use and benefit, that every
          attribute in the Divine nature may be claimed by us; not to be
          imparted to us whereby we may be deified, but employed for our
          welfare, whereby we may be blessed. He gave himself in creation to us
          in the image of his holiness; but, in redemption, he gave himself in
          the image of his person: he would not only communicate the goodness
          without him, but bestow upon us the infinite goodness of his own
          nature; that that which was his own end and happiness might be our end
          and happiness, viz. himself. By giving his Son, he hath given himself;
          and in both gifts he hath given all things to us. The Creator of all
          things is eminently all things: “He hath given all things into the
          hands of his Son” (John iii. 35); and, by consequence, given all
          things into the hands of his redeemed creatures, by giving them Him to
          whom he gave all things; whatsoever we were invested in by creation,
          whatsoever we were deprived of by corruption, and more, he hath
          deposited in safe hands for our enjoyment: and what can Divine
          goodness do more for us? What further can it give unto us, than what
          it hath given, and in that gift designed for us?
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. This goodness is enhanced by considering the state of man in the
          first transgression, and since.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man’s first transgression. If we should rip up every vein of that
          first sin, should we find any want of wickedness to excite a just
          indignation? What was there but ingratitude to Divine bounty, and
          rebellion against Divine sovereignty? The royalty of God was
          attempted; the supremacy of Divine knowledge above man’s own knowledge
          envied; the riches of goodness, whereby he lived and breathed,
          slighted. There is a discontent with God upon an unreasonable
          sentiment, that God had denied a knowledge to him which was his right
          and due, when there should have been an humble acknowledgment of that
          unmerited goodness, which had not only given him a being above other
          creatures, but placed him the governor and lord of those that were
          inferior to him. What alienation of his understanding was there from
          knowing God, and of his will from loving him! A debauch of all his
          faculties; a spiritual adultery, in preferring, not only one of God’s
          creatures, but one of his desperate enemies, before him; thinking him
          a wiser counsellor than Infinite Wisdom, and imagining him possessed
          with kinder affections to him than that God who had newly created him.
          Thus he joins in league with hell against heaven, with a fallen spirit
          against his bountiful Benefactor, and enters into society with rebels
          that just before commenced a war against his and their common
          Sovereign: he did not only falter in, but cast off, the obedience due
          to his Creator; endeavored to purloin his glory, and actually murdered
          all those that were virtually in his loins. “Sin entered into the
          world” by him, “and death by sin, and passed upon all men” (Rom. v.
          12), taking them off from their subjection to God, to be slaves to the
          damned spirits, and heirs of their misery: and, after all this, he
          adds a foul imputation on God, taxing him as the author of his sin,
          and thereby stains the beauty of his holiness. But, notwithstanding
          all this, God stops not up the flood‑gates of his goodness, nor doth
          he entertain fiery resolutions against man, but brings forth a healing
          promise; and sends not an angel upon commission to reveal it to him,
          but preaches it himself to this forlorn and rebellious creature (Gen.
          iii. 15).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Could there be anything in this fallen creature to allure God to
          the expression of his goodness? Was there any good action in all his
          carriage that could plead for a re‑admission of him to his former
          state? Was there one good quality left, that could be an orator to
          persuade Divine goodness to such a gracious procedure? Was there any
          moral goodness in man, after this debauch, that might be an object of
          Divine love? What was there in him, that was not rather a provocation
          than an allurement? Could you expect that any perfection in God should
          find a motive in this ungrateful apostate to open a mouth for him, and
          be an advocate to support him, and bring him off from a just tribunal?
          or, after Divine goodness had begun to pity and plead for man, is it
          not wonderful that it should not discontinue the plea, after it found
          man’s excuse to be as black as his crime (Gen. iii. 12), and his
          carriage, upon his examination, to be as disobliging as his first
          revolt? It might well be expected, that all the perfections in the
          Divine nature would have entered into an association eternally to
          treat this rebel according to his deserts. What attractives were there
          in a silly worm, much less in such complete wickedness, inexcusable
          enmity, infamous rebellion, to design a Redeemer for him, and such a
          person as the Son of God to a fleshy body, an eclipse of glory, and an
          ignominious cross? The meanness of man was further from alluring God
          to it, than the dignity of angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Was there not a world of demerit in man, to animate grace as well
          as wrath against him? We were so far from deserving the opening any
          streams of goodness, that we had merited floods of devouring wrath.
          What were all men but enemies to God in a high manner? Every offence
          was infinite, as being committed against a being of infinite dignity;
          it was a stroke at the very being of God, a resistance of all his
          attributes; it would degrade him from the height and perfection of his
          nature; it would not, by its good will, suffer God to be God. If he
          that hates his brother is a murderer of his brother (1 John iii. 15),
          he that hates his Creator is a murderer of the Deity, and every
          “carnal mind is enmity to God” (Rom. viii. 7): every sin envies him
          his authority, by breaking his precept; and envies him his goodness,
          by defacing the marks of it: every sin comprehends in it more than men
          or angels can conceive: that God who only hath the clear apprehensions
          of his own dignity, hath the sole clear apprehensions of sin’s
          malignity. All men were thus by nature: those that sinned before the
          coming of the Redeemer had been in a state of sin; those that were to
          come after him would be in a state of sin by their birth, and be
          criminals as soon as ever they were creatures. All men, as well the
          glorified, as those in the flesh at the coming of the Redeemer, and
          those that were to be born after, were considered in a state of sin by
          God, when he bruised the Redeemer for them; all were filthy and
          unworthy of the eye of God; all had employed the faculties of their
          souls, and the members of their bodies, which they enjoyed by his
          goodness, against the interest of his glory. Every rational creature
          had made himself a slave to those creatures over whom he had been
          appointed a lord, subjected himself as a servant to his inferior, and
          strutted as a superior against his liberal Sovereign, and by every sin
          rendered himself more a child of Satan, and enemy of God, and more
          worthy of the curses of the law, and the torments of hell. Was it not,
          now, a mighty goodness that would surmount those high mountains of
          demerit, and elevate such creatures by the depression of his Son? Had
          we been possessed of the highest holiness, a reward had been the
          natural effect of goodness. It was not possible that God should be
          unkind to a righteous and innocent creature; his grace would have
          crowned that which had been so agreeable to him. He had been a denier
          of himself, had he numbered innocent creatures in the rank of the
          miserable; but to be kind to an enemy, to run counter to the vastness
          of demerit in man, was a superlative goodness, a goodness triumphing
          above all the provocations of men, and pleas of justice: it was an
          abounding goodness of grace; “where sin abounded, grace did much more
          abound” (Rom. v. 20), ὑπερεπερίσσευσεν; it swelled above the heights
          of sin, and triumphed more than all his other attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Man was reduced to the lowest condition. Our crimes had brought us
          to the lowest calamity; we were brought to the dust, and prepared for
          hell. Adam had not the boldness to request, and therefore we may judge
          he had not the least hopes of pardon; he was sunk under wrath, and
          could have expected no better an entertainment than the tempter, whose
          solicitations he submitted to. We had cast the diadem from our heads,
          and lost all our original excellency; we were lost to our own
          happiness, and lost to our Creator’s service, when he was so kind as
          to send his Son to seek us (Matt. xviii. 11), and so liberal as to
          expend his blood for our cure and preservation. How great was that
          goodness that would not abandon us in our misery, but remit our
          crimes, and rescue our persons, and ransom our souls by so great a
          price from the rights of justice, and horrors of hell, we were so
          fitted for?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Every age multiplied provocations; every age of the world proved
          more degenerate. The traditions, which were purer and more lively
          among Adam’s immediate posterity, were more dark among his further
          descendants; idolatry, whereof we have no marks in the old world
          before the deluge, was frequent afterwards in every nation: not only
          the knowledge of the true God was lost, but the natural reverential
          thoughts of a Deity were expelled. Hence gods were dubbed according to
          men’s humors; and not only human passions, but brutish vices, ascribed
          to them: as by the fall we were become less than men, so we would
          fancy God no better than a beast, since beasts were worshipped as gods
          (Rom. i. 21); yea, fancied God no better than a devil, since that
          destroyer was worshipped instead of the Creator, and a homage paid to
          the powers of hell that had ruined them, which was due to the goodness
          of that Benefactor, who had made them and preserved them in the world.
          The vilest creatures were deified; reason was debased below common
          sense; and men adored one end of a “log,” while they “warmed
          themselves with the other” (Isa. xliv. 14, 16, 17); as if that which
          was ordained for the kitchen were a fit representation for God in the
          temple. Thus were the natural notions of a Deity depraved; the whole
          world drenched in idolatry; and though the Jews were free from that
          gross abuse of God, yet they were sunk also into loathsome
          superstitions, when the goodness of God brought in his designed
          Redeemer and redemption into the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The impotence of man enhanceth this goodness. Our own eye did
          scarce pity us, and it was impossible for our own hands to relieve us;
          we were insensible of our misery, in love with our death; we courted
          our chains, and the noise of our fettering lusts were our music,
          “serving divers lusts and pleasures” (Tit. iii. 3). Our lusts were our
          pleasures; Satan’s yoke was as delightful to us to bear, as to him to
          impose: instead of being his opposers in his attempts against us, we
          were his voluntary seconds, and every whit as willing to embrace, as
          he was to propose, his ruining temptations. As no man can recover
          himself from death, so no man can recover himself from wrath; he is as
          unable to redeem, as to create himself; he might as soon have stripped
          himself of his being, as put an end to his misery; his captivity would
          have been endless, and his chains remediless, for anything he could do
          to knock them off, and deliver himself; he was too much in love with
          the sink of sin, to leave wallowing in it, and under too powerful a
          hand, to cease frying in the flames of wrath. As the law could not be
          obeyed by man, after a corrupt principle had entered into him, so
          neither could justice be satisfied by him after his transgression. The
          sinner was indebted, but bankrupt; as he was unable to pay a mite of
          that obedience he owed to the precept, because of his enmity, so he
          was unable to satisfy what he owed to the penalty, because of his
          feebleness: he was as much without love to observe the one, as
          “without strength” to bear the other: he could not, because of his
          “enmity, be subject to the law” (Rom. viii. 7), or compensate for his
          sin, because he was “without strength” (Rom. v. 6). His strength to
          offend was great; but to deliver himself a mere nothing. Repentance
          was not a thing known by man after the fall, till he had hopes of
          redemption; and if he had known and exercised it, what compensation
          are the tears of a malefactor for an injury done to the crown, and
          attempting the life of his prince? How great was Divine goodness, not
          only to pity men in this state, but to provide a strong Redeemer for
          them! “O Lord, my strength, and my Redeemer!” said the Psalmist (Ps.
          xix. 14): when he found out a Redeemer for our misery, he found out a
          strength for our impotency. To conclude this: behold the “goodness of
          God,” when we had thus unhandsomely dealt with him; had nothing to
          allure his goodness, multitudes of provocations to incense him, were
          reduced to a condition as low as could be, fit to be the matter of his
          scoffs, and the sport of Divine justice, and so weak that we could not
          repair our own ruins; then did he open a fountain of fresh goodness in
          the death of his Son, and sent forth such delightful streams, as in
          our original creation we could never have tasted; not only overcame
          the resentments of a provoked justice, but magnified itself by our
          lowness, and strengthened itself by our weakness. His goodness had
          before created an innocent, but here it saves a malefactor; and sends
          his Son to die for us, as if the Holy of holies were the criminal, and
          the rebel the innocent. It had been a pompous goodness to have given
          him as a king; but a goodness of greater grandeur to expose him as a
          sacrifice for slaves and enemies. Had Adam remained innocent, and
          proved thankful for what he had received, it had been great goodness
          to have brought him to glory; but to bring filthy and rebellious Adam
          to it, surmounts, by inexpressible degrees, that sort of goodness he
          had experimented before; since it was not from a light evil, a
          tolerable curse unawares brought upon us, but from the yoke we had
          willingly submitted to, from the power of darkness we had courted, and
          the furnace of wrath we had kindled for ourselves. What are we dead
          dogs, that he should behold us with so gracious an eye? This goodness
          is thus enhanced, if you consider the state of man in his first
          transgression, and after.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. This goodness further appears in the high advancement of our
          nature, after it had so highly offended. By creation, we had an
          affinity with animals in our bodies, with angels in our spirits, with
          God in his image; but not with God in our nature, till the incarnation
          of the Redeemer. Adam, by creation, was the son of God (Luke iii. 38),
          but his nature was not one with the person of God: he was his son, as
          created by him, but had no affinity to him by virtue of union with
          him: but now man doth not only see his nature in multitudes of men on
          earth, but, by an astonishing goodness, beholds his nature united to
          the Deity in heaven: that as he was the son of God by creation, he is
          now the brother of God by redemption; for with such a title doth that
          Person, who was the Son of God as well as the Son of man, honor his
          disciples (John xx. 17): and because he is of the same nature with
          them, he “is not ashamed to call them brethren” (Heb. ii. 11). Our
          nature, which was infinitely distant from, and below the Deity, now
          makes one person with the Son of God. What man sinfully aspired to,
          God hath graciously granted, and more: man aspired to a likeness in
          knowledge, and God hath granted him an affinity in union. It had been
          astonishing goodness to angelize our natures; but in redemption Divine
          goodness hath acted higher, in a sort to deify our natures. In
          creation, our nature was exalted above other creatures on earth; in
          our redemption, our nature is exalted above all the host of heaven: we
          were higher than the beasts, as creatures, but “lower than the angels”
          (Ps. viii. 5); but, by the incarnation of the Son of God, our nature
          is elevated many steps above them. After it had sunk itself by
          corruption below the bestial nature, and as low as the diabolical, the
          “fulness of the Godhead dwells in our nature bodily” (Col. ii. 9), but
          never in the angels, angelically. The Son of God descended to dignify
          our nature, by assuming it; and ascended with our nature to have it
          crowned above those standing monuments of Divine power and goodness
          (Eph. i. 20, 21). That Person that descended in our nature into the
          grave, and in the same nature was raised up again, is, in that same
          nature, set at the right hand of God in heaven, “far above all
          principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that
          is named.” Our refined clay, by an indissoluble union with this Divine
          Person, is honored to sit forever upon a throne above all the tribes
          of seraphims and cherubims; and the Person that wears it, is the head
          of the good angels, and the conqueror of the bad; the one are put
          under his feet, and the other commanded to adore him, “that purged our
          sins in our nature” (Heb. i. 3, 6): that Divine Person in our nature
          receives adoration from the angels; but the nature of man is not
          ordered to pay any homage and adorations to the angels. How could
          Divine goodness, to man, more magnify itself? As we could not have a
          lower descent than we had by sin, how could we have a higher ascent
          than by a substantial participation of a divine life, in our nature,
          in the unity of a Divine Person? Our earthly nature is joined to a
          heavenly Person; our undone nature united to “one equal with God”
          (Phil. ii. 6). It may truly be said, that man is God, which is
          infinitely more glorious for us, than if it could be said, man is an
          angel. If it were goodness to advance our innocent nature above other
          creatures, the advancement of our degenerate nature above angels
          deserves a higher title than mere goodness. It is a more gracious act,
          than if all men had been transformed into the pure spiritual nature of
          the loftiest cherubims.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. This goodness is manifest in the covenant of grace made with us,
          whereby we are freed from the rigor of that of works. God might have
          insisted upon the terms of the old covenant, and required of man the
          improvement of his original stock; but God hath condescended to lower
          terms, and offered man more gracious methods, and mitigated the rigor
          of the first, by the sweetness of the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is goodness, that he should condescend to make another covenant
          with man. To stipulate with innocent and righteous Adam for his
          obedience, was a stoop of his sovereignty; though he gave the precept
          as a sovereign Lord, yet in his covenanting, he seems to descend to
          some kind of equality with that dust and ashes with whom the treated.
          Absolute sovereigns do not usually covenant with their people, but
          exact obedience and duty, without binding themselves to bestow a
          reward; and if they intend any, they reserve the purpose in their own
          breasts, without treating their subjects with a solemn declaration of
          it. There was no obligation on God to enter into the first covenant,
          much less, after the violation of the first, to the settlement of a
          new. If God seemed in some sort to equal himself to man in the first,
          he seemed to descend below himself in treating with a rebel upon more
          condescending terms in the second. If his covenant with innocent Adam
          was a stoop of his sovereignty, this with rebellious Adam seems to be
          a stripping himself of his majesty in favor of his goodness; as if his
          happiness depended upon us, and not ours upon him. It is a humiliation
          of himself to behold the things in heaven, the glorious angels, as
          well as things on earth, mortal men (Ps. cxiii. 6); much more to bind
          himself in gracious bonds to the glorious angels; and much more if to
          rebel man. In the first covenant there was much of sovereignty as well
          as goodness; in the second there is less of sovereignty, and more of
          grace: in the first there was a righteous man for a holy God; in the
          second a polluted creature for a pure and provoked God: in the first
          he holds his sceptre in his hand, to rule his subjects; in the second
          he seems to lay by his sceptre, to court and espouse a beggar (Hosea
          ii. 18‒20): in the first he is a Lord; in the second a husband; and
          binds himself upon gracious conditions to become a debtor. How should
          this goodness fill us with an humble astonishment, as it did Abraham,
          when he “fell on his face,” when he heard God speaking of making a
          covenant with him! (Gen. xvii. 2, 3). And if God speaking to Israel
          out of the fire, and making them to hear his voice out of heaven, that
          he might instruct them, was a consideration whereby Moses would
          heighten their admiration of Divine goodness, and engage their
          affectionate obedience to him (Deut. iv. 32, 36, 40), how much more
          admirable is it for God to speak so kindly to us through the pacifying
          blood of the covenant, that silenced the terrors of the old, and
          settled the tenderness of the new!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His goodness is seen in the nature and tenor of the new covenant.
          There are in this richer streams of love and pity. The language of one
          was, Die, if thou sin; that of the other, Live, if thou believest:982
          the old covenant was founded upon the obedience of man; the new one is
          not founded upon the inconstancy of man’s will, but the firmness of
          Divine love, and the valuable merit of Christ. The head of the first
          covenant was human and mutable; the Head of the second is divine and
          immutable. The curse due to us by the breach of the first, is taken
          off by the indulgence of the second: we are by it snatched from the
          jaws of the law, to be wrapped up in the bosom of grace (Rom. viii.
          1). “For you are not under the law, but under grace” (Rom. vi. 14);
          from the curse and condemnation of the law, to the sweetness and
          forgiveness of grace. Christ bore the one, being “made a curse for us”
          (Gal. iii. 13), that we might enjoy the sweetness of the other; by
          this we are brought from Mount Sinai, the mount of terror, to Mount
          Sion, the mount of sacrifice, the type of the great Sacrifice (Heb.
          xii. 18, 22). That covenant brought in death upon one offence, this
          covenant offers life after many offences (Rom. v. 16, 17): that
          involves us in a curse, and this enricheth us with a blessing; the
          breaches of that expelled us out of Paradise, and the embracing of
          this admits us into heaven. This covenant demands, and admits of that
          repentance whereof there was no mention in the first; that demanded
          obedience, not repentance upon a failure; and though the exercise of
          it had been never so deep in the fallen creature, nothing of the law’s
          severity had been remitted by any virtue of it. Again, the first
          covenant demanded exact righteousness, but conveyed no cleansing
          virtue, upon the contracting any filth. The first demands a
          continuance in the righteousness conferred in creation; the second
          imprints a gracious heart in regeneration. “I will pour clean water
          upon you; I will put a new spirit within you,” was the voice of the
          second covenant, not of the first. Again, as to pardon: Adam’s
          covenant was to punish him, not to pardon him, if he fell; that
          threatened death upon transgression, this remits it; that was an act
          of Divine sovereignty, declaring the will of God; this is an act of
          Divine grace, passing an act of oblivion on the crimes of the
          creature: that, as it demanded no repentance upon a failure, so it
          promised no mercy upon guilt; that convened our sin, and condemned us
          for it; this clears our guilt, and comforts us under it. The first
          covenant related us to God as a Judge; every transgression against it
          forfeited his indulgence as a Father: the second delivers us from God
          as a condemning Judge, to bring us under his wing, as an affectionate
          Father; in the one there was a dreadful frown to scare us; in the
          other, a healing wing to cover and relieve us. Again, in regard of
          righteousness: that demanded our performance of a righteousness in and
          by ourselves, and our own strength; this demands our acceptance of a
          righteousness higher than ever the standing angels had; the
          righteousness of the first covenant was the righteousness of a man,
          the righteousness of the second is the righteousness of a God (2 Cor.
          v. 21). Again, in regard of that obedience it demands: it exacts not
          of us, as a necessary condition, the perfection of obedience, but the
          sincerity of obedience; an uprightness in our intention, not an
          unspottedness in our action; an integrity in our aims, and an industry
          in our compliance with divine precepts: “Walk before me, and be thou
          perfect” (Gen. xvii. 1); i. e. sincere. What is hearty in our actions,
          is accepted; and what is defective, is overlooked, and not charged
          upon us, because of the obedience and righteousness of our Surety. The
          first covenant rejected all our services after sin; the services of a
          person under the sentence of death, are but dead services: this
          accepts our imperfect services, after faith in it; that administered
          no strength to obey, but supposed it; this supposeth our inability to
          obey, and confers some strength for it: “I will put my spirit within
          you, and cause you to walk in my statutes” (Ezek. xxxvi. 27). Again,
          in regard of the promises: the old covenant had good, but the new hath
          “better promises” (Heb. viii. 6), of justification after guilt and
          sanctification after filth, and glorification at last of the whole
          man. In the first, there was provision against guilt, but none for the
          removal of it: provision against filth, but none for the cleansing of
          it; promise of happiness implied, but not so great a one as that “life
          and immortality” in heaven, “brought to light by the gospel” (2 Tim.
          i. 10). Why said to be “brought to light by the gospel?” because it
          was not only buried, upon the fall of man under the curses of the law,
          but it was not so obvious to the conceptions of man in his innocent
          state. Life indeed was implied to be promised upon his standing, but
          not so glorious an immortality disclosed, to be reserved for him, if
          he stood: as it is a covenant of better promises, so a covenant of
          sweeter comforts; comforts more choice, and comforts more durable; an
          “everlasting consolation, and a good hope” are the fruits of “grace,”
          i. e. the covenant of grace (2 Thess. ii. 16). In the whole there is
          such a love disclosed, as cannot be expressed; the apostle leaves it
          to every man’s mind to conceive it, if he could, “What manner of love
          the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of
          God” (1 John iii. 1). It instates us in such a manner of the love of
          God as he bears to his Son, the image of his person (John xvii. 23):
          “That the world may know that thou hast loved them, as thou hast loved
          me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This goodness appears in the choice gift of himself which he hath
          made over in this covenant (Gen. xvii. 7). You know how it runs in
          Scripture: “I will be their God, and they shall be my people” (Jer.
          xxxii. 38): a propriety in the Deity is made over by it. As he gave
          the blood of his Son to seal the covenant, so he gave himself as the
          blessing of the covenant; “He is not ashamed to be called their God”
          (Heb. xi. 16). Though he be environed with millions of angels, and
          presides over them in an inexpressible glory, he is not ashamed of his
          condescensions to man, and to pass over himself as the propriety of
          his people, as well as to take them to be his. It is a diminution of
          the sense of the place, to understand it of God, as Creator; what
          reason was there for God to be ashamed of the expressions of his
          power, wisdom, goodness, in the works of his hands? But we might have
          reason to think there might be some ground in God to be ashamed of
          making himself over in a deed of gift to a mean worm and filthy rebel;
          this might seem a disparagement to his majesty; but God is not ashamed
          of a title so mean, as the God of his despised people; a title below
          those others, of the “Lord of hosts, glorious in holiness, fearful in
          praises, doing wonders, riding on the wings of the wind, walking in
          the circuits of heaven.” He is no more ashamed of this title of being
          our God, than he is of those other that sound more glorious; he would
          rather have his greatness veil to his goodness, than his goodness be
          confined by his majesty; he is not only our God, but our God as he is
          the God of Christ: he is not ashamed to be our propriety, and Christ
          is not ashamed to own his people in a partnership with him in this
          propriety (John xx. 17): “I ascend to my God, and your God.” This of
          God’s being our God, is the quintessence of the covenant, the soul of
          all the promises: in this he hath promised whatsoever is infinite in
          him, whatsoever is the glory and ornament of his nature, for our use;
          not a part of him, or one single perfection, but the whole vigor and
          strength of all. As he is not a God without infinite wisdom, and
          infinite power, and infinite goodness, and infinite blessedness,
          &amp;c., so he passes over, in this covenant, all that which presents
          him as the most adorable Being to his creatures; he will be to them as
          great, as wise, as powerful, as good as he is in himself; and the
          assuring us, in this covenant, to be our God, imports also that he
          will do as much for us, as we would do for ourselves, were we
          furnished with the same goodness, power, and wisdom: in being our God,
          he testifies it is all one, as if we had the same perfections in our
          own power to employ for our use; for he being possessed with them, it
          is as much as if we ourselves were possessed with them, for our own
          advantage, according to the rules of wisdom, and the several
          conditions we pass through for his glory. But this must be taken with
          a relation to that wisdom, which he observes in his proceedings with
          us as creatures, and according to the several conditions we pass
          through for his glory. Thus God’s being ours is more than if all
          heaven and earth were ours besides; it is more than if we were fully
          our own, and at our own dispose; it makes “all things that God hath
          ours” (1 Cor. iii. 22); and therefore, not only all things he hath
          created, but all things that he can create; not only all things that
          he hath contrived, but all things that he can contrive: for in being
          ours, his power is ours, his possible power as well as his active
          power; his power, whereby he can effect more than he hath done, and
          his wisdom, whereby he can contrive more than he hath done; so that if
          there were need of employing his power to create many worlds for our
          good, he would not stick at it; for if he did, he would not be our
          God, in the extent of his nature, as the promise intimates. What a
          rich goodness, and a fulness of bounty, is there in this short
          expression, as full as the expression of a God can make it, to be
          intelligible, to such creatures as we are!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This goodness is further manifest in the confirmation of the
          covenant. His goodness did not only condescend to make it for our
          happiness, after we had made ourselves miserable, but further
          condescended to ratify it in the solemnest manner for our assurance,
          to overrule all the despondencies unbelief could raise up in our
          souls. The reason why he confirmed it by an oath, was to show the
          immutability of his glorious counsel, not to tie himself to keep it,
          for his word and promise is in itself as immutable as his oath; they
          were “two immutable things, his word and his oath,” one as
          unchangeable as the other; but for the strength of our consolation,
          that it might have no reason to shake and totter (Heb. vi. 17, 18): he
          would condescend as low as was possible for a God to do for the
          satisfaction of the dejected creature. When the first covenant was
          broken, and it was impossible for man to fulfil the terms of it, and
          mount to happiness thereby, he makes another; and, as if we had reason
          to distrust him in the first, he solemnly ratifies it in a higher
          manner than he had done the other, and swears by himself that he will
          be true to it, not so much out of an election of himself, as the
          object of the oath (Heb. vi. 13): “Because he could not swear by a
          greater, he swears by himself;” whereby the apostle clearly intimates,
          that Divine goodness was raised to such a height for us, that if there
          had been anything else more sacred than himself, or that could have
          punished him if he had broken it, that he would have sworn by, to
          silence any diffidence in us, and confirm us in the reality of his
          intentions. Now if it were a mighty mark of goodness for God to stoop
          to a covenanting with us, it was more for a sovereign to bind himself
          so solemnly to be our debtor in a promise, as well as he was our
          sovereign in the precept, and stoop so low in it to satisfy the
          distrust of that creature, that deserved for ever to lie soaking in
          his own ruins, for not believing his bare word. What absolute prince
          would ever stoop so low as to article with rebellious subjects, whom
          he could in a moment set his foot upon and crush; much less
          countenance a causeless distrust of his goodness by the addition of
          his oath, and thereby bind his own hands, which were unconfined
          before, and free to do what he pleased with them?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This goodness of God is remarkable also in the condition of this
          covenant which is faith. This was the easiest condition, in its own
          nature, that could be imagined; no difficulty in it but what proceeds
          from the pride of man’s nature, and the obstinacy of his will. It was
          not impossible in itself; it was not the old condition of perfect
          obedience. It had been mighty goodness to set us up again upon our old
          stock, and restore us to the tenor and condition of the covenant of
          works, or to have required the burdensome ceremonies of the law. Nor
          is it an exact knowledge he requires of us; all men’s understandings
          being of a different size, they had not been capable of this. It was
          the most reasonable condition, in regard of the excellency of the
          things proposed, and the effects following upon it; nay, it was
          necessary. It had been a want of goodness to himself and his own
          honor; he had cast that off, had he not insisted on this condition of
          faith, it being the lowest he could condescend to with a salvo for his
          glory. And it was a goodness to us; it is nothing else he requires,
          but a willingness to accept what he hath contrived and acted for us:
          and no man can be happy against his will; without this belief, at
          least, man could never voluntarily have arrived to his happiness. The
          goodness of God is evidenced in that.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1st.] It is an easy condition, not impossible. 1. It was not the
          condition of the old covenant. The condition of that was an entire
          obedience to every precept with a man’s whole strength, and without
          any flaw or crack. But the condition of the evangelical covenant is a
          sincere, though weak, faith; He hath suited this covenant to the
          misery of man’s fallen condition; he considers our weakness, and that
          we are but dust, and therefore exacts not of us an entire, but a
          sincere, obedience. Had God sent Christ to expiate the crime of Adam,
          restore him to his paradise estate, and repair in man the ruined image
          of holiness, and after this to have renewed the covenant of works for
          the future, and settled the same condition in exacting a complete
          obedience for the time to come; Divine goodness had been above any
          accusation, and had deserved our highest admiration in the pardon of
          former transgressions, and giving out to us our first stock. But
          Divine goodness took larger strides: he had tried our first condition,
          and found his mutable creature quickly to violate it: had he demanded
          the same now, it is likely it had met with the same issue as before,
          in man’s disobedience and fall; we should have been as men, as Adam
          (Hos. vi. 7), “transgressing the covenant;” and then we must have lain
          groaning under our disease, and wallowing in our blood, unless Christ
          had come to die for the expiation of our new crimes; for every
          transgression had been a violation of that covenant, and a forfeiture
          of our right to the benefits of it. If we had broke it but in one
          tittle, we had rendered ourselves incapable to fulfil it for the
          future; that one transgression had stood as a bar against the pleas of
          after‑obedience. But God hath wholly laid that condition aside as to
          us, and settled that of faith, more easy to be performed, and to be
          renewed by us. It is infinite grace in him, that he will accept of
          faith in us, instead of that perfect obedience he required of us in
          the covenant of works. 2. It is easy, not like the burdensome
          ceremonies appointed under the law. He exacts not now the legal
          obedience, expensive sacrifices, troublesome purifications, and
          abstinences, that “yoke of bondage” (Gal. v. 1) which they were “not
          able to bear” (Acts xv. 10). He treats us not as servants, or
          children, in their nonage, under the elements of the world, nor
          requires those innumerable bodily exercises that he exacted of them:
          he demands not “a thousand of lambs,” and “rivers of oil;” but he
          requires a sincere confession and repentance, in order to our
          absolution; an “unfeigned faith,” in order to our blessedness, and
          elevation to a glorious life. He requires only that we should believe
          what he saith, and have so good an opinion of his goodness and
          veracity, as to persuade ourselves of the reality of his intentions,
          confide in his word, and rely upon his promise, cordially embrace his
          crucified Son, whom he hath set forth as the means of our happiness,
          and have a sincere respect to all the discoveries of his will. What
          can be more easy than this? Though some in the days of the apostles,
          and others since have endeavored to introduce a multitude of legal
          burdens, as if they envied God the expressions of his goodness, or
          thought him guilty of too much remissness, in taking off the yoke, and
          treating man too favorably. 3. Nor is it a clear knowledge of every
          revelation, that is the condition of this covenant. God in his
          kindness to man hath made revelations of himself, but his goodness is
          manifested in obliging us to believe him, not fully to understand him.
          He hath made them, by sufficient testimonies, as clear to our faith,
          as they are incomprehensible to our reason: he hath revealed a Trinity
          of Persons, in their distinct offices, in the business of redemption,
          without which revelation of a Trinity we could not have a right notion
          and scheme of redeeming grace. But since the clearness of men’s
          understanding is sullied by the fall, and hath lost its wings to fly
          up to a knowledge of such sublime things as that of the Trinity, and
          other mysteries of the Christian religion, God hath manifested his
          goodness in not obliging us to understand them but to believe them;
          and hath given us reason enough to believe it to be his revelation,
          (both from the nature of the revelation itself, and the way and manner
          of propagating it, which is wholly divine, exceeding all the methods
          of human art,) though he hath not extended our understandings to a
          capacity to know them, and render a reason of every mystery. He did
          not require of every Israelite, or of any of them that were stung by
          the fiery serpents, that they should understand, or be able to
          discourse of the nature and qualities of that brass of which the
          serpent upon the pole was made, or by what art that serpent was
          formed, or in what manner the sight of it did operate in them for
          their cure; it was enough that they did believe the institution and
          precept of God, and that their own cure was assured by it: it was
          enough if they cast their eyes upon it according to the direction. The
          understandings of men are of several sizes and elevations, one higher
          than another: if the condition of this covenant had been a greatness
          of knowledge, the most acute men had only enjoyed the benefits of it.
          But it is “faith,” which is as easy to be performed by the ignorant
          and simple, as by the strongest and most towering mind: it is that
          which is within the compass of every man’s understanding. God did not
          require that every one within the verge of the covenant should be able
          to discourse of it to the reasons of men; he required not that every
          man should be a philosopher, or an orator, but a believer. What could
          be more easy than to lift up the eye to the brazen serpent, to be
          cured of a fiery sting? What could be more facile than a glance, which
          is done without any pain, and in a moment? It is a condition may be
          performed by the weakest as well as the strongest: could those that
          were bitten in the most vital part cast up their eyes, though at the
          last gasp, they would arise to health by the expulsion of the venom.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2d.] As it is easy, so it is reasonable. Repent and believe, is that
          which is required by Christ and the apostles for the enjoyment of the
          kingdom of heaven. It is very reasonable that things so great and
          glorious, so beneficial to men, and revealed to them by so sound an
          authority, and an unerring truth, should be believed. The excellency
          of the thing disclosed could admit of no lower a condition than to be
          believed and embraced. There is a sort of faith, that is a natural
          condition in everything: all religion in the world, though never so
          false, depends upon a sort of it; for unless there be a belief of
          future things, there would never be a hope of good, or a fear of evil,
          the two great hinges upon which religion moves. In all kinds of
          learning, many things must be believed before a progress can be made.
          Belief of one another is necessary in all acts of human life; without
          which human society would be unlinked and dissolved. What is that
          faith that God requires of us in this covenant, but a willingness of
          soul to take God for our God, Christ for our Mediator, and the
          procurer of our happiness (Rev. xxii. 17)? What prince could require
          less upon any promise he makes his subjects, than to be believed as
          true, and depended on as good; that they should accept his pardon, and
          other gracious offers, and be sincere in their allegiance to him,
          avoiding all things that may offend him, and pursuing all things that
          may please him? Thus God, by so small and reasonable a condition as
          faith, lets in the fruits of Christ’s death into our soul, and wraps
          us up in the fruition of all the privileges purchased by it. So much
          he hath condescended in his goodness, that upon so slight a condition
          we may plead his promise, and humbly challenge, by virtue of the
          covenant, those good things he hath promised in his word. It is so
          reasonable a condition, that if God did not require it in the covenant
          of grace, the creature were obliged to perform it: for the publishing
          any truth from God, naturally calls for credit to be given it by the
          creature, and an entertainment of it in practice. Could you offer a
          more reasonable condition yourselves, had it been left to your choice?
          Should a prince proclaim a pardon to a profligate wretch, would not
          all the world cry shame of him, if he did not believe it upon the
          highest assurances? and if ingenuity did not make him sorry for his
          crimes, and careful in the duty of a subject, surely the world would
          cry shame of such a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3d.] It is a necessary condition. 1. Necessary for the honor of God.
          A prince is disparaged if his authority in his law, and if his
          graciousness in his promises, be not accepted and believed. What
          physician would undertake a cure, if his precepts may not be credited?
          It is the first thing in the order of nature, that the revelation of
          God should be believed, that the reality of his intentions in inviting
          man to the acceptance of those methods he hath prescribed for their
          attaining their chief happiness, should be acknowledged. It is a
          debasing notion of God, that he should give a happiness, purchased by
          Divine blood, to a person that hath no value for it, nor any
          abhorrency of those sins that occasioned so great a suffering, nor any
          will to avoid them: should he not vilify himself, to bestow a heaven
          upon that man that will not believe the offers of it, nor walk in
          those ways that lead to it? that walks so, as if he would declare
          there was no truth in his word, nor holiness in his nature? Would not
          God by such an act verify a truth in the language of their practice,
          viz. that he were both false and impure, careless of his word, and
          negligent of his holiness? As God was so desirous to ensure the
          consolation of believers, that if there had been a greater Being than
          himself to attest, and for him to be responsible to, for the
          confirmation of his promise, he would willingly have submitted to him,
          and have made him the umpire, “He swore by himself, because he could
          not swear by a greater” (Heb. vi. 19); by the same reason, had it
          stood with the majesty and wisdom of God to stoop to lower conditions
          in this covenant, for the reducing of man to his duty and happiness,
          he would have done it; but his goodness could not take lower steps,
          with the preservation of the rights of his majesty, and the honor of
          his wisdom. Would you have had him wholly submitted to the obstinate
          will of a rebellious creature, and be ruled only by his terms? Would
          you have had him received men to happiness, after they had heightened
          their crimes by a contempt of his grace, as well as of his creating
          goodness, and have made them blessed under the guilt of their crimes
          without an acknowledgment? Should he glorify one that will not believe
          what he hath revealed, nor repent of what himself hath committed; and
          so save a man after a repeated unthankfulness to the most immense
          grace that ever was, or can be, discovered and offered, without a
          detestation of his ingratitude, and a voluntary acceptance of his
          offers? It is necessary, for the honor of God, that man should accept
          of his terms, and not give laws to him to whom he is obnoxious as a
          guilty person, as well as subject as a creature. Again, it was very
          equitable and necessary for the honor of God, that since man fell by
          an unbelief of his precept and threatening, he should not rise again
          without a belief of his promise, and casting himself upon his truth in
          that: since he had vilified the honor of his truth in the threatening;
          since man in his fall would lean to his own understanding against God,
          it is fit that, in his recovery, the highest powers of his soul, his
          understanding and will, should be subjected to him in an entire
          resignation. Now, whereas knowledge seems to have a power over its
          object, faith is a full submission to that which is the object of it.
          Since man intended a glorying in himself, the evangelical covenant
          directs its whole battery against it, that men may “glory in nothing
          but Divine goodness” (1 Cor. i. 29‒31). Had man performed exact
          obedience by his own strength, he had had something in himself as the
          matter of his glory. And though, after the fall, grace had made itself
          illustrious in setting him up upon a new stock, yet had the same
          condition of exact obedience been settled in the same manner, man
          would have had something to glory in, which is struck off wholly by
          faith; whereby man in every act must go out of himself for a supply,
          to that Mediator which Divine goodness and grace hath appointed. 2. It
          is necessary for the happiness of man. That can be no contenting
          condition wherein the will of man doth not concur. He that is forced
          to the most delicious diet, or to wear the bravest apparel, or to be
          stored with abundance of treasure, cannot be happy in those things
          without an esteem of them, and delight in them: if they be nauseous to
          him, the indisposition of his mind is a dead fly in those boxes of
          precious ointment. Now, faith being a sincere willingness to accept of
          Christ, and to come to God by him, and repentance being a detestation
          of that which made man’s separation from God, it is impossible he
          could be voluntarily happy without it: man cannot attain and enjoy a
          true happiness without an operation of his understanding about the
          object proposed, and the means appointed to enjoy it. There must be a
          knowledge of what is offered, and of the way of it, and such a
          knowledge as may determine the will to affect that end, and embrace
          those means; which the will can never do, till the understanding be
          fully persuaded of the truth of the offerer, and the goodness of the
          proposal itself, and the conveniency of the means for the attaining of
          it. It is necessary, in the nature of the thing, that what is revealed
          should be believed to be a Divine revelation. God must be judged true
          in the promising justification and sanctification, the means of
          happiness; and if any man desires to be partaker of those promises, he
          must desire to be sanctified; and how can he desire that which is the
          matter of those promises, if he wallow in his own lusts, and desire to
          do so, a thing repugnant to the promise itself? Would you have God
          force man to be happy against his will? Is it not very reasonable he
          should demand the consent of his reasonable creature to that
          blessedness he offers him? The new covenant is a “marriage covenant”
          (Hos. ii. 16, 19, 20), which implies a consent on our parts, as well
          as a consent on God’s part; that is no marriage that hath not the
          consent of both parties. Now faith is our actual consent, and
          repentance and sincere obedience are the testimonies of the truth and
          reality of this consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. Divine goodness is eminent in his methods of treating with men to
          embrace this covenant. They are methods of gentleness and sweetness:
          it is a wooing goodness, and a bewailing goodness; his expressions are
          with strong motions of affection: he carrieth not on the gospel by
          force of arms: he doth not solely menace men into it, as worldly
          conquerors have done; he doth not, as Mahomet, plunder men’s estates,
          and wound their bodies, to imprint a religion on their souls: he doth
          not erect gibbets, and kindle faggots, to scare men to an entering
          into covenant with him. What multitudes might he have raised by his
          power, as well as others! What legions of angels might he have
          rendezvoused from heaven, to have beaten men into a profession of the
          gospel! Nor doth he only interpose his sovereign authority in the
          precept of faith, but useth rational expostulations, to move men
          voluntarily to comply with his proposals (Isa. i. 18), “Come now, and
          let us reason together,” saith the Lord. He seems to call heaven and
          earth to be judge, whether he had been wanting in any reasonable ways
          of goodness, to overcome the perversity of the creature; (Isa. i. 2),
          “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, I have nourished and brought
          up children.” What various encouragements doth he use agreeable to the
          nature of men, endeavoring to persuade them with all tenderness, not
          to despise their own mercies, and be enemies to their own happiness!
          He would allure us by his beauty, and win us by his mercy. He uses the
          arms of his own excellency and our necessity to prevail upon us, and
          this after the highest provocations. When Adam had trampled upon his
          creating goodness, it was not crushed; and when man had cast it from
          him, it took the higher rebound: when the rebel’s provocation was
          fresh in his mind, he sought him out with a promise in his hand,
          though Adam fled from him out of enmity as well as fear (Gen. iii).
          And when the Jews had outraged his Son, whom he loved from eternity,
          and made the Lord of heaven and earth bow down his head like a slave
          on the cross, yet in that place, where the most horrible wickedness
          had been committed, must the gospel be preached: the law must go forth
          out of that Sion, and the apostles must not stir from thence till they
          had received the promise of the Spirit, and published the word of
          grace in that ungrateful city, whose inhabitants yet swelled with
          indignation against the Lord of Life, and the doctrine he had preached
          among them (Luke xxiv. 47; Acts i. 4, 5). He would overlook their
          indignities out of tenderness to their souls, and expose the apostles
          to the peril of their lives, rather than expose his enemies to the
          fury of the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How affectionately doth he invite men! What multitudes of alluring
          promises and pressing exhortations are there everywhere sprinkled in
          the Scripture, and in such a passionate manner, as if God were solely
          concerned in our good, without a glance on his own glory! How tenderly
          doth he woo flinty hearts, and express more pity to them than they do
          to themselves! With what affection do his bowels rise up to his lips
          in his speech in the prophet, Isa. li. 4, “Hearken to me, O my people,
          and give ear unto me, O my nation!” “My people,” “my nation!”—melting
          expressions of a tender God soliciting a rebellious people to make
          their retreat to him. He never emptied his hand of his bounty, nor
          divested his lips of those charitable expressions. He sent Noah to
          move the wicked of the old world to an embracing of his goodness, and
          frequent prophets to the provoking Jews; and as the world continued,
          and grew up to a taller stature in sin, he stoops more in the manner
          of his expressions. Never was the world at a higher pitch of idolatry
          than at the first publishing the gospel; yet, when we should have
          expected him to be a punishing, he is a beseeching God. The apostle
          fears not to use the expression for the glory of Divine goodness; “We
          are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us” (2
          Cor. v. 20). The beseeching voice of God is in the voice of the
          ministry, as the voice of the prince is in that of the herald: it is
          as if Divine goodness did kneel down to a sinner with ringed hands and
          blubbered cheeks, entreating him not to force him to re‑assume a
          tribunal of justice in the nature of a Judge, since he would treat
          with man upon a throne of grace in the nature of a Father; yea, he
          seems to put himself into the posture of the criminal, that the
          offending creature might not feel the punishment due to a rebel. It is
          not the condescension, but the interest, of a traitor to creep upon
          his knees in sackcloth to his sovereign, to beg his life; but it is a
          miraculous goodness in the sovereign to creep in the lowest posture to
          the rebel, to importune him, not only for an amity to him, but a love
          for his own life and happiness: this He doth, not only in his general
          proclamations, but in his particular wooings, those inward courtings
          of his Spirits, soliciting them with more diligence (if they would
          observe it) to their happiness, than the devil tempts them to the ways
          of their misery: as he was first in Christ, reconciling the world,
          when the world looked not after him, so he is first in his Spirit,
          wooing the world to accept of that reconciliation, when the world will
          not listen to him. How often doth he flash up the light of nature and
          the light of the word in men’s hearts, to move them not to lie down in
          sparks of their own kindling, but to aspire to a better happiness, and
          prepare them to be subject to a higher mercy, if they would improve
          his present entreaties to such an end! And what are his threatenings
          designed for, but to move the wheel of our fears, that the wheel of
          our desire and love might be set on motion for the embracing his
          promise? They are not so much the thunders of his justice, as the loud
          rhetoric of his good will, to prevent men’s misery under the vials of
          wrath: it is his kindness to scare men by threatenings, that justice
          might not strike them with the sword: it is not the destruction, but
          the preserving reformation, that he aims at: he hath no pleasure in
          the death of the wicked; this he confirms by his oath. His
          threatenings are gracious expostulations with them: “Why will ye die,
          O house of Israel” (Ezek. xxxiii. 11)? They are like the noise a
          favorable officer makes in the street, to warn the criminal he comes
          to seize upon, to make his escape: he never used his justice to crush
          men, till he had used his kindness to allure them. All the dreadful
          descriptions of a future wrath, as well as the lively descriptions of
          the happiness of another world, are designed to persuade men; the
          honey of his goodness is in the bowels of those roaring lions: such
          pains doth Goodness take with men, to make them candidates for heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How readily doth he receive men when they do return! We have
          David’s experience for it (Ps. xxxii. 5); “I said, I will confess my
          transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my
          sin. Selah.” A sincere look from the creature draws out his arms, and
          opens his bosom; he is ready with his physic to heal us, upon a
          resolution to acquaint him with our disease, and by his medicines
          prevents the putting our resolution into a petition. The Psalmist adds
          a “Selah” to it, as a special note of thankfulness for Divine
          goodness. He doth not only stand ready to receive our petitions while
          we are speaking, but answers us before we call (Isa. lxv. 24);
          listening to the motions of our heart, as well as to the supplications
          of our lips. He is the true Father, that hath a quicker pace in
          meeting, than the prodigal hath in returning; who would not have his
          embraces and caresses interrupted by his confession (Luke xv. 20‒22);
          the confession follows, doth not precede, the Father’s compassion. How
          doth he rejoice in having an opportunity to express his grace, when he
          hath prevailed with a rebel to throw down his arms, and lie at his
          feet; and this because “he delights in mercy” (Micah vii. 18)! He
          delights in the expressions of it from himself, and the acceptance of
          it by his creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How meltingly doth he bewail man’s wilful refusal of his goodness!
          It is a mighty goodness to offer grace to a rebel; a mighty goodness
          to give it him after he hath a while stood off from the terms; an
          astonishing goodness to regret and lament his wilful perdition. He
          seems to utter those words in a sigh, “O that my people had hearkened
          unto me, and Israel had walked in my way” (Ps. lxxxi. 13)! It is true,
          God hath not human passions, but his affections cannot be expressed
          otherwise in a way intelligible to us; the excellency of his nature is
          above the passions of men; but such expressions of himself manifest to
          us the sincerity of his goodness: and that, were he capable of our
          passions, he would express himself in such a manner as we do: and we
          find incarnate Goodness bewailing with tears and sighs the ruin of
          Jerusalem (Luke xix. 42). By the same reason that when a sinner
          returns there is joy in heaven, upon his obstinacy there is sorrow in
          earth. The one is, as if a prince should clothe all his court in
          triumphant scarlet, upon a rebel’s repentance; and the other, as if a
          prince put himself and his court in mourning for a rebel’s obstinate
          refusal of a pardon, when he lies at his mercy. Are not now these
          affectionate invitations, and deep bewailings of their perversity,
          high testimonies of Divine goodness? Do not the unwearied repetitions
          of gracious encouragements deserve a higher name than that of mere
          goodness? What can be a stronger evidence of the sincerity of it, than
          the sound of his saving voice in our enjoyments, the motion of his
          Spirit in our hearts, and his grief for the neglect of all? These are
          not testimonies of any want of goodness in his nature to answer us, or
          unwillingness to express it to his creature. Hath he any mind to
          deceive us, that thus intreats us? The majesty of his nature is too
          great for such shifts; or, if it were not, the despicableness of our
          condition would render him above the using any. Who would charge that
          physician with want of kindness, that freely offers his sovereign
          medicine, importunes men, by the love they have to their health, to
          take it, and is dissolved into tears and sorrow when he finds it
          rejected by their peevish and conceited humor?
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. Divine goodness is eminent in the sacraments he hath affixed to
          this covenant, especially the Lord’s supper. As he gave himself in his
          Son, so he gives his Son in the sacrament; he doth not only give him
          as a sacrifice upon the cross for the expiation of our crimes, but as
          a feast upon the table for the nourishment of our souls: in the one he
          was given to be offered; in this he gives him to be partaken of, with
          all the fruits of his death; under the image of the sacramental signs,
          every believer doth eat the flesh, and drink the blood of the great
          Mediator of the covenant. The words of Christ, “This is my body, and
          this is my blood,” are true to the end of the world (Matt. xxvi. 26,
          28). This is the most delicious viand of heaven, the most exquisite
          dainty food God can feed us with: the delight of the Deity, the
          admiration of angels; a feast with God is great, but a feast on God is
          greater. Under those signs that body is presented; that which was
          conceived by the Spirit, inhabited by the Godhead, bruised by the
          Father to be our food, as well as our propitiation, is presented to us
          on the table. That blood which satisfied justice, washed away our
          guilt on the cross, and pleads for our persons at the throne of grace;
          that blood which silenced the curse, pacified heaven, and purged
          earth, is given to us for our refreshment. This is the bread sent from
          heaven, the true manna; the cup is “the cup of blessing,” and,
          therefore, a cup of goodness (1 Cor. x. 15). It is true, bread doth
          not cease to be bread, nor the wine cease to be wine; neither of them
          lose their substance, but both acquire a sanctification, by the
          relation they have to that which they represent, and give a
          nourishment to that faith that receives them. In those God offers us a
          remedy for the sting of sin, and troubles of conscience; he gives us
          not the blood of a mere man, or the blood of an incarnate angel, but
          of God blessed forever; a blood that can secure us against the wrath
          of heaven, and the tumults of our consciences; a blood that can wash
          away our sins, and beautify our souls; a blood that hath more strength
          than our filth, and more prevalency than our accuser; a blood that
          secures us against the terrors of death, and purifies us for the
          blessedness of heaven. The goodness of God complies with our senses,
          and condescends to our weakness; he instructs us by the eye, as well
          as by the ear; he lets us see, and taste, and feel him, as well as
          hear him; he veils his glory under earthly elements, and informs our
          understanding in the mysteries of salvation by signs familiar to our
          senses; and because we cannot with our bodily eyes behold him in his
          glory, he presents him to the eyes of our minds in elements, to affect
          our understandings in the representations of his death. The body of
          Christ crucified is more visible to our spiritual sense, than the
          invisible Deity could be visible in his flesh upon earth; and the
          power of his body and blood is as well experimented in our souls, as
          the power of his Divinity was seen by the Jews in his miraculous
          actions in his body in the world. It is the goodness of God, to mind
          us frequently of the great things Christ hath purchased; that as
          himself would not let them be out of his mind, to communicate them to
          us, so he would give us means to preserve them in our minds, to adore
          him for them, and request them of him; whereby he doth evidence his
          own solicitousness, that we should not be deprived by our own
          forgetfulness of that grace Christ hath purchased for us; it was to
          remember the Redeemer, “and show his death till he came” (1 Cor. xi.
          25, 26).
        </p>
        <p>
          1. His goodness is seen in the end of it, which is a sealing the
          covenant of grace. The common nature and end of sacraments is to seal
          the covenant they belong to, and the truths of the promises of it.983
          The legal sacraments of circumcision and the passover sealed the legal
          promises and the covenant in the Judicial administration of it; and
          the evangelical sacraments seal the evangelical promises, as a ring
          confirms a contract of marriage, and a seal the articles of a compact;
          by the same reason, circumcision is called a “seal of the
          righteousness of faith” (Rom. iv. 11); other sacraments may have the
          same title; God doth attest, that he will remain firm in his promise,
          and the receiver attests he will remain firm in his faith. In all
          reciprocal covenants, there are mutual engagements, and that which
          serves for a seal on the part of the one, serves for a seal also on
          the part of the other; God obligeth himself to the performance of the
          promise, and man engageth himself to the performance of his duty. The
          thing confirmed by this sacrament is the perpetuity of this covenant
          in the blood of Christ, whence it is called “the New Testament,” or
          covenant “in the blood of Christ” (Luke xxii. 20). In every repetition
          of it, God, by presenting, confirms his resolution to us, of sticking
          to this covenant for the merit of Christ’s blood; and the receiver, by
          eating the body and drinking the blood, engageth himself to keep close
          to the condition of faith, expecting a full salvation and a blessed
          immortality upon the merit of the same blood alone. This sacrament
          could not be called the “New Testament, or Covenant,” if it had not
          some relation to the covenant; and what it can be but this, I do not
          understand. The covenant itself was confirmed “by the death of Christ”
          (Heb. ix. 15), and thereby made unchangeable both in the benefits to
          us, and the condition required of us; but he seals it to our sense in
          a sacrament, to give us strong consolation; or, rather, the articles
          of the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son, agreed
          on from eternity, were accomplished on Christ’s part by his death, on
          the Father’s part by his resurrection; Christ performed what he
          promised in the one, and God acknowledgeth the validity of it, and
          performs what he had promised in the other. The covenant of grace,
          founded upon this covenant of redemption, is sealed in the sacrament;
          God owns his standing to the terms of it, as sealed by the blood of
          the Mediator, by presenting him to us under those signs, and gives us
          a right upon faith to the enjoyment of the fruits of it. As the right
          of a house is made over by the delivery of the key, and the right of
          land translated by the delivery of a turf; whereby he gives us
          assurance of his reality, and a strong support to our confidence in
          him; not that there is any virtue and power of sealing in the elements
          themselves, no more than there is in a turf to give an enfeoffment in
          a parcel of land; but as the power of one is derived from the order of
          the law, so the confirming power of the sacrament is derived from the
          institution of God; as the oil wherewith kings were anointed, did not
          of itself confer upon them that royal dignity, but it was a sign of
          their investiture into office, ordered by Divine institution. We can
          with no reason imagine, that God intended them as naked signs or
          pictures, to please our eyes with the image of them, to represent
          their own figures to our eyes, but to confirm something to our
          understanding by the efficacy of the Spirit accompanying them:984 they
          convey to the believing receiver what they represent, as the great
          seal of a prince, fixed to the parchment, doth the pardon of a rebel
          as well as its own figure. Christ’s death, and the grace of the
          covenant is not only signified, but the fruits and merit of that death
          communicated also. Thus doth Divine goodness evidence itself, not only
          in making a gracious covenant with us, but fixing seals to it; not to
          strengthen his own obligation, which stood stronger than the
          foundations of heaven and earth, upon the credit of his word, but to
          strengthen our weakness, and support our security, by something which
          might appear more formal and solemn than a bare word. By this, the
          Divine goodness provides against our spiritual faintings, and shows us
          by real signs as well as verbal declarations, that the covenant sealed
          by the blood of Christ, is unalterable; and thereby would fortify and
          mount our hopes to degrees in some measure suitable to the kindness of
          the covenant, and the dignity of the Redeemer’s blood. And it is yet a
          further degree of this goodness, that he hath appointed us so often to
          celebrate it, whereby he shows how careful he is to keep up our
          tottering faith, and preserve us constant in our obedience; obliging
          himself to the performance of his promise, and obliging us to the
          payment of our duty.

          2. His goodness is seen in the sacrament in giving us in it an union
          and communion with Christ. There is not only a commemoration of Christ
          dying, but a communication of Christ living. The apostle strongly
          asserts it by way of interrogation (1 Cor. x. 16), “The cup of
          blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
          Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body
          of Christ?” In the cup there is a communication of the blood of
          Christ, a conveyance of a right to the merits of his death, and the
          blessedness of his life: we are not less by this made one body with
          Christ than we are by baptism (1 Cor. xii. 13): and “put on Christ”
          living in this, as well as in baptism (Gal. iii. 27); that as his
          taking our infirm flesh was a real incarnation, so the giving us his
          flesh to eat is a mystical incarnation in believers, whereby they
          become one body with him as crucified, and one body with him as risen;
          for if Christ himself be received by faith in the word (Col. ii. 6),
          he is no less received by faith in the sacrament. When the Holy Ghost
          is said to be received, the graces or gifts of the Holy Ghost are
          received; so when Christ is received, the fruits of his death are
          really partaken of. The Israelites that ate of the sacrifices, did
          “partake of the altar” (1 Cor. x. 18), i. e. had a communion with the
          God of Israel, to whom they had been sacrificed; and those that “ate
          of the sacrifices” offered to idols, had a “fellowship with devils,”
          to whom those sacrifices were offered (ver. 20). Those that partake of
          the sacraments in a due manner, have a communion with that God to whom
          it was sacrificed, and a communion with that body which was sacrificed
          to God; not that the substance of that body and blood is wrapped up in
          the elements, or that the bread and wine are transformed into the body
          and blood of Christ, but as they represent him, and by virtue of the
          institution are, in estimation himself, his own body and blood; by the
          same reason as he is called “Christ our passover,” he may be called
          “Christ our supper” (1 Cor. v. 7): for as they are so reckoned to an
          unworthy receiver, as if they were the real body and blood of Christ,
          because by his not discerning the Lord’s body in it, or making light
          of it as common bread, he is judged “guilty of the body and blood of
          Christ,” guilty of treating him in as base a manner as the Jews did
          when they crowned him with thorns (1 Cor. xi. 27, 29): by the same
          reason they must be reckoned to a worthy receiver, as the very body
          and blood of Christ: so that as the unworthy receiver “eats and drinks
          damnation,” the worthy receiver “eats and drinks” salvation. It would
          be an empty mystery, and unworthy of an institution by Divine
          goodness, if there were not some communion with Christ in it: there
          would be some kind of deceit in the precept, “Take, eat, and drink,
          this is my body and blood,” if there were not a conveyance of
          spiritual vital influences to our souls: for the natural end of eating
          and drinking is the nourishment and increase of the body, and
          preservation of life, by that which we eat and drink. The infinite
          wise, gracious, and true God, would never give us empty figures
          without accomplishing that which is signified by them, and suitable to
          them. How great is this goodness of God! he would have his Son in us,
          one with us, straitly joined to us, as if we were his proper flesh and
          blood: in the incarnation Divine goodness united him to our nature; in
          the sacrament, it doth in a sort unite him with his purchased
          privileges to our persons; we have not a communion with a part or a
          member of his body, or a drop of his blood, but with his whole body
          and blood, represented in every part of the elements. The angels in
          the heaven enjoy not so great a privilege; they have the honor to be
          under him as their Head, but not that of having him for their food;
          they behold him, but they do not taste him. And, certainly, that
          goodness that hath condescended so much to our weakness, would impart
          it to us in a very glorious manner, were we capable of it. But,
          because a man cannot behold the light of the sun in its full splendor
          by reason of the infirmities of his eyes, he must behold it by the
          help of a glass, and such a communication through a colored and opaque
          glass, is as real from the sun itself, though not so glorious, but
          more shrouded and obscure; it is the same light that shines through
          that medium, as spreads itself gloriously in the open air, though the
          one be masked, and the other open‑faced. To conclude this, by the way,
          we may take notice of the neglect of this ordinance: if it be a token
          of Divine goodness to appoint it, it is no sign of our estimation of
          Divine goodness to neglect it. He that values the kindness of his
          friend, will accept of his invitation, if there be not some strong
          impediments in the way, or so much familiarity with him that his
          refusal upon a light occasion would not be unkindly taken. But though
          God put on the disposition of a friend to us, yet he looseth not the
          authority of a sovereign; and the humble familiarity he invites us to,
          doth not diminish the condition and duty of a subject. A sovereign
          prince would not take it well, if a favorite should refuse the offered
          honor of his table. The viands of God are not to be slighted. Can we
          live better upon our poor pittance than upon his dainties? Did not
          Divine goodness condescend in it to the weakness of our faith, and
          shall we conceit our faith stronger than God thinks it? If he thought
          fit by those seals to make a deed of gift to us, shall we be so
          unmannerly to him, and such enemies to the security he offers us over
          and above his word, as not to accept it? Are we unwilling to have our
          souls inflamed with love, our hearts filled with comfort, and armed
          against the attempts of our enemies? It is true, there is a guilt of
          the body and blood of Christ contracted by a slightness in the manner
          of attending; is it not also contracted by a refusal and neglect? What
          is the language of it? If it speaks not the death of Christ in vain,
          it speaks the institution of this ordinance as a remembrance of his
          death, to be a vanity, and no mark of Divine goodness. Let us,
          therefore, put such a value upon Divine goodness in this affair, as to
          be willing to receive the conveyances of his love, and fresh
          engagements of our duty; the one is due from us to the kindness of our
          friend, and the other belongs to our duty as his subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          vi. By this redemption God restores us to a more excellent condition
          than Adam had in innocence. Christ was sent by Divine goodness, not
          only to restore the life Adam’s sin had stripped us of, but to give it
          more abundantly than Adam’s standing could have conveyed it to us
          (John x. 10), “I am come that they might have life, and that they
          might have it more abundantly.” More abundantly for strength, more
          abundantly for duration, a life abounding with greater felicity and
          glory: the substance of those better promises of the new covenant than
          what attended the old. There are fuller streams of grace by Christ
          than flowed to Adam, or could flow from Adam. As Christ never restored
          any to health and strength while he was in the world, but he gave them
          a greater measure of both than they had before; so there is the same
          kindness, no question, manifested in our spiritual condition. Adam’s
          life might have preserved us, but Adam’s death could not have rescued
          either himself or his posterity; but, in our redemption, we have a
          Redeemer, who hath “died to expiate our sins,” and so crowned with
          life to save, and forever preserve our persons (Rom. v. 10), “Because
          I live, ye shall live also:” so that by redeeming goodness the life of
          a believer is as perpetual as the life of the Redeemer Christ (John
          xiv. 19). Adam, though innocent, was under the danger of perishing; a
          believer, though culpable, is above the fears of mutability. Adam had
          a holiness in his nature, but capable of being lost; by Christ
          believers have a holiness bestowed, not capable of being rifled, but
          which will remain till it be at last fully perfected: though they have
          a power to change in their nature, yet they are above an actual final
          change by the indulgence of Divine grace. Adam stood by himself;
          believers stand in a root, impossible to be shaken or corrupted: by
          this means the “promise is sure to all the seed” (Rom. iv. 16). Christ
          is a stronger person than Adam, who can never break covenant with God,
          and the truth of God will never break covenant with him. We are united
          to a more excellent Head than Adam: instead of a root merely human, we
          have a root Divine as well as human. In him we had the righteousness
          of a creature merely human; in this we have a righteousness divine,
          the righteousness of God‑man; the stock is no longer in our own hands,
          but in the hands of One that cannot embezzle it, or forfeit it: Divine
          goodness hath deposited it strongly for our security. The stamp we
          receive, by the Divine goodness, from the second Adam, is more noble
          than that we should have received from the first, had he remained in
          his created state: Adam was formed of the dust of the earth, and the
          new man is formed by the incorruptible seed of the word; and at the
          resurrection, the body of man shall be endued with better qualities
          than Adam had at creation: they shall be like that glorious Body which
          is in heaven, in union with the person of the “Son of God” (Phil. iii.
          21). Adam, at the best, had but an earthly body, but the Lord from
          heaven hath a “heavenly body,” the image of which shall be borne by
          the redeemed ones, as they have borne the image of the earthly (1 Cor.
          xv. 47‒49). Adam had the society of beasts; redeemed ones expect, by
          Divine goodness in redemption, a commerce with angels; as they are
          reconciled to them by his death, they shall certainly come to converse
          with them at the consummation of their happiness; as they are made of
          one family, so they will have a peculiar intimacy: Adam had a
          paradise, and redeemed ones a heaven provided for them; a happier
          place with a richer furniture. It is much to give so complete a
          paradise to innocent Adam; but more to give heaven to an ungrateful
          Adam, and his rebellious posterity: it had been abundant goodness to
          have restored us to the same condition in that paradise from whence we
          were ejected; but a superabundant goodness to bestow upon us a better
          habitation in heaven, which we could never have expected. How great is
          that goodness, when by sin we were fallen to be worse than nothing,
          that He should raise us to be more than what we were; that restored
          us, not to the first step of our creation, but to many degrees of
          elevation beyond it! not only restores us, but prefers us; not only
          striking off our chains, to set us free, but clothing us with a robe
          of righteousness, to render us honorable; not only quenching our hell,
          but preparing a heaven; not re‑garnishing an earthly, but providing a
          richer palace: his goodness was so great, that, after it had rescued
          us, it would not content itself with the old furniture, but makes all
          new for us in another world; a new wine to drink; a new heaven to
          dwell in; a more magnificent structure for our habitation: thus hath
          Goodness prepared for us a straiter union, a stronger life, a purer
          righteousness, an unshaken standing, and a fuller glory; all more
          excellent than was within the compass of innocent Adam’s possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          vii. This goodness in redemption extends itself to the lower creation.
          It takes in, not only man, but the whole creation, except the fallen
          angels, and gives a participation of it to insensible creatures; upon
          the account of this redemption the sun, and all kind of creatures,
          were preserved, which otherwise had sunk into destruction upon the sin
          of man, and ceased from their being, as man had utterly ceased from
          his happiness (Colos. i. 17): “By him all things consist.” The fall of
          man brought, not only a misery upon himself, but a vanity upon the
          creature; the earth groaned under a curse for his sake. They were all
          created for the glory of God, and the support of man in the
          performance of his duty, who was obliged to use them for the honor of
          Him that created them both. Had man been true to his obligations, and
          used the creatures for that end to which they were dedicated by the
          Creator; as God would have then rejoiced in his works, so his works
          would have rejoiced in the honor of answering so excellent an end: but
          when man lost his integrity, the creatures lost their perfection; the
          honor of them was stained when they were debased to serve the lusts of
          a traitor, instead of supporting the duty of a subject, and employed
          in the defence of the vices of men against the precepts and authority
          of their common Sovereign. This was a vilifying the creature, as it
          would be a vilifying the sword of a prince, which is, for the
          maintenance of justice, to be used for the murder of an innocent; and
          a dishonoring a royal mansion, to make it a storehouse for a dunghill.
          Had those things the benefit of sense, they would groan under this
          disgrace, and rise up in indignation against them that offered them
          this affront, and turned them from their proper end. When sin entered,
          the heavens that were made to shine upon man, and the earth that was
          made to bear and nourish an innocent creature, were now subjected to
          serve a rebellious creature; and as man turned against God, so he made
          those instruments against God, to serve his enmity, luxury,
          sensuality. Hence the creatures are said to groan (Rom. viii. 22);
          “The whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.”
          They would really groan, had they understanding to be sensible of the
          outrage done them. “The whole creation.”—It is the pang of universal
          nature, the agony of the whole creation, to be alienated from the
          original use for which they were intended, and be disjointed from
          their end to serve the disloyalty of a rebel. The drunkard’s cup, and
          the glutton’s table, the adulterer’s bed, and the proud man’s purple,
          would groan against the abuser of them. But when all the fruits of
          redemption shall be completed, the goodness of God shall pour itself
          upon the creatures, deliver them from the “bondage of corruption into
          the glorious liberty of the children of God” (Rom. viii. 21); they
          shall be reduced to their true end, and returned in their original
          harmony. As the creation doth passionately groan under its vanity, so
          it doth “earnestly expect and wait for its deliverance at the time of
          the manifestation of the sons of God” (ver. 19). The manifestation of
          the sons of God is the attainment of the liberty of the creature. They
          shall be freed from the vanity under which they are enslaved; as it
          entered by sin, it shall vanish upon the total removal of sin. What
          use they were designed for in paradise they will have afterwards,
          except that of the nourishment of men, who shall be as “angels,
          neither eating nor drinking:” the glory of God shall be seen and
          contemplated in them. It can hardly be thought that God made the world
          to be little a moment after he had reared it, sullied by the sin of
          man, and turned from its original end, without thoughts of a
          restoration of it to its true end, as well as man to his lost
          happiness. The world was made for man: man hath not yet enjoyed the
          creature in the first intention of them; sin made an interruption in
          that fruition. As redemption restores man to his true end, so it
          restores the creatures to their true use. The restoration of the world
          to its beauty and order was the design of the Divine goodness in the
          coming of Christ, as it is intimated in Isa. xi. 6‒9; as he “came not
          to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,” so he came not to destroy the
          creatures, but to repair them: to restore to God the honor and
          pleasure of the creation, and restore to the creatures their felicity
          in restoring their order: the fall corrupted it, and the full
          redemption of men restores it. The last time is called, not a time of
          destruction, but a “time of restitution,” and that “of all things”
          (Acts iii. 21) of universal nature, the main part of the creation at
          least. All those things which were the effects of sin will be
          abolished; the removal of the cause beats down the effect. The
          disorder and unruliness of the creature, arising from the venom of
          man’s transgression, all the fierceness of one creature against
          another shall vanish. The world shall be nothing but an universal
          smile; nature shall put on triumphant vestments: there shall be no
          affrighting thunders, choking mists, venomous vapors, or poisonous
          plants. It would not else be a restitution of all things. They are now
          subject to be wasted by judgments for the sin of their possessor, but
          the perfection of man’s redemptions shall free them from every misery.
          They have an advancement at the present, for they are under a more
          glorious Head, as being the possession of Christ, the heavenly Adam,
          much superior to the first: as it is the glory of a person to be a
          servant to a prince, rather than a peasant. And afterwards, they shall
          be elevated to a better state, sharing in man’s happiness, as well as
          they did in his misery: as servants are interested in the good fortune
          of their master, and bettered by his advance in his prince’s favor. As
          man in his first creation was mutable and liable to sin, so the
          creatures were liable to vanity; but as man by grace shall be freed
          from the mutability, so shall the creatures be freed from the fears of
          an invasion, by the vanity that sullied them before. The condition of
          the servants shall be suited to that of their Lord, for whom they were
          designed: hence, all creatures are called upon to rejoice upon the
          perfection of salvation, and the appearance of Christ’s royal
          authority in the world. If they were to be destroyed, there would be
          no ground to invite them to triumph (Ps. xcvi. 11, 12; cxviii. 7, 8).
          Thus doth Divine goodness spread its kind arms over the whole
          creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. The third thing is the goodness of God in his Government.
          That goodness that despised not their creation, doth not despise their
          conduct. The same goodness that was the head that framed them, is the
          helm that guides them; his goodness hovers over the whole frame,
          either to prevent any wild disorders unsuitable to his creating end,
          or to conduct them to those ends which might illustrate his wisdom and
          goodness to his creatures. His goodness doth no less incline him to
          provide for them, than to frame them. It is the natural inclination of
          man to love what is purely the birth of his own strength or skill. He
          is fond of preserving his own inventions, as well as laborious in
          inventing them. It is the glory of a man to preserve them, as well as
          to produce them. God loves everything which he hath made, which love
          could not be without a continued diffusiveness to them, suitable to
          the end for which he made them. It would be a vain goodness, if it did
          not interest itself in managing the world, as well as erecting it:
          without his government everything in the world would jostle against
          one another: the beauty of it would be more defaced, it would be an
          unruly mass, a confused chaos rather than a Κόσμος, a comely world. If
          Divine goodness respected it when it was nothing, it would much more
          respect it when it was something, by the sole virtue of his power and
          good‑will to it, without any motive from anything else than himself,
          because there was nothing else but himself. But since he sees his own
          stamp in things without himself in the creature, which is a kind of
          motive or moving object to Divine goodness to preserve it, when there
          was nothing without himself that could be any motive to Him to create
          it: as when God hath created a creature, and it falls into misery,
          that misery of the creature, though it doth not necessitate his mercy,
          yet meeting with such an affection as mercy in his nature, is a moving
          object to excite it; as the repentance of Nineveh drew forth the
          exercise of his pity and preserving goodness. Certainly, since God is
          good, he is bountiful; and if bountiful, he is provident. He would
          seem to envy and malign his creatures, if he did not provide for them,
          while he intends to use them: but infinite goodness cannot be effected
          with envy; for all envy implies a want of that good in ourselves,
          which we regard with so evil an eye in another. But God, being
          infinitely blessed, hath not the want of any good that can be a rise
          to such an uncomely disposition. The Jews thought that Divine goodness
          extended only to them in an immediate and particular care, and left
          all other nations and things to the guidance of angels. But the
          Psalmist (Ps. cvii. a psalm calculated for the celebration of this
          perfection, in the continued course of his providence throughout all
          ages of the world) ascribes to Divine goodness immediately all the
          advantages men meet with. He helps them in their actions, presides
          over their motions, inspects their several conditions, labors day and
          night in a perpetual care of them. The whole life of the world is
          linked together by Divine goodness. Everything is ordered by him in
          the place where he hath set it, without which the world would be
          stripped of that excellency it hath by creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. This goodness is evident in the care he hath of all creatures.
          There is a peculiar goodness to his people; but this takes not away
          his general goodness to the world: though a master of a family hath a
          choicer affection to those that have an affinity to him in nature, and
          stand in a nearer relation, as his wife, children, servants; yet he
          hath a regard to his cattle, and other creatures he nourisheth in his
          house. All things are not only before his eyes, but in his bosom; he
          is the nurse of all creatures, supplying their wants, and sustaining
          them from that nothing they tend to. The “earth is full of his riches”
          (Ps. civ. 24); not a creek or cranny but partakes of it. Abundant
          goodness daily hovers over it, as well as hatched it. The whole world
          swims in the rich bounty of the Creator, as the fish do in the
          largeness of the sea, and birds in the spaciousness of the air.985 The
          goodness of God is the river that waters the whole earth. As a
          lifeless picture casts its eye upon every one in the room, so doth a
          living God upon everything in the world. And as the sun illuminates
          all things which are capable of partaking of its light, and diffuseth
          its beams to all things which are capable of receiving them, so doth
          God spread his wings over the whole creation, and neglects nothing,
          wherein he sees a mark of his first creating goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. His goodness is seen, in preserving all things. “O Lord, thou
          preservest man and beast” (Ps. xxxvi. 6). Not only man, but beasts,
          and beasts as well as men; man, as the most excellent creature, and
          beasts as being serviceable to man, and instruments of his worldly
          happiness. He continues the species of all things, concurs with them
          in their distinct offices, and quickens the womb of nature. He visits
          man every day, and makes him feel the effects of his providence, in
          giving him “fruitful seasons, and filling his heart with food and
          gladness” (Acts xiv. 17), as witnesses of his liberality and kindness
          to man. “The earth is visited and watered by the river of God. He
          settles the furrows of the earth, and makes it soft with showers,”
          that the corn may be nourished in its womb, and spring up to maturity.
          “He crowns the year with his goodness, and his paths drop fatness. The
          little hills rejoice on every side; the pastures are clothed with
          flocks, and the valleys are covered over with corn,” as the Psalmist
          elegantly says (Ps. lxv. 9, 10; cvii. 35, 36). He waters the ground by
          his showers, and preserves the little seed from the rapine of animals.
          “He draws not out the evil arrows of famine,” as the expression is
          (Ezek. v. 16). Every day shines with new beams of his Divine goodness.
          The vastness of this city, and the multitudes of living souls in it,
          is an astonishing argument. What streams of nourishing necessaries are
          daily conveyed to it! Every mouth hath bread to sustain it; and among
          all the number of poor in the bowels and skirts of it, how rare is it
          to hear of any starved to death for want of it! Every day he “spreads
          a table” for us, and that with varieties, and “fills our cups” (Ps.
          xxiii. 5). He shortens not his hand, nor withdraws his bounty: the
          increase of one year by his blessing, restores what was spent by the
          former. He is the “strength of our life” (Ps. xxvii. 1), continuing
          the vigor of our limbs, and the health of our bodies; secures us from
          “terrors by night, and the arrows of diseases that fly by day” (Ps.
          xci. 5); “sets a hedge about our estates” (Job i. 10), and defends
          them against the attempts of violence; preserves our houses from
          flames that might consume them, and our persons from the dangers that
          lie in wait for them; watcheth over us “in our goings out, and our
          comings in” (Ps. cxxi. 8), and way‑lays a thousand dangers we know not
          of: and employs the most glorious creatures in heaven in the service
          of mean “men upon earth” (Ps. xci. 11): not by a faint order, but a
          pressing charge over them, to “keep them in all his ways.” Those that
          are his immediate servants before his throne, he sends to minister to
          them that were once his rebels. By an angel he conducted the affairs
          of Abraham (Gen. xxiv. 7): and by an angel secured the life of Ishmael
          (Gen. xxi. 17): glorious angels for mean man, holy angels for impure
          man, powerful angels for weak man. How in the midst of great dangers,
          doth his sudden light dissipate our great darkness, and create a
          deliverance out of nothing! How often is he found a present help in
          time of trouble! When all other assistance seems to stand at a
          distance, he flies to us beyond our expectations, and raises us up on
          the sudden from the pit of our dejectedness, as well as that of our
          danger, exceeding our wishes, and shooting beyond our desires as well
          as our deserts. How often, in the time of confusion, doth he preserve
          an indefensible place from the attacks of enemies, like a bark in the
          midst of a tempestuous sea! the rage falls upon other places round
          about them, and, by a secret efficacy of Divine goodness, is not able
          to touch them. He hath peculiar preservations for his Israel in Egypt,
          and his Lots in Sodom, his Daniels in the lions’ dens, and his
          children in a fiery furnace. He hath a tenderness for all, but a
          peculiar affection to those that are in covenant with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The goodness of God is seen in taking care of the animals and
          inanimate things. Divine goodness embraceth in its arms the lowest
          worm as well as the loftiest cherubim: he provides food for the
          “crying ravens” (Ps. cxlvii. 9), and a prey for the appetite of the
          “hungry lion” (Ps. civ. 21): “He opens his hand, and fills with good
          those innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts; they
          are all waiters upon him, and all are satisfied by their bountiful
          Master” (Ps. civ. 25‒28). They are better provided for by the hand of
          heaven, than the best favorite is by an earthly prince: for “they are
          filled with good.” He hath made channels in the wildest deserts, for
          the watering of beasts, and trees for the nests and “habitation of
          birds” (Ps. civ. 10, 12, 17). As a Law‑giver to the Jews, he took care
          that the poor beast should not be abused by the cruelty of man: he
          provided for the ease of the laboring beast in that command of the
          Sabbath, wherein he provided for his own service: the cattle was to do
          “no work” on it (Exod. xx. 10). He ordered that the mouth of the ox
          should not be muzzled while it trod out the corn (Deut. xxv. 4, it
          being the manner of those countries to separate the corn from the
          stalk by that means, as we do in this by thrashing), regarding it as a
          part of cruelty to deprive the poor beast of tasting, and satisfying
          itself with that which he was so officious by his labor to prepare for
          the use of man. And when any met with a nest of young birds, though
          they might take the young to their use, they were forbidden to seize
          upon the dam, that she might not lose the objects of her affection and
          her own liberty in one day (Deut. xxii. 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          And see how God enforceth this precept with a threatening of a
          shortness of life, if they transgressed it (Deut. xxii. 7)! “Thou
          shalt let the dam go, that it may be well with thee, and that thou
          mayest prolong thy days.” He would revenge the cruelty to dumb
          creatures with the shortness of the oppressor’s life: nor would he
          have cruelty used to creatures that were separated for his worship: he
          therefore provides that a cow, or an ewe, and their young ones, should
          “not be killed for sacrifice in one day” (Lev. xxii. 28). All which
          precepts, say the Jews, are to teach men mercifulness to their beasts;
          so much doth Divine goodness bow down itself, to take notice of those
          mean creatures, which men have so little regard to, but for their own
          advantage; yea, he is so good, that he would have worship declined for
          a time in favor of a distressed beast; the “helping a sheep, or an ox,
          or an ass, out of a pit,” was indulged them even “on the Sabbath‑day,”
          a day God had peculiarly sanctified and ordered for his service (Matt.
          xii. 11; Luke xiv. 5): in this case he seems to remit for a time the
          rights of the Deity for the rescue of a mere animal. His goodness
          extends not only to those kind of creatures that have life, but to the
          insensible ones; he clothes the grass, and “arrays the lilies of the
          field” with a greater glory than Solomon had upon his throne (Matt.
          vi. 28, 29); and such care he had of those trees which bore fruit for
          the maintenance of man or beast, that he forbids any injury to be
          offered to them, and bars the rapine and violence, which by soldiers
          used to be practised (Deut. xx. 19), though it were to promote the
          conquest of their enemy. How much goodness is it, that he should think
          of so small a thing as man! How much more that he should concern
          himself in things that seem so petty as beasts and trees! Persons
          seated in a sovereign throne, think it a debasing of their dignity to
          regard little things: but God, who is infinitely greater in majesty
          above the mightiest potentate, and the highest angel, yet is so
          infinitely good, as to employ his divine thoughts about the meanest
          things. He who possesses the praises of angels, leaves not off the
          care of the meanest creatures: and that majesty that dwells in a pure
          heaven, and an inconceivable light, stoops to provide for the ease of
          those creatures that lie and lodge in the dirt and dung of the earth.
          How should we be careful not to use those unmercifully, which God
          takes such care of in his law, and not to distrust that goodness, that
          opens his hand so liberally to creatures of another rank!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The goodness of God is seen in taking care of the meanest rational
          creatures; as servants and criminals. He provided for the liberty of
          slaves, and would not have their chains continue longer than the
          seventh year, unless they would voluntarily continue under the power
          of their masters; and that upon pain of his displeasure, and the
          withdrawing his blessing (Deut. xv. 18). And though, by the laws of
          many nations, masters had an absolute power of life and death over
          their servants, yet God provided that no member should be lamed, not
          an eye, no, nor a tooth, struck out, but the master was to pay for his
          folly and fury the price of the “liberty of his servant” (Exod. xxi.
          26, 27): he would not suffer the abused servant to be any longer under
          the power of that man that had not humanity to use him as one of the
          same kindred and blood with himself. And though those servants might
          be never so wicked, yet, when unjustly afflicted, God would interest
          himself as their guardian in their protection and delivery. And when a
          poor slave had been provoked, by the severity of his master’s fury, to
          turn fugitive from him, he was, by Divine order, not to be delivered
          up again to his master’s fury, but dwell in that city, and with that
          person, to whom he had “fled for refuge” (Deut. xxiii. 15, 16). And
          when public justice was to be administered upon the lesser sort of
          criminals, the goodness of God ordered the “number of blows” not to
          exceed forty, and left not the fury of man to measure out the
          punishment to excess (Deut. xxv. 3). And in any just quarrel against a
          provoking and injuring enemy, he ordered them not to ravage with the
          sword till they had summoned a rendition of the place (Deut. xx. 10).
          And as great a care he took of the poor, that they should have the
          gleanings both of the vineyard and field (Lev. xix. 10; xxiii. 22),
          and not be forced to pay “usury for the money lent them” (Exod. xxii.
          25).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. His goodness is seen in taking care of the wickedest persons. “The
          earth is full of his goodness” (Ps. xxxvii. 5). The wicked as well as
          the good enjoy it; they that dare lift up their hands against heaven
          in the posture of rebels, as well as those that lift up their eyes in
          the condition of suppliants. To do good to a criminal, far surmounts
          that goodness that flows down upon an innocent object: now God is not
          only good to those that have some degrees of goodness, but to those
          that have the greatest degrees of wickedness, to men that turn his
          liberality into affronts of him, and have scarce an appetite to
          anything but the violation of his authority and goodness. Though, upon
          the fall of Adam, we have lost the pleasant habitation of paradise,
          and the creatures made for our use are fallen from their original
          excellency and sweetness; yet he hath not left the world utterly
          incommodious for us, but yet stores it with things not only for the
          preservation, but delight of those that make their whole lives
          invectives against this good God. Manna fell from heaven for the
          rebellious as well as for the obedient Israelites. Cain as well as
          Abel, and Esau as well as Jacob, had the influences of his sun, and
          the benefits of his showers. The world is yet a kind of paradise to
          the veriest beasts among mankind; the earth affords its riches, the
          heavens its showers, and the sun its light, to those that injure and
          blaspheme him: “He makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
          and sends rain on the just and on the unjust” (Matt. v. 45). The
          wickedest breathe in his air, walk upon his earth, and drink of his
          water, as well as the best. The sun looks with as pleasant and bright
          an eye upon a rebellious Absalom, as a righteous David; the earth
          yields its plants and medicines to one as well as to the other; it is
          seldom that He deprives any of the faculties of their souls, or any
          members of their bodies. God distributes his blessings where he might
          shoot his thunders; and darts his light on those who deserve an
          eternal darkness; and presents the good things of the earth to those
          that merit the miseries of hell; for “the earth, and the fulness
          thereof, is the Lord’s” (Ps. xxiv. 1); everything in it is his in
          propriety, ours in trust; it is his corn, his wine (Hos. ii. 8); he
          never divested himself of the propriety, though he grants us the use;
          and by those good things he supports multitudes of wicked men, not one
          or two, but the whole shoal of them in the world; for he is “the
          Saviour of all men,” i. e. is the preserver of all men (1 Tim. iv.
          10). And as he created them, when he foresaw they would be wicked; so
          he provides for them, when he beholds them in their ungodliness. The
          ingratitude of men stops not the current of his bounty, nor tires his
          liberal hand; howsoever unprofitable and injurious men are to him, he
          is liberal to them; and his goodness is the more admirable, by how
          much the more the unthankfulness of men is provoking: he sometimes
          affords to the worst a greater portion of these earthly goods; they
          often swim in wealth, when others pine away their lives in poverty.
          And the silk‑worm yields its bowels to make purple for tyrants, while
          the oppressed scarce have from the sheep wool enough to cover their
          nakedness; and though he furnish men with those good things, upon no
          other account than what princes do, when they nourish criminals in a
          prison till the time of their execution, it is a mark of his goodness.
          Is it not the kindness of a prince to treat his rebels deliciously? to
          give them the liberty of the prison, and the enjoyments of the
          delights of the place, rather than to load their legs with fetters,
          and lodge them in a dark and loathsome dungeon, till he orders them,
          for their crime, to be conducted to the scaffold or gibbet? Since God
          is thus kind to the vilest men, whose meanness, by reason of sin, is
          beyond that of any other creature, as to shoot such rays of goodness
          upon them; how inexpressible would be the expressions of his goodness,
          if the Divine image were as pure and bright upon them as it was upon
          innocent Adam!
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. His goodness is evident in the preservation of human society. It
          belongs to his power that he is able to do it, but to his goodness
          that he is willing to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This goodness appears in prescribing rules for it. The moral law
          consists but of ten precepts, and there are more of them ordered for
          the support of human society, than for the adoration and honor of
          himself (Exod. xx. 1, 2); four for the rights of God, and six for the
          rights of man, and his security in his authority, relations, life,
          goods, and reputation; superiors not to be dishonored, life not to be
          invaded, chastity not to be stained, goods not to be filched, good
          name not to be cracked by false witness, nor anything belonging to our
          neighbor to be coveted; and in the whole Scripture, not only that
          which was calculated for the Jews, but compiled for the whole world;
          he hath fixed rules for the ordering all relations, magistrates, and
          subjects; parents and children; husbands and wives; masters and
          servants; rich and poor, find their distinct qualifications and
          duties. There would be a paradisiacal state, if men had a goodness to
          observe what God hath had a goodness to order for the strengthening
          the sinews of human society; the world would not groan under
          oppressing tyrants, nor princes tremble under discontented subjects,
          or mighty rebels; children would not be provoked to anger by the
          unreasonableness of their parents, nor parents sink under grief by the
          rebellion of their children; masters would not tyrannize over the
          meanest of their servants, nor servants invade the authority of their
          masters.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The goodness of God in the preserving human society, is seen in
          setting a magistracy to preserve it. Magistracy is from God in its
          original; the charter was drawn up in paradise; civil subordination
          must have been had man remained in innocence; but the charter was more
          explicitly renewed and enlarged at the restoration of the world after
          the deluge, and given out to man under the broad seal of heaven;
          “Whoso sheds man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed” (Gen. ix.
          6). The command of shedding the blood of a murderer was a part of his
          goodness, to secure the lives of those that bore his image.
          Magistrates are “the shields of the earth,” but they “belong to God”
          (Ps. xlvii. 9). They are fruits of his goodness in their original, and
          authority; were there no magistracy, there would be no government, no
          security to any man under his own vine and fig tree; the world would
          be a den of wild beasts preying upon one another; every one would do
          what seems good in his eyes; the loss of government is a judgment God
          brings upon a nation when men become “as the fishes of the sea,” to
          devour one another, because they “have no ruler over them” (Hab. i.
          14). Private dissensions will break out into public disorders and
          combustions.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The goodness of God in the preservation of human society, is seen
          in the restraints of the passions of men. He sets bounds to the
          passions of men as well as to the rollings of the sea; “He stilleth
          the noise of the waves, and the tumults of the people” (Ps. lxv. 7).
          Though God hath erected a magistracy to stop the breaking out of those
          floods of licentiousness, which swell in the hearts of men; yet, if
          God should not hold stiff reins on the necks of those tumultuous and
          foaming passions, the world would be a place of unruly confusion, and
          hell triumph upon earth; a crazy state would be quickly broke in
          pieces by boisterous nature. The tumults of a people could no more be
          quelled by the force of man, than the rage of the sea by a puff of
          breath; without Divine goodness, neither the wisdom nor watchfulness
          of the magistrates, nor the industry of officers, could preserve a
          state. The laws of men would be too slight to curb the lusts of men,
          if the goodness of God did not restrain them by a secret hand, and
          interweave their temporal security with observance of those laws. The
          sons of Belial did murmur when Saul was chosen king; and that they did
          no more was the goodness of God, for the preservation of human
          society. If God did not restrain the impetuousness of men’s lusts,
          they would be the entire ruin of human society; their lusts would
          render them as bad as beasts, and change the world into a savage
          wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The goodness of God is seen in the preservation of human society,
          in giving various inclinations to men for public advantage. If all men
          had an inclination to one science or art, they would all stand idle
          spectators of one another; but God hath bestowed various dispositions
          and gifts upon men, for the promoting the common good, that they may
          not only be useful to themselves, but to society. He will have none
          idle, none unuseful, but every one acting in a due place, according to
          their measures, for the good of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The goodness of God is seen in the witness he bears against those
          sins that disturb human society. In those cases he is pleased to
          interest himself in a more signal manner, to cool those that make it
          their business to overturn the order he hath established for the good
          of the earth. He doth not so often in this world punish those faults
          committed immediately against his own honor, as those that put the
          world into a hurry and confusion: as a good governor is more merciful
          to crimes against himself, than those against his community. It is
          observed that the most turbulent seditious persons in a state come to
          most violent ends, as Corah, Adonijah, Zimri: Ahithopel draws
          Absalom’s sword against David and Israel, and the next is, he twists a
          halter for himself: Absalom heads a party against his father, and God,
          by a goodness to Israel, hangs him up, and prevents not its safety by
          David’s indulgence, and a future rebellion, had life been spared by
          the fondness of his father. His providence is more evident in
          discovering disturbers, and the causes that move them, in defeating
          their enterprises, and digging the contrivers out of their caverns and
          lurking holes: in such cases, God doth so act, and use such methods,
          that he silenceth any creature from challenging any partnership with
          him in the discovery. He doth more severely in this world correct
          those actions that unlink the mutual assistance between man and man,
          and the charitable and kind correspondence he would have kept up. The
          sins for which the “wrath of God comes upon the children of
          disobedience” (Col. iii. 5, 6) in this world are of this sort; and
          when princes will be oppressing the people, God will be “pouring
          contempt on the princes, and set the poor on high from affliction”
          (Ps. cvii. 40, 41). An evidence of God’s care and kindness in the
          preserving human society, is those strange discoveries of murders,
          though never so clandestine and subtilly committed, more than of any
          other crime among men: Divine care never appears more than in bringing
          those hidden and injurious works of darkness to light, and a due
          punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. His goodness is seen in ordering mutual offices to one another
          against the current of men’s passions. Upon this account he ordered,
          in his laws for the government of the Israelites, that a man should
          reduce the wandering beast of his enemy to the hand of his rightful
          proprietor, though he were a provoking enemy; and also “help the poor
          beast that belonged to one that hated him, when he saw him sink under
          his burden” (Exod. xxiii. 4, 5). When mutual assistance was necessary,
          he would not have men considered as enemies, or considered as wicked,
          but as of the same blood with ourselves, that we might be serviceable
          to one another for the preservation of life and goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. His goodness is seen in remitting something of his own right, for
          the preserving a due dependence and subjection. He declines the right
          he had to the vows of a minor, or one under the power of another,
          waving what he might challenge by the voluntary obligation of his
          creature, to keep up the due order between parents and children,
          husbands and wives, superiors and inferiors; those that were under the
          power of another, as a child under his parents, or a wife under her
          husband, if they had “vowed a vow unto the Lord,” which concerned his
          honor and worship, it was void without the approbation of that person
          under whose charge they were (Num. xxx. 3, 4, &amp;c.). Though God was
          the Lord of every man’s goods, and men but his stewards; and though he
          might have taken to himself what another had offered by a vow, since
          whatsoever could be offered was God’s own, though it was not the
          parties’ own who offered it; yet God would not have himself adored by
          his creature to the prejudice of the necessary ties of human society;
          he lays aside what he might challenge by his sovereign dominion, that
          there might not be any breach of that regular order which was
          necessary for the preservation of the world. If Divine goodness did
          not thus order things, he would not do the part of a Rector of the
          world; the beauty of the world would be much defaced, it would be a
          confused mass of men and women, or rather, beasts and bedlams. Order
          renders every city, every nation, yea, the whole earth, beautiful:
          this is an effect of Divine goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. His goodness is evident in encouraging anything of moral goodness
          in the world. Though moral goodness cannot claim an eternal reward,
          yet it hath been many times rewarded with a temporal happiness; he
          hath often signally rewarded acts of honesty, justice, and fidelity,
          and punished the contrary by his judgments, to deter man from such an
          unworthy practice, and encourage others to what was comely, and of a
          general good report in the world. Ahab’s humiliation put a demurrer to
          God’s judgments intended against him; and some ascribe the great
          victories and success of the Romans to that justice which was observed
          among themselves. Baruch was but an amanuensis to the Prophet Jeremy
          to write his prophecy, and very despondent of his own welfare (Jer.
          xlv. 13); God upon that account provides for his safety, and rewards
          the industry of his service with the security of his person; he was
          not a statesman, to declare against the corrupt counsels of them that
          sat at the helm, nor a prophet, to declare against their profane
          practices, but the prophet’s scribe; and as he writes in God’s service
          the prophecies revealed to the prophet, God writes his name in the
          roll of those that were designed for preservation in that deluge of
          judgments which were to come upon that nation. Epicurus complained of
          the administration of God, that the virtuous moralist had not
          sufficient smiles of Divine favor, nor the swinish sensualist frowns
          of Divine indignation. But what if they have not always that
          confluence of outward wealth and pleasures, but remain in the common
          level? yet they have the happiness and satisfaction of a clear
          reputation, the esteem of men, and the secret applauses of their very
          enemies, besides the inward ravishments upon an exercise of virtue,
          and the commendatory subscription of their own hearts, a dainty the
          vicious man knows not of; they have an inward applause from God as a
          reward of Divine goodness, instead of those racks of conscience upon
          which the profane are sometimes stretched. He will not let the worst
          men do him any service (though they never intended in the act of
          service him, but themselves) without giving them their wages: he will
          not let them hit him in the teeth as if he were beholden to them. If
          Nebuchadnezzar be the instrument of God’s judgments against Tyrus and
          Israel, he will not only give him that rich city, but a richer
          country, Egypt, the granary for her neighbors, a wages above his work.
          In this is Divine goodness eminent, since, in the most moral actions,
          as there is something beautiful, so there is something mixed, hateful
          to the infinitely exact holiness of the Divine nature; yet he will not
          let that which is pleasing to him go unrewarded, and defeat the
          expectations of men, as men do with those they employ, when, for one
          flaw in an action, they deny them the reward due for the other part.
          God encouraged and kept up morality in the cities of the Gentiles for
          the entertainment of a further goodness in the doctrine of the gospel
          when it should be published among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Divine goodness is eminent in providing a Scripture as a rule to
          guide us, and continuing it in the world. If man be a rational
          creature, governable by a law, can it be imagined there should be no
          revelation of that law to him? Man, by the light of reason, must needs
          confess himself to be in another condition than he was by creation,
          when he came first out of the hands of God; and can it be thought,
          that God should keep up the world under so many sins against the light
          of nature, and bestow so many providential influences, to invite men
          to return to him, and acquaint no men in the world with the means of
          that return? Would he exact an obedience of men, as their consciences
          witness he doth, and furnish them with no rules to guide them in the
          darkness they cannot but acknowledge that they have contracted? No;
          Divine goodness hath otherwise provided: this Bible we have is his
          word and rule. Had it been a falsity and imposture, would that
          goodness, that watches over the world, have continued it so long? That
          goodness that overthrew the burdensome rites of Moses, and expelled
          the foolish idolatry of the Pagans, would have discovered the
          imposture of this, had it not been a transcript of his own will.
          Whatever mistakes he suffers to remain in the world, what goodness had
          there been to suffer this anciently amongst the Jews, and afterwards
          to open it to the whole world, to abuse men in religion and worship,
          which so nearly concerned himself and his own honor, that the world
          should be deceived by the devil without a remedy in the morning of its
          appearance? It hath been honored and admired by some heathens, when
          they have cast their eyes upon it, and their natural light made them
          behold some footsteps of a Divinity in it. If this, therefore, be not
          a Divine prescript, let any that deny it, bring as good arguments for
          any book else, as can be brought for this. Now, the publishing this is
          an argument of Divine goodness: it is designed to win the affections
          of beggarly man, to be espoused to a God of eternal blessedness and
          immense riches. It speaks words in season: no doubts but it resolves;
          no spiritual distemper but it cures; no condition but it hath a
          comfort to suit it. It is a garden which the hand of Divine bounty
          hath planted for us; in it he condescends to shadow himself in those
          expressions that render him in some manner intelligible to us. Had God
          wrote in a loftiness of style suitable to the greatness of his
          majesty, his writing had been as little understood by us, as the
          brightness of his glory can be beheld by us. But he draws phrases from
          our affairs, to express his mind to us; he incarnates himself in his
          word to our minds, before his Son was incarnate in the flesh to the
          eyes of men: he ascribes to himself eyes, ears, hands, that we might
          have, from the consideration of ourselves, and the whole human nature,
          a conception of his perfections: he assumes to himself the members of
          our bodies, to direct our understandings in the knowledge of his
          Deity; this is his goodness. Again, though the Scripture was written
          upon several occasions, yet in the dictating of it, the goodness of
          God cast his eye upon the last ages of the world (1 Cor. x. 11): “They
          are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
          come.” It was given to the Israelites, but Divine goodness intended it
          for the future Gentiles. The old writings of the prophets were thus
          designed, much more the later writings of the apostles. Thus did
          Divine goodness think of us, and prepare his records for us, before we
          were in the world: these he hath written plain for our instruction,
          and wrapped up in them what is necessary for our salvation: it is
          clear to inform our understanding, and rich to comfort us in our
          misery; it is a light to guide us, and a cordial to refresh us; it is
          a lamp to our feet, and a medicine for our diseases; a purifier of our
          filth, and a restorer of us in our faintings. He hath by his goodness
          sealed the truth of it, by his efficacy on multitudes of men: he hath
          made it the “word of regeneration” (James i. 18). Men, wilder and more
          monstrous than beasts, have been tamed and changed by the power of it:
          it hath raised multitudes of dead men from a grave fuller of horror
          than any earthly one. Again, Goodness was in all ages sending his
          letters of advice and counsel from heaven, till the canon of the
          Scripture was closed; sometimes he wrote to chide a froward people,
          sometimes to cheer up an oppressed and disconsolate people, according
          to the state wherein they were; as we may observe by the several
          seasons wherein parts of Scripture were written. It was His goodness
          that he first revealed anything of his will after the fall; it was a
          further degree of goodness, that he would add more cubits to its
          stature; before he would lay aside his pencil, it grew up to that bulk
          wherein we have it. And his goodness is further seen in the preserving
          it; he hath triumphed over the powers that opposed it, and showed
          himself good to the instruments that propagated it: he hath maintained
          it against the blasts of hell, and spread it in all languages against
          the obstructions of men and devils. The sun of his word is by his
          kindness preserved in our horizon, as well as the sun in the heavens.
          How admirable is Divine goodness! He hath sent his Son to die for us,
          and his written word to instruct us, and his Spirit to edge it for an
          entrance into our souls: he hath opened the womb of the earth to
          nourish us, and sent down the records of heaven to direct us in our
          pilgrimage: he hath provided the earth for our habitation, while we
          are travellers, and sent his word to acquaint us with a felicity at
          the end of our journey, and the way to attain in another world what we
          want in this, viz. a happy immortality.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. His goodness in his government is evident, in conversions of men.
          Though this work be wrought by his power, yet his power was first
          solicited by his goodness. It was his rich goodness that he would
          employ his power to pierce the scales of a heart as hard as those of
          the “leviathan.” It was this that opened the ears of men to hear him,
          and draws them from the hurry of worldly cares, and the charms of
          sensual pleasures, and, which is the top of all, the impostures and
          cheats of their own hearts. It is this that sends a spark of his wrath
          into men’s consciences, to put them to a stand in sin, that he might
          not send down a shower of brimstone eternally to consume their
          persons. This it was that first showed you the excellency of the
          Redeemer, and brought you to taste the sweetness of his blood, and
          find your security in the agonies of his death. It is his goodness to
          call one man and not another, to turn Paul in his course, and lay hold
          of no other of his companions. It is his goodness to call any, when he
          is not bound to call one.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is his goodness to pitch upon mean and despicable men in the eye
          of the world; to call this poor publican, and overlook that proud
          Pharisee, this man that sits upon a dunghill, and neglect him that
          glisters in his purple. His majesty is not enticed by the lofty titles
          of men, nor, which is more worth, by the learning and knowledge of
          men. “Not many wise, not many mighty,” not many doctors, not many
          lords, though some of them; but his goodness condescends to the “base
          things” of the world, and things which are “despised” (1 Cor. i.
          26‒28). “The poor receive the gospel” (Matt. xi. 5), when those that
          are more acute, and furnished with a more apprehensive reason, are not
          touched by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The worst men. He seizeth sometimes upon men most soiled, and
          neglects others that seem more clean and less polluted. He turns men
          in their course in sin, that, by their infernal practices, have seemed
          to have gone to school to hell, and to have sucked in the sole
          instructions of the devil. He lays hold upon some when they are most
          under actual demerit, and snatches them as fire‑brands out of the
          fire, as upon Paul when fullest of rage against him; and shoots a beam
          of grace, where nothing could be justly expected but a thunderbolt of
          wrath. It is his goodness to visit any, when they lie putrefying in
          their loathsome lusts; to draw near to them who have been guilty of
          the greatest contempt of God, and the light of nature; the murdering
          Manassehs, the persecuting Sauls, the Christ‑crucifying Jews,—persons
          in whom lusts had had a peaceable possession and empire for many
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. His goodness appears in converting men possessed with the greatest
          enmity against him, while he was dealing with them. All were in such a
          state, and framing contrivances against him, when Divine goodness
          knocked at the door (Col. i. 21). He looked after us when our backs
          were turned upon him, and sought us when we slighted him, and were a
          “gainsaying people” (Rom. x. 21); when we had shaken off his
          convictions, and contended with our Maker, and mustered up the powers
          of nature against the alarms of conscience; struggled like wild bulls
          in a net, and blunted those darts that stuck in our souls. Not a man
          that is turned to him, but had lifted up the heel against his gospel
          grace, as well as made light of his creating goodness. Yet it hath
          employed itself about such ungrateful wretches, to polish those knotty
          and rugged pieces for heaven; and so invincibly, that he would not
          have his goodness defeated by the fierceness and rebellion of the
          flesh. Though the thing was more difficult in itself (if anything may
          be said to have a difficulty to omnipotency) than to make a stone
          live, or to turn a straw into a marble pillar. The malice of the flesh
          makes a man more unfit for the one, than the nature of the straw
          unfits it for the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. His goodness appears in turning men, when they were pleased with
          their own misery, and unable to deliver themselves; when they
          preferred a hell before him, and were in love with their own vileness;
          when his call was our torment, and his neglect of us had been
          accounted our felicity. Was it not a mighty goodness to keep the light
          close to our eyes, when we endeavored to blow it out; and the
          corrosive near to our hearts, when we endeavored to tear it off, being
          more fond of our disease than the remedy? We should have been scalded
          to death with the Sodomite, had not God laid his good hand upon us,
          and drawn us from the approaching ruin we affected, and were loath to
          be freed from. And had we been displeased with our state, yet we had
          been as unable spiritually to raise ourselves from sin to grace, as to
          raise ourselves naturally from nothing to being. In this state we were
          when his goodness triumphed over us; when he put a hook into our
          nostrils, to turn us in order to our salvation; and drew us out of the
          pit which we had digged, when he might have left us to sink under the
          rigors of his justice we had merited. Now this goodness in conversion
          is greater than that in creation; as in creation there is nothing to
          oppose him, so there was nothing to disoblige him; creation was
          terminated to the good of a mutable nature, and conversion tends to a
          supernatural good. God pronounced all creatures good at first, and man
          among the rest, but did not pronounce any of them, or man himself, his
          “portion,” his “inheritance,” his “segullah,” his “house,” his
          “diadem.” He speaks slightly of all those things which he made, the
          noblest heavens, as well as the lowest earth, in comparison of a true
          convert: “All those things hath mine hand made, and all those things
          have been: but to this man will I look, to him that is of a contrite
          spirit” (Isa. lxvi. 1, 2). It is more goodness to give the espousing
          grace of the covenant, than the completing glory of heaven; as it is
          more for a prince to marry a beggar, than only to bring her to live
          deliciously in his courts. All other benefits are of a meaner strain,
          if compared with this; there is little less of goodness in imparting
          the holiness of his nature, than imputing the righteousness of his
          Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. The Divine goodness doth appear in answering prayers. He delights
          to be familiarly acquainted with his people, and to hear them call
          upon him. He indulgeth them a free access to him, and delights in
          every address of an “upright man” (Prov. xv. 8). The wonderful
          efficacy of prayer depends not upon the nature of our petitions or the
          temper of our soul, but the goodness of God to whom we address. Christ
          establisheth it upon this bottom: when he exhorts to ask in his name,
          he tells them the spring of all their grants is the Father’s love: “I
          say not, I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himself loves
          you” (John xvi. 26, 27). And since it is of itself incredible, that a
          Majesty, exalted above the cherubims, should stoop so low as to give a
          miserable and rebellious creature admittance to him, and afford him a
          gracious hearing, and a quick supply, Christ ushers in the promise of
          answering prayer with a note of great assurance: “I say unto you, Ask,
          and it shall be given you” (Luke xi. 9, 10). I, that know the mind of
          my Father, and his good disposition, assure you your prayer shall not
          be in vain. Perhaps you will not be so ready of yourselves to imagine
          so great a liberality; but take it upon my word, it is true, and so
          you will find it. And his bounty travels, as it were, in birth, to
          give the greatest blessings, upon our asking, rather than the
          smallest: “your heavenly Father shall give his Holy Spirit to them
          that ask him” (ver. 13): which in Matt. vii. 11, is called, “good
          things.” Of all the good and rich things Divine goodness hath in his
          treasury, he delights to give the best upon asking, because God doth
          act so as to manifest the greatness of his bounty and magnificence to
          men; and, therefore, is delighted when men, by their petitioning him,
          own such a liberal disposition in him, and put him upon the
          manifesting it. He would rather you should ask the greatest things
          heaven can afford, than the trifles of this world; because his bounty
          is not discovered in meaner gifts: he loves to have an opportunity to
          manifest his affection above the liberality and tenderness of worldly
          fathers. He doth more wait to give in a way of grace, than we to beg;
          and, “therefore, will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you”
          (Isa. xxx. 18). He stands expecting your suits, and employs his wisdom
          in pitching upon the fittest seasons, when the manifestation of his
          goodness may be most gracious in itself, and the mercy you want most
          welcome to you; as it follows, “for the Lord is a God of judgment.” He
          chooseth the time wherein his doles may be most acceptable to his
          suppliants; “In an acceptable time have I heard thee” (Isa. xlix. 8).
          He often opens his hand while we are opening our lips, and his
          blessings meet our petitions at the first setting out upon their
          journey to heaven: “While they are yet speaking, I will hear” (Isa.
          lxv. 24). How often do we hear a secret voice within us, while we are
          praying, saying, “Your prayer is granted;” as well as hear a voice
          behind us, while we are erring, saying, “This is the way, walk in it!”
          And his liberality exceeds often our desires, as well as our deserts;
          and gives out more than we had the wisdom or confidence to ask. The
          apostle intimates it in that doxology, “Unto Him who is able to do
          abundantly above all that we ask or think” (Eph. iii. 20). This power
          would not have been so strong an argument of comfort, if it were never
          put in practice; he is more liberal than his creatures are craving.
          Abraham petitioned for the life of Ishmael, and God promiseth him the
          “birth of Isaac” (Gen. xvii. 18, 19). Isaac asks for a “child,” and
          God gives him “two” (Gen. xxv. 21, 22). Jacob desires “food” to eat,
          and “raiment” to put on; God confines not his bounty within the narrow
          limits of his petition, but instead of a “staff,” wherewith he passed
          Jordan, makes him repass it with “two bands” (Gen. xxviii. 20). David
          asked life of God, and he gave him “life,” and a “crown” to boot (Ps.
          xxi. 2‒5). The Israelites would have been contented with a free life
          in Egypt; they only cried to have their chains struck off; God gave
          them that, and adopts them to be his “peculiar people,” and raises
          them into a famous state. It is a wonder that God should condescend so
          much, that he should hear prayers so weak, so cold, so wandering, and
          gather up our sincere petitions from the dung of our distractions and
          diffidence. David vents his astonishment at it; “Blessed be God, for
          he hath shown me marvellous kindness. I said in my haste, I am cut off
          from before thine eyes: nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my
          supplication” (Ps. xxxi. 21, 22). How do we wonder at the goodness of
          a petty man, in granting our desires; how much more should we at the
          humility and goodness of the most sovereign Majesty of heaven and
          earth!
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. The goodness of God is seen in bearing with the infirmities of
          his people, and accepting imperfect obedience. Though Asa had many
          blots in his escutcheon, yet they are overlooked, and this note set
          upon record by Divine goodness, that his heart was perfect towards the
          Lord all his days; “But the high places were not removed:
          nevertheless, Asa’s heart was perfect with the Lord all his days” (1
          Kings, xv. 14). He takes notice of a sincere, though chequered
          obedience, to reward it, which could claim nothing but a slight from
          him, if he were extreme to mark what is done amiss. When there is not
          an opportunity to work, but only to will, he accepts the will, as if
          it had passed into work and act. He sees no iniquity in Jacob (Numb.
          xxiii. 21), i. e. He sees it not so as to cast off a respect to their
          persons, and the acceptance of their services: his omniscience knows
          their sins, but his goodness doth not reject their persons. He is of
          so good a disposition, that he delights in a weak obedience of his
          servants, not in the imperfection, but in the obedience (Ps. xxxvii.
          23); “He delights in the way of a good man,” though he sometimes slips
          in it: he accepts a poor man’s pigeon, as well as a rich man’s ox: he
          hath a bottle for the tears, and a book for the “services of the
          upright,” as well as for the most perfect obedience of angels (Ps.
          lvi. 8): he preserves their tears, as if they were a rich and generous
          wine, as the vine‑dresser doth the expressions of the grape.
        </p>
        <p>
          8th. The goodness of God is seen in afflictions and persecutions. If
          it be “good for us to be afflicted,” for which we have the psalmist’s
          vote (Ps. cxix. 71), then goodness in God is the principal cause and
          orderer of the afflictions. It is his goodness to snatch away that
          whence we fetch supports for our security, and encouragements for our
          insolence against him: he takes away the thing which we have some
          value for, but such as his infinite wisdom sees inconsistent with our
          true happiness. It is no ill‑will in the physician to take away the
          hurtful matter the patient loves, and prescribe bitter potions, to
          advance that health which the other impaired; nor any mark of
          unkindness in a friend, to wrest a sword out of a madman’s hand,
          wherewith he was about to stab himself, though it were beset with the
          most orient pearls. To prevent what is evil, is to do us the greatest
          good. It is a kindness to prevent a man from falling down a precipice,
          though it be with a violent blow, that lays him flat upon the ground
          at some distance from the edge of it. By afflictions he often snaps
          asunder those chains which fettered us, and quells those passions
          which ravaged us: he sharpens our faith, and quickens our prayers; he
          brings us in the secret chamber of our own heart, which we had little
          mind before to visit by a self‑examination. It is such a goodness that
          he will vouchsafe to correct man in order to his eternal happiness,
          that Job makes it one part of his astonishment (Job. vii. 17); “What
          is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? that thou shouldest set thy
          heart upon him? and that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and
          try him every moment?” His strokes are often the magnifyings and
          exaltings of man. He sets his heart upon man, while he inflicts the
          smart of his rod: he shows thereby, what a high account he makes of
          him, and what a special affection he bears to him. When he might treat
          us with more severity after the breach of his covenant, and make his
          jealousy flame out against us in furious methods, he will not destroy
          his relation to us, and leave us to our own inclinations, but deal
          with us as a father with his children; and when he takes this course
          with us, it is when it cannot be avoided without our ruin: his
          goodness would not suffer him to do it, if our badness did not force
          him to it (Jer. ix. 7), “I will melt them and try them, for how shall
          I do for the daughter of my people?” What other course can I take but
          this, according to the nature of man? The goldsmith hath no other way
          to separate the dross from the metal, but by melting it down. And when
          the impurities of his people necessitate him to this proceeding, “he
          sits as a refiner” (Mal. iii. 3): he watches for the purifying the
          silver, not for his own profit as the goldsmith, but out of a care of
          them, and good will to them; as himself speaks (Isa. xlviii. 10), “I
          have refined thee, but not with silver;” or, as some read it, “not for
          silver.” As when he scatters his people abroad for their sin, he will
          not leave them without his presence for their “sanctuary” (Ezek. xi.
          16): he would by his presence with them supply the place of
          ordinances, or be an ark to them in the midst of the deluge: his hand
          that struck them, is never without a goodness to comfort them and pity
          them. When Jacob was to go into Egypt, which was to prove a furnace of
          affliction to his offspring, God promises to go down with him, and to
          “bring him up again” (Gen. xlvi. 4): a promise not only made to Jacob
          in his person, but to Jacob in his posterity. He returned not out of
          Egypt in his person, but as the father of a numerous posterity. He
          that would go down with their root, and afterwards bring up the
          branches, was certainly with them in all their oppressions: “I will go
          down with thee.” “Down,” saith one; what a word is that for a Deity!
          into Egypt, idolatrous Egypt; what a place is that for his
          holiness!986 Yet O, the goodness of God! He never thinks himself low
          enough to do his people good, nor any place too bad for his society
          with them. So when he had sent away into captivity the people of
          Israel by the hand of the Assyrian, his bowels yearn after them in
          their affliction (Isa. lii. 4, 5); the Assyrian “oppressed them
          without cause,” i. e. without a just cause in the conqueror to inflict
          so great an evil upon them, but not without cause from God, whom they
          had provoked. “Now, therefore, what have I here, saith the Lord?” What
          do I here? I will not stay behind them. What do I longer here? for I
          will redeem again those jewels the enemy hath carried away. That
          chapter is a prophecy of redemption: God shows himself so good to his
          people in their persecutions, that he gives them occasion to glorify
          him in the very fires, as the Divine order is (Isa. xxiv. 15),
          “Wherefore glorify the Lord in the fires.”
        </p>
        <p>
          9th. The goodness of God is seen in temptations. In those he takes
          occasion to show his care and watchfulness, as a father uses the
          distress of a child as an opportunity for manifesting the tenderness
          of his affection. God is at the beginning and end of every temptation;
          he measures out both the quality and quantity: he exposeth them not to
          temptation beyond the ability he had already granted them, or will at
          the time, or afterwards multiply in them. He hath promised his people
          that “the gate of hell shall not prevail against them” (1 Cor. x. 13):
          that “in all things” they shall be “more than conquerors through Him
          that loved them:” that the most raging malice of hell shall not wrest
          them out of his hands. His goodness is not less in performing than it
          was in promising: and as the care of his providence extends to the
          least as well as the greatest, so the watchfulness of his goodness
          extends to us in the least as well as in the greatest temptations.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The goodness of God appears in shortening temptations. None of them
          can go beyond their “appointed times” (Dan. xi. 35): the strong blast
          Satan breathes cannot blow, nor the waves he raises rage one minute
          beyond the time God allows them; when they have done their work, and
          come to the period of their time, God speaks the word, and the wind
          and sea of hell must obey him, and retire into their dens. The more
          violent temptations are, the shorter time doth God allot to them. The
          assaults Christ had at the time of his death were of the most pressing
          and urging nature: the powers of darkness were all in arms against
          him; the reproaches and scorns put upon him, questioning his sonship,
          were very sharp; yet a little before his suffering he calls it but an
          hour (Luke xxii. 53), “This is your hour, and the power of darkness.”
          A short time that men and devils were combined against him; and the
          time of temptation that is to come upon all the world for their trial,
          is called but an “hour” (Rev. iii. 10). In all such attempts, the
          greatness of the rage is a certain prognostic of the shortness of the
          season (Rev. xii. 12).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The goodness of God appears in strengthening his people under
          temptations. If he doth not restrain the arm of Satan from striking,
          he gives us a sword to manage the combat, and a shield to bear off the
          blow (Eph. vi. 16, 17). If he obscures his goodness in one part, he
          clears and brightens it in another: he either binds the strong man
          that he shall not stir, or gives us armor to render us victorious. If
          we fall, it is not for want of provision from him, but for want of our
          “putting on the armor of God” (Eph. vi. 11, 13). When we have not a
          strength by nature, he gives it us by grace: he often quells those
          passions within which would join hands with, and second the temptation
          without. He either qualifies the temptation suitably to the force we
          have, or else supplies us with a new strength to mate the temptation
          he intends to let loose against us; he knows we are but dust, and his
          goodness will not have us unequally matched. The Jews that in
          Antiochus’ time were under great temptation to apostasy by reason of
          the violence of their persecutions, were, “out of weakness, made
          strong” for the combat (Heb. xi. 34). The Spirit came more strongly
          upon Sampson when the Philistines most furiously and confidently
          assaulted him. His Spirit is sent to strengthen his people before the
          devil is permitted to tempt them (Matt. iv. 2); “Then was Jesus led up
          of the Spirit.” Then; When? When the Spirit had in an extraordinary
          manner descended upon him (Matt. iii. 16), “then,” and not before. As
          the angels appeared to Christ, after his temptation, to minister to
          him, so they appeared to him before his passion, the time of the
          strongest powers of darkness, to strengthen him for it: he is so good,
          that when he knows our potsherd strength too weak, he furnisheth our
          recruits from his own omnipotence (Eph. vi. 10); “Be strong in the
          Lord, and in the power of his might.” He doth, as it were, breathe in
          something of his own almightiness, to assist us in our wrestling
          against principalities and powers, and make us capable to sustain the
          violent storms of the enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The goodness of God is seen in temptations, in giving great
          comforts in or after them. The Israelites had a more immediate
          provision of manna from heaven when they were in the wilderness. We
          read not that the Father spake audibly to the Son, and gave him so
          loud a testimony, that he was his “beloved Son, in whom he was well
          pleased,” till he was upon the brink of strong temptations (Matt. iii.
          17): nor sent angels to minister immediately to his person, till after
          his success (Matt. iv. 11). Job never had such evidences of Divine
          love till after he had felt the sharp strokes of Satan’s malice; he
          had heard of God before, by the “hearing of the ear,” but afterwards
          is admitted into greater familiarity (Job. xlii. 5): he had more
          choice appearances, clearer illuminations, and more lively
          instructions. And, though his people fall into temptation, yet, after
          their rising, they have more signal marks of his favor than others
          have, or themselves, before they fell. Peter had been the butt of
          Satan’s rage, in tempting him to deny Christ, and he had shamefully
          complied with the temptation; yet, to him particularly, must the first
          news of the Redeemer’s resurrection be carried, by God’s order, in the
          mouth of an angel (Mark xvi. 7); “Go your ways, tell his disciples,
          and Peter.” We have the greatest communion with God after a victory;
          the most refreshing truths after the devil hath done his worst. God is
          ready to furnish us with strength in a combat, and cordials after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The goodness of God is seen in temptations, in discovering and
          advancing inward grace by this means. The issue of a temptation of a
          Christian is often like that of Christ’s, the manifesting a greater
          vigor of the Divine nature, in affections to God, and enmity to sin.
          Spices perfume not the air with their scent till they are invaded by
          the fire: the truth of grace is evidenced by them. The assault of an
          enemy revives, and actuates that strength and courage which is in a
          man, perhaps unknown to himself, as well as others, till he meets with
          an adversary: many seem good, not that they are so in themselves, but
          for want of a temptation: this many times verifies a virtue, which was
          owned upon trust before, and discovers that we had more grace than we
          thought we had. The solicitations of Joseph’s mistress cleared up his
          chastity: we are many times under temptation, as a candle under the
          snuffer; it seems to be out, but presently burns the clearer.
          Afflictions are like those clouds which look black, and eclipse the
          sun from the earth, but yet, when they drop, refresh that ground they
          seem to threaten, and multiply the grain on the earth, to serve for
          our food; and so our troubles, while they wet us to the skin, wash
          much of that dust from our graces which in a clearer day had been
          blown upon us. Too much rest corrupts; exercise teacheth us to manage
          our weapons: the spiritual armor would grow rusty, without opportunity
          to furbish it up; faith receives a new heart by every combat, and by
          every victory; like a fire, it spreads itself further, and gathers
          strength by the blowing of the wind. While the gardener commands his
          servant to shake the tree, he intends to fasten its roots, and settle
          it firmer in its place; and is this an ill‑will to the plant?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. His goodness is seen in temptations, in preventing sin which we
          were likely to fall into. Paul’s thorn in the flesh was to prevent the
          pride of his spirit, and let out the windiness of his heart (2 Cor.
          xii. 7), lest it should be exalted above measure. The goodness of God
          makes the devil a polisher, while he intends to be a destroyer. The
          devil never works, but suitably to some corruption lurking in us:
          Divine goodness makes his fiery darts a means to discover, and so to
          prevent the treachery of that perfidious inmate in our hearts;
          humility is a greater benefit than a putrefying pride; if God brings
          us into a wilderness to be tempted of the devil, it is to bring down
          our loftiness, to starve our carnal confidence, and expel our rusting
          “security” (Deut. viii. 2); we many times fly under a temptation to
          God, from whom we sat too loose before. Is it not goodness to use
          those means that may drive us into his own arms? It is not a want of
          goodness to soap the garment, in order to take away the spots; we have
          reason to bless God for the assaults from hell, as well as pure
          mercies from heaven; and it is a sin to overlook the one as well as
          the other, since Divine goodness shines in both.

          6. The goodness of God is seen in temptations, in fitting us more for
          his service. Those whom God intends to make choice instruments in his
          service, are first seasoned with strong temptations, as timber
          reserved for the strong beams of a building is first exposed to sun
          and wind, to make it more compact for its proper use. By this men are
          brought to answer the end of their creation, the service of God, which
          is their proper goodness. Peter was, after his foil by a temptation,
          more courageous in his Master’s cause than before, and the more fitted
          to strengthen his brethren.

        <p>V. I shall now come to the Use. First, Of instruction.</p>
        <p>
          1. If God be so good, how unworthy is the contempt or abuse of his
          goodness! (1.) The contempt and abuse of Divine goodness is frequent
          and common; it began in the first ages of the world, and commenced a
          few moments after the creation; it hath not to this day diminished its
          affronts; Adam began the dance, and his posterity have followed him;
          the injury was directed against this, when he entertained the
          seducer’s notion of God’s being an envious Deity, in not indulging
          such a knowledge as he might have afforded him (Gen. iii. 5): “God
          doth know, that you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” The
          charge of envy is utterly inconsistent with pure goodness. What was
          the language of this notion, so easily entertained by Adam, but that
          the tempter was better than God, and the nature of God as base and
          sordid as the nature of a devil? Satan paints God with his own colors,
          represents him as envious and malicious as himself; Adam admires, and
          believes the picture to be true, and hangs it up as a beloved one in
          the closet of his heart. The devil still drives on the same game,
          fills men’s hearts with the same sentiments, and by the same means he
          murdered our first parents, he redoubles the stabs to his posterity.
          Every violation of the Divine law is a contempt of God’s goodness, as
          well as his sovereignty, because his laws are the products both of the
          one and the other. Goodness animates them, while sovereignty enjoys
          them: God hath commanded nothing but what doth conduce to our
          happiness. All disobedience implies, that his law is a snare to entrap
          us, and make us miserable, and not an act of kindness, to render us
          happy, which is a disparagement to this perfection, as if he had
          commanded what would promote our misery, and prohibited what would
          conduce to our blessedness: to go far from him, and walk after vanity,
          is to charge him with our iniquity, and unrighteousness, baseness, and
          cruelty, in his commands: God implies it by his speech (Jer. ii. 5),
          “What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far
          from me, and walked after vanity?” as if, like a tyrant, he had
          consulted cruelty in the composure of them, and designed to feast
          himself with the blood and misery of his creatures. Every sin is, in
          its own nature, a denial of God to be the chiefest good and happiness,
          and implies that it is no great matter to lose him: it is a forsaking
          him as the Fountain of Life, and a preferring a cracked and “empty
          cistern” as the chief happiness before him (Jer. ii. 13). Though sin
          is not so evil as God is good, yet it is the greatest evil, and stands
          in opposition to God as the greatest good. Sin disorders the frame of
          the world; it endeavored to frustrate all the communications of Divine
          goodness in creation, and to stop up the way of any further streams of
          it to his creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The abuse and contempt of the Divine goodness is base and
          disingenious. It is the highest wickedness, because God is the highest
          goodness, pure goodness that cannot have anything in him worthy of our
          contempt. Let men injure God under what notion they will, they injure
          his goodness; because all his attributes are summed up in this one,
          and all, as it were, deified by it. For whatsoever power or wisdom he
          might have, if he were destitute of this he were not God: the contempt
          of his goodness implies him to be the greatest evil, and worst of
          beings. Badness, not goodness, is the proper object of contempt: as
          respect is a propension of mind to something that is good, so contempt
          is an alienation of the mind from something as evil, either simply or
          supposedly evil in its nature, or base or unworthy in its action
          towards that person that contemns it. As men desire nothing but what
          they apprehend to be good, so they slight nothing but what they
          apprehend to be evil: since nothing, therefore, is more contemned by
          us than God, nothing more spurned at by us than God, it will follow
          that we regard him as the most loathsome and despicable being, which
          is the greatest baseness. And our contempt of him is worse than that
          of the devils; they injure him under the inevitable strokes of his
          justice, and we slight him when we are surrounded with the expressions
          of his bounty; they abuse him under vials of wrath, and we under a
          plenteous liberality: they malice him, because he inflicts on them
          what is hurtful; and we despise him, because he commands what is
          profitable, holy, and honorable, in its own nature, though not in our
          esteem. They are not under those high obligations as we; they abuse
          his creating, and we his redeeming goodness: he never sent his Son to
          shed a drop of blood for their recovery; they can expect nothing but
          the torment of their persons, and the destruction of their works; but
          we abuse that goodness that would rescue us since we are miserable, as
          well as that righteousness which created us innocent. How base is it
          to use him so ill, that is not once or twice, but a daily, hourly
          Benefactor to us; whose rain drops upon the earth for our food, and
          whose sun shines upon the earth for our pleasure as well as profit:
          such a Benefactor as is the true Proprietor of what we have, and
          thinks nothing too good for them that think everything too much for
          his service! How unworthy is it to be guilty of such base carriage
          towards him, whose benefits we cannot want, nor live without! How
          disingenious both to God and ourselves, to “despise the riches of his
          goodness, that are designed to lead us to repentance” (Rom. ii. 4),
          and by that to happiness! And more heinous are the sins of renewed men
          upon this account, because they are against his “goodness” not only
          offered to them, but tasted by them; not only against the notion of
          goodness, but the experience of goodness, and the relished sweetness
          of choicest bounty.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God takes this contempt of his goodness heinously. He never
          upbraids men with anything in the Scripture, but with the abuse of the
          good things he hath vouchsafed them, and the unmindfulness of the
          obligations arising from them. This he bears with the greatest regret
          and indignation. Thus he upbraids Eli with the preference of him to
          the priesthood above other families (1 Sam. ii. 28): and David with
          his exaltation to the crown of Israel (2 Sam. xii. 7‒9), when they
          abused those honors to carelessness and licentiousness. All sins
          offend God, but sins against his goodness do more disparage him; and,
          therefore, his fury is the greater, by how much the more liberally his
          benefits have been dispensed. It was for abuse of Divine goodness, as
          soon as it was tasted, that some angels were hurled from their blessed
          habitation and more happy nature: it was for this Adam lost his
          present enjoyments, and future happiness, for the abuse of God’s
          goodness in creation. For the abuse of God’s goodness the old world
          fell under the fury of the flood; and for the contempt of the Divine
          goodness in redemption, Jerusalem, once the darling city of the
          infinite Monarch of the world, was made an Aceldema, a field of blood.
          For this cause it is, that candlesticks have been removed, great
          lights put out, nations overturned, and ignorance hath triumphed in
          places bright before with the beams of heaven. God would have little
          care of his own goodness, if he always prostituted the fruits of it to
          our contempt. Why should we expect he should always continue that to
          us which he sees we will never use to his service? When the Israelites
          would dedicate the gifts of God to the service of Baal, then he would
          return, and take away his corn, and his wine, and make them know by
          the loss, that those things were his in dominion, which they abused,
          as if they had been sovereign lords of them (Hos. ii. 8, 9). Benefits
          are entailed upon us no longer than we obey (Josh. xxiv. 20): “If you
          forsake the Lord, he will do you hurt, after he hath done you good.”
          While we obey, his bounty shall shower upon us: and when we revolt,
          his justice shall consume us. Present mercies abused, are no bulwarks
          against independent judgments. God hath curses as well as blessings;
          and they shall light more heavy when his blessings have been more
          weighty: justice is never so severe as when it comes to right
          goodness, and revenge its quarrel for the injuries received.
        </p>
        <p>
          A convenient inquiry may be here, How God’s goodness is contemned or
          abused?
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. By a forgetfulness of his benefits. We enjoy the mercies, and
          forget the Donor; we take what he gives, and pay not the tribute he
          deserves; the “Israelites forgot God their Saviour, which had done
          great things in Egypt” (Ps. cvi. 21). We send God’s mercies where we
          would have God send our sins, into the land of forgetfulness, and
          write his benefits where himself will write the names of the wicked,
          in the dust, which every wind defaceth: the remembrance soon wears out
          of our minds, and we are so far from remembering what we had before,
          that we scarce think of that hand that gives, the very instant wherein
          his benefits drop upon us. Adam basely forgot his Benefactor,
          presently after he had been made capable to remember him, and reflect
          upon him; the first remark we hear of him, is of his forgetfulness,
          not a syllable of his thankfulness. We forget those souls he hath
          lodged in us, to acknowledge his favors to our bodies; we forget that
          image wherewith he beautified us, and that Christ he exposed as a
          criminal to death for our rescue, which is such an act of goodness as
          cannot be expressed by the eloquence of the tongue, or conceived by
          the acuteness of the mind. Those things which are so common, that they
          cannot be invisible to our eyes, are unregarded by our minds; our
          sense prompts our understanding, and our understanding is deaf to the
          plain dictates of our sense. We forget his goodness in the sun, while
          it warms us, and his showers while they enrich us; in the corn, while
          it nourisheth us, and the wine while it refresheth us; “She did not
          know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil” (Hos. ii. 8): she that
          might have read my hand in every bit of bread, and every drop of
          drink, did not consider this. It is an injustice to forget the
          benefits we receive from man; it is a crime of a higher nature to
          forget those dispensed to us by the hand of God, who gives us those
          things that all the world cannot furnish us with, without him. The
          inhabitants of Troas will condemn us, who worshipped mice, in a
          grateful remembrance of the victory they had made easy for them, by
          gnawing their enemies’ bow‑strings. They were mindful of the courtesy
          of animals, though unintended by those creatures; and we are
          regardless of the fore‑meditated bounty of God. It is in God’s
          judgment a brutishness beyond that of a stupid ox, or a duller ass;
          “The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel
          doth not know, my people do not consider” (Isa. i. 3). The ox knows
          his owner that pastures him, and the ass his master that feeds him;
          but man is not so good as to be like to them, but so bad as to be
          inferior to them: he forgets Him that sustains him, and spurns at him,
          instead of valuing him for the benefits conferred by him. How horrible
          is it, that God should lose more by his bounty, than he would do by
          his parsimony! If we had blessings more sparingly, we should remember
          him more gratefully. If he had sent us a bit of bread in a distress by
          a miracle, as he did to Elijah by the ravens, it would have stuck
          longer in our memories; but the sense of daily favors soonest wears
          out of our minds, which are as great miracles as any in their own
          nature, and the products of the same power; but the wonder they should
          beget in us, is obscured by their frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. The goodness of God is contemned by an impatient murmuring. Our
          repinings proceed from an inconsideration of God’s free liberality,
          and an ungrateful temper of spirit. Most men are guilty of this. It is
          implied in the commendation of Job under his pressures (Job i. 22):
          “In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly,” as if it were
          a character peculiar to him, whereby he verified the eulogy God had
          given of him before (ver. 8), that there was “none like him in the
          earth, a perfect and an upright man.” What is implied by the
          expression? but that scarce a man is to be found without unjust
          complaints of God, and charging him under their crosses with cruelty;
          when in the greatest they have much more reason to bless him for his
          bounty in the remainder. Good men have not been innocent. Baruch
          complains of God for adding grief to his sorrow, not furnishing him
          with those “great things” he expected (Jer. xlv. 3, 4); whereas, he
          had matter of thankfulness in God’s gift of his life as a prey. But
          his master chargeth God in a higher strain: “O Lord, thou hast
          deceived me, and I was deceived: I am in derision daily” (Jer. xx. 7).
          When he met with reproach instead of success in the execution of his
          function, he quarrels with God, as if he had a mind to cheat him into
          a mischief, when he had more reason to bless him for the honor of
          being employed in his service. Because we have not what we expect, we
          slight his goodness in what we enjoy. If he cross us in one thing, he
          might have made us successless in more: if he take away some things,
          he might as well have taken away all. The unmerited remainder, though
          never so little, deserves our acknowledgements more than the deserved
          loss can justify our repining. And for that which is snatched from us,
          there is more cause to be thankful, that we have enjoyed it so long,
          than to murmur that we possess it no longer. Adam’s sin implies a
          repining: he imagined God had been short in his goodness, in not
          giving him a knowledge he foolishly conceived himself capable of, and
          would venture a forfeiture of what already had been bountifully
          bestowed upon him. Man thought God had envied him, and ever since man
          studies to be even with God, and envies him the free disposal of his
          own doles: all murmuring, either in our own cause or others, charges
          God with a want of goodness, because there is a want of that which he
          foolishly thinks would make himself or others happy. The language of
          this sin is, that man thinks himself better than God; and if it were
          in his power, would express a more plentiful goodness than his Maker.
          As man is apt to think himself “more pure than God” (Job iv. 17), so
          of a kinder nature also than an infinite goodness. The Israelites are
          a wonderful example of this contempt of Divine goodness; they had been
          spectators of the greatest miracles, and partakers of the choicest
          deliverance: he had solicited their redemption from captivity; and
          when words would not do, he came to blows for them, musters up his
          judgments against their enemies, and, at last, as the Lord of hosts
          and God of battles, totally defeats their pursuers, and drowns them
          and their proud hopes of victory in the Red Sea. Little account was
          made of all this by the redeemed ones; “they lightly esteemed the rock
          of their salvation,” and launch into greater unworthiness, instead of
          being thankful for the breaking their yoke: they are angry with him,
          that he had done so much for them: they repented that ever they had
          complied with him, for their own deliverance, and had a regret that
          they had been brought out of Egypt: they were angry that they were
          freemen, and that their chains had been knocked off: they were more
          desirous to return to the oppression of their Egyptian tyrants, than
          have God for their governor and caterer, and be fed with his manna.
          “It was well with us in Egypt: Why came we forth out of Egypt?” which
          is called a “despising the Lord” (Numb. xi. 18, 20). They were so far
          from rejoicing in the expectation of the future benefits promised
          them, that they murmured that they had not enjoyed less; they were so
          sottish, as to be desirous to put themselves into the irons whence God
          had delivered them: they would seek a remedy in that Egypt, which had
          been the prison of their nation, and under the successors of that
          Pharaoh, who had been the invader of their liberties; they would
          snatch Moses from the place where the Lord, by an extraordinary
          providence, hath established him; they would stone those that minded
          them of the goodness of God to them, and thereupon of their crime and
          their duty (Numb. xvi. 3, 9‒11); they rose against their benefactors,
          and “murmured against God,” that had strengthened the hands of their
          deliverers; they “despised the manna” he had sent them, and “despised
          the pleasant land” he intended them (Ps. cvi. 24): all which was a
          high contempt of God and his unparalleled goodness and care of them.
          All murmuring is an accusation of Divine goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. By unbelief and impenitency. What is the reason we come not to Him
          when he calls us; but some secret imagination that he is of an ill
          nature, means not as he speaks, but intends to mock us, instead of
          welcoming us? When we neglect his call, spurn at his bowels, slight
          the riches of his grace; as it is a disparagement to his wisdom to
          despise his counsel, so it is to his goodness to slight his offers, as
          though you could make better provision for yourselves than he is able
          or willing to do. It disgraceth that which is designed to the praise
          of the glory of his grace, and renders God cruel to his own Son, as
          being an unnecessary shedder of his blood. As the devil by his
          temptation of Adam, envied God the glory of his creating goodness, so
          unbelief envies God the glory of his redeeming grace: it is a bidding
          defiance to him, and challenging him to muster up the legions of his
          judgments, rather than have sent his Son to suffer for us, or his
          Spirit to solicit us. Since the sending his Son was the greatest act
          of goodness that God could express, the refusal of him must be the
          highest reproach of that liberality God designed to commend to the
          world in so rare a gift: the ingratitude in this refusal must be as
          high in the rank of sins, as the person slighted is in the rank of
          beings, or rank of gifts. Christ is a gift (Rom. v. 16), the royalest
          gift, an unparalleled gift, springing from inconceivable treasures of
          goodness (John iii. 16). What is our turning our backs upon this gift
          but a low opinion of it? as though the richest jewel of heaven were
          not so valuable as a swinish pleasure on earth, and deserved to be
          treated at no other rate than if mere offals had been presented to us.
          The plain language of it is, that there were no gracious intentions
          for our welfare in this present; and that he is not as good, in the
          mission of his Son, as he would induce us to imagine. Impenitence is
          also an abuse of this goodness, either by presumption, as if God would
          entertain rebels that bid defiance against him with the same respect
          that he doth his prostrate and weeping suppliants; that he will have
          the same regard to the swine as to the children, and lodge them in the
          same habitation; or it speaks a suspicion of God as a deceitful
          Master, one of a pretended, not a real goodness, that makes promises
          to mock men, and invitations to delude them: that he is an implacable
          tyrant, rather than a good Father; a rigid, not a kind Being,
          delightful only to mark our faults, and overlook our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The goodness of God is contemned by a distrust of his providence.
          As all trust in him supposeth him good, so all distrust of him
          supposeth him evil; either without goodness to exert his power, or
          without power to display his goodness. Job seems to have a spice of
          this in his complaint (Job xxx. 20), “I cry unto thee, and thou dost
          not hear me; I stand up, and thou regardest me not.” It is a fume of
          the serpent’s venom, first breathed into man, to suspect him of
          cruelty, severity, regardlessness, even under the daily evidences of
          his good disposition: and it is ordinary not to believe him when he
          speaks, nor credit him when he acts; to question the goodness of his
          precepts, and misinterpret the kindness of his providence; as if they
          were designed for the supports of a tyranny, and the deceit of the
          miserable. Thus the Israelites thought their miraculous deliverance
          from Egypt, and the placing them in security in the wilderness, was
          intended only to pound them up for a slaughter (Numb. xiv. 3): thus
          they defiled the lustre of Divine goodness which they had so highly
          experimented, and placed not that confidence in him which was due to
          so frequent a Benefactor, and thereby crucified the rich kindness of
          God, as Genebrard translates the word “limited” (Ps. lxxviii. 41). It
          is also a jealousy of Divine goodness, when we seek to deliver
          ourselves from our straits by unlawful ways, as though God had not
          kindness enough to deliver us without committing evil. What! did God
          make a world, and all creatures in it, to think of them no more, not
          to concern himself in their affairs? If he be good, he is diffusive,
          and delights to communicate himself; and what subjects should there be
          for it, but those that seek him, and implore his assistance? It is an
          indignity to Divine bounty to have such mean thoughts of it, that it
          should be of a nature contrary to that of his works, which, the better
          they are, the more diffusive they are. Doth a man distrust that the
          sun will not shine any more, or the earth not bring forth its fruit?
          Doth he distrust the goodness of an approved medicine for the
          expelling his distemper? If we distrust those things, should we not
          render ourselves ridiculous and sottish? and if we distrust the
          Creator of those things, do we not make ourselves contemners of his
          goodness? If his caring for us be a principal argument to move us to
          cast our care upon him, as it is 1 Pet. v. 7, “Casting your care upon
          him, for he cares for you;” then, if we cast not our care upon him, it
          is a denial of his gracious care of us, as if he regarded not what
          becomes of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. We do contemn or abuse his goodness by omissions of duty. These
          sometimes spring from injurious conceits of God, which end in
          desperate resolutions. It was the crime of a good prophet in his
          passion (2 Kings vi. 33): “This evil is of the Lord, why should I wait
          on the Lord any longer?” God designs nothing but mischief to us, and
          we will seek him no longer. And the complaint of those in Malachi
          (Mal. iii. 14) is of the same nature; “Ye have said, It is vain to
          serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances?” We
          have all this while served a hard Master, not a Benefactor, and have
          not been answered with advantages proportionable to our services; we
          have met with a hand too niggardly to dispense that reward which is
          due to the largeness of our offerings. When men will not lift up their
          eyes to heaven, and solicit nothing but the contrivance of their own
          brain, and the industry of their own heads, they disown Divine
          goodness, and approve themselves as their own gods, and the spring of
          their own prosperity. Those that run not to God in their necessity, to
          crave his support, deny either the arm of his power, or the
          disposition of his will, to sustain and deliver them: they must have
          very mean sentiments, or none at all, of this perfection, or think him
          either too empty to fill them, or too churlish to relieve them; that
          he is of a narrow and contracted temper, and that they may sooner
          expect to be made better and happier by anything else than by him: and
          as we contemn his goodness by a total omission of those duties which
          respect our own advantage and supply, as prayer; so we contemn him as
          the chiefest good, by an omission of the due manner of any act of
          worship which is designed purely for the acknowledgment of him. As
          every omission of the material part of a duty is a denial of his
          sovereignty as commanding it, so every omission of the manner of it,
          not performing it with due esteem and valuation of him, a surrender of
          all the powers of our soul to him, is a denial of him as the most
          amiable object. But certainly to omit those addresses to God which his
          precept enjoins, and his excellency deserves, speaks this language,
          that they can be well enough, and do well enough, without God, and
          stand in no need of his goodness to maintain them. The neglect or
          refusal in a malefactor to supplicate for his pardon, is a wrong to,
          and contempt of, the prince’s goodness: either implying that he hath
          not a goodness in his nature worthy of an address, or that he scorns
          to be obliged to him for any exercise of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. The goodness of God is contemned, or abused, in relying upon our
          services to procure God’s good will to us. As, when we stand in need
          either of some particular mercy, or special assistance; when pressures
          are heavy, and we have little hopes of ease in an ordinary way; when
          the devotions in course have not prevailed for what we want; we engage
          ourselves by extraordinary vows and promises to God, hereby to open
          that goodness which seems to be locked up from us.987 Sometimes,
          indeed, vows may proceed from a sole desire to engage ourselves to
          God, from a sense of the levity and inconstancy of our spirits;
          binding ourselves to God by something more sacred and inviolable than
          a common resolution. But many times the vowing the building of a
          temple, endowing a hospital, giving so much in alms if God will free
          them from a fit of sickness, and spin out the thread of their lives a
          little longer (as hath been frequent among the Romanists), arises from
          an opinion of laziness and a selfishness in the Divine goodness; that
          it must be squeezed out by some solemn promises of returns to him,
          before it will exercise itself to take their parts. Popular vows are
          often the effects of an ignorance of the free and bubbling nature of
          this perfection of the generousness and royalty of Divine goodness: as
          if God were of a mean and mechanic temper, not to part with anything
          unless he were in some measure paid for it; and of so bad a nature as
          not to give passage to any kindness to his creature without a bribe.
          It implies also that he is of an ignorant as well as contracted
          goodness; that he hath so little understanding, and so much weakness
          of judgment, as to be taken with such trifles, and ceremonial
          courtships, and little promises; and meditated only low designs, in
          imparting his bounty: it is just as if a malefactor should speak to a
          prince,—Sir, if you will but bestow a pardon upon me, and prevent the
          death I have merited for this crime, I will give you this rattle. All
          vows made with such a temper of spirit to God, are as injurious and
          abusive to his goodness, as any man will judge such an offer to be to
          a majestic and gracious prince; as if it were a trading, not a free
          and royal goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          7th. The goodness of God is abused when we give up our souls and
          affections to those benefits we have from God; when we make those
          things God’s rivals, which were sent to woo us for him, and offer
          those affections to the presents themselves, which they were sent to
          solicit for the Master. This is done, when either we place our trust
          in them, or glue our choicest affections to them. This charge God
          brings against Jerusalem, the trusting in her own beauty, glory, and
          strength, though it was a comeliness put upon her by God (Ezek. xvi.
          14, 15). When a little sunshine of prosperity breaks out upon us, we
          are apt to grasp it with so much eagerness and closeness, as if we had
          no other foundation to settle ourselves upon, no other being that
          might challenge from us our sole dependence. And the love of
          ourselves, and of creatures above God, is very natural to us: “Lovers
          of themselves, and lovers of pleasure more than of God” (2 Tim. iii.
          2, 4). Self‑love is the root, and the love of pleasures the top
          branch, that mounts its head highest against heaven. It is for the
          love of the world that the dangers of the sea are passed over, that
          men descend into the bowels of the earth, pass nights without sleep,
          undertake suits without intermission, wade through many
          inconveniences, venture their souls, and contemn God; in those things
          men glory, and foolishly grow proud by them, and think themselves safe
          and happy in them.988 Now to love ourselves above God, is to own
          ourselves better than God, and that we transcend him in an amiable
          goodness; or, if we love ourselves equal with God, it at least
          manifests that we think God no better than ourselves; and think
          ourselves our own chief good, and deny anything above us to outstrip
          us in goodness, whereby to deserve to be the centre of our affections
          and actions, and to love any other creature above him, is to conclude
          some defect in God; that he hath not so much goodness in his own
          nature as that creature hath, to complete our felicity; that God is a
          slighter thing than that creature. It is to account God, what all the
          things in the world are,—an imaginary happiness, a goodness of clay;
          and them what God is,—a Supreme Goodness. It is to value the goodness
          of a drop above that of the spring, and the goodness of the spark
          above that of the sun. As if the bounty of God were of a less alloy
          than the advantages we immediately receive from the hands of a silly
          worm. By how much the better we think a creature to be, and place our
          affections chiefly upon it, by so much the more deficient and indigent
          we conclude God; for God wants so much in our conception, as the other
          thing hath goodness above him in our thoughts. Thus is God lessened
          below the creature, as if he had a mixture of evil in him, and were
          capable of an imperfect goodness. He that esteems the sun that shines
          upon him, the clothes that warm him, the food that nourisheth him, or
          any other benefit above the Donor, regards them as more comely and
          useful than God himself; and behaves himself as if he were more
          obliged to them than to God, who bestowed those advantageous qualities
          upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          8th. The Divine goodness is contemned, in sinning more freely upon the
          account of that goodness, and employing God’s benefits in a drudgery
          for our lusts. This is a treachery to his goodness, to make his
          benefits serve for an end quite contrary to that for which he sent
          them. As if God had been plentiful in his blessings, to hire them to
          be more fierce in their rebellions, and fed them to no other purpose,
          but that they might more strongly kick against him; this is the fruit
          which corrupt nature produceth. Thus the Egyptians, who had so fertile
          a country, prove unthankful to the Creator, by adoring the meanest
          creatures, and putting the sceptre of the Monarch of the world into
          the hands of the sottishest and cruellest beasts. And the Romans
          multiply their idols, as God multiplied their victories. This is also
          the complaint of God concerning Israel: “She did not know that I gave
          her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which
          they prepared for Baal” (Hos. ii. 8). They ungratefully employed the
          blessings of God in the worship of an idol against the will of the
          Donor. So in Hos. x. 1; “According to the multitude of his fruit, he
          hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land, they
          have made goodly images.” They followed their own inventions with the
          strength of my outward blessings; as their wealth increased, they
          increased the ornaments of their images; so that what were before of
          wood and stone, they advanced to gold and silver. And the like
          complaint you may see Ezek. 16, 17. Thus,
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] The benefits of God are abused to pride, when men standing upon a
          higher ground of outward prosperity, vaunt it loftily above their
          neighbors; the common fault of those that enjoy a worldly sunshine,
          which the apostle observes in his direction to Timothy; “Charge them
          that are rich in this world, that they be not high‑minded” (1 Tim. vi.
          17). It is an ill use of Divine blessings to be filled by them with
          pride and wind. Also,
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] When men abuse plenty to ease; because they have abundance, spend
          their time in idleness, and make no other use of Divine benefits than
          to trifle away their time, and be utterly useless to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] When they also abuse peace and other blessing to security; as
          they which would not believe the threatenings of judgment, and the
          storm coming from a far country, because the Lord was in Sion, and her
          King in her; “Is not the Lord in Sion, is not her King in her” (Jer.
          viii. 19)? thinking they might continue their progress in their sin,
          because they had the temple, the seat of the Divine glory, Sion, and
          the promise of an everlasting kingdom to David; abusing the promise of
          God to presumption and security, and turning the grace of God into
          wantonness.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] Again, when they abuse the bounty of God to sensuality and
          luxury, misemploying the provisions God gives them, in resolving to
          live like beasts, when by a good improvement of them, they might
          attain the life of angels. Thus is the light of the sun abused to
          conduct them, and the fruits of the earth abused to enable them to
          their prodigious debauchery: as we do, saith one, with the Thames,
          which brings us in provision, and we soil it with our rubbish.989 The
          more God sows his gifts, the more we sow our cockle and darnel. Thus
          we make our outward happiness the most unhappy part of our lives, and
          by the strength of Divine blessings, exceed all laws of reason and
          religion too. How unworthy a carriage is this, to use the expressions
          of Divine goodness as occasions of a greater outrage and affront of
          him; when we stab his honor by those instruments he puts into our
          hands to glorify him! as if a favorite should turn that sword into the
          bowels of his prince, wherewith he knighted him; and a servant,
          enriched by a lord, should hire by that wealth, murderers to take away
          his life! How brutish is it, the more God courts us with his
          blessings, the more to spurn at him with our feet; like the mule that
          lifts up his heel against the dam, as soon as ever it hath sucked her!
          We never beat God out of our hearts, but by his own gifts; he receives
          no blows from men, but by those instruments he gave them to promote
          their happiness. While man is an enjoyer, he makes God a loser, by his
          own blessings; inflames his rebellion by those benefits which should
          kindle his love; and runs from him by the strength of those favors
          which should endear the donor to him: “Do you thus requite the Lord, O
          foolish people, and unwise?” is the expostulation (Deut. xxxii. 6).
          Divine goodness appears in the complaint of the abuse of it, in giving
          them titles below their crime, and complaining more of their being
          unfaithful to their own interest, than enemies to his glory: “foolish
          and unwise” in neglecting their own happiness; a charge below the
          crime, which deserved to be “abominable, ungrateful people to a
          prodigy.” All this carriage towards God, is as if a man should knock
          the chirurgeon on the head, as soon as he hath set and bound up his
          dislocated members. So God compares the ungrateful behavior of the
          Israelites against him: “Though I have bound and strengthened their
          arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me” (Hos. vii. 15): a
          metaphor taken from a chirurgeon that applies corroborating plasters
          to a broken limb.
        </p>
        <p>
          9th. We contemn the goodness of God, in ascribing our benefits to
          other causes than Divine goodness. Thus Israel ascribed her felicity,
          plenty, and success, to her idols, as “rewards which her lovers had
          given her” (Hos. ii. 5, 12). And this charge Daniel brought home upon
          Belshazzar: “Thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, and
          brass, and iron; and the God in whose hand is thy breath, and whose
          are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified” (Dan. v. 23). The God who
          hath given success to the arms of thy ancestors, and conveyed by their
          hands so large a dominion to thee, thou hast not honored in the same
          rank with the sordidest of thy idols. It is the same case, when we own
          him not as the author of any success in our affairs, but by an
          overweaning conceit of our own sagacity, applaud and admire ourselves,
          and overlook the hand that conducted us, and brought our endeavors to
          a good issue. We eclipse the glory of Divine goodness, by setting the
          crown that is due to it upon the head of our own industry; a sacrilege
          worse than Belshazzar’s drinking of wine with his lords and concubines
          in the sacred vessels pilfered from the temple; as in that place of
          Daniel. This was the proud vaunt of the Assyrian conqueror, for which
          God threatens to punish the fruit of his stout heart: “By the strength
          of my hand, I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent;” and,
          “I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their
          treasures;” and, “I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man”
          (Isa. x. 12‒14). Not a word of Divine goodness and assistance in all
          this, but applauding his own courage and conduct. This is a robbing of
          God, to set up ourselves, and making Divine goodness a footstool, to
          ascend into his throne. And as it is unjust, so it is ridiculous, to
          ascribe to ourselves, or instruments, the chief honor of any work; as
          ridiculous as if a soldier, after a victory, should erect an altar to
          the honor of his sword; or an artificer offer sacrifices to the tools
          whereby he completed some excellent and useful invention: a practice
          that every rational man would disdain, where he should see it. It is a
          discarding any thoughts of the goodness of God, when we imagine, that
          we chiefly owe anything in this world to our own industry or wit, to
          friends or means, as though Divine goodness did not open its hand to
          interest itself in our affairs, support our ability, direct our
          counsels, and mingle itself with anything we do. God is the principal
          author of any advantage that accrues to us, of any wise resolution we
          fix upon, or any proper way we take to compass it; no man can be wise
          in opposition to God, act wisely, or well without him; his goodness
          inspires men with generous and magnificent counsels, and furnisheth
          them with fit and proportionable means; when he withdraws his hand,
          men’s heads grow foolish, and their hands feeble; folly and weakness
          drop upon them, as darkness upon the world upon the removal of the
          sun; it is an abuse of Divine goodness not to own it, but erect an
          idol in its place. Ezra was of another mind when he ascribed to the
          good hand of God the “providing ministers for the temple,” and not to
          his own care and diligence (chap. viii. 18); and Nehemiah, the
          “success he had with the king” in the behalf of his nation, and not
          solely to his favor with the prince, or the arts he used to please him
          (chap. ii. 8).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The second information is this: If God be so good, it is a certain
          argument that man is fallen from his original state. It is the
          complaint of man, sometimes, that other creatures have more of earthly
          happiness than men have; live freer from cares and trouble, and are
          not racked with that solicitousness and anxiety as man is: have not
          such distempers to embitter their lives. It is a good ground for man
          to look into himself, and consider whether he hath not, some ways or
          other, disobliged God more than other creatures can possibly do. We
          often find that the creatures men have need of in this state, do not
          answer the expectation of man: “Cursed be the ground for thy sake”
          (Gen. iii. 17). A fruitful land is made barren; thorns and thistles
          triumph upon the face of the earth, instead of good fruit. Is it
          likely that that goodness, which is as infinite as his power, and
          knows no more limits than his Almightiness, should imprint so many
          scars upon the world, if he had not been heinously provoked by some
          miscarriage of his creature? Infinite Goodness could never move
          Infinite Justice to inflict punishment upon creatures, if they had not
          highly merited it; we cannot think that any creature was blemished
          with a principle of disturbance, as it came first out of the hand of
          God. All things were certainly settled in a due order and dependence
          upon one another; nothing could be ungrateful and unuseful to man by
          the original law of their creation; if there had, it had not been
          goodness, but evil and baseness, that had created the world. When we
          see, therefore, the course of nature overturned, the order Divine
          goodness had placed, disturbed; and the creatures pronounced good and
          useful to man, employed as instruments of vengeance against him; we
          must conclude some horrible blot upon human nature, and very odious to
          a God of infinite goodness; and that this blot was dashed upon man by
          himself, and his own fault; for it is repugnant to the infinite
          goodness of God to put into the creature a sinning nature, to hurry
          him into sin, and then punish him for that which he had impressed upon
          him. The goodness of God inclines him to love goodness wherever he
          finds it; and not to punish any that have not deserved it by their own
          crimes. The curse we therefore see the creatures groan under, the
          disorders in nature, the frustrating the expectations of man in the
          fruits of the earth and plentiful harvests, the trouble he is
          continually exposed to in the world, which tedders down his spirit
          from more generous employments, shows that man is not what he was when
          Divine goodness first erected him; but hath admitted into his nature
          something more uncomely in the eye of God; and so heinous, that it
          puts his goodness sometimes to a stand, and makes him lay aside the
          blessings his hand was filled with, to take up the arms of vengeance,
          wherewith to fight against the world. Divine goodness would have
          secured his creatures from any such invasions, and never used those
          things against man, which he designed in the first frame for man’s
          service, were there not some detestable disorder risen in the nature
          of man which makes God withhold his liberality and change the
          dispensation of his numerous benefits into legions of judgments. The
          consideration of the Divine goodness, which is a notion that man
          naturally concludes to be inseparable from the Deity, would, to an
          unbiassed reason, verify the history of those punishments settled upon
          man in the third chapter of Genesis, and make the whole seem more
          probable to reason at the first relation. This instruction naturally
          flows from the doctrine of Divine goodness: if God be so good, it is a
          certain argument that man is fallen from his original state.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third information is this: If God be infinitely good, there can
          be no just complaint against God, if men be punished for abusing his
          goodness. Man had nothing, nay, it was impossible he could have
          anything, from Infinite Goodness to disoblige him, but to engage him.
          God never did, nay, never could, draw his sword against man, till man
          had slighted him and affronted him by the strength of his own bounty.
          It is by this God doth justify his severest proceedings against men,
          and very seldom charges them with any else as the matter of their
          provocations (Hos. ii. 9): “Therefore will I return, and take away my
          corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will
          recover my wool and my flax.” And in Ezek. xvi., after he had drawn
          out a bill of complaint against them, and inserted only the abuse of
          his benefits, as a justification of what he intended to do; he
          concludes (ver. 27), “Behold, therefore, I have stretched out my hand
          over thee, and diminished thy ordinary food, and delivered thee unto
          the will of them that hate thee.” When men suffer, they suffer justly;
          they were not constrained by any violence, or forced by any necessity,
          nor provoked by any ill usage, to turn head against God, but broke the
          bands of the strongest obligations and most tender allurements. What
          man, what devil, can justly blame God for punishing them, after they
          had been so intolerably bold, as to fly in the face of that goodness
          that had obliged them, by giving them beings of a higher elevation
          than to inferior creatures, and furnishing them with sufficient
          strength to continue in their first habitation? Man seems to have less
          reason to accuse God of rigor than devils; since, after his
          unreasonable revolt, a more express goodness than that which created
          him hath solicited him to repentance, courted him by melting promises
          and expostulations, added undeniable arguments of bounty, and drawn
          out the choicest treasures of heaven, in the gift of his Son, to
          prevail over men’s perversity. And yet man, after he might arrive to
          the height and happiness of an angel, will be fond of continuing in
          the meanness and misery of a devil; and more strongly link himself to
          the society of the damned spirits, wherein, by his first rebellion, he
          had incorporated himself. Who can blame God for vindicating his own
          goodness from such desperate contempts, and the extreme ingratitude of
          man? If God be good, it is our happiness to adhere to him; if we
          depart from him, we depart from goodness; and if evil happen to us, we
          cannot blame God, but ourselves, for our departure.990 Why are men
          happy? because they cleave to God. Why are men miserable? because they
          recede from God. It is then our own fault that we are miserable; God
          cannot be charged with any injustice if we be miserable, since his
          goodness gave means to prevent it, and afterwards added means to
          recover us from it, but all despised by us. The doctrine of Divine
          goodness justifies every stone laid in the foundation of hell, and
          every spark in that burning furnace, since it is for the abuse of
          infinite goodness that it was kindled.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The fourth information: Here is a certain argument, both for God’s
          fitness to govern the world, and his actual government of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) This renders him fit for the government of the world, and gives
          him a full title to it. This perfection doth the Psalmist celebrate
          throughout the 107th Psalm, where he declares God’s works of
          providence (ver. 8, 15, 21, 32). Power without goodness would deface,
          instead of preserving; ruin is the fruit of rigor without kindness;
          but God, because of his infinite and immutable goodness, cannot do
          anything unworthy of himself, and uncomely in itself, or destructive
          to any moral goodness in the creature. It is impossible he should do
          anything that is base, or act anything but for the best, because he is
          essentially and naturally, and, therefore, necessarily good. As a good
          tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, so a good God cannot produce evil
          acts, no more than a pure beam of the sun can engender so much as a
          mite of darkness, or infinite heat produce any particle of cold. As
          God is so much light, that he can be no darkness, so he is so much
          good, that he can have no evil; and because there is no evil in him,
          nothing simply evil can be produced by him. Since he is good by
          nature, all evil is against his nature, and God can do nothing against
          his nature; it would be a part of impotence in him to will that which
          is evil; and, therefore, the misery man feels, as well as the sin
          whereby he deserves that misery, are said to be from himself (Hos.
          xiii. 9): “O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself!” And though God
          sends judgments upon the world, we have shown these to be intended for
          the support and vindication of his goodness. And Hezekiah judged no
          otherwise, when, after the threatening of the devastation of his
          house, the plundering his treasures, and captivity of his posterity,
          he replies, “Good is the word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken”
          (Isa. xxxix. 8). God cannot act anything that is base and cruel,
          because his goodness is as infinite as his power, and his power acts
          nothing but what his wisdom directs, and his goodness moves him to.
          Wisdom is the head in government, omniscience the eye, power the arm,
          and goodness the heart and spirit in them, that animates all.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) As goodness renders Him fit to govern the world, so God doth
          actually govern the world. Can we understand this perfection aright,
          and yet imagine that he is of so morose a disposition as to neglect
          the care of his creatures? that his excellency, which was displayed in
          framing the world, should withdraw and wrap up itself in his own
          bosom, without looking out, and darting itself out in the disposal of
          them? Can that which moved him first to erect a world, suffer him to
          be unmindful of his own work? Would he design first to display it in
          creation, and afterwards obscure the honor of it? That cannot be
          entitled an infinite permanent goodness, which should be so
          indifferent as to let the creatures tumble together as they please,
          without any order, after he had moulded them in his hand. If goodness
          be diffusive and communicative of itself, can it consist with the
          nature of it, to extend itself to the giving the creatures being, and
          then withdraw and contract itself, not caring what becomes of them? It
          is the nature of goodness, after it hath communicated itself, to
          enlarge its channels; that fountain that springs up in a little hollow
          part of the earth, doth in a short progress increase its streams, and
          widen the passages through which it runs; it would be a blemish to
          Divine goodness, if it did desert what it made, and leave things to
          wild confusions, which would be, if a good hand did not manage them,
          and a good mind preside over them. This is the lesson intended to us
          by all his judgments (Dan. iv. 17), “That the living may know that the
          Most High rules in the kingdoms of men.” If he doth not actually
          govern the world, he must have devolved it somewhere, either to men or
          angels; not to men, who naturally want a goodness and wisdom to govern
          themselves, much more to govern others exactly. And, besides the
          misinterpretations of actions, they are liable to the want of
          patience, to bear with the provocations of the world; since some of
          the best at one time in the world, and, in the greatest example of
          meekness and sweetness, would have kindled a fire in heaven to have
          consumed the Samaritans, for no other affront than a non‑entertainment
          of their Master and themselves (Luke ix. 54). Nor hath he committed
          the disposal of things to angels, either good or bad; though he useth
          them as instruments in his government, yet they are not the principal
          pilots to steer the world. Bad angels certainly are not; they would
          make continual ravages, meditate ruin, never defeat their own
          counsels, which they manage by the wicked as the instruments in the
          world, nor fill their spirits with disquiet and restlessness when they
          are engaged in some ruinous design, as often is experienced: nor hath
          he committed it to the good angels, who, for aught we know, are not
          more numerous than the evil ones are; but besides, we can scarcely
          think their finite nature capable of so much goodness, as to bear the
          innumerable debaucheries, villanies, blasphemies, vented in one year,
          one week, one day, one hour, throughout the world; their zeal for
          their Creator might well be supposed to move them to testify their
          affection to him in a constant and speedy righting of his injured
          honor upon the heads of the offenders. The evil angels have too much
          cruelty, and would have no care of justice, but take pleasure in the
          blood of the most innocent, as well as the most criminal; and the good
          angels have too little tenderness to suffer so many crimes: since the
          world, therefore, continues without those floods of judgments, which
          it daily merits; since, notwithstanding all the provocations, the
          order of it is preserved; it is a testimony that an Infinite Goodness
          holds the helm in his hands, and spreads its warm wings over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The fifth information is this: Hence we may infer the ground of all
          religion; it is this perfection of goodness. As the goodness of God is
          the lustre of all his attributes, so it is the foundation and link of
          all true religious worship: the natural religion of the heathens was
          introduced by the consideration of Divine goodness, in the being he
          had bestowed upon them, and the provisions that were made for them.
          Divine bounty was the motive to erect altars, and present sacrifices,
          though they mistook the object of their worship, and offered the dues
          of the Creator to the instruments whereby he conveyed his benefits to
          them: and you find, that the religion instituted by him among the
          Jews, was enforced upon them by the consideration of their miraculous
          deliverance from Egypt, the preservation of them in the wilderness,
          and the enfeoffing them in a land flowing with milk and honey. Every
          act of bounty and success the heathens received, moved them to appoint
          new feasts, and repeat their adorations of those deities they thought
          the authors and promoters of their victories and welfare. The devil
          did not mistake the common sentiment of the world in Divine service,
          when he alleged to God, that “Job did not fear him for nought,” i. e.
          worship him for nothing (Job i. 9). All acts of devotion take their
          rise from God’s liberality, either from what they have or from what
          they hope; praise speaks the possession, and prayer the expectation,
          of some benefit from his hand: though some of the heathens made fear
          to be the prime cause of the acknowledgment and worship of a deity,
          yet surely something else besides and beyond this established so great
          a thing as religion in the world; an ingenuous religion could never
          have been born into the world without a notion of goodness, and would
          have gaped its last as soon as this notion should have expired in the
          minds of men. What encouragement can fear of power give, without sense
          of goodness? just as much as thunder hath, to invite a man to the
          place where it is like to fall, and crush him. The nature of “fear” is
          to drive from, and the nature of “goodness” to allure to, the object:
          the Divine thunders, prodigies, and other armies of his justice in the
          world, which are the marks of his power, could conclude in nothing but
          a slavish worship: fear alone would have made men blaspheme the Deity;
          instead of serving him, they would have fretted against him; they
          might have offered him a trembling worship; but they could never have,
          in their minds, thought him worthy of an adoration; they would rather
          have secretly complained of him, and cursed him in their heart, than
          inwardly have admired him: the issue would have been the same, which
          Job’s wife advised him to, when God withdrew his protection from his
          goods and body: “Curse God, and die” (Job ii. 9). It is certainly the
          common sentiment of men, that he that acts cruelly and tyrannically,
          is not worthy of an integrity to be retained towards him in the hearts
          of his subjects; but Job fortifies himself against this temptation
          from his bosom friend, by the consideration of the good he had
          received from God, which did more deserve a worship from him than the
          present evil had reason to discourage it. Alas! what is only feared,
          is hated, not adored. Would any seek to an irreconcileable enemy?
          would any person affectionately list himself in the service of a man
          void of all good disposition? would any distressed person put up a
          petition to that prince, who never gave any experiment of the
          sweetness of his nature, but always satiated himself with the blood of
          the meanest criminals? All affection to service is rooted up when
          hopes of receiving good are extinguished: there could not be a spark
          of that in the world, which is properly called religion, without a
          notion of goodness; the existence of God is the first pillar, and the
          goodness of God in rewarding the next, upon which coming to him (which
          includes all acts of devotion) is established (Heb. xi. 6); “He that
          comes unto God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
          them that diligently seek him:” if either of those pillars be not
          thought to stand firm, all religion falls to the ground. It is this,
          as the most agreeable motive, that the apostle James uses, to
          encourage men’s approach to God, because “he gives liberally, and
          upbraideth not” (James i. 5). A man of a kind heart and a bountiful
          hand shall have his gate thronged with suppliants, who sometimes would
          be willing to lay down their lives; “for a good man one would even
          dare to die:” when one of a niggardly or tyrannical temper shall be
          destitute of all free and affectionate applications. What eyes would
          be lifted up to heaven? what hands stretched out, if there were not a
          knowledge of goodness there to enliven their hopes of speeding in
          their petitions? Therefore Christ orders our prayers to be directed to
          God as a Father, which is a title of tenderness, as well as a “Father
          in heaven,” a mark of his greatness; the one to support our
          confidence, as well as the other to preserve our distance. God could
          not be ingenuously adored and acknowledged, if he were not liberal as
          well as powerful; the goodness of God is the foundation of all
          ingenuous religion, devotion and worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The sixth instruction: The goodness of God renders God amiable. His
          goodness renders him beautiful, and his beauty renders him lovely;
          both are linked together (Zech. ix. 17): “How great is his goodness!
          and how great is his beauty!” This is the most powerful attractive,
          and masters the affections of the soul: it is goodness only supposed,
          or real, that is thought worthy to demerit our affections to anything.
          If there be not a reality of this, or at least an opinion and
          estimation of it in an object, it would want a force and vigor to
          allure our will. This perfection of God is the loadstone to draw us,
          and the centre for our spirits to rest in.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This renders God amiable to himself. His goodness is his “Godhead”
          (Rom. i. 20): by his Godhead is meant his goodness; if he loves his
          Godhead for itself, he loves his goodness for itself; he would not be
          good, if he did not love himself; and if there were anything more
          excellent, and had a greater goodness than himself, he would not be
          good if he did not love that greater goodness above himself; for not
          only a hatred of goodness is evil, but an indifferent or cold
          affection to goodness hath a tincture of evil in it. If God were not
          good, and yet should love himself in the highest manner, he would be
          the greatest evil, and do the greatest evil in that act; for he would
          set his love upon that which is not the proper object of such an
          affection, but the object of aversion: his own infinite excellency,
          and goodness of his nature, renders him lovely and delightful to
          himself; without this he could not love himself in a commendable and
          worthy way, and becoming the purity of a Deity; and he cannot but love
          himself for this; for, as creatures, by not loving him as the supreme
          good, deny him to be the choicest good, so God would deny himself, and
          his own goodness, if he did not love himself, and that for his
          goodness. But the apostle tells us, that “God cannot deny himself” (2
          Tim. ii. 13). Self‑love, upon this account, is the only prerogative of
          God, because there is not anything better than himself that can lay
          any just claim to his affections: he only ought to love himself, and
          it would be an injustice in him to himself, if he did not. He only can
          love himself for this: an infinite goodness ought to be infinitely
          loved, but he only being infinite, can only love himself according to
          the due merit of his own goodness. He cannot be so amiable to any man,
          to any angel, to the highest seraphim, as he is to himself; because he
          is only capable in regard of his infinite wisdom, to know the
          infiniteness of his own goodness. And no creature can love him as he
          ought to be loved, unless it had the same infinite capacity of
          understanding to know him, and of affection to embrace him. This first
          renders God amiable to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It ought therefore to render him amiable to us. What renders him
          lovely to his own eye, ought to render him so to ours; and since, by
          the shortness of our understandings, we cannot love him as he merits,
          yet we should be induced by the measures of his bounty, to love him as
          we can. If this do not present him lovely to us, we own him rather a
          devil than a God: if his goodness moved him to frame creatures, his
          goodness moved him also to frame creatures for himself and his own
          glory. It is a mighty wrong to him not to look with a delightful eye
          upon the marks of it, and return an affection to God in some measure
          suitable to his liberality to us; we are descended as low as brutes,
          if we understand him not to be the perfect good; and we are descended
          as low as devils, if our affections are not attracted by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) If God were not infinitely good, he could not be the object of
          supreme love. If he were finitely good, there might be other things as
          good as God, and then God in justice could not challenge our choicest
          affections to him above anything else: it would be a defect of
          goodness in him to demand it, because he would despoil that which were
          equally good with him, of its due and right to our affections, which
          it might claim from us upon the account of its goodness: God would be
          unjust to challenge more than was due to him; for he would claim that
          chiefly to himself which another had a lawful share in. Nothing can be
          supremely loved that hath not a triumphant excellency above all other
          things; where is an equality of goodness, neither can justly challenge
          a supremacy, but only an equality of affection.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This attribute of goodness renders him more lovely than any other
          attribute. He never requires our adoration of him so much as the
          strongest or wisest, but as the best of beings: he uses this chiefly
          to constrain and allure us. Why would he be feared or worshipped, but
          because “there is forgiveness with him” (Ps. cxxx. 4)? it is for his
          goodness’ sake that he is sued to by his people in distress (Ps. xxv.
          7), “For thy goodness’ sake, O Lord.” Men may be admired because of
          their knowledge, but they are affected because of their goodness: the
          will, in all the variety of objects it pursues, centres in this one
          thing of good as the term of its appetite. All things are beloved by
          men, because they have been bettered by them. Severity can never
          conquer enmity, and kindle love: were there nothing but wrath in the
          Deity, it would make him be feared, but render him odious, and that to
          an innocent nature. As the spouse speaks of Christ (Cant. v. 10, 11),
          so we may of God: though she commends him for his head, the excellency
          of his wisdom; his eyes, the extent of his omniscience; his hands, the
          greatness of his power; and his legs, the swiftness of his motions and
          ways to and for his people; yet the “sweetness of his mouth,” in his
          gracious words and promises, closes all, and is followed with nothing
          but an exclamation, that “he is altogether lovely” (ver. 16). His
          mouth, in pronouncing pardon of sin, and justification of the person,
          presents him most lovely. His power to do good is admirable, but his
          will to do good is amiable: this puts a gloss upon all his other
          attributes. Though he had knowledge to understand the depth of our
          necessities, and power to prevent them, or rescue us from them, yet
          his knowledge would be fruitless, and his power useless, if he were of
          a rigid nature, and not touched with any sentiments of kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This goodness therefore lays a strong obligation upon us. It is
          true he is lovely in regard of his absolute goodness, or the goodness
          of his nature, but we should hardly be persuaded to return him an
          affection without his relative goodness, his benefits to his
          creatures; we are obliged by both to love him.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] By his absolute goodness, or the goodness of his nature. Suppose
          a creature had drawn its original from something else wherein God had
          no influx, and had never received the least mite of a benefit from
          him, but from some other hand, yet the infinite excellency and
          goodness of his nature would merit the love of that creature, and it
          would act sordidly and disingenuously if it did not discover a mighty
          respect for God: for what ingenuity could there be in a rational
          creature, that were possessed with no esteem for any nature filled
          with unbounded goodness and excellency, though he had never been
          obliged to him for any favor? That man is accounted odious, and justly
          despicable by man, that reproaches and disesteems, nay, that doth not
          value a person of a high virtue in himself, and an universal goodness
          and charity to others, though himself never stood in need of his
          charity, and never had any benefit conveyed from his hands, nor ever
          saw his face, or had any commerce with him: a value of such a person
          is but a just due to the natural claim of virtue. And, indeed, the
          first object of love is God in the excellency of his own nature, as
          the first object of love in marriage is the person; the portion is a
          thing consequent upon it. To love God only for his benefits, is to
          love ourselves first, and him secondarily: to love God for his own
          goodness and excellency, is a true love of God; a love of him for
          himself. That flaming fire in his own breast, though we have not a
          spark of it, hath a right to kindle one in ours to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] By his relative goodness, or that of his benefits. Though the
          excellency of his own nature, wherein there is a combination of
          goodness, must needs ravish an apprehensive mind; yet a reflection
          upon his imparted kindness, both in the beings we have from him, and
          the support we have by him, must enhance his estimation. When the
          excellency of his nature, and the expressions of his bounty are in
          conjunction, the excellency of his own nature renders him estimable in
          a way of justice, and the greatness of his benefits renders him
          valuable in a way of gratitude: the first ravisheth, and the other
          allures and melts: he hath enough in his nature to attract, and
          sufficient in his bounty to engage our affections. The excellency of
          his nature is strong enough of itself to blow up our affections to
          him, were there not a malignity in our hearts that represents him
          under the notion of an enemy; therefore in regard of our corrupt
          state, the consideration of Divine largesses comes in for a share in
          the elevation of our affections. For, indeed, it is a very hard thing
          for a man to love another, though never so well qualified, and of an
          eminent virtue, while he believes him to be his enemy, and one that
          will severely handle him, though he hath before received many good
          turns from him; the virtue, valor, and courtesy of a prince, will
          hardly make him affected by those against whom he is in arms, and that
          are daily pilfered by his soldiers, unless they have hopes of a
          reparation from him, and future security from injuries. Christ, in the
          repetition of the command to “love God with all our mind, with all our
          heart, and with all our soul,” i. e. with such an ardency above all
          things which glitter in our eye, or can be created by him, considers
          him as “our God” (Matt. xxii. 37). And the Psalmist considers him as
          one that had kindly employed his power for him, in the eruption of his
          love (Ps. xviii. 1), “I will love thee, O Lord, my strength;” and so
          in Ps. cxvi. 1, “I love the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of
          my supplications.” An esteem of the benefactor is inseparable from
          gratitude for the received benefits: and should not then the
          unparalleled kindness of God advance him in our thoughts, much more
          than slighter courtesies do a created benefactor in ours? It is an
          obligation on every man’s nature to answer bounty with gratitude, and
          goodness with love. Hence you never knew any man, nor can the records
          of eternity produce any man, or devil, that ever hated any person, or
          anything as good in itself: it is a thing absolutely repugnant to the
          nature of any rational creature. The devils hate not God because he is
          good, but because he is not so good to them as they would have him;
          because he will not unlock their chains, turn them into liberty, and
          restore them to happiness; i. e. because he will not desert the rights
          of abused goodness. But how should we send up flames of love to that
          God, since we are under his direct beams, and enjoy such plentiful
          influences! If the sun is comely in itself, yet it is more amiable to
          us, by the light we see, and the warmth we feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The greatness of his benefits have reason to affect us with a
          love to him. The impress he made upon our souls when he extracted us
          from the darkness of nothing; the comeliness he hath put upon us by
          his own breath; the care he took of our recovery, when we had lost
          ourselves; the expense he was at for our regaining our defaced beauty;
          the gift he made of his Son; the affectionate calls we have heard to
          over‑master our corrupt appetites, move us to repentance, and make us
          disaffect our beloved misery; the loud sound of his word in our ears,
          and the more inward knockings of his Spirit in our heart; the offering
          us the gift of himself, and the everlasting happiness he courts us to,
          besides those common favors we enjoy in the world, which are all the
          streams of his rich bounty: the voice of all is loud enough to solicit
          our love, and the merit of all ought to be strong enough to engage our
          love: “there is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides upon the
          heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky” (Deut. xxxiii.
          26).
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. The unmeritedness of them doth enhance this. It is but reason to
          love him who hath loved us first (1 John iv. 19). Hath he placed his
          delight upon any when they were nothing, and after they were sinful;
          and shall he set his delight upon such vile persons, and shall not we
          set our love upon so excellent an object as himself? How base are we,
          if his goodness doth not constrain us to affect him who hath been so
          free in his favor to us, who have merited the quite contrary at his
          hands? If “his tender mercies are over all his works” (Ps. cxlv. 9),
          he ought for it to be esteemed by all his works that are capable of a
          rational estimation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. Goodness in creatures makes them estimable, much more should the
          goodness of God render him lovely to us. If we love a little spark of
          goodness in this or that creature, if a drop be so delicious to us,
          shall not the immense Sun of goodness, the ever‑flowing Fountain of
          all, be much more delightful? The original excellency always outstrips
          what is derived from it; if so mean and contracted an object as a
          little creature deserves estimation for a little mite communicated to
          it, so great and extended a goodness as is in the Creator much more
          merits it at our hands: he is good after the infinite methods of a
          Deity: a weak resemblance is lovely; much more amiable, then, must be
          the incomprehensible original of that beauty. We love creatures for
          what we think to be good in them, though it may be hurtful; and shall
          we not love God, who is a real and unblemished goodness, and from
          whose hand are poured out all those blessings that are conveyed to us
          by second causes? The object that delights us, the capacity we have to
          delight in it, are both from him; our love, therefore, to him should
          transcend the affection we bear to any instruments he moves for our
          welfare. “Among the gods, there is none like thee, O Lord, neither are
          there any works like unto thy works” (Ps. lxxxvi. 8): among the
          pleasantest creatures there is none like the Creator, nor any goodness
          like unto his goodness. Shall we love the food that nourisheth us, and
          the medicine that cures us, and the silver whereby we furnish
          ourselves with useful commodities? Shall we love a horse, or dog, for
          the benefits we have by them? and shall not the spring of all those
          draw our souls after it, and make us aspire to the honor of loving and
          embracing Him who hath stored every creature with that which may
          pleasure us? But, instead of endeavoring to parallel our affection
          with his kindness, we endeavor to make our disingenuity as extensive
          and towering as his Divine goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. This is the true end of the manifestation of his goodness, that
          he might appear amiable, and have a return of affection. Did God
          display his goodness only to be thought of, or to be loved? It is the
          want of such a return, that he hath usually aggravated, from the
          benefits he hath bestowed upon men. Every thought of him should be
          attended with a motion suitable to the excellency of his nature and
          works. Can we think those nobler spirits, the angels, look upon
          themselves, or those frames of things in the heavens and earth,
          without starting some practical affection to him for them? Their
          knowledge of his excellency and works cannot be a lazy contemplation:
          it is impossible their wills and affections should be a thousand miles
          distant from their understandings in their operations. It is not the
          least part of his condescending goodness to court in such methods the
          affections of us worms, and manifest his desire to be beloved by us.
          Let us give him, then, that affection he deserves, as well as demands,
          and which cannot be withheld from him without horrible sacrilege.
          There is nothing worthy of love besides him; let no fire be kindled in
          our hearts, but what may ascend directly to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The seventh instruction is this: This renders God a fit object of
          trust and confidence. Since none is good but God, none can be a full
          and satisfactory ground or object of confidence but God: as all things
          derive their beings, so they derive their helpfulness to us from God;
          they are not, therefore, the principal objects of trust, but that
          goodness alone that renders them fit instruments of our support; they
          can no more challenge from us a stable confidence, than they can a
          supreme affection. It is by this the Psalmist allures men to a trust
          in him; “Taste and see how good the Lord is:” what is the consequence?
          “Blessed is the man that trusts in thee” (Ps. xxxiv. 8). The voice of
          Divine goodness sounds nothing more intelligibly, and a taste of it
          produceth nothing more effectually, than this. As the vials of his
          justice are to make us fear him, so the streams of his goodness are to
          make us rely on him: as his patience is designed to broach our
          repentance, so his goodness is most proper to strengthen our assurance
          in him: that goodness which surmounted so many difficulties, and
          conquered so many motions that might be made against any repeated
          exercise of it, after it had been abused by the first rebellion of
          man; that goodness that after so much contempt of it, appeared in such
          a majestic tenderness, and threw aside those impediments which men had
          cast in the way of Divine inclinations: this goodness is the
          foundation of all reliance upon God. Who is better than God? and,
          therefore, who more to be trusted than God? As his power cannot act
          anything weakly, so his goodness cannot act anything unbecomingly, and
          unworthy of his infinite majesty. And here consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Goodness is the first motive of trust. Nothing but this could be
          the encouragement to man, had he stood in a state of innocence, to
          present himself before God; the majesty of God would have constrained
          him to keep his due distance, but the goodness of God could only
          hearten his confidence: it is nothing else now that can preserve the
          same temper in us in our lapsed condition. To regard him only as the
          Judge of our crimes, will drive us from him; but only the regard of
          him as the Donor of our blessings, will allure us to him. The
          principal foundation of faith is not the word of God, but God himself,
          and God as considered in this perfection. As the goodness of God in
          his invitations and providential blessings “leads us to repentance”
          (Rom. ii. 4), so, by the same reason, the goodness of God by his
          promises leads us to reliance. If God be not first believed to be
          good, he would not be believed at all in anything that he speaks or
          swears: if you were not satisfied in the goodness of a man, though he
          should swear a thousand times, you would value neither his word nor
          oath as any security. Many times, where we are certain of the goodness
          of a man, we are willing to trust him without his promise. This Divine
          perfection gives credit to the Divine promises; they of themselves
          would not be a sufficient ground of trust, without an apprehension of
          his truth; nor would his truth be very comfortable without a belief of
          his good will, whereby we are assured that what he promises to give,
          he gives liberally, free, and without regret. The truth of the
          promiser makes the promise credible, but the goodness of the promiser
          makes it cheerfully relied on. In Ps. lxxiii. (Asaph’s penitential
          psalm for his distrust of God,) he begins the first verse with an
          assertion of this attribute (ver. 1), “Truly God is good to Israel;”
          and ends with this fruit of it (ver. 28), “I will put my trust in the
          Lord God.” It is a mighty ill nature that receives not with assurance
          the dictates of Infinite Goodness, (that cannot deceive or frustrate
          the hopes we conceive of him) that is inconceivably more abundant in
          the breast and inclinations of the promiser, than expressible in the
          words of his promise, “All true faith works by love” (Gal. v. 6), and,
          therefore, necessarily includes a particular eyeing of this excellency
          in the Divine nature, which renders him amiable, and is the motive and
          encouragement of a love to him. His power indeed is a foundation of
          trust, but his goodness is the principal motive of it. His power
          without good‑will would be dangerous, and could not allure affection;
          and his good‑will without power would be useless; and though it might
          merit a love, yet could not create a confidence; both in conjunction
          are strong grounds of hope, especially since his goodness is of the
          same infinity with his wisdom and power; and that he can be no more
          wanting in the effusions of this upon them that seek him, than in his
          wisdom to contrive, or his power to effect, his designs and works.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This goodness is more the foundation and motive of trust under
          the gospel, than under the law. They under the law had more evidences
          of Divine power, and their trust eyed that much; though there was an
          eminency of goodness in the frequent deliverances they had, yet the
          power of God had a more glorious dress than his goodness, because of
          the extraordinary and miraculous ways whereby he brought those
          deliverances about. Therefore, in the catalogue of believers in Heb.
          xi. you shall find the power of God to be the centre of their rest and
          trust; and their faith was built upon the extraordinary marks of
          Divine power, which were frequently visible to them. But under the
          gospel, goodness and love was intended by God to be the chief object
          of trust; suitable to the excellency of that dispensation, he would
          have an exercise of more ingenuity in the creatures: therefore, it is
          said (Hos. iii. 5), a promise of gospel‑times, “They shall fear God
          and his goodness in the latter days,” when they shall return to “seek
          the Lord, and David their king.” It is not said, they shall fear God,
          and his power, but the Lord and his goodness, or the Lord for his
          goodness: fear is often in the Old Testament taken for faith, or
          trust. This Divine goodness, the object of faith, is that goodness
          discovered in David their king; the Messiah, our Jesus. God, in this
          dispensation, recommends his goodness and love, and reveals it more
          clearly than other attributes, that the soul might have more
          prevailing and sweeter attractives to confide in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) A confidence in him gives him the glory of his goodness. Most
          nations that had nothing but the light of nature, thought it a great
          part of the honor that was due to God, to implore his goodness, and
          cast their cares upon it. To do good, is the most honorable thing in
          the world, and to acknowledge a goodness in a way of confidence, is as
          high an honor as we can give to it, and a great part of gratitude for
          what it hath already expressed. Therefore we find often, that an
          acknowledgment of one benefit received, was attended with a trust in
          him for what they should in the future need (Ps. lvi. 13): “Thou hast
          delivered my soul from death, wilt thou not deliver my feet from
          falling?” So, 2 Cor. i. 10: and they who have been most eminent for
          their trust in him, have had the greatest eulogies and commendations
          from him. As a diffidence doth disparage this perfection, thinking it
          meaner and shallower than it is, so confidence highly honors it. We
          never please him more, than when we trust in him; “The Lord takes
          pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy” (Ps.
          cxlvii. 11). He takes it for an honor to have this attribute exalted
          by such a carriage of his creature. He is no less offended when we
          think his heart straitened, as if he were a parsimonious God; than
          when we think his arm shortened, as if he were an impotent and feeble
          God. Let us, therefore, make this use of his goodness, to hearten our
          faith. When we are scared by the terrors of his justice, when we are
          dazzled by the arts of his wisdom, and confounded by the splendor of
          his majesty, we may take refuge in the sanctuary of his goodness; this
          will encourage us, as well as astonish us; whereas, the consideration
          of his other attributes would only amaze us, but can never refresh us,
          but when they are considered marching under the conduct and banners of
          this. When all the other perfections of the Divine nature are looked
          upon in conjunction with this excellency, each of them send forth
          ravishing and benign influences upon the applying creature. It is more
          advantageous to depend upon Divine bounty, than our own cares; we may
          have better assurance upon this account in his cares for us, than in
          ours for ourselves. Our goodness for ourselves is finite; and besides,
          we are too ignorant: his goodness is infinite, and attended with an
          infinite wisdom; we have reason to distrust ourselves, not God. We
          have reason to be at rest, under that kind influence we have so often
          experimented; he hath so much goodness, that he can have no deceit:
          his goodness in making the promise, and his goodness in working the
          heart to a reliance on it, are grounds of trust in him; “Remember thy
          word to thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope” (Ps.
          cxix. 49). If his promise did not please him, why did he make it? If
          reliance on the promise did not please him, why did his goodness work
          it? It would be inconsistent with his goodness to mock his creature,
          and it would be the highest mockery to publish his word, and create a
          temper in the heart of his supplicant, suited to his promise which he
          never intended to satisfy. He can as little wrong his creature, as
          wrong himself; and, therefore, can never disappoint that faith which
          in his own methods casts itself into the arms of his kindness, and is
          his own workmanship, and calls him Author. That goodness that imparted
          itself so freely in creation, will not neglect those nobler creatures
          that put their trust in him. This renders God a fit object for trust
          and confidence.

          8. The eighth instruction: This renders God worthy to be obeyed and
          honored. There is an excellency in God to allure, as well as
          sovereignty to enjoin obedience: the infinite excellency of his nature
          is so great, that if his goodness had promised us nothing to encourage
          our obedience, we ought to prefer him before ourselves, devote
          ourselves to serve him, and make his glory our greatest content; but
          much more when he hath given such admirable expressions of his
          liberality, and stored us with hopes of richer and fuller streams of
          it. When David considered the absolute goodness of his nature, and the
          relative goodness of his benefits, he presently expresseth an ardent
          desire to be acquainted with the Divine statutes, that he might make
          ingenious returns in a dutiful observance; “Thou art good, and thou
          dost good; teach me thy statutes” (Ps. cxix. 68). As his goodness is
          the original, so the acknowledgment of it is the end of all, which
          cannot be without an observance of his will. His goodness requires of
          us an ingenuous, not a servile obedience. And this is established upon
          two foundations.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] Because the bounty of God hath laid upon us the strongest
          obligations. The strength of an obligation depends upon the greatness
          and numerousness of the benefits received. The more excellent the
          favors are which are conferred upon any person, the more right hath
          the benefactor to claim an observance from the person bettered by him.
          Much of the rule and empire which hath been in several ages conferred
          by communities upon princes, hath had its first spring from a sense of
          the advantages they have received by them, either in protecting them
          from their enemies, or rescuing them from an ignoble captivity; in
          enlarging their territories, or increasing their wealth. Conquest hath
          been the original of a constrained, but beneficence always the
          original of a voluntary and free subjection.991 Obedience to parents
          is founded upon their right, because they are instrumental in
          bestowing upon us being and life; and because this of life is so great
          a benefit, the law of nature never dissolves this obligation of
          obeying and honoring parents; it is as long‑lived as the law of
          nature, and hath an universal practice, by the strength of that law,
          in all parts of the world: and those rightful chains are not unlocked,
          but by that which unties the knot between soul and body: much more
          hath God a right to be obeyed and reverenced, who is the principal
          Benefactor, and moved all those second causes to impart to us, what
          conduced to our advantage. The just authority of God over us results
          from the superlativeness of his blessings he hath poured down upon us,
          which cannot be equalled, much less exceeded, by any other. As
          therefore upon this account he hath a claim to our choicest
          affections, so he hath also to most exact obedience; and neither one
          nor other can be denied him, without a sordid and disingenuous
          ingratitude; God therefore aggravates the rebellion of the Jews from
          the cares he had in the bringing them up (Isa. ii. 2), and the
          miraculous deliverance from Egypt (Jer. xi. 7, 8); implying that those
          benefits were strong obligations to an ingenuous observance of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] It is established upon this, that God can enjoin the observance
          of nothing but what is good. He may by the right of his sovereign
          dominion, command that which is indifferent in its own nature: as in
          positive laws, the not eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
          of good and evil, which had not been evil in itself, set aside the
          command of God to the contrary; and likewise in those ceremonial laws
          he gave the Jews: but in regard to the transcendent goodness and
          righteousness of his nature, he will not, he cannot command anything
          that is evil in itself, or repugnant to the true interest of his
          creature; and God never obliged the creature to anything but what was
          so free from damaging it, that it highly conduced to its good and
          welfare: and therefore it is said, that “his commands are not
          grievous” (1 John v. 3): not grievous in their own nature, nor
          grievous to one possessed with a true reason. The command given to
          Adam in Paradise was not grievous in itself, nor could he ever have
          thought it so, but upon a false supposition instilled into him by the
          tempter. There is a pleasure results from the law of God to a holy
          rational nature, a sweetness tasted both by the understanding and by
          the will, for they both “rejoice the heart and enlighten the eyes” of
          the mind (Ps. xix. 8). God being essentially wisdom and goodness,
          cannot deviate from that goodness in any orders he gives the creature;
          whatsoever he enacts must be agreeable to that rule, and therefore he
          can will nothing but what is good and excellent, and what is good for
          the creature; for since he hath put originally into man a natural
          instinct to desire that which is good, he would never enact any thing
          for the creature’s observance,992 that might control that desire
          imprinted by himself, but what might countenance that impression of
          his own hand; for if God did otherwise, he would contradict his own
          natural law, and be a deluder of his creatures, if he impressed upon
          them desires one way, and ordered directions another. The truth is,
          all his moral precepts are comely in themselves, and they receive not
          their goodness from God’s positive command, but that command supposeth
          their goodness; if everything were good because God loves it, or
          because God wills it, i. e. that God’s loving it or willing it made
          that good which was not good before, then, as Camero well argues
          somewhere, God’s goodness would depend upon his loving himself; he was
          good because he loved himself, and was not good till he loved himself;
          whereas, indeed, God’s loving himself, doth not make him good, but
          supposeth him good: he was good in the order of nature before he loved
          himself; and his being good was the ground of his loving himself,
          because, as was said before, if there were anything better than God,
          God would love that; for it is inconsistent with the nature of God and
          infinite goodness not to love that which is good, and not to love that
          supremely which is the supreme good. Further to understand it, you may
          consider, if the question be asked, why God loves himself? you would
          think it a reasonable answer to say, because he is good. But if the
          question be asked, why God is good? you would think that answer,
          because he loves himself, would be destitute of reason; but the true
          answer would be, because his nature is so, and he could not be God if
          he were not good: therefore God’s goodness is in order of our
          conception before his self‑love, and not his self‑love before his
          goodness; so the moral things God commands, are good in themselves
          before God commands them; and such, that if God should command the
          contrary, it would openly speak him evil and unrighteous. Abstract
          from Scripture, and weigh things in your own reason; could you
          conceive God good, if he should command a creature not to love him?
          could you preserve the notion of a good nature in him, if he did
          command murder, adultery, tyranny, and cutting of throats? You would
          wonder to what purpose he made the world, and framed it for society,
          if such things were ordered, that should deface all comeliness of
          society: the moral commands given in the word, appeared of themselves
          very beautiful to mere reason, that had no knowledge of the written
          law; they are good, and because they are so, his goodness had moved
          his sovereign authority strictly to enjoin them. Now this goodness,
          whereby he cannot oblige a creature to anything that is evil, speaks
          him highly worthy of our observance, and our disobedience to his law
          to be full of inconceivable malignity: that is the last thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second Use is of comfort. He is a good without mixture, good without
          weariness—none good but God, none good purely, none good
          inexhaustibly, but God; because he is good, we may, upon our speaking,
          expect his instruction; “Good is the Lord, therefore will he teach
          sinners in his way” (Ps. xxv. 8). His goodness makes him stoop to be
          the tutor to those worms that lie prostrate before him; and though
          they are sinners full of filth, he drives them not from his school,
          nor denies them his medicines, if they apply themselves to him as a
          physician. He is good in removing the punishment due to our crimes,
          and good in bestowing benefits not due to our merits; because he is
          good, penitent believers may expect forgiveness; “Thou, Lord, art
          good, and ready to forgive” (Ps. lxxxvi. 5). He acts not according to
          the rigor of the law, but willingly grants his pardon to those that
          fly into the arms of the Mediator; his goodness makes him more ready
          to forgive, than our necessities make us desirous to enjoy; he charged
          not upon Job his impatient expressions in cursing the day of his
          birth; his goodness passed that over in silence, and extols him for
          speaking the thing that is right, right in the main, when he charges
          his friends for not speaking of him the thing that is right, as his
          servant Job had done (Job xlii. 7). He is so good, that if we offer
          the least thing sincerely, he will graciously receive it; if we have
          not a lamb to offer, a pigeon or turtle shall be accepted upon his
          altar; he stands not upon costly presents, but sincerely tendered
          services. All conditions are sweetened by it; whatsoever any in the
          world enjoy, is from a redundancy of this goodness; but whatsoever a
          good man enjoys, is from a propriety in this goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Here is comfort in our addresses to him. If he be a fountain and
          sea of goodness, he cannot be weary of doing good, no more than a
          fountain or sea are of flowing. All goodness delights to communicate
          itself; infinite goodness hath then an infinite delight in expressing
          itself; it is a part of his goodness not to be weary of showing it; he
          can never, then, be weary of being solicited for the effusions of it;
          if he rejoices over his people to do them good, he will rejoice in any
          opportunities offered to him to honor his goodness, and gladly meet
          with a fit subject for it; he therefore delights in prayer. Never can
          we so delight in addressing, as he doth in imparting; he delights more
          in our prayers than we can ourselves; goodness is not pleased with
          shyness. To what purpose did his immense bounty bestow his Son upon
          us, but that we should be “accepted” both in our persons and petitions
          (Eph. i. 6)? “His eyes are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
          to their cry” (Ps. xxxiv. 15); he fixes the eye of his goodness upon
          them, and opens the ears of his goodness for them; he is pleased to
          behold them, and pleased to listen to them, as if he had no pleasure
          in anything else; he loves to be sought to, to give a vent to his
          bounty; “Acquaint thyself with God, and thereby good shall come unto
          thee” (Job xxii. 21). The word signifies, to accustom ourselves to
          God; the more we accustom ourselves in speaking, the more he will
          accustom himself in giving; he loves not to keep his goodness close
          under lock and key, as men do their treasures. If we knock, he opens
          his exchequer (Matt. vii. 7); his goodness is as flexible to our
          importunities, as his power is invincible by the arm of a silly worm;
          he thinks his liberality honored by being applied to, and your address
          to be a recompense for his expense. There is no reason to fear, since
          he hath so kindly invited us, but he will as heartily welcome us; the
          nature of goodness is to compassionate and communicate, to pity and
          relieve, and that with a heartiness and cheerfulness; man is weary of
          being often solicited, because he hath a finite, not a bottomless,
          goodness: he gives sometimes to be rid of his suppliant, not to
          encourage him to a second approach. But every experience God gives us
          of his bounty, is a motive to solicit him afresh, and a kind of
          obligation he hath laid upon himself to “renew it” (1 Sam. xvii. 37):
          it is one part of his goodness that it is boundless and bottomless; we
          need not fear the wasting of it, nor any weariness in him to bestow
          it. The stock cannot be spent, and infinite kindness can never become
          niggardly; when we have enjoyed it, there is still an infinite ocean
          in Him to refresh us, and as full streams as ever to supply us. What
          an encouragement have we to draw near to God! We run in our straits to
          those that we think have most good will, as well as power to relieve
          and protect us. The oftener we come to him, and the nearer we approach
          to him, the more of his influences we shall feel: as the nearer the
          sun, the more of its heat insinuates itself into us. The greatness of
          God, joined with his goodness, hath more reason to encourage our
          approach to him, than our flight from him, because his greatness never
          goes unattended with his goodness; and if we were not so good, he
          would not be so great in the apprehensions of any creature. How may
          his goodness, in the great gift of his Son, encourage us to apply to
          him: since he hath set him as a day’s‑man between himself and us, and
          appointed him an Advocate to present our requests for us, and speed
          them at the throne of grace; and he never leaves till Divine goodness
          subscribes a fiat to our believing and just petitions!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Here is comfort in afflictions. What can we fear from the conduct
          of Infinite Goodness? Can his hand be heavy upon those that are humble
          before him? They are the hands of Infinite Power indeed, but there is
          not any motion of it upon his people, but is ordered by a goodness as
          infinite as his power, which will not suffer any affliction to be too
          sharp or too long. By what ways soever he conveys grace to us here,
          and prepares us for glory hereafter, they are good, and those are the
          good things he hath chiefly obliged himself to give (Ps. lxxxiv. 11):
          “Grace and glory” will he “give, and no good thing will he withhold
          from them that walk uprightly.” This David comforted himself with, in
          that which his devout soul accounted the greatest calamity, his
          absence from the courts and house of God (ver. 2). Not an ill will,
          but a good will, directs his scourges; he is not an idle spectator of
          our combats; his thoughts are fuller of kindness than ours, in any
          case, can be of trouble: and because he is good, he wills the best
          good in everything he acts; in exercising virtue, or correcting vice.
          There is no affliction without some apparent mixtures of goodness;
          when he speaks how he had smitten Israel (Jer. ii. 30), he presently
          adds (ver. 31), “Have I been a wilderness to Israel, a land of
          darkness?” Though he led them through a desert, yet he was not a
          desert to them; he was no land of darkness to them; while they marched
          through a land of barrenness, he was a caterer to provide them
          “manna,” and a place of “broad rivers” and streams. How often hath
          Divine goodness made our afflictions our consolations; our diseases,
          our medicines, and his gentle strokes, reviving cordials! How doth he
          provide for us above our deserts, even while he doth punish us beneath
          our merits! Divine goodness can no more mean ill, than Divine wisdom
          can be mistaken in its end, or Divine power overruled in its actions.
          “Charity thinks no evil” (1 Cor. xiii. 5); charity in the stream doth
          not, much less doth charity in the fountain. To be afflicted by a hand
          of goodness hath something comfortable in it, when to be afflicted by
          an evil hand is very odious. Elijah, who was loth to die by the hand
          of a whorish idolatrous Jezebel, was very desirous to die by the hand
          of God (1 Kings, xix. 2‒4). He accounted it a misery to have died by
          her hand, who hated him, and had nothing but cruelty; and, therefore,
          fled from her, when he wished for death, as a desirable thing by the
          hand of that God who had been good to him, and could not but be good
          in whatsoever he acted.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third comfort flowing from this doctrine of the goodness of
          God, is, it is a ground of assurance of happiness. If God be so good,
          that nothing is better, and loves himself, as he is good, he cannot be
          wanting in love to those that resemble his nature, and imitate his
          goodness: he cannot but love his own image of goodness; wherever he
          finds it, he cannot but be bountiful to it; for it is impossible there
          can be any love to any object, without wishing well to it, and doing
          well for it. If the soul loves God as its chiefest good, God will love
          the soul as his pious servant: as he hath offered to them the highest
          allurements, so he will not withhold the choicest communications.
          Goodness cannot be a deluding thing; it cannot consist with the
          nobleness and largeness of this perfection to invite the creature to
          him, and leave the creature empty of him when it comes. It is
          inconsistent with this perfection to give the creature a knowledge of
          himself, and a desire of enjoyment larger than that knowledge; a
          desire to know, and enjoy him perpetually, yet never intend to bestow
          an eternal communication of himself upon it. The nature of man was
          erected by the goodness of God, but with an enlarged desire for the
          highest good, and a capacity of enjoying it. Can goodness be thought
          to be deceitful, to frustrate its own work, be tired with its own
          effusions, to let a gracious soul groan under its burden, and never
          resolve to ease him of it; to see delightfully the aspirings of the
          creature to another state, and resolve never to admit him to a happy
          issue of those desires? It is not agreeable to this inconceivable
          perfection to be unconcerned in the longings of his creature, since
          their first longings were placed in them by that goodness which is so
          free from mocking the creature, or falling short of its well‑grounded
          expectations or desires, that it infinitely exceeds them. If man had
          continued in innocence, the goodness of God, without question, would
          have continued him in happiness: and, since he hath had so much
          goodness to restore man, would it not be dishonorable to that goodness
          to break his own conditions, and defeat the believing creature of
          happiness, after it hath complied with his terms? He is a believer’s
          God in covenant, and is a God in the utmost extent of this attribute,
          as well as of any other; and, therefore, will not communicate mean and
          shallow benefits, but according to the grandeur of it, sovereign and
          divine, such as the gift of a happy immortality. Since he had no
          obligation upon him, to make any promise, but the sweetness of his own
          nature, the same is as strong upon him to make all the words of his
          grace good; they cannot be invalid in any one tittle of them as long
          as his nature remains the same; and his goodness cannot be diminished
          without the impairing of his Godhead, since it is inseparable from it.
          Divine goodness will not let any man serve God for nought; he hath
          promised our weak obedience more than any man in his right wits can
          say it merits (Matt. x. 42): “A cup of cold water shall not lose its
          reward.” He will manifest our good actions as he gave so high a
          testimony to Job, in the face of the devil, his accuser: it will not
          only be the happiness of the soul, but of the body, the whole man,
          since soul and body were in conjunction in the acts of righteousness;
          it consists not with the goodness of God to reward the one, and to let
          the other lie in the ruins of its first nothing: to bestow joy upon
          the one for its being principal, and leave the other without any
          sentiments of joy, that was instrumental in those good works, both
          commanded and approved by God: he that had the goodness to pity our
          original dust, will not want a goodness to advance it: and if we put
          off our bodies, it is but afterwards to put them on repaired and
          fresher. From this goodness, the upright may expect all the happiness
          their nature is capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is a ground of comfort in the midst of public dangers. This hath
          more sweetness in it to support us, than the malice of enemies hath to
          deject us; because he is “good,” he is “a stronghold in the day of
          trouble” (Nah. i. 7). If his goodness extends to all his creatures, it
          will much more extend to those that honor him: if the earth be full of
          his goodness, that part of heaven which he hath upon earth shall not
          be empty of it. He hath a goodness often to deliver the righteous, and
          a justice to put the wicked in his stead (Prov. xi. 8). When his
          people have been under the power of their enemies, he hath changed the
          scene, and put the enemies under the power of his people: he hath
          clapped upon them the same bolts which they did upon his servants. How
          comfortable is this goodness that hath yet maintained us in the midst
          of dangers, preserved us in the mouth of lions, quenched kindled fire;
          hitherto rescued us from designed ruin subtilly hatched, and supported
          us in the midst of men very passionate for our destruction; how hath
          this watchful goodness been a sanctuary to us in the midst of an upper
          hell!
        </p>
        <p>Third Use is of exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          1. How should we endeavor after the enjoyment of God as good! How
          earnestly should we desire him! As there is no other goodness worthy
          of our supreme love, so there is no other goodness worthy our most
          ardent thirst. Nothing deserves the name of a desirable good, but as
          it tends to the attainment of this: here we must pitch our desires,
          which otherwise will terminate in nullities or inconceivable
          disturbances.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Consider, nothing but good can be the object of a rational
          appetite. The will cannot direct its motion to anything under the
          notion of evil, evil in itself, or evil to it; whatsoever courts it
          must present itself in the quality of a good in its own nature, or in
          its present circumstances to the present state and condition of the
          desire; it will not else touch or affect the will. This is the
          language of that faculty: “Who will show me any good?” (Ps. iv. 6),
          and good is as inseparably the object of the will’s motion, as truth
          is of the understanding’s inquiry. Whatsoever a man would allure
          another to comply with, he must propose to the person under the notion
          of some beneficialness to him in point of honor, profit, or pleasure.
          To act after this manner is the proper character of a rational
          creature; and though that which is evil is often embraced instead of
          that which is good, and what we entertain as conducing to our felicity
          proves our misfortune, yet that is from our ignorance, and not from a
          formal choice of it as evil; for what evil is chosen it is not
          possible to choose under the conception of evil, but under the
          appearance of a good, though it be not so in reality. It is
          inseparable from the wills of all men to propose to themselves that
          which in the opinion and judgment of their understandings or
          imagination is good, though they often mistake and cheat themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Since that good is the object of a rational appetite, the purest,
          best, and most universal good, such as God is, ought to be most sought
          after. Since good only is the object of a rational appetite, all the
          motions of our souls should be carried to the first and best good: a
          real good is most desirable; the greatest excellency of the creatures
          cannot speak them so, since, by the corruption of man, they are
          “subjected to vanity” (Rom. viii. 20). God is the most excellent good
          without any shadow; a real something without that nothing which every
          creature hath in its nature (Isa. xl. 17). A perfect good can only
          give us content: the best goodness in the creature is but slender and
          imperfect; had not the venom of corruption infused a vanity into it,
          the make of it speaks it finite, and the best qualities in it are
          bounded, and cannot give satisfaction to a rational appetite which
          bears in its nature an imitation of Divine infiniteness, and therefore
          can never find an eternal rest in mean trifles. God is above the
          imperfection of all creatures; creatures are but drops of goodness, at
          best but shallow streams; God is like a teeming ocean, that can fill
          the largest as well as the narrowest creek. He hath an accumulative
          goodness; several creatures answer several necessities, but one God
          can answer all our wants: he hath an universal fulness, to overtop our
          universal emptiness: he contains in himself the sweetness of all other
          goods, and holds in his bosom plentifully what creatures have in their
          natures sparingly. Creatures are uncertain goods; as they begin to
          exist, so they may cease to be; they may be gone with a breath, they
          will certainly languish if God blows upon them (Isa. xl. 24): the same
          breath that raised them can blast them; but who can rifle God of the
          least part of his excellency? Mutability is inherent in the nature of
          every creature, as a creature. All sublunary things are as gourds,
          that refresh us one moment with their presence, and the next fret us
          with their absence; like fading flowers, strutting to‑day, and
          drooping to‑morrow (Isa. xl. 6): while we possess them, we cannot clip
          their wings, that may carry them away from us, and may make us vainly
          seek what we thought we firmly held. But God is as permanent a good as
          he is a real one: he hath wings to fly to them that seek him, but no
          wings to fly from them forever, and leave them. God is an universal
          good; that which is good to one may be evil to another; what is
          desirable by one maybe refused as inconvenient for another: but God
          being an universal, unstained good, is useful for all, convenient to
          the natures of all but such as will continue in enmity against him.
          There is nothing in God can displease a soul that desires to please
          him; when we are in darkness, he is a light to scatter it; when we are
          in want, he hath riches to relieve us; when we are in spiritual death,
          he is a Prince of life to deliver us; when we are defiled, he is
          holiness to purify us: it is in vain to fix our hearts anywhere but on
          him, in the desire of whom there is a delight, and in the enjoyment of
          whom there is an inconceivable pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) He is most to be sought after, since all things else that are
          desirable had their goodness from him. If anything be desirable
          because of its goodness, God is much more desirable because of his,
          since all things are good by a participation, and nothing good but by
          his print upon it: as what being creatures have was derived to them by
          God, so what goodness they are possessed with they were furnished with
          it by God; all goodness flowed from him, and all created goodness is
          summed up in him. The streams should not terminate our appetite
          without aspiring to the fountain. If the waters in the channel, which
          receive mixture, communicate a pleasure, the taste of the fountain
          must be much more delicious; that original Perfection of all things
          hath an inconceivable beauty above those things it hath framed. Since
          those things live not by their own strength, nor nourish us by their
          own liberality, but by the “word of God” (Matt. iv. 4), that God that
          speaks them into life, and speaks them into usefulness, should be most
          ardently desired as the best. If the sparkling glory of the visible
          heavens delight us, and the beauty and bounty of the earth please and
          refresh us, what should be the language of our souls upon those views
          and tastes but that of the Psalmist, “Whom have I in heaven but thee?
          and there is none upon earth that I can desire beside thee” (Ps.
          lxxiii. 25). No greater good can possibly be desired, and no less good
          should be ardently desired. As he is the supreme good, so we should
          bear that regard to him as supremely, and above all, to thirst for
          him: as he is good, he is the object of desire; as the choicest and
          first goodness, he is desirable with the greatest vehemency. “Give me
          children, or else I die” (Gen. xxx. 1), was an uncomely speech; the
          one was granted, and the other inflicted; she had children, but the
          last cost her her life: but, Give me God, or I will not be content, is
          a gracious speech, wherein we cannot miscarry; all that God demands of
          us is, that we should long for him, and look for our happiness only in
          him. That is the first thing, endeavor after the enjoyment of God as
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Often meditate on the goodness of God. What was man produced for,
          but to settle his thoughts upon this? What should have been Adam’s
          employment in innocence, but to read over all the lines of nature, and
          fix his contemplations on that good hand that drew them? What is man
          endued with reason for, above all other animals, but to take notice of
          this goodness spread over all the creatures, which they themselves,
          though they felt it, could not have such a sense of as to make
          answerable returns to their Benefactor? Can we satisfy ourselves in
          being spectators of it, and enjoyers of it, only in such a manner as
          the brutes are? The beasts behold things as well as we, they feel the
          warm beams of this goodness as well as we, but without any reflection
          upon the Author of them. Shall Divine blessings meet with no more from
          us but a brutish view and beholding of them? What is more just, than
          to spend a thought upon Him who hath enlarged his hand in so many
          benefits to us? Are we indebted to any more than we are to him? Why
          should we send our souls to visit anything more than him in his works?
          That we are able to meditate on him is a part of his goodness to us,
          who hath bestowed that capacity upon us; and, if we will not, it is a
          great part of our ingratitude. Can anything more delightful enter into
          us, than that of the kind and gracious disposition of that God who
          first brought us out of the abyss of an unhappy nothing, and hath
          hitherto spread his wings over us? Where can we meet with a nobler
          object than Divine goodness? and what nobler work can be practised by
          us than to consider it? What is more sensible in all the operations of
          his hands than his skill, as they are considered in themselves, and
          his goodness, as they are considered in relation to us? It is strange
          that we should miss the thoughts of it; that we should look upon this
          earth, and everything in it, and yet overlook that which it is most
          full of, viz. Divine goodness (Ps. xxxiii. 5); it runs through the
          whole web of the world; all is framed and diversified by goodness; it
          is one entire single goodness, which appears in various garbs and
          dresses in every part of the creation. Can we turn our eyes inward,
          and send our eyes outward, and see nothing of a Divinity in both
          worthy of our deepest and seriousest thoughts? Is there anything in
          the world we can behold, but we see his bounty, since nothing was made
          but is one way or other beneficial to us? Can we think of our daily
          food, but we must have some reflecting thoughts on our great Caterer?
          Can the sweetness of the creature to our palate obscure the sweetness
          of the Provider to our minds? It is strange that we should be
          regardless of that wherein every creature without us, and every sense
          within us and about us, is a tutor to instruct us! Is it not reason we
          should think of the times wherein we were nothing, and from thence run
          back to a never‑begun eternity, and view ourselves in the thoughts of
          that goodness, to be in time brought forth upon this stage, as we are
          at present? Can we consider but one act of our understandings, but one
          thought, one blossom, one spark of our souls mounting upwards, and not
          reflect upon the goodness of God to us, who, in that faculty that
          sparkles out rational thoughts, has advanced us to a nobler state, and
          endued us with a nobler principle, than all the creatures we see on
          earth, except those of our own rank and kind? Can we consider but one
          foolish thought, one sinful act, and reflect upon the guilt and filth
          of it, and not behold goodness in sparing us, and miracles of goodness
          in sending his Son to die for us, for the expiation of it? This
          perfection cannot well be out of our thoughts, or at least it is
          horrible it should, when it is writ in every line of the creation, and
          in a legible rubric, in bloody letters, in the cross of his Son. Let
          us think with ourselves, how often he hath multiplied his blessings,
          when we did deserve his wrath! how he hath sent one unexpected benefit
          upon the heel of another, to bring us with a swift pace the tidings of
          good‑will to us! how often hath he delivered us from a disease that
          had the arrows of death in its hand ready to pierce us! how often hath
          he turned our fears into joys, and our distempers into promoters of
          our felicity! how often hath he mated a temptation, sent seasonable
          supplies in the midst of a sore distress, and prevented many dangers
          which we could not be so sensible of, because we were, in a great
          measure, ignorant of them! How should we meditate upon his goodness to
          our souls, in preventing some sins, in pardoning others, in darting
          upon us the knowledge of his gospel, and of himself, in the face of
          his Son Christ! This seems to stick much upon the spirit of Paul,
          since he doth so often sprinkle his epistles with the titles of the
          “grace of God, riches of grace, unsearchable riches of God, riches of
          glory,” and cannot satisfy himself, with the extolling of it.
          Certainly, we should bear upon our heart a deep and quick sense of
          this perfection; as it was the design of God to manifest it, so it
          would be acceptable to God for us to have a sense of it: a dull
          receiver of his blessings is no less nauseous to him than a dull
          dispenser of his alms; he loves a “cheerful giver” (2 Cor. ix. 7); he
          doth himself what he loves in others; he is cheerful in giving, and he
          loves we should be serious in thinking of him, and have a right
          apprehension and sense of his goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) A right sense of his goodness would dispose us to an ingenuous
          worship of God. It would damp our averseness to any act of religion;
          what made David so resolute and ready to “worship towards his holy
          temple” but the sense of his “loving kindness?” (Ps. cxxxviii. 2).
          This would render him always in our mind a worthy object of our
          devotion, a stable prop of our confidence. We should then adore him,
          when we consider him as “our God,” and ourselves as “the people of his
          pasture, and the sheep of his hand” (Ps. xcv. 7): we should send up
          prayers with strong faith and feeling, and praises with great joy and
          pleasure. The sense of his goodness would make us love him, and our
          love to him would quicken our adoration of him; but if we regard not
          this, we shall have no mind to think of him, no mind to act anything
          towards him; we may tremble at his presence, but not heartily worship
          him; we shall rather look upon him as a tyrant, and think no other
          affection due to him than what we reserve for an oppressor, viz.
          hatred and ill‑will.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) A sense of it will keep us humble. A sense of it would effect
          that for which itself was intended; viz. bring us to a repentance for
          our crimes, and not suffer us to harden ourselves against him. When we
          should deeply consider how he hath made the sun to shine upon us, and
          his rain to fall upon the earth for our support; the one to supple the
          earth, and the other to assist the juice of it to bring forth fruits;
          how would it reflect upon us our ill requitals, and make us hang down
          our heads before him in a low posture, pleasing to him, and
          advantageous to ourselves! What would the first charge be upon
          ourselves, but what Moses brings in his expostulation against the
          Israelites (Deut. xxxii. 6): “Do I thus requite the Lord?” What is
          this goodness for me, who am so much below him; for me, who have so
          much incensed him; for me, who have so much abused what he hath
          allowed? It would bring to remembrance the horror of our crimes, and
          set us a blushing before him, when we should consider the multitude of
          his benefits, and our unworthy behaviour, that hath not constrained
          him even against the inclination of his goodness, to punish us: how
          little should we plead for a further liberty in sin, or palliate our
          former faults! When we set Divine goodness in one column, and our
          transgressions in another, and compare together their several items,
          it would fill us with a deep consciousness of our own guilt, and
          divest us of any worth of our own in our approaches to him; it would
          humble us, that we cannot love so obliging a God as much as he
          deserves to be loved by us; it would make us humble before men. Who
          would be proud of a mere gift which he knows he hath not merited? How
          ridiculous would that servant be, that should be proud of a rich
          livery, which is a badge of his service, not a token of his merit, but
          of his master’s magnificence and bounty, which, though he wear this
          day, he may be stripped of to‑morrow, and be turned out of his
          master’s family!
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) A sense of the Divine goodness would make us faithful to him. The
          goodness of God obligeth us to serve him, not to offend him; the
          freeness of his goodness should make us more ready to contribute to
          the advancement of his glory. When we consider the benefits of a
          friend proceed out of kindness to us, and not out of self ends and
          vain applause, it works more upon us, and makes us more careful of the
          honor of such a person. It is a pure bounty God hath manifested in
          creation and providence, which could not be for himself, who, being
          blessed forever, wanted nothing from us: it was not to draw a profit
          from us, but to impart an advantage to us; “Our goodness extends not
          to him” (Ps. xvi. 2). The service of the benefactor is but a rational
          return for benefits; whence Nehemiah aggravates the sins of the Jews
          (Neh. ix. 35): “They have not served thee in thy great goodness that
          thou gavest them;” i. e. which thou didst freely bestow upon them. How
          should we dare to spend upon our lusts that which we possess, if we
          considered by whose liberality we came by it? how should we dare to be
          unfaithful in the goods he hath made us trustees of? A deep sense of
          Divine goodness will ennoble the creature, and make it act for the
          most glorious and noble end; it would strike Satan’s temptation dead
          at a blow; it would pull off the false mask and vizor from what he
          presents to us, to draw us from the service of our Benefactor; we
          could not, with a sense of this, think him kinder to us than God hath,
          and will be, which is the great motive of men to join hands with him,
          and turn their backs upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) A sense of the Divine goodness would make us patient under our
          miseries. A deep sense of this would make us give God the honor of his
          goodness in whatsoever he doth, though the reason of his actions be
          not apparent to us, nor the event and issue of his proceedings
          foreseen by us. It is a stated case, that goodness can never intend
          ill, but designs good in all its acts “to them that love God” (Rom.
          viii. 28): nay, he always designs the best; when he bestows anything
          upon his people, he sees it best they should have it; and when he
          removes anything from them, he sees it best they should lose it. When
          we have lost a thing we loved, and refuse to be comforted, a sense of
          this perfection, which acts God in all, would keep us from misjudging
          our sufferings, and measuring the intention of the hand that sent
          them, by the sharpness of what we feel. What patient, fully persuaded
          of the affection of the physician, would not value him, though that
          which is given to purge out the humors, racks his bowels? When we lose
          what we love, perhaps it was some outward lustre tickled our
          apprehensions, and we did not see the viper we would have harmed
          ourselves by; but God seeing it, snatched it from us, and we mutter as
          if he had been cruel, and deprived us of the good we imagined, when he
          was kind to us, and freed us from the hurt we should certainly have
          felt. We should regard that which in goodness he takes from us, at no
          other rate than some gilded poison and lurking venom; the sufferings
          of men, though upon high provocations, are often followed with rich
          mercies, and many times are intended as preparations for greater
          goodness. When God utters that rhetoric of his bowels, “How shall I
          give thee up, O Ephraim, I will not execute the fierceness of my
          anger!” (Hos. xi. 8), he intended them mercy in their captivity, and
          would prepare them by it, to walk after the Lord. And it is likely the
          posterity of those ten tribes were the first that ran to God, upon the
          publishing the gospel in the places where they lived; he doth not take
          away himself when he takes away outward comforts; while he snatcheth
          away the rattles we play with, he hath a breast in himself for us to
          suck. The consideration of his goodness would dispose us to a composed
          frame of spirit. If we are sick, it is goodness, it is a disease, and
          not a hell. It is goodness, that it is a cloud, and not a total
          darkness. What if he transfers from us what we have? he takes no more
          than what his goodness first imparted to us; and never takes so much
          from his people as his goodness leaves them: if he strips them of
          their lives, he leaves them their souls, with those faculties he
          furnished them with at first, and removes them from those houses of
          clay to a richer mansion. The time of our sufferings here, were it the
          whole course of our life, bears not the proportion of a moment to that
          endless eternity wherein he hath designed to manifest his goodness to
          us. The consideration of Divine goodness would teach us to draw a calm
          even from storms, and distil balsam from rods. If the reproofs of the
          righteous be an excellent oil (Ps. cxlv. 5), we should not think the
          corrections of a good God to have a less virtue.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) A sense of the Divine goodness would mount us above the world. It
          would damp our appetites after meaner things; we should look upon the
          world not as a God, but a gift from God, and never think the present
          better than the Donor. We should never lie soaking in muddy puddles
          were we always filled with a sense of the richness and clearness of
          this Fountain, wherein we might bathe ourselves; little petty
          particles of good would give us no content, when we were sensible of
          such an unbounded ocean. Infinite goodness, rightly apprehended, would
          dull our desires after other things, and sharpen them with a keener
          edge after that which is best of all. How earnestly do we long for the
          presence of a friend, of whose good will towards us we have full
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) It would check any motions of envy: it would make us joy in the
          prosperity of good men, and hinder us from envying the outward
          felicity of the wicked. We should not dare with an evil eye to censure
          his good hand (Matt. xx. 15), but approve of what he thinks fit to do,
          both in the matter of his liberality and the subjects he chooseth for
          it. Though if the disposal were in our hands, we should not imitate
          him, as not thinking them subjects fit for our bounty; yet since it is
          in his hands, we be to approve of his actions and not have an ill will
          towards him for his goodness, or towards those he is pleased to make
          the subject of it. Since all his doles are given to “invite man to
          repentance” (Rom. ii. 4), to envy them those goods God hath bestowed
          upon them, is to envy God the glory of his own goodness, and them the
          felicity those things might move them to aspire to; it is to wish God
          more contracted, and thy neighbor more miserable: but a deep sense of
          his sovereign goodness would make us rejoice in any marks of it upon
          others, and move us to bless him instead of censuring him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7.) It would make us thankful. What can be the most proper, the most
          natural reflection, when we behold the most magnificent characters he
          hath imprinted upon our souls; the conveniency of the members he hath
          compacted in our bodies, but a praise of him? Such motion had David
          upon the first consideration: “I will praise thee, for I am fearfully
          and wonderfully made” (Ps. cxxxix. 14). What could be the most natural
          reflection, when we behold the rich prerogatives of our natures above
          other creatures, the provision he hath made for us for our delight in
          the beauties of heaven, for our support in the creatures on earth?
          What can reasonably be expected from uncorrupted man, to be the first
          motion of his soul, but an extolling the bountiful hand of the
          invisible donor, whoever he be? This would make us venture at some
          endeavors of a grateful acknowledgment, though we should despair of
          rendering anything proportionable to the greatness of the benefit; and
          such an acknowledgment of our own weakness would be an acceptable part
          of our gratitude. Without a due and deep sense of Divine goodness, our
          praise of it, and thankfulness for it, will be but cold, formal, and
          customary; our tongues may bless him, and our heart slight him: and
          this will lead us to the third exhortation:
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Which is that of thankfulness for Divine goodness. The absolute
          goodness of God, as it is the excellency of his nature, is the object
          of praise: the relative goodness of God, as he is our benefactor, is
          the object of thankfulness. This was always a debt due from man to
          God; he had obligations in the time of his integrity, and was then to
          render it; he is not less, but more obliged to it in the state of
          corruption; the benefits being the greater, by how much the more
          unworthy he is of them by reason of his revolt. The bounty bestowed
          upon an enemy that merits the contrary, ought to be received with a
          greater resentment than that bestowed on a friend, who is not unworthy
          of testimonies of respect. Gratitude to God is the duty of every
          creature that hath a sense of itself; the more excellent being any
          enjoy the more devout ought to be the acknowledgment. How often doth
          David stir up, not only himself, but summon all creatures, even the
          insensible ones, to join in the concert! He calls to the “deeps, fire,
          hail, snow, mountains and hills,” to bear a part in this work of
          praise (Ps. cxlviii.); not that they are able to do it actively, but
          to show that man is to call in the whole creation to assist him
          passively, and should have so much charity to all creatures, as to
          receive what they offer, and so much affection to God, as to present
          to him what he receives from him. Snow and hail cannot bless and
          praise God, but man ought to praise God for those things wherein there
          is a mixture of trouble and inconvenience, something to molest our
          sense, as well as something that improves the earth for fruit. This
          God requires of us: for this he instituted several offerings, and
          required a little portion of fruits to be presented to him, as an
          acknowledgment they held the whole from his bounty. And the end of the
          festival days among the Jews was to revive the memory of those signal
          acts wherein his power for them, and his goodness to them, had been
          extraordinarily evident; it is no more but our mouths to praise him,
          and our hand to obey him, that he exacts at our hands. He commands us
          not to expend what he allows us in the erecting stately temples to his
          honor; all the coin he requires to be paid with for his expense is the
          “offering of thanksgiving” (Ps. l. 14): and this we ought to do as
          much as we can, since we cannot do it as much as he merits, for “who
          can show forth all his praise?” (Ps. cvi. 2.) If we have the fruit of
          his goodness, it is fit he should have the “fruit of our lips” (Heb.
          xiii. 15): the least kindness should inflame our souls with a kindly
          resentment. Though some of his benefits have a brighter, some a
          darker, aspect towards us, yet they all come from this common spring;
          his goodness shines in all; there are the footsteps of goodness in the
          least, as well as the smiles of goodness in the greatest; the meanest
          therefore is not to pass without a regard of the Author. As the glory
          of God is more illustrious in some creatures than in others, yet it
          glitters in all, and the lowest as well as the highest administers
          matter of praise; but they are not only little things, but the choicer
          favors he has bestowed upon us. How much doth it deserve our
          acknowledgment, that he should contrive our recovery, when we had
          plotted our ruin! that when he did from eternity behold the crimes
          wherewith we would incense him, he should not, according to the rights
          of justice, cast us into hell, but prize us at the rate of the blood
          and life of his only Son, in value above the blood of men and lives of
          angels! How should we bless that God, that we have yet a gospel among
          us, that we are not driven into the utmost regions, that we can attend
          upon him in the face of the sun, and not forced to the secret
          obscurities of the night! Whatsoever we enjoy, whatsoever we receive,
          we must own him as the Donor, and read his hand in it. Rob him not of
          any praise to give to an instrument. No man hath wherewithal to do us
          good, nor a heart to do us good, nor opportunities of benefitting us
          without him. When the cripple received the soundness of his limbs from
          Peter, he praised the hand that sent it, not the hand that brought it
          (Acts iii. 6): he “praised God” (ver. 8). When we want anything that
          is good, let the goodness of Divine nature move us to David’s
          practice, to “thirst after God” (Ps. xlii. 1): and when we feel the
          motions of his goodness to us, let us imitate the temper of the same
          holy man (Ps. ciii. 2): “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all
          his benefits.” It is an unworthy carriage to deal with him as a
          traveller doth with a fountain, kneel down to drink of it when he is
          thirsty, and turn his back upon it, and perhaps never think of it more
          after he is satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And, lastly, Imitate this goodness of God. If his goodness hath
          such an influence upon us as to make us love him, it will also move us
          with an ardent zeal to imitate him in it. Christ makes this use from
          the doctrine of Divine goodness (Matt. v. 44, 45): “Do good to them
          that hate you, that you may be the children of your Father which is in
          heaven; for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.” As
          holiness is a resemblance of God’s purity, so charity is a resemblance
          of God’s goodness; and this our Saviour calls perfection (ver. 48):
          “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father, which is in heaven, is
          perfect.” As God would not be a perfect God without goodness, so
          neither can any be a perfect Christian without kindness; charity and
          love being the splendor and loveliness of all Christian graces, as
          goodness is the splendor and loveliness of all Divine attributes. This
          and holiness are ordered in the Scripture to be the grand patterns of
          our imitation. Imitate the goodness of God in two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) In relieving and assisting others in distress. Let our heart be
          as large in the capacity of creatures, as God’s is in the capacity of
          a Creator. A large heart from him to us, and a strait heart from us to
          others, will not suit: let us not think any so far below us as to be
          unworthy of our care, since God thinks none that are infinitely
          distant from him too mean for his. His infinite glory mounts him above
          the creature, but his infinite goodness stoops him to the meanest
          works of his hands. As he lets not the transgressions of prosperity
          pass without punishment, so he lets not the distress of his afflicted
          people pass him without support. Shall God provide for the ease of
          beasts, and shall not we have some tenderness towards those that are
          of the same blood with ourselves, and have as good blood to boast of
          as runs in the veins of the mightiest monarch on earth; and as mean,
          and as little as they are, can lay claim to as ancient a pedigree as
          the stateliest prince in the world, who cannot ascend to ancestors
          beyond Adam? Shall we glut ourselves with Divine beneficence to us,
          and wear his livery only on our own backs, forgetting the afflictions
          of some dear Joseph; when God, who hath an unblemished felicity in his
          own nature, looks out of himself to view and relieve the miseries of
          poor creatures? Why hath God increased the doles of his treasures to
          some more than others? Was it merely for themselves, or rather that
          they might have a bottom to attain the honor of imitating him? Shall
          we embezzle his goods to our own use, as if we were absolute
          proprietors, and not stewards entrusted for others? Shall we make a
          difficulty to part with something to others, out of that abundance he
          hath bestowed upon any of us? Did not his goodness strip his Son of
          the glory of heaven for a time to enrich us? and shall we shrug when
          we are to part with a little to pleasure him? It is not very becoming
          for any to be backward in supplying the necessities of others with a
          few morsels, who have had the happiness to have had their greatest
          necessities supplied with his Son’s blood. He demands not that we
          should strip ourselves of all for others, but of a pittance, something
          of superfluity, which will turn more to our account than what is
          vainly and unprofitably consumed on our backs and bellies. If he hath
          given much to any of us, it is rather to lay aside part of the income
          for his service; else we would monopolize Divine goodness to
          ourselves, and seem to distrust under our present experiments his
          future kindness, as though the last thing he gave us was attended with
          this language, Hoard up this, and expect no more from me; use it only
          to the glutting your avarice, and feeding your ambition: which would
          be against the whole scope of Divine goodness. If we do not endeavor
          to write after the comely copy he hath set us, we may provoke him to
          harden himself against us, and in wrath bestow that on the fire, or on
          our enemies, which his goodness hath imparted to us for his glory, and
          the supplying the necessities of poor creatures. And, on the contrary,
          he is so delighted with this kind of imitation of him, that a cup of
          cold water, when there is no more to be done, shall not be unrewarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Imitate God in his goodness, in a kindness to our worst enemies.
          The best man is more unworthy to receive anything from God than the
          worst can be to receive from us. How kind is God to those that
          blaspheme him, and gives them the same sun, and the same showers, that
          he doth to the best men in the world! Is it not more our glory to
          imitate God in “doing good to those that hate us,” than to imitate the
          men of the world in requiting evil, by a return of a sevenfold
          mischief? This would be a goodness which would vanquish the hearts of
          men, and render us greater than Alexanders and Cæsars, who did only
          triumph over miserable carcasses; yea, it is to triumph over ourselves
          in being good against the sentiments of corrupt nature. Revenge makes
          us slaves to our passions, as much as the offenders, and good returns
          render us victorious over our adversaries (Rom. xii. 21): “Be not
          overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” When we took up our
          arms against God, his goodness contrived not our ruin, but our
          recovery. This is such a goodness of God as could not be discovered in
          an innocent state; while man had continued in his duty, he could not
          have been guilty of an enmity; and God could not but affect him,
          unless he had denied himself: so this of being good to our enemies
          could never have been practised in a state of rectitude; since, where
          was a perfect innocence, there could be no spark of enmity to one
          another. It can be no disparagement to any man’s dignity to cast his
          influences on his greatest opposers, since God, who acts for his own
          glory, thinks not himself disparaged by sending forth the streams of
          his bounty on the wickedest persons, who are far meaner to him than
          those of the same blood can be to us. Who hath the worse thoughts of
          the sun, for shining upon the earth, that sends up vapors to cloud it?
          it can be no disgrace to resemble God; if his hand and bowels be open
          to us, let not ours be shut to any.
