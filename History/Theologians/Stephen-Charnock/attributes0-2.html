        <h2>TO THE READER.</h2>
        <p>
          This long since promised and greatly expected volume of the reverend
          author upon the Divine Attributes, being transcribed out of his own
          manuscripts by the unwearied diligence of those worthy persons that
          undertook it,4 is now at last come to thy hands: doubt not but thy
          reading will pay for thy waiting, and thy satisfaction make full
          compensation for thy patience. In the epistle before his treatise on
          Providence, it was intimated that his following discourses would not
          be inferior to that; and we are persuaded that, ere thou hast perused
          one half of this, thou wilt acknowledge that it was modestly spoken.
          Enough, assure thyself, thou wilt find here for thy entertainment and
          delight, as well as profit. The sublimeness, variety, and rareness of
          the truths here handled, together with the elegancy of the composure,
          neatness of the style, and whatever is wont to make any book
          desirable, will all concur in the recommendation of this. What so high
          and noble a subject, what so fit for his meditations or thine, as the
          highest and noblest Being, and those transcendently glorious
          perfections wherewith he is clothed! A mere contemplation of the
          Divine excellencies may afford much pleasure to any man that loves to
          exercise his reason, and is addicted to speculation: but what
          incomparable sweetness, then, will holy souls find in viewing and
          considering those perfections now, which they are more fully to behold
          hereafter; and seeing what manner of God, how wise and powerful, how
          great, and good, and holy is he, in whom the covenant interests them,
          and in the enjoyment of whom their happiness consists! If rich men
          delight to sum up their vast revenues, to read over their rentals,
          look upon their hoards; if they bless themselves in their great
          wealth, or, to use the prophet’s words (Jer. ix. 23), “glory in their
          riches,” well may believers rejoice and glory in their “knowing the
          Lord” (ver. 24), and please themselves in seeing how rich they are in
          having an immensely full and all‑sufficient God for their inheritance.
          Alas! how little do most men know of that Deity they profess to serve,
          and own, not as their Sovereign only, but their Portion. To such this
          author might say, as Paul to the Athenians, “Whom you ignorantly
          worship, him declare I unto you” (Acts xvii. 23). These treatises,
          reader, will inform thee who He is whom thou callest thine, present
          thee with a view of thy chief good, and make thee value thyself a
          thousand times more upon thy interest with God, than upon all external
          accomplishments and worldly possessions. Who but delights to hear well
          of one whom he loves! God is thy love, if thou be a believer; and then
          it cannot but fill thee with delight and ravishment to hear so much
          spoken in his praise. David desired to “dwell in the house of the
          Lord,” that he might there behold his beauty: how much of that beauty,
          if thou art but capable of seeing it, mayest thou behold in this
          volume, which was our author’s main business, for about three years
          before he died, to display before his hearers! True, indeed, the
          Lord’s glory, as shining forth before his heavenly courtiers above, is
          unapproachable by mortal men; but what of it is visible in his
          works—creation, providence, redemption—falls under the cognizance of
          his inferior subjects here. And this is, in a great measure, presented
          to view in these discourses; and so much, we may well say, as may, by
          the help of grace, be effectual to raise thy admiration, attract thy
          love, provoke thy desires, and enable thee to make some guess at what
          is yet unseen; and why not, likewise, to clear thy eyes, and prepare
          them for future sight, as well as turn them away from the contemptible
          vanities of this present life? Whatever is glorious in this world, yet
          (as the apostle, in another case) “hath no glory, by reason of the
          glory that excels” (2 Cor. iii. 10). This “excellent glory” is the
          subject of this book, to which all created beauty is but mere shadow
          and duskiness. If thy eyes be well fixed on this, they will not be
          easily drawn to wander after other objects: if thy heart be taken with
          God, it will be mortified to everything that is not God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But thou hast in this book, not only an excellent subject in the
          general, but great variety of matter for the employment of thy
          understanding, as well as enlivening thy affections, and that, too,
          such as thou wilt not find elsewhere: many excellent things which are
          out of the road of ordinary preachers and writers, and which may be
          grateful to the curious, no less than satisfactory to the wise and
          judicious. It is not, therefore, a book to be played with or slept
          over, but read with the most intent and serious mind; for though it
          afford much pleasure for the fancy, yet much more work for the heart,
          and hath, indeed, enough in it to busy all the faculties. The dress is
          complete and decent, yet not garish nor theatrical; the rhetoric
          masculine and vigorous, such as became a pulpit, and was never
          borrowed from the stage; the expressions full, clear, apt, and such as
          are best suited to the weightiness and spirituality of the truths here
          delivered. It is plain he was no empty preacher, but was more for
          sense than sound, filled up his words with matter, and chose rather to
          inform his hearers’ minds than to claw any itching ears. Yet we will
          not say but some little things, a word, or a phrase now and then he
          may have, which, no doubt, had he lived to transcribe his own sermons,
          he would have altered. If in some lesser matters he differ from thee,
          it is but in such as godly and learned men do frequently, and may,
          without breach of charity, differ in among themselves: in some things
          he may differ from us too, and, it may be, we from each other; and
          where are there any two persons who have in all, especially the more
          disputable points of religion, exactly the same sentiments,—at least,
          express themselves altogether in the same terms? But this we must say,
          that though he treat of many of the most abstruse and mysterious
          doctrines of Christianity, which are the subjects of great debates and
          controversies in the world, yet we find no one material thing in which
          he may justly be called heterodox (unless old heresies be of late
          grown orthodox, and his differing from them must make him faulty), but
          generally delivers, as in his former pieces,5 what is most consonant
          to the faith of this and other, the best reformed churches. He was
          not, indeed, for that modern divinity which is so much in vogue with
          some who would be counted the only sound divines; having “tasted the
          old,” he did not desire “the new,” but said, “the old is better.” Some
          errors, especially the Socinian, he sets himself industriously
          against, and cuts the very sinews of them, yet sometimes almost
          without naming them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the doctrinal part of several of his discourses thou wilt find the
          depth of polemical divinity, and in his inferences from thence, the
          sweetness of practical; some things which may exercise the profoundest
          scholar, and others which may instruct and edify the weakest
          Christian. Nothing is more nervous than his reasonings, and nothing
          more affecting than his applications. Though he make great use of
          schoolmen, yet they are certainly more beholden to him than he to
          them; he adopts their notions, but he refines them too, and improves
          them and reforms them from the barbarousness in which they were
          expressed, and dresseth them up in his own language (so far as the
          nature of the matter will permit, and more clear terms are to be
          found), and so makes them intelligible to vulgar capacities, which, in
          their original rudeness, were obscure and strange even to learned
          heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a word, he handles the great truths of the gospel with that
          perspicuity, gravity, and majesty, which best becomes the oracles of
          God; and we have reason to believe, that no judicious and unbiassed
          reader but will acknowledge this to be incomparably the best practical
          treatise the world ever saw in English upon this subject. What Dr.
          Jackson did, to whom our author gave all due respect, was more brief
          and in another way. Dr. Preston did worthily upon the Attributes in
          his day; but his discourses likewise, are more succinct, when this
          author’s are more full and large. But whatever were the mind of God in
          it, it was not his will that either of these two should live to finish
          what he had begun, both being taken away when preaching upon this
          subject. Happy souls! whose last breath was spent in so noble a work,
          praising God while they had any being (Psal. cxlvi. 2).
        </p>
        <p>
          His method is much the same in most of these discourses, both in the
          doctrinal and practical part, which will make the whole more plain and
          facile to ordinary readers. He rarely makes objections, and yet
          frequently answers them, by implying them in those propositions he
          lays down for the clearing up the truths he asserts. His dexterity is
          admirable in the applicatory work, where he not only brings down the
          highest doctrines to the lowest capacities, but collects great variety
          of proper, pertinent, useful, and yet, many times, unthought‑of
          inferences, and that from those truths, which however they afford much
          matter for inquisition and speculation, yet might seem, unless to the
          most intelligent and judicious Christians, to have a more remote
          influence upon practice. He is not like some school writers, who
          attenuate and rarefy the matter they discourse of to a degree
          bordering upon annihilation, at least, beat it so thin, that a puff of
          breath may blow it away; spin their thread so fine, that the cloth,
          when made up, proves useless, solidity dwindles into niceties, and
          what we thought we had got by their assertions, we lose by their
          distinctions. But if our author have some subtilties and superfine
          notions in his argumentations, yet he condenseth them again, and
          consolidates them into substantial and profitable corollaries in his
          applications; and in them his main business is, as to discipline a
          profane world for its neglect of God, and contempt of him in his most
          adorable and shining perfections, so likewise to show how the Divine
          Attributes are not only infinitely excellent in themselves, but a
          grand foundation for all true divine worship, and should be the great
          motives to provoke men to the exercise of faith, and love, and fear,
          and humility, and all that holy obedience they are called to by the
          gospel; and this, without peradventure, is the great end of all those
          rich discoveries God hath in his word made of himself to us. And,
          reader, if these elaborate discourses of this holy man, through the
          Lord’s blessing, become a means of promoting holiness in thee, and
          stir thee up to love and live to the God of his praise (Ps. cix. 1),
          we are well assured that his end in preaching them is answered, and so
          is ours in publishing them.
