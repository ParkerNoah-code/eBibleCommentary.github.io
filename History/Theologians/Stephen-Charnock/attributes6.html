        <h2>DISCOURSE VI.</h2>
        <p>ON THE IMMUTABILITY OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Psalm cii. 26, 27.—They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all
          of them shall wax old as a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
          them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years
          shall have no end.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Psalm contains a complaint of a people pressed with a great
          calamity; some think of the Jewish church in Babylon; others think the
          Psalmist doth here personate mankind lying under a state of
          corruption, because he wishes for the coming of the Messiah, to
          accomplish that redemption promised by God, and needed by them. Indeed
          the title of the Psalm is “A prayer of the afflicted when he is
          overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before the Lord;” whether
          afflicted with the sense of corruption, or with the sense of
          oppression. And the redemption by the Messiah, which the ancient
          church looked upon as the fountain of their deliverance from a sinful
          or a servile bondage, is in this psalm spoken of. A set time appointed
          for the discovery of his mercy to Sion (ver. 13); an appearance in
          glory to build up Sion (ver. 16); the loosing of the prisoner by
          redemption, and them that are appointed to death (ver. 20); the
          calling of the Gentiles (ver. 22); and the latter part of the psalm,
          wherein are the verses I have read, are applied to Christ (Heb. i.)
          Whatsoever the design of the psalm might be, many things are
          intermingled that concern the kingdom of the Messiah, and redemption
          by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some make three parts of the psalm. 1. A petition plainly delivered
          (ver. 1, 2): “Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee,”
          &amp;c. 2. The petition strongly and argumentatively enforced and
          pleaded (ver. 3), from the misery of the petitioner in himself, and
          his reproach from his enemies. 3. An acting of faith in the
          expectation of an answer in the general redemption promised (ver. 12,
          13): “But thou, O Lord, shalt endure forever; thou shalt arise and
          have mercy upon Sion; the heathen shall fear thy name.” The first part
          is the petition pleaded; the second part is the petition answered, in
          an assurance that there should in time be a full deliverance.580 The
          design of the penman is to confirm the church in the truth of the
          divine promises; that though the foundations of the world should be
          ripped up, and the heavens clatter together, and the whole fabric of
          them be unpinned and fall to pieces, the firmest parts of it
          dissolved; yet the church should continue in its stability, because it
          stands not upon the changeableness of creatures, but is built upon the
          immutable rock of the truth of God, which is as little subject to
          change, as his essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          They shall perish, thou shalt change them. As he had before ascribed
          to God the “foundation of heaven and earth” (ver. 25), so he ascribes
          to God here the destruction of them. Both the beginning and end of the
          world are here ascertained. There is nothing, indeed, from the present
          appearance of things, that can demonstrate the cessation of the world.
          The heaven and earth stand firm; the motions of the heavenly bodies
          are the same, their beauty is not decayed; individuals corrupt, but
          the species and kinds remain. The successions of the year observe
          their due order; but the sin of man renders the change of the present
          appearance of the world necessary to accomplish the design of God for
          the glory of his elect. The heavens do not naturally perish, as some
          fancied an old age of the world, wherein it must necessarily decay as
          the bodies of animals do; or that the parts of the heavens are broken
          off by their rubbing one against another in their motion, and falling
          to the earth, are the seeds of those things that grow among us.581
        </p>
        <p>
          The earth and heavens. He names here the most stable parts of the
          world, and the most beautiful parts of the creation; those that are
          freest from corruptibility and change, to illustrate thereby the
          immutability of God; that though the heavens and earth have a
          prerogative of fixedness above other parts of the world, and the
          creatures that reside below, the heavens remain the same as they were
          created, and the centre of the earth retains its fixedness, and are as
          beautiful and fresh in their age as they were in their youth many
          years ago, notwithstanding the change of the elements, fire and water
          being often turned into air, so that there may remain but little of
          that air which was first created by reason of the continual
          transmutation; yet this firmness of the earth and heavens is not to be
          regarded in comparison of the unmovableness and fixedness of the being
          of God; as their beauty comes short of the glory of his being, so doth
          their firmness come short of his stability. Some, by heavens and
          earth, understand the creatures which reside in the earth, and those
          which are in the air, which is called heaven often in Scripture; but
          the ruin and fall of these being seen every day, had been no fit
          illustration of the unchangeableness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          They, shall perish, they shall be changed. 1. They may perish, say
          some; they have it not from themselves that they do not perish, but
          from thee, who didst endue them with an incorruptible nature; they
          shall perish if thou speakest the word; thou canst with as much ease
          destroy them, as thou didst create them. But the Psalmist speaks not
          of their possibility, but the certainty of their perishing. 2. They
          shall perish in their qualities and motion, not in their substance,
          say others. They shall cease from that motion which is designed
          properly for the generation and corruption of things in the earth; but
          in regard of their substance and beauty they shall remain. As when the
          strings or wheels of a clock or watch are taken off, the material
          parts remain, though the motion of it, and the use for discovering the
          time of the day, ceaseth.582 To perish, doth not signify alway a
          falling into nothing, an annihilation, by which both the matter and
          the form are destroyed, but a ceasing of the present appearance of
          them; a ceasing to be what they now are; as a man is said to perish
          when he dies, whereas the better part of man doth not cease to be. The
          figure of the body moulders away, and the matter of it returns to
          dust; but the soul being immortal ceaseth not to act, when the body,
          by reason of the absence of the soul, is incapable of acting. So the
          heavens shall perish; the appearance they now have shall vanish, and a
          more glorious and incorruptible frame be erected by the power and
          goodness of God. The dissolution of heaven and earth is meant by the
          word perish; the raising a new frame is signified by the word changed:
          as if the Spirit of God would prevent any wrong meaning of the word
          perish, by alleviating the sense of that, by another which signifies
          only a mutation and change; as when we change a habit and garment, we
          quit the old to receive the new.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a garment, as a vesture. Thou shalt change them, ἑλίξεις,583 thou
          shalt fold them up. The heavens are compared to a curtain (Ps. civ.
          2), and shall in due time be folded up as clothes and curtains are. As
          a garment encompasseth the whole body, so do the heavens encircle the
          earth.584 Some say, as a garment is folded up to be laid aside, that
          when there is need it may be taken again for use; so shalt thou fold
          up the heavens like a garment, that when they are repaired, thou
          mayest again stretch them out about the earth; thou shalt fold them
          up, so that what did appear shall not now appear. It may be
          illustrated by the metaphor of a scroll or book, which the Spirit of
          God useth (Isa. xxxiv. 4; Rev. vi. 14): “The heavens departed as a
          scroll when it is rolled together.” When a book is rolled up or shut,
          nothing can be read in it till it be opened again; so the face of the
          heavens, wherein the stars are as letters declaring the glory of God,
          shall be shut or rolled together, so that nothing shall appear, till
          by its renovation it be opened again: as a garment it shall be
          changed, not to be used in the same fashion, and for the same use
          again. It seems, indeed, to be for the worse; an old garment is not
          changed but into rags, to be put to other uses, and afterwards thrown
          upon the dunghill; but similitudes are not to be pressed too far; and
          this will not agree with the new heavens and new earth, physically so,
          as well as metaphorically so. It is not likely the heavens will be put
          to a worse use than God designed them for in creation; however, a
          change as a garment, speaks not a total corruption, but an alteration
          of qualities; as a garment not to be used in the same fashion as
          before. We may observe, that it is probable the world shall not be
          annihilated, but refined. It shall lose its present form and fashion;
          but not its foundation: indeed, as God raised it from nothing, so he
          can reduce it into nothing; yet it doth not appear that God will
          annihilate it, and utterly destroy both the matter and form of it;
          part shall be consumed, and part purified (2 Pet. iii. 12, 13): “The
          heavens shall be on fire and dissolved; nevertheless, we, according to
          his promise, look for a new heaven and a new earth.” They shall be
          melted down as gold by the artificer, to be refined from its dross,
          and wrought into a more beautiful fashion, that they may serve the
          design of God for those that shall reside therein; a new world wherein
          righteousness shall dwell: the apostle opposing it thereby to the old
          world wherein wickedness did reside. The heavens are to be purged, as
          the vessels that held the sin‑offering were to be purified by the fire
          of the sanctuary. God, indeed, will take down this scaffold, which he
          hath built to publish his glory. As every individual hath a certain
          term of its duration, so an end is appointed for the universal nature
          of heaven and earth (Isa. li. 6): “The heavens shall vanish like
          smoke” which disappears. As smoke is resolved and attenuated into air,
          not annihilated, so shall the world assume a new face, and have a
          greater clearness and splendor; as the bodies of men, dissolved into
          dust, shall have more glorious qualities at their resurrection; as a
          vessel of gold is melted down to remove the batterings in it, and
          receive a more comely form by the skill of the workman.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The world was not destroyed by the deluge: it was rather washed by
          water, than consumed; so it shall be rather refined by the last fire,
          than lie under an irrecoverable ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is not likely God would liken the everlastingness of his
          covenant, and the perpetuity of his spiritual Israel, to the duration
          of the ordinances of the heavens (as he doth in Jer. xxxi. 35, 36), if
          they were wholly to depart from before him. Though that place may only
          tend to an assurance of a church in the world, while the world
          endures; yet it would be but small comfort, if the happiness of
          believers should endure no longer than the heavens and earth, if they
          were to have a total period.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Besides, the bodies of the saints must have place for their support
          to move in, and glorious objects suited to those glorious senses which
          shall be restored to them; not in any carnal way, which our Saviour
          rejects, when he saith, There is no eating, or drinking, or marrying,
          &amp;c. in the other world; but whereby they may glorify God; though
          how or in what manner their senses shall be used, would be rashness to
          determine; only something is necessary for the corporeal state of men,
          that there may be an employment for their senses as well as their
          souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Again, How could the creature, the world, or any part of it, be
          said to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious
          liberty of the sons of God, if the whole frame of heaven and earth
          were to be annihilated (Rom. viii. 21)? The apostle saith also, that
          the creature waits with an “earnest expectation for this manifestation
          of the sons of God” (ver. 19); which would have no foundation if the
          whole frame should be reduced to nothing. What joyful expectation can
          there be in any of a total ruin? How should the creature be capable of
          partaking in this glorious liberty of the sons of God?585 As the world
          for the sin of man lost its first dignity, and was cursed after the
          fall, and the beauty bestowed upon it by creation defaced; so it shall
          recover that ancient glory, when he shall be fully restored by the
          resurrection to that dignity he lost by his first sin. As man shall be
          freed from his corruptibility to receive that glory which is prepared
          for him, so shall the creatures be freed from that imperfection or
          corruptibility, those stains and spots upon the face of them, to
          receive a new glory suited to their nature, and answerable to the
          design of God, when the glorious liberty of the saints shall be
          accomplished.586 As when a prince’s nuptials are solemnized, the whole
          country echoes with joy; so the inanimate creatures, when the time of
          the marriage of the Lamb is come, shall have a delight and pleasure
          from that renovation. The apostle sets forth the whole world as a
          person groaning; and the Scripture is frequent in such metaphors; as
          when the creatures are said to wait upon God, and to be troubled, the
          hills are said to leap and the mountains to rejoice (Ps. civ. 27‒29);
          the creature is said to groan, as the heavens are said to declare the
          glory of God, passively, naturally, not rationally. It is not likely
          angels are here meant, though they cannot but desire it; since they
          are affected with the dishonor and reproach God hath in the world,
          they cannot but long for the restoration of his honor in the
          restoration of the creature to its true end: and, indeed, the angels
          are employed to serve man in this sinful state, and cannot but in
          holiness wish the creature freed from his corruption. Nor is it meant
          of the new creatures, which have the first fruits of the Spirit; those
          he brings in afterwards, groaning and waiting for the adoption (ver.
          23); where he distinguisheth the rational creature from the creature
          he had spoken of before. If he had meant the believing creature by
          that creature that desired the liberty of the sons of God, what need
          had there been of that additional distinction, and not only they, but
          we also who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan within
          ourselves? Whereby it seems he means some creatures below rational
          creatures, since neither angels nor blessed souls can be said to
          travail in pain, with that distress as a woman in travail hath, as the
          word signifies, who perform the work joyfully which God sets them
          upon.587 If the creatures be subject to vanity by the sin of man, they
          shall also partake of a happiness by the restoration of man. The earth
          hath borne thorns and thistles, and venomous beasts; the air hath had
          its tempests and infectious qualities; the water hath caused its
          floods and deluges. The creature hath been abused to luxury and
          intemperance; and been tyrannized over by man, contrary to the end of
          its creation. It is convenient that some time should be allotted for
          the creature’s attaining its true end, and that it may partake of the
          peace of man, as it hath done of the fruits of his sin; otherwise it
          would seem, that sin had prevailed more than grace, and would have had
          more power to deface, than grace to restore things into their due
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Again, Upon what account should the Psalmist exhort the heavens to
          rejoice, and the earth to be glad, when God “comes to judge the world
          with righteousness” (Ps. xcvi. 11‒13), if they should be annihilated
          and sunk forever into nothing? “It would seem,” saith Daille, “to be
          an impertinent figure, if the Judge of the world brought to them a
          total destruction; an entire ruin could not be matter of triumph to
          creatures, who naturally have that instinct or inclination put into
          them by their Creator, to preserve themselves, and to effect their own
          preservation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Again, the Lord is to rejoice in his works (Ps. civ. 31): “The
          glory of the Lord shall endure forever; the Lord shall rejoice in his
          works;” not hath, but shall rejoice in his works: in the works of
          creation, which the Psalmist had enumerated, and which is the whole
          scope of the Psalm: and he intimates that it is part of the glory of
          the Lord which endures forever; that is, his manifestative glory, to
          rejoice in his works: the glory of the Lord must be understood with
          reference to the creation he had spoken of before. How short was that
          joy God had in his works after he had sent them beautified out of his
          hand! How soon did he repent, not only that he had made man, but was
          grieved at the heart also, that he made the other creatures which
          man’s sin had disordered! (Gen. vi. 7.) What joy can God have in them,
          since the curse upon the entrance of sin into the world remains upon
          them? If they are to be annihilated upon the full restoration of his
          holiness, what time will God have to rejoice in the other works of
          creation? It is the joy of God to see all his works in due order;
          every one pointing to their true end; marching together in their
          excellency, according to his first intendment in their creation. Did
          God create the world to perform its end only for one day; scarce so
          much, if Adam fell the very first day of his creation? What would have
          been their end, if Adam had been confirmed in a state of happiness as
          the angels were? ’tis likely will be answered and performed upon the
          complete restoration of man to that happy state from whence he fell.
          What artificer compiles a work by his skill, but to rejoice in it? And
          shall God have no joy from the works of his hands? Since God can only
          rejoice in goodness, the creatures must have that goodness restored to
          them which God pronounced them to have at the first creation, and
          which he ordained them for, before he can again rejoice in his works.
          The goodness of the creatures is the glory and joy of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 1. We may infer from hence, what a base and vile thing sin
          is, which lays the foundation of the world’s change. Sin brings it to
          a decrepit age; sin overturned the whole work of God (Gen. iii. 17);
          so that to render it useful to its proper end, there is a necessity of
          a kind of a new creating it. This causes God to fire the earth for a
          purification of it from that infection and contagion brought upon it
          by the apostasy and corruption of man. It hath served sinful man, and
          therefore must undergo a purging flame, to be fit to serve the holy
          and righteous Creator. As sin is so riveted in the body of man, that
          there is need of a change by death to raze it out; so hath the curse
          for sin got so deep into the bowels of the world, that there is need
          of a change by fire to refine it for its master’s use. Let us look
          upon sin with no other notion than as the object of God’s hatred, the
          cause of his grief in the creatures, and the spring of the pain and
          ruin of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How foolish a thing is it to set our hearts upon that which shall
          perish, and be no more what it is now! The heavens and the earth, the
          solidest and firmest parts of the creation, shall not continue in the
          posture they are; they must perish and undergo a refining change. How
          feeble and weak are the other parts of the creation, the little
          creatures walking upon and fluttering about the world, that are
          perishing and dying every day; and we scarce see them clothed with
          life and beauty this day, but they wither and are despoiled of all the
          next; and are such frail things fit objects for our everlasting
          spirits and affections? Though the daily employment of the heavens is
          the declaration of the glory of God (Ps. xix. 1), yet neither this,
          nor their harmony, order, beauty, amazing greatness and glory of them,
          shall preserve them from a dissolution and melting at the presence of
          the Lord. Though they have remained in the same posture from the
          creation till this day, and are of so great antiquity, yet they must
          bow down to a change before the will and word of their Creator; and
          shall we rest upon that which shall vanish like smoke? Shall we take
          any creature for our support like ice, that will crack under our feet,
          and must, by the order of their Lord Creator, deceive our hopes?
          Perishing things can be no support to the soul; if we would have rest,
          we must run to God and rest in God. How contemptible should that be to
          us, whose fashion shall pass away, which shall not endure long in its
          present form and appearance; contemptible as a rest, not contemptible
          as the work of God; contemptible as an end, not contemptible as a
          means to attain our end! If these must be changed, how unworthy are
          other things to be the centre of our souls, that change in our very
          using of them, and slide away in our very enjoyment of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou art the same. The essence of God, with all the perfections of his
          nature, are pronounced the same, without any variation from eternity
          to eternity; so that the text doth not only assert the eternal
          duration of God, but his immutability in that duration. His eternity
          is signified in that expression, “Thou shalt endure;” his immutability
          in this, “Thou art the same.” To endure, argues indeed his
          immutability as well as eternity; for what endures, is not changed,
          and what is changed, doth not endure;588 but “Thou art the same”589
          doth more fully signify it. He could not be the same if he could be
          changed into any other thing than what he is; the Psalmist therefore
          puts not thou hast been, or shalt be, but thou art the same, without
          any alteration. “Thou art the same;” that is, the same God; the same
          in essence and nature; the same in will and purpose. Thou dost change
          all other things as thou pleasest, but thou art immutable in every
          respect, and receivest no shadow of change, though never so light and
          small. The Psalmist here alludes to the name Jehovah, I Am;590 and
          doth not only ascribe immutability to God, but exclude everything else
          from partaking in that perfection. All things else are tottering; God
          sees all other things in continual motion under his feet, like water
          passing away and no more seen; while he remains fixed and immovable;
          his wisdom and power, his knowledge and will, are always the same. His
          essence can receive no alteration, neither by itself, nor by any
          external cause; whereas other things either naturally decline to
          destruction, pass from one term to another, till they come to their
          period; or shall at the last day be wrapped up, after God hath
          completed his will in them and by them, as a man doth a garment he
          intends to repair and transform to another use. So that in the text,
          God, as immutable, is opposed to all creatures as perishing and
          changeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. God is unchangeable in his essence, nature, and perfections.
          Immutability and eternity are linked together; and, indeed, true
          eternity is true immutability; whence eternity is defined the
          possession of an immutable life. Yet immutability differs from
          eternity in our conception; immutability respects the essence or
          existence of a thing; eternity respects the duration of a being in
          that state, or rather, immutability is the state itself;591 eternity
          is the measure of that state. A thing is said to be changed, when it
          is otherwise now in regard of nature, state, will, or any quality than
          it was before; when either something is added to it, or taken from it;
          when it either loses or acquires. But now it is the essential property
          of God, not to have any accession to, or diminution of, his essence or
          attributes, but to remain entirely the same. He wants nothing; he
          loses nothing; but doth uniformly exist by himself, without any new
          nature, new thoughts, new will, new purpose, or new place. This
          unchangeableness of God was anciently represented by the figure of a
          cube, a piece of metal or wood framed four‑square, when every side is
          exactly of the same equality; cast it which way you will, it will
          always be in the same posture, because it is equal to itself in all
          its dimensions.592 He was therefore said to be the centre of all
          things, and other things the circumference; the centre is never moved,
          while the circumference is; it remains immovable in the midst of the
          circle; “There is no variableness nor shadow of turning with him”
          (James i. 17). The moon hath her spots, so hath the sun; there is a
          mixture of light and darkness; it hath its changes; sometimes it is in
          the increase, sometimes in the wane; it is always either gaining or
          losing, and by the turnings and motions, either of the heavenly bodies
          or of the earth, it is in its eclipse, by the interposition of the
          earth between that and the sun. The sun also hath its diurnal and
          annual motion; it riseth and sets, and puts on a different face; it
          doth not always shine with the noon‑day light; it is sometimes veiled
          with clouds and vapors; it is always going from one tropic to another,
          whereby it makes various shadows on the earth, and produceth the
          various seasons of the year; it is not always in our hemisphere, nor
          doth it always shine with an equal force and brightness in it. Such
          shadows and variations have no place in the eternal Father of Lights;
          he hath not the least spot or diminution of brightness; nothing can
          cloud him or eclipse him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the better understanding this perfection of God, I shall premise
          three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The immutability of God is a perfection. Immutability considered in
          itself, without relation to other things, is not a perfection. It is
          the greatest misery and imperfection of the evil angels, that they are
          immutable in malice against God; but as God is infinite in essence,
          infinitely good, wise, holy; so it is a perfection necessary to his
          nature, that he should be immutably all this, all excellency,
          goodness, wisdom, immutably all that he is; without this he would be
          an imperfect Being. Are not the angels in heaven, who are confirmed in
          a holy and happy state, more perfect than when they were in a
          possibility of committing evil and becoming miserable? Are not the
          saints in heaven, whose wills by grace do unalterably cleave to God
          and goodness, more perfect than if they were as Adam in Paradise,
          capable of losing their felicity, as well as preserving it? We count a
          rock, in regard of its stability, more excellent than the dust of the
          ground, or a feather that is tossed about with every wind; is it not
          also the perfection of the body to have a constant tenor of health,
          and the glory of a man not to warp aside from what is just and right,
          by the persuasions of any temptations?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Immutability is a glory belonging to all the attributes of God. It
          is not a single perfection of the Divine nature, nor is it limited to
          particular objects thus and thus disposed. Mercy and justice have
          their distinct objects and distinct acts; mercy is conversant about a
          penitent, justice conversant about an obstinate sinner. In our notion
          and conception of the Divine perfections, his perfections are
          different: the wisdom of God is not his power, nor his power his
          holiness, but immutability is the centre wherein they all unite. There
          is not one perfection but may be said to be and truly is, immutable;
          none of them will appear so glorious without this beam, this sun of
          immutability, which renders them highly excellent without the least
          shadow of imperfection. How cloudy would his blessedness be if it were
          changeable! How dim his wisdom, if it might be obscured! How feeble
          his power, if it were capable to be sickly and languish! How would
          mercy lose much of its lustre, if it could change into wrath; and
          justice much of its dread, if it could be turned into mercy, while the
          object of justice remains unfit for mercy, and one that hath need of
          mercy continues only fit for the Divine fury! But unchangeableness is
          a thread that runs through the whole web; it is the enamel of all the
          rest; none of them without it could look with a triumphant aspect. His
          power is unchangeable: “In the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength”
          (Isa. xxvi. 4). His mercy and his holiness endure forever: he never
          could, nor ever can, look upon iniquity (Hab. i. 13). He is a rock in
          the righteousness of his ways, the truth of his word, the holiness of
          his proceedings, and the rectitude of his nature. All are expressed
          Deut xxxii. 4: “He is a rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways
          are judgment; a God of truth, and without iniquity; just and right is
          he.” All that we consider in God is unchangeable; for his essence and
          his properties are the same, and, therefore, what is necessarily
          belonging to the essence of God, belongs also to every perfection of
          the nature of God; none of them can receive any addition or
          diminution. From the unchangeableness of his nature, the apostle
          (James i. 17) infers the unchangeableness of his holiness, and himself
          (in Mal. iii. 6) the unchangeableness of his counsel.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Unchangeableness doth necessarily pertain to the nature of God. It
          is of the same necessity with the rectitude of his nature; he can no
          more be changeable in his essence than he can be unrighteous in his
          actions. God is a necessary Being; he is necessarily what he is, and,
          therefore, is unchangeably what he is. Mutability belongs to
          contingency. If any perfection of his nature could be separated from
          him, he would cease to be God. What did not possess the whole nature
          of God, could not have the essence of God; it is reciprocated with the
          nature of God. Whatsoever is immutable by nature is God; whatsoever is
          God is immutable by nature. Some creatures are immutable by his grace
          and power. God is holy, happy, wise, good, by his essence; angels and
          men are made holy, wise, happy, strong, and good, by qualities and
          graces.593 The holiness, happiness, and wisdom of saints and angels,
          as they had a beginning, so they are capable of increase and
          diminution, and of an end also; for their standing is not from
          themselves, or from the nature of created strength, holiness, or
          wisdom, which in themselves are apt to fail, and finally to decay; but
          from the stability and confirmation they have by the gift and grace of
          God. The heaven and earth shall be changed; and after that renewal and
          reparation they shall not be changed. Our bodies after the
          resurrection shall not be changed, but forever be “made conformable to
          the glorious body of Christ” (Phil. iii. 21); but this is by the
          powerful grace of God: so that, indeed, those things may be said
          afterwards rather to be unchanged than unchangeable, because they are
          not so by nature, but by sovereign dispensation. As creatures have not
          necessary beings, so they have not necessary immutability. Necessity
          of being, and, therefore, immutability of being, belongs by nature
          only to God; otherwise, if there were any change in God, he would be
          sometimes what he was not, and would cease to be what he was, which is
          against the nature, and, indeed, against the natural notion of a
          Deity. Let us see then,

        </p>
        <p>I. In what respects God is unchangeable.</p>
        <p>
          1. God is unchangeable in his essence. He is unalterably fixed in his
          being, so that not a particle of it can be lost from it, not a mite
          added to it. If a man continue in being as long as Methuselah, nine
          hundred and sixty‑nine years; yet there is not a day, nay, an hour,
          wherein there is not some alteration in his substance. Though no
          substantial part is wanting, yet there is an addition to him by his
          food, a diminution of something by his labor; he is always making some
          acquisition, or suffering some loss: but in God there can be no
          alteration, by the accession of anything to make his substance greater
          or better, or by diminution to make it less or worse. He who hath not
          being from another, cannot but be always what he is: God is the first
          Being, an independent Being; he was not produced of himself, or of any
          other, but by nature always hath been, and, therefore, cannot by
          himself, or by any other, be changed from what he is in his own
          nature. That which is not may as well assume to itself a being, as he
          who hath and is all being, have the least change from what he is.
          Again, because he is a Spirit, he is not subject to those mutations
          which are found in corporeal and bodily natures; because he is an
          absolutely simple Spirit, not having the least particle of
          composition; he is not capable of those changes which may be in
          created spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) If his essence were mutable, God would not truly be; it could not
          be truly said by himself, “I Am that I Am” (Exod. iii. 14), if he were
          such a thing or Being at this time, and a different Being at another
          time. Whatsoever is changed properly is not, because it doth not
          remain to be what it was; that which is changed was something, is
          something, and will be something. A being remains to that thing which
          is changed; yet though it may be said such a thing is, yet it may be
          also said such a thing is not, because it is not what it was in its
          first being; it is not now what it was, it is now what it was not; it
          is another thing than it was, it was another thing than it is; it will
          be another thing than what it is or was. It is, indeed, a being, but a
          different being from what it was before. But if God were changed, it
          could not be said of him that he is, but it might also be said of him
          that he is not; or if he were changeable, or could be changed, it
          might be said of him he is, but he will not be what he is; or he may
          not be what he is, but there will be or may be some difference in his
          being, and so God would not be “I Am that I Am;” for though he would
          not cease utterly to be, yet he would cease to be what he was before.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Again: if his essence were mutable, he could not be perfectly
          blessed, and fully rejoice in himself. If he changed for the better,
          he could not have an infinite pleasure in what he was before the
          change, because he was not infinitely blessed; and the pleasure of
          that state could not be of a higher kind than the state itself, or, at
          least, the apprehension of a happiness in it. If he changed for the
          worse, he could not have a pleasure in it after the change; for
          according to the diminution of his state would be the decrease of his
          pleasure. His pleasure could not be infinite before the change, if he
          changed for the better; it could not be infinite after the change, if
          he changed for the worse. If he changed for the better, he would not
          have had an infinite goodness of being before; and not having an
          infinite goodness of being, he would have a finite goodness of being;
          for there is no medium between finite and infinite. Then, though the
          change were for the better, yet, being finite before, something would
          be still wanting to make him infinitely blessed; because being finite,
          he could not change to that which is infinite; for finite and infinite
          are extremes so distant, that they can never pass into one another;
          that is, that that which is finite should become infinite, or that
          which is infinite should become finite; so that supposing him mutable,
          his essence in no state of change could furnish him with an infinite
          peace and blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Again: if God’s essence be changed, he either increaseth or
          diminisheth.594 Whatsoever is changed, doth either gain by receiving
          something larger and greater than it had in itself before, or gains
          nothing by being changed. If the former, then it receives more than
          itself, more than it had in itself before. The Divine nature cannot be
          increased; for whatsoever receives anything than what it had in itself
          before, must necessarily receive it from another, because nothing can
          give to itself that which it hath not. But God cannot receive from
          another what he hath not already, because whatsoever other things
          possess is derived from him, and, therefore, contained in him, as the
          fountain contains the virtue in itself which it conveys to the
          streams; so that God cannot gain anything. If a thing that is changed
          gain nothing by that change, it loseth something of what it had before
          in itself; and this loss must be by itself or some other. God cannot
          receive any loss from anything in himself; he cannot will his own
          diminution, that is repugnant to every nature. He may as well will his
          own destruction as his own decrease: every decrease is a partial
          destruction. But it is impossible for God to die any kind of death, to
          have any resemblance of death, for he is immortal, and “only hath
          immortality” (1 Tim. vi. 16), therefore impossible to be diminished in
          any particle of his essence; nor can he be diminished by anything in
          his own nature, because his infinite simplicity admits of nothing
          distinct from himself, or contrary to himself. All decreases come from
          something contrary to the nature of that thing which doth decrease.
          Whatsoever is made less than itself, was not truly unum, one and
          simple, because that which divides itself in separation was not the
          same in conjunction. Nor can he be diminished by any other without
          himself; because nothing is superior to God, nothing stronger than God
          which can oppress him. But whatsoever is changed is weaker than that
          which changeth it, and sinks under a power it cannot successfully
          resist; weakness belongs not to the Deity.595 Nor, lastly, can God
          change from a state wherein he is, to another state equal to the
          former, as men in some cases may do; for in passing from one state to
          another equal to it, something must be parted with which he had
          before, that some other thing may accrue to him as a recompense for
          that loss, to make him equal to what he was. This recompense then he
          had not before, though he had something equal to it. And in this case
          it could not be said by God “I Am that I Am,” but I am equal to what I
          was; for in this case there would be a diminution and increase which,
          as was showed, cannot be in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Again: God is of himself, from no other.596 Natures, which are
          made by God, may increase, because they began to be; they may
          decrease, because they were made of nothing, and so tend to nothing;
          the condition of their original leads them to defect, and the power of
          their Creator brings them to increase. But God hath no original; he
          hath no defect, because he was not made of nothing: he hath no
          increase, because he had no beginning. He was before all things, and,
          therefore, depends upon no other thing which, by its own change, can
          bring any change upon him. That which is from itself cannot be
          changed, because it hath nothing before it, nothing more excellent
          than itself; but that which is from another as its first cause and
          chief good, may be changed by that which was its efficient cause and
          last end.597
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God is immutable in regard of knowledge. God hath known from all
          eternity all that which he can know, so that nothing is hid from him.
          He knows not at present any more than he hath known from eternity: and
          that which he knows now he always knows: “All things are open and
          naked before him” (Heb. iv. 13). A man is said to be changed in regard
          of knowledge, when he knows that now which he did not know before, or
          knows that to be false now which he thought true before, or has
          something for the object of his understanding now, which he had not
          before. But,

        <p>
          (1.) This would be repugnant to the wisdom and omniscience which
          belongs to the notions of a Deity. That cannot be God that is not
          infinitely wise; that cannot be infinitely wise that is either
          ignorant of, or mistaken in, his apprehension of any one thing. If God
          be changed in knowledge, it must be for want of wisdom; all change of
          this nature in creatures implies this defect preceding or accompanying
          it. Such a thought of God would have been unworthy of him that is
          “only wise,” that hath no mate for wisdom (1 Tim. i. 17); none wise
          beside himself. If he knew that thing this day which he knew not
          before, he would not be an “only wise” Being; for a being that did
          know everything at once might be conceived, and so a wiser being be
          apprehended by the mind of man. If God understood a thing at one time
          which he did not at another, he would be changed from ignorance to
          knowledge; as if he could not do that this day which he could do
          to‑morrow, he would be changed from impotence to power. He could not
          be always omniscient, because there might be yet something still to
          come which he yet knows not, though he may know all things that are
          past. What way soever you suppose a change, you must suppose a present
          or a past ignorance; if he be changed in his knowledge for the
          perfection of his understanding, he was ignorant before; if his
          understanding be impaired by the change, he is ignorant after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If God were changeable in his knowledge, it would make him unfit
          to be an object of trust to any rational creature. His revelations
          would want the due ground for entertainment, if his understanding were
          changeable; for that might be revealed as truth now which might prove
          false hereafter, and that as false now which hereafter might prove
          true; and so God would be an unfit object of obedience in regard of
          his precepts, and an unfit object of confidence in regard of his
          promises. For if he be changeable in knowledge he is defective in
          knowledge, and might promise that now which he would know afterwards
          was unfit to be promised, and, therefore, unfit to be performed. It
          would make him an incompetent object of dread, in regard of his
          threatenings; for he might threaten that now which he might know
          hereafter were not fit or just to be inflicted. A changeable mind and
          understanding cannot make a due and right judgment of things to be
          done, and things to be avoided; no wise man would judge it reasonable
          to trust a weak and flitting person. God must needs be unchangeable in
          his knowledge; but, as the schoolmen say, that, as the sun always
          shines, so God always knows; as the sun never ceaseth to shine, so God
          never ceaseth to know. Nothing can be hid from the vast compass of his
          understanding, no more than anything can shelter itself without the
          verge of his power. This farther appears in that,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. God knows by his own essence. He doth not know, as we do, by
          habits, qualities, species, whereby we may be mistaken at one time and
          rectified at another. He hath not an understanding distinct from his
          essence as we have, but being the most simple Being, his understanding
          is his essence; and as from the infiniteness of his essence we
          conclude the infiniteness of his understanding, so from the
          unchangeableness of his essence, we may justly conclude the
          unchangeableness of his knowledge. Since, therefore, God is without
          all composition, and his understanding is not distinct from his
          essence, what he knows, he knows by his essence, and there can then be
          no more mutability in his knowledge than there can be in his essence;
          and if there were any in that, he could not be God, because he would
          have the property of a creature. If his understanding then be his
          essence, his knowledge is as necessary, as unchangeable as his
          essence. As his essence eminently contains all perfections in itself,
          so his understanding comprehends all things past, present, and future,
          in itself. If his understanding and his essence were not one and the
          same, he were not simple, but compounded: if compounded, he would
          consist of parts; if he consisted of parts, he would not be an
          independent Being, and so would not be God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. God knows all things by one intuitive act. As there is no
          succession in his being, so that he is one thing now and another thing
          hereafter; so there is no succession in his knowledge. He knows things
          that are successive, before their existence and succession, by one
          single act of intuition; by one cast of his eye all things future are
          present to him in regard of his eternity and omnipresence; so that
          though there is a change and variation in the things known, yet his
          knowledge of them and their several changes in nature is invariable
          and unalterable. As imagine a creature that could see with his eye at
          one glance the whole compass of the heavens, by sending out beams from
          his eye without receiving any species from them, he would see the
          whole heavens uniformly, this part now in the east, then in the west,
          without any change in his eye, for he sees every part and every motion
          together; and though that great body varies and whirls about, and is
          in continual agitation, his eye remains steadfast, suffers no change,
          beholds all their motions at once and by one glance. God knows all
          things from eternity, and, therefore, perpetually knows them;598 the
          reason is because the Divine knowledge is infinite,599 and therefore,
          comprehends all knowable truths at once. An eternal knowledge
          comprehends in itself all time, and beholds past and present in the
          same manner, and, therefore, his knowledge is immutable: by one simple
          knowledge he considers the infinite spaces of past and future.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. God’s knowledge and will is the cause of all things and their
          successions.600 There can be no pretence of any changeableness of
          knowledge in God; but in this case, before things come to pass, he
          knows that they will come to pass; after they are come to pass, he
          knows that they are past, and slide away. This would be something if
          the succession of things were the cause of the Divine knowledge, as it
          is of our knowledge; but on the contrary, the Divine knowledge and
          will is the cause of the succession of them: God doth not know
          creatures because they are; but they are because he knows them: “All
          his works were known to him from the beginning of the world” (Acts xv.
          18). All his works were not known to him, if the events of all those
          works were not also known to him; if they were not known to him, how
          should he make them? he could not do anything ignorantly. He made them
          then after he knew them, and did not know them after he made them. His
          knowledge of them made a change in them; their existence made no
          change in his knowledge. He knew them when they were to be created, in
          the same manner that he knew them after they were created; before they
          were brought into act, as well as after they were brought into act;
          before they were made, they were, and were not; they were in the
          knowledge of God, when they were not in their own nature; God did not
          receive his knowledge from their existence, but his knowledge and will
          acted upon them to bring them into being.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Therefore the distinction of past and future makes no change in
          the knowledge of God. When a thing is past, God hath no more distinct
          knowledge of it after it is past, than he had when it was to come; all
          things were all in their circumstances of past, present, and to come;
          seen by his understanding, as they were determined by his will.601
          Besides, to know a day to be past or future, is only to know the state
          of that day in itself, and to know its relation to that which follows,
          and that which went before. This day wherein we are, if we consider it
          in the state wherein it was yesterday, it was to come, it was future;
          but if we consider it in that state wherein it will be to‑morrow, we
          understand it as past. This in man cannot be said to be a different
          knowledge of the thing itself, but only of the circumstance attending
          a thing, and the different relation of it. As I see the sun this day,
          I know it was up yesterday, I know it will be up to‑morrow; my
          knowledge of the sun is the same; if there be any change, it is in the
          sun, not in my knowledge; only I apply my knowledge to such particular
          circumstances. How much more must the knowledge of those things in God
          be unchangeable, who knows all those states, conditions, and
          circumstances, most perfectly from eternity; wherein there is no
          succession, no past or future, and therefore will know them forever!
          He always beholds the same thing; he sees, indeed, succession in
          things, and he sees a thing to be past which before was future. As
          from eternity he saw Adam as existing in such a time; in the first
          time he saw that he would be, in the following time he saw that he had
          been; but this he knew from eternity; this he knew in the same manner;
          though there was a variation in Adam, yet there was no variation in
          God’s knowledge of him, in all his states; though Adam was not present
          to himself, yet in all his states he was present to God’s eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. Consider, that the knowledge of God, in regard of the manner of
          it, as well as the objects, is incomprehensible to a finite creature.
          So that though we cannot arrive to a full understanding of the manner
          of God’s knowledge, yet we must conceive so of it, as to remove all
          imperfection from him in it. And since it is an imperfection to be
          changeable, we must remove that from God; the knowledge of God about
          things past, present and future, must be inconceivably above ours:
          “His understanding is infinite” (Ps. cxlvii. 5). There is no number of
          it; it can no more be calculated or drawn into an account by us, than
          infinite spaces, which have no bounds and limits, can be measured by
          us. We can no more arrive, even in heaven, to a comprehensive
          understanding of the manner of his knowledge, than of the infinite
          glory of his essence; we may as well comprehend one as the other. This
          we must conclude, that God being not a body, doth not see one thing
          with eyes, and another thing with mind, as we do; but being a spirit,
          he sees and knows only with mind, and his mind is himself, and is as
          unchangeable as himself; and therefore as he is not now another thing
          than what he was, so he knows not anything now in another manner than
          as he knew it from eternity; he sees all things in the glass of his
          own essence; as, therefore, the glass doth not vary, so neither doth
          his vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God is unchangeable in regard of his will and purpose. A change in
          his purpose is, when a man determines to do that now which before he
          determined not to do, or to do the contrary; when a man hates that
          thing which he loved, or begins to love that which he before hated;
          when the will is changed, a man begins to will that which he willed
          not before, and ceaseth to will that which he willed before. But
          whatsoever God hath decreed, is immutable; whatsoever God hath
          promised, shall be accomplished: “The word that goes forth of his
          mouth shall not return to him void, but it shall accomplish that which
          he pleaseth” (Isa. lv. 11); whatsoever “he purposeth, he will do”
          (Isa. xlvi. 11; Numb. xxiii. 19); his decrees are therefore called
          “mountains of brass” (Zech. vi. 1): brass, as having substance and
          solidity; mountains, as being immovable, not only by any creature, but
          by himself; because they stand upon the basis of infallible wisdom,
          and are supported by uncontrollable power. From this immutability of
          his will, published to man, there could be no release from the
          severity of the law, without satisfaction made by the death of a
          Mediator, since it was the unalterable will of God, that death should
          be the wages of sin; and from this immutable will it was, that the
          length of time, from the first promise of the Redeemer to his mission,
          and the daily provocations of men, altered not his purpose for the
          accomplishment of it in the fulness of that time he had resolved upon;
          nor did the wickedness of former ages hinder the addition of several
          promises as buttresses to the first. To make this out, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The will of God is the same with his essence. If God had a will
          distinct from his essence, he would not be the most simple Being. God
          hath not a faculty of will distinct from himself; as his understanding
          is nothing else but Deus intelligens, God understanding; so his will
          is nothing else but Deus volens, God willing; being, therefore, the
          essence of God; though it is considered, according to our weakness, as
          a faculty, it is as his understanding and wisdom, eternal and
          immutable; and can no more be changed than his essence. The
          immutability of the Divine counsel depends upon that of his essence;
          he is the Lord Jehovah, therefore he is true to his word (Mal. iii. 6;
          Isa. xliii. 13): “Yea, before the day I am he, and there is none that
          can deliver out of my hand.” He is the same, immutable in his essence,
          therefore irresistible in his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) There is a concurrence of God’s will and understanding in
          everything. As his knowledge is eternal, so is his purpose. Things
          created had not been known to be, had not God resolved them to be the
          act of his will; the existence of anything supposeth an act of his
          will. Again, as God knows all things by one simple vision of his
          understanding, so he wills all things by one act of volition;
          therefore the purpose of God in the Scripture is not expressed by
          counsels in the plural number, but counsel; showing that all the
          purposes of God are not various, but as one will, branching itself out
          into many acts towards the creature; but all knit in one root, all
          links of one chain. Whatsoever is eternal is immutable; as his
          knowledge is eternal, and therefore immutable, so is his will; he
          wills or nills nothing to be in time, but what he willed and nilled
          from eternity; if he willed in time that to be that he willed not from
          eternity, then he would know that in time which he knew not from
          eternity; for God knows nothing future, but as his will orders it to
          be future, and in time to be brought into being.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) There can be no reason for any change in the will of God. When
          men change in their minds, it must be for want of foresight; because
          they could not foresee all the rubs and bars which might suddenly
          offer themselves; which if they had foreseen, they would not have
          taken such measures: hence men often will that which they afterwards
          wish they had not willed when they come to understand it clearer, and
          see that to be injurious to them which they thought to be good for
          them; or else the change proceeds from a natural instability without
          any just cause, and an easiness to be drawn into that which is
          unrighteous; or else it proceeds from a want of power, when men take
          new counsels, because they are invincibly hindered from executing the
          old. But none of those can be in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. It cannot be for want of foresight. What can be wanting to an
          infinite understanding? How can any unknown event defeat his purpose,
          since nothing happens in the world but what he wills to effect, or
          wills to permit; and therefore all future events are present with him?
          Besides, it doth not consist with God’s wisdom to resolve anything,
          but upon the highest reason; and what is the highest and infinite
          reason, cannot but be unalterable in itself; for there can be no
          reason and wisdom higher than the highest. All God’s purposes are not
          bare acts of will, but acts of counsel. “He works all things according
          to the counsel of his own will” (Eph. i. 11): and he doth not say so
          much that his will, as that “his counsel shall stand” (Isa. xlvi. 10).
          It stands, because it is counsel; and the immutability of a promise is
          called the “immutability of his counsel” (Heb. vi. 17), as being
          introduced and settled by the most perfect wisdom, and therefore to be
          carried on to a full and complete execution; his purpose, then, cannot
          be changed for want of foresight; for this would be a charge of
          weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. Nor can it proceed from a natural instability of his will, or an
          easiness to be drawn to that which is unrighteous. If his will should
          not adhere to his counsel, it is because it is not fit to be followed,
          or because it will not follow it; if not fit to be followed, it is a
          reflection upon his wisdom; if it be established, and he will not
          follow it, there is a contrariety in God, as there is in a fallen
          creature, will against wisdom. That cannot be in God which he hates in
          a creature, viz. the disorder of faculties, and being out of their due
          place. The righteousness of God is like a “great mountain” (Ps. xxxvi.
          6). The rectitude of his nature is as immovable in itself, as all the
          mountains in the world are by the strength of man. “He is not as a
          man, that he should repent or lie” (Numb. xxiii. 19); who often
          changes, out of a perversity of will, as well as want of wisdom to
          foresee, or want of ability to perform. His eternal purpose must
          either be righteous or unrighteous; if righteous and holy, he would
          become unholy by the change; if not righteous nor holy, then he was
          unrighteous before the change; which way soever it falls, it would
          reflect upon the righteousness of God, which is a blasphemous
          imagination.602 If God did change his purpose, it must be either for
          the better,—then the counsel of God was bad before; or for the
          worse,—then he was not wise and good before.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. Nor can it be for want of strength. Who hath power to control him?
          Not all the combined devices and endeavors of men can make the counsel
          of God to totter (Prov. xix. 21): “There are many devices in a man’s
          heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand;” that,
          and that only shall stand. Man hath a power to devise and imagine, but
          no power to effect and execute of himself. God wants no more power to
          effect what he will, than he wants understanding to know what is fit.
          Well, then, since God wanted not wisdom to frame his decrees, nor
          holiness to regulate them, nor power to effect them, what should make
          him change them? since there can be no reason superior to his, no
          event unforeseen by him, no holiness comparable to his, no
          unrighteousness found in him, no power equal to his, to put a rub in
          his way.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. Though the will of God be immutable, yet it is not to be
          understood so, as that the things themselves so willed are immutable.
          Nor will the immutability of the things willed by him, follow upon the
          unchangeableness of his will in willing them; though God be firm in
          willing them, yet he doth not will that they should alway be. God did
          not perpetually will the doing those things which he once decreed to
          be done; he decreed that Christ should suffer, but he did not decree
          that Christ should alway suffer; so he willed the Mosaical rites for a
          time, but he did not will that they should alway continue; he willed
          that they should endure only for a time; and when the time came for
          their ceasing, God had been mutable if he had not put an end to them,
          because his will had fixed such a period. So that the changing of
          those things which he had once appointed to be practised, is so far
          from charging God with changeableness, that God would be mutable if he
          did not take them away; since he decreed as well their abolition at
          such a time, as their continuance till such a time; so that the
          removal of them was pursuant to his unchangeable will and decree. If
          God had decreed that such laws should alway continue, and afterwards
          changed that decree, and resolved the abrogation of them, then indeed
          God had been mutable; he had rescinded one decree by another; he had
          then seen an error in his first resolve, and there must be some
          weakness in the reason and wisdom whereon it was grounded.603 But it
          was not so here; for the change of those laws is so far from slurring
          God with any mutability, that the very change of them is no other than
          the issue of his eternal decree; for from eternity he purposed in
          himself to change this or that dispensation, though he did decree to
          bring such a dispensation into the world. The decree itself was
          eternal and immutable, but the thing decreed was temporary and
          mutable. As a decree from eternity doth not make the thing decreed to
          be eternal, so neither doth the immutability of the decree render the
          thing so decreed to be immutable: as for example, God decreed from all
          eternity to create the world; the eternity of this decree did not make
          the world to be in being and actually created from eternity; so God
          decreed immutably that the world so created should continue for such a
          time; the decree is immutable if the world perish at that time, and
          would not be immutable if the world did endure beyond that time that
          God hath fixed for the duration of it: as when a prince orders a man’s
          remaining in prison for so many days; if he be prevailed with to give
          him a delivery before those days, or to continue him in custody for
          the same crime after those days, his order is changed; but if he
          orders the delivery of him just at that time, till which he had before
          decreed that he should continue in prison, the purpose and order of
          the prince remains firm, and the change in the state of the prisoner
          is the fruit of that firm and fixed resolution: so that we must
          distinguish between the person decreeing, the decree itself, and the
          thing decreed. The person decreeing, viz., God, is in himself
          immutable, and the decree is immutable; but the thing decreed may be
          mutable; and if it were not changed according to the first purpose, it
          would argue the decree itself to be changed; for while a man wills
          that this may be done now, and another thing done afterwards, the same
          will remains; and though there be a change in the effects, there is no
          change in the will.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. The immutability of God’s will doth not infringe the liberty of
          it. The liberty of God’s will consists with the necessity of
          continuing his purpose. God is necessarily good, immutably good; yet
          he is freely so, and would not be otherwise than what he is. God was
          free in his first purpose; and purposing this or that by an infallible
          and unerring wisdom, it would be a weakness to change the purpose.
          But, indeed, the liberty of God’s will doth not seem so much to
          consist in an indifferency to this or that, as in an independency on
          anything without himself: his will was free, because it did not depend
          upon the objects about which his will was conversant. To be immutably
          good is no point of imperfection, but the height of perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. As God is unchangeable in regard of essence, knowledge, purpose, so
          he is unchangeable in regard of place. He cannot be changed in time,
          because he is eternity; so he cannot be changed in place, because he
          hath ubiquity: he is eternal, therefore cannot be changed in time; he
          is omnipresent, therefore cannot be changed in place: he doth not
          begin to be in one place wherein he was not before, or cease to be in
          a place wherein he was before. He that fills every place in heaven and
          earth, cannot change place; he cannot leave one to possess another,
          that is equally, in regard of his essence, in all: “He fills heaven
          and earth” (Jer. xxiii. 24). The heavens that are not subject to those
          changes to which sublunary bodies are subject, that are not diminished
          in quantity or quality; yet they are alway changing place in regard of
          their motion; no part of them doth alway continue in the same point:
          but God hath no change of his nature, because he is most inward in
          everything; he is substantially in all spaces, real and imaginary;
          there is no part of the world which he doth not fill; no place can be
          imagined wherein he doth not exist. Suppose a million of worlds above
          and about this, encircling one another; his essence would be in every
          part and point of those worlds; because it is indivisible, it cannot
          be divided; nor can it be contained within those created limits of
          millions of worlds, when the most soaring and best coining fancy hath
          run through all creatures to the highest sphere of the heavens, and
          imagined one world after another, till it can fancy no more: none of
          these, nor all of these, can contain God; for the “heaven of heavens
          cannot contain him” (1 Kings viii. 27); “He is higher than heaven,
          deeper than hell” (Job xi. 8), and possesses infinite imaginary spaces
          beyond created limits. He who hath no cause of being, can have no
          limits of being;604 and though by creation he began to be in the
          world, yet he did not begin to be where the world is, but was in the
          same imaginary space from all eternity; for he was alway in himself by
          his own eternal ubi. Therefore observe, that when God is said to draw
          near to us when we draw near to him (James iv. 8), it is not by local
          motion or change of place, but by special and spiritual influences, by
          exciting and supporting grace. As we ordinarily say, the sun is come
          into the house when yet it remains in its place and order in the
          heavens, because the beams pierce through the windows and enlighten
          the room, so when God is said to come down or descend (Gen. xi. 5;
          Exod. xxxiv. 5), it is not by a change of place, but a change of
          outward acts, when he puts forth himself in ways of fresh mercy or new
          judgments, in the effluxes of his love or the flames of his wrath.
          When good men feel the warm beams of his grace refreshing them, or
          wicked men feel the hot coals of his anger scorching them. God’s
          drawing near to us is not so much his coming to us, but his drawing us
          to him;605 as when watermen pull a rope that is in one end fastened to
          the shore, and the other end to the vessel; the shore is immovable,
          yet it seems to the eye to come to them, but they really move to the
          shore. God is an immovable rock; we are floating and uncertain
          creatures; while he seems to approach to us, he doth really make us to
          approach to him; he comes not to us by any change of place himself,
          but draws us to him by a change of mind, will, and affections in us.
        </p>

          II. The second thing propounded, is the reasons to prove God
          immutable. The heathens acknowledged God to be so: Plato606 and the
          Pythagoreans called God, or the stable good principle, αὐτόν, idem:
          the evil principle, ἕτερον, another thing, changeable; one thing one
          time, and another thing another time607 (Dan. vi. 26): “He is the
          living God, and steadfast forever.”
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The name Jehovah signifies this attribute (Exod. iii. 14): “I am
          that I am; I am hath sent me to you.” It signifies his immutability as
          well as eternity. I am, signifies his eternity; that, or the same that
          I am, his immutability:608 as it respects the essence of God, it
          signifies his unchangeable being from eternity to eternity; as it
          respects the creature, it signifies his constancy in his counsels and
          promises, which spring from no other cause but the unchangeableness of
          his nature.609 The reason why men stand not to their covenant, is
          because they are not always the same; I am, that is, I am the same,
          before the creation of the world, and since the creation of the world;
          before the entrance of sin, and since the entrance of sin; before
          their going into Egypt, and while they remain in Egypt. The very name
          Jehovah610 bears, according to the grammatical order, a mark of God’s
          unchangeableness; it never hath anything added to it, nor anything
          taken from it; it hath no plural number, no affixes—a custom peculiar
          to the eastern languages; it never changes its letters as other words
          do. That only is a true being which hath not only an eternal
          existence, but stability in it: that is not truly a being, that never
          remains in the same state.611 All things that are changed cease to be
          what they were, and begin to be what they were not, and therefore
          cannot have the title truly applied to them, they are; they are,
          indeed, but like a river in a continual flux, that no man ever sees
          the same; let his eye be fixed upon one place of it, the water he
          sees, slides away, and that which he saw not succeeds in its place;
          let him take his eye off but for the least moment, and fix it there
          again, and he sees not the same that he saw before. All sensible
          things are in a perpetual stream; that which is sometimes this and
          sometimes that, is not, because it is not always the same; whatsoever
          is changed, is something now which it was not alway; but of God it is
          said, I am, which could not be if he were changeable; for it may be
          said of him, he is not, as well as he is, because he is not what he
          was; if we say not of him, he was, nor he will be, but only he is,
          whence should any change arrive? He must invincibly remain the same,
          of whose nature, perfections, knowledge and will, it cannot be said it
          was, as if it were not now in him; or it shall be, as if it were not
          yet in him; but he is, because he doth not only exist, but doth alway
          exist the same. I am, that is, I receive from no other what I am in
          myself; he depends upon no other in his essence, knowledge, purposes,
          and therefore hath no changing power over him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If God were changeable, he could not be the most perfect Being. God
          is the most perfect Being, and possesses in himself infinite and
          essential goodness (Matt. v. 48): “Your heavenly Father is perfect.”
          If he could change from that perfection, he were not the highest
          exemplar and copy for us to write after. If God doth change, it must
          be either to a greater perfection than he had before, or to a less,
          mutatio perfectiva vel amissiva; if he changes to acquire a perfection
          he had not, then he was not before the most excellent Being;
          necessarily, he was not what he might be; there was a defect in him,
          and a privation of that which is better than what he had and was; and
          then he was not alway the best, and so was not alway God; and being
          not alway God, could never be God; for to begin to be God is against
          the notion of God; not to a less perfection than he had; that were to
          change to imperfection, and to lose a perfection which he possessed
          before, and cease to be the best Being; for he would lose some good
          which he had, and acquire some evil which he was free from before. So
          that the sovereign perfection of God is an invincible bar to any
          change in him; for which way soever you cast it for a change, his
          supreme excellency is impaired and nulled by it: for in all change
          there is something from which a thing is changed, and something to
          which it is changed; so that on the one part there is a loss of what
          it had, and on the other part there is an acquisition of what it had
          not. If to the better, he was not perfect, and so was not God; if to
          the worse, he will not be perfect, and so be no longer God after that
          change. If God be changed, his change must be voluntary or necessary;
          if voluntary, he then intends the change for the better, and chose it
          to acquire a perfection by it; the will must be carried out to
          anything under the notion of some goodness in that which it desires.
          Since good is the object of the desire and will of the creature, evil
          cannot be the object of the desire and will of the Creator. And if he
          should be changed for the worse, when he did really intend the better,
          it would speak a defect of wisdom, and a mistake of that for good
          which was evil and imperfect in itself; and if it be for the better,
          it must be a motion or change for something without himself; that
          which he desireth is not possessed by himself, but by some other.
          There is, then, some good without him and above him, which is the end
          in this change; for nothing acts but for some end, and that end is
          within itself or without itself; if the end for which God changes be
          without himself, then there is something better than himself: besides,
          if he were voluntarily changed for the better, why did he not change
          before? If it were for want of power, he had the imperfection of
          weakness; if for want of knowledge of what was the best good, he had
          the imperfection of wisdom, he was ignorant of his own happiness; if
          he had both wisdom to know it, and power to effect it, it must be for
          want of will; he then wanted that love to himself and his own glory,
          which is necessary in the Supreme Being. Voluntarily he could not be
          changed for the worse, he could not be such an enemy to his own glory;
          there is nothing but would hinder its own imperfection and becoming
          worse. Necessarily he could not be changed, for that necessity must
          arise from himself, and then the difficulties spoken of before will
          recur, or it must arise from another; he cannot be bettered by
          another, because nothing hath any good but what it hath received from
          the hands of his bounty, and that without loss to himself, nor made
          worse; if anything made him worse, it would be sin, but that cannot
          touch his essence or obscure his glory, but in the design and nature
          of the sin itself (Job xxxv. 6, 7): “If thou sinnest, what dost thou
          against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what dost thou
          unto him? if thou be righteous, what givest thou him; or what receives
          he at thy hand?” He hath no addition by the service of man, no more
          than the sun hath of light by a multitude of torches kindled on the
          earth; nor any more impair by the sins of men, than the light of the
          sun hath by men’s shooting arrows against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God were not the most simple being if he were not immutable.612
          There is in everything that is mutable a composition either essential
          or accidental; and in all changes, something of the thing changed
          remains, and something of it ceaseth and is done away; as for example,
          in an accidental change, if a white wall be made black, it loses its
          white color; but the wall itself, which was the subject of that color,
          remains and loses nothing of its substance: likewise in a substantial
          change, as when wood is burnt, the substantial part of wood is lost,
          the earthly part is changed into ashes, the airy part ascends in
          smoke, the watery part is changed into air by the fire: there is not
          an annihilation of it, but a resolution of it into those parts whereof
          it was compounded; and this change doth evidence that it was
          compounded of several parts distinct from one another. If there were
          any change in God, it is by separating something from him, or adding
          something to him; if by separating something from him, then he was
          compounded of something distinct from himself; for if it were not
          distinct from himself it could not be separated from him without loss
          of his being; if by adding anything to him, then it is a compounding
          of him, either substantially or accidentally. Mutability is absolutely
          inconsistent with simplicity, whether the change come from an internal
          or external principle. If a change be wrought by something without, it
          supposeth either contrary or various parts in the thing so changed,
          whereof it doth consist; if it be wrought by anything within, it
          supposeth that the thing so changed doth consist of one part that doth
          change it, and another part that is changed, and so it would not be a
          simple being. If God could be changed by anything within himself, all
          in God would not be God; his essence would depend upon some parts,
          whereof some would be superior to others; if one part were able to
          change or destroy another, that which doth change would be God, that
          which is changed would not be God; so God would be made up of a Deity
          and a non‑Deity, and part of God would depend upon God; part would be
          dependent, and part would be independent; part would be mutable, part
          immutable: so that mutability is against the notion of God’s
          independency as well as his simplicity. God is the most simple being;
          for that which is first in nature, having nothing beyond it, cannot by
          any means be thought to be compounded; for whatsoever is so, depends
          upon the parts whereof it is compounded, and so is not the first
          being: now God being infinitely simple, hath nothing in himself which
          is not himself, and therefore cannot will any change in himself, he
          being his own essence and existence.613
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God were not eternal if he were mutable. In all change there is
          something that perishes, either substantially or accidentally. All
          change is a kind of death, or imitation of death; that which was dies,
          and begins to be what it was not. The soul of man, though it ceaseth
          not to be and exist, yet when it ceaseth to be in quality what it was,
          is said to die. Adam died when he changed from integrity to
          corruption, though both his soul and body were in being (Gen. ii. 17);
          and the soul of a regenerate man is said to “die to sin,” when it is
          changed from sin to grace (Rom. vi. 11). In all change there is a
          resemblance of death; so the notion of mutability is against the
          eternity of God. If anything be acquired by a change, then that which
          is acquired was not from eternity, and so he was not wholly eternal;
          if anything be lost which was from eternity, he is not wholly
          everlasting; if he did decrease by the change, something in him which
          had no beginning would have an end; if he did increase by that change,
          something in him would have a beginning that might have no end. What
          is changed doth not remain, and what doth not remain is not
          eternal.614 Though God alway remains in regard of existence, he would
          be immortal, and live alway; yet if he should suffer any change, he
          could not properly be eternal, because he would not alway be the same,
          and would not in every part be eternal; for all change is finished in
          time, one moment preceding, another moment following; but that which
          is before time cannot be changed by time. God cannot be eternally what
          he was; that is, he cannot have a true eternity, if he had a new
          knowledge, a new purpose, a new essence; if he were sometimes this and
          sometimes that, sometimes know this and sometimes know that, sometimes
          purpose this and afterwards hath a new purpose; he would be partly
          temporary and partly eternal, not truly and universally eternal. He
          that hath anything of newness, hath not properly and truly an entire
          eternity. Again, by the same reason that God could in the least cease
          to be what he was, he might also cease wholly to be; and no reason can
          be rendered why God might not cease wholly to be, as well as cease to
          be entirely and uniformly what he was. All changeableness implies a
          corruptibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If God were changeable, he were not infinite and almighty. All
          change ends in addition or diminution; if anything be added, he was
          not infinite before, if anything be diminished, he is not infinite
          after. All change implies bounds and limits to that which is changed;
          but God is infinite; “His greatness is unsearchable:”615 we can add
          number to number without any end, and can conceive an infinite number;
          yet the greatness of God is beyond all our conceptions. But if there
          could be any change in his greatness for the better, it would not be
          unsearchable before that change; if for the worse, it would not be
          unsearchable after that change. Whatsoever hath limits and is
          changeable, is conceivable and searchable; but God is not only not
          known, but impossible in his own nature to be known and searched out,
          and, therefore, impossible to have any diminution in his nature. All
          that which is changed arrives to something which it was not before, or
          ceaseth in part to be what it was before. He would not also be
          almighty. What is omnipotent cannot be made worse; for to be made
          worse, is in part to be corrupted. If he be made better, he was not
          almighty before; something of power was wanting to him. If there
          should be any change, it must proceed from himself or from another; if
          from himself, it would be an inability to preserve himself in the
          perfection of his nature; if from another, he would be inferior in
          strength, knowledge, and power, to that which changes him, either in
          his nature, knowledge, or will; in both an inability; an inability in
          him to continue the same, or an inability in him to resist the power
          of another.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The world could not be ordered and governed but by some Principle
          or Being which were immutable. Principles are alway more fixed and
          stable than things which proceed from those principles; and this is
          true both in morals and naturals. Principles in conscience, whereby
          men are governed, remain firmly engraven in their minds. The root lies
          firmly in the earth, while branches are shaken with the wind. The
          heavens, the cause of generation, are more firm and stable than those
          things which are wrought by their influence. All things in the world
          are moved by some power and virtue which is stable; and unless it were
          so, no order would be observed in motion, no motion could be regularly
          continued. He could not be a full satisfaction to the infinite desire
          of the souls of his people. Nothing can truly satisfy the soul of man
          but rest; and nothing can give it rest but that which is perfect and
          immutably perfect; for else it would be subject to those agitations
          and variations which the being it depends upon is subject to. The
          principle of all things must be immutable,616 which is described by
          some by a unity, the principle of number, wherein there is a
          resemblance of God’s unchangeableness. A unit is not variable; it
          continues in its own nature immutably a unit. It never varies from
          itself; it cannot be changed from itself; but is, as it were, so
          omnipotent towards others, that it changes all numbers. If you add any
          number, it is the beginning of that number, but the unit is not
          increased by it; a new number ariseth from that addition, but the unit
          still remains the same, and adds value to other figures, but receives
          none from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third thing to speak to is, that immutability is proper to
          God, and incommunicable to any creature. Mutability is natural to
          every creature as a creature, and immutability is the sole perfection
          of God. He only is infinite wisdom, able to foreknow future events; he
          only is infinitely powerful, able to call forth all means to effect;
          so that wanting neither wisdom to contrive, nor strength to execute,
          he cannot alter his counsel. None being above him, nothing in him
          contrary to him, and being defective in no blessedness and perfection,
          he cannot vary in his essence and nature. Had not immutability as well
          as eternity been a property solely pertaining to the Divine nature, as
          well as creative power and eternal duration, the apostle’s argument to
          prove Christ to be God from this perpetual sameness, had come short of
          any convincing strength. These words of the text he applies to Christ
          (Heb. i. 10‒12): “They shall be changed, but thou art the same.” There
          had been no strength in the reason, if immutability by nature did
          belong to any creature.
        </p>
        <p>The changeableness of all creatures is evident:</p>
        <p>
          1. Of corporeal creatures it is evident to sense. All plants and
          animals, as they have their duration bounded in certain limits; so
          while they do exist, they proceed from their rise to their fall. They
          pass through many sensible alterations, from one degree of growth to
          another, from buds to blossoms, from blossoms to flowers and fruits.
          They come to their pitch that nature had set them, and return back to
          the state from whence they sprung; there is not a day but they make
          some acquisition, or suffer some loss. They die and spring up every
          day; nothing in them more certain than their inconstancy: “The
          creature is subject to vanity” (Rom. viii. 20). The heavenly bodies
          are changing their place; the sun every day is running his race, and
          stays not in the same point; and though they are not changed in their
          essence, yet they are in their place. Some, indeed, say there is a
          continual generation of light in the sun, as there is a loss of light
          by the casting out its beams, as in a fountain there is a flowing out
          of the streams, and a continual generation of supply. And though these
          heavenly bodies have kept their standing and motion from the time of
          their creation, yet both the sun’s standing still in Joshua’s time,
          and its going back in Hezekiah’s time, show that they are changeable
          at the pleasure of God. But in man the change is perpetually visible;
          every day there is a change from ignorance to knowledge, from one will
          to another, from passion to passion, sometimes sad and sometimes
          cheerful, sometimes craving this, and presently nauseating it; his
          body changes from health to sickness, or from weakness to strength;
          some alteration there is either in body or mind. Man, who is the
          noblest creature, the subordinate end of the creation of other things,
          cannot assure himself of a consistency and fixedness in anything the
          short space of a day, no, not of a minute. All his months are months
          of vanity (Job vii. 3); whence the Psalmist calls man at the “best
          estate altogether vanity,” a mere heap of vanity (Ps. xxxv.) As he
          contains in his nature the nature of all creatures, so he inherits in
          his nature the vanity of all creatures. A little world, the centre of
          the world and of the vanity of the world; yea, “lighter than vanity”
          (Ps. lxii. 9), more movable than a feather; tossed between passion and
          passion, daily changing his end, and changing the means; an image of
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Spiritual natures, as angels. They change not in their being, but
          that is from the indulgence of God. They change not in their goodness,
          but that is not from their nature, but divine grace in their
          confirmation; but they change in their knowledge; they know more by
          Christ than they did by creation (1 Tim. iii. 16). They have an
          addition of knowledge every day, by the providential dispensations of
          God to his church (Eph. iii. 10); and the increase of their
          astonishment and love is according to the increase of their knowledge
          and insight. They cannot have a new discovery without new admirations
          of what is discovered to them: there is a change in their joy when
          there is a change in a sinner (Luke xv. 10). They were changed in
          their essence, when they were made such glorious spirits of nothing;
          some of them were changed in their will, when of holy they became
          impure. The good angels were changed in their understandings, when the
          glories of God in Christ were presented to their view; and all can be
          changed in their essence again; and as they were made of nothing, so
          by the power of God may be reduced to nothing again. So glorified
          souls shall have an unchanged operation about God, for they shall
          behold his face without any grief or fear of loss, without vagrant
          thoughts; but they can never be unchangeable in their nature, because
          they can never pass from finite to infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          No creature can be unchangeable in its nature:—1. Because every
          creature rose from nothing. As they rose from nothing, so they tend to
          nothing, unless they are preserved by God. The notion of a creature
          speaks changeableness; because to be a creature is to be made
          something of nothing, and, therefore, creation is a change of nothing
          into something. The being of a creature begins from change, and,
          therefore, the essence of a creature is subject to change. God only is
          uncreated, and, therefore, unchangeable. If he were made he could not
          be immutable; for the very making is a change of not being into being.
          All creatures were made good, as they were the fruits of God’s
          goodness and power; but must needs be mutable, because they were the
          extracts of nothing. 2. Because every creature depends purely upon the
          will of God. They depend not upon themselves, but upon another for
          their being. As they received their being from the word of his mouth
          and the arm of his power, so by the same word they can be cancelled
          into nothing, and return into as little significancy as when they were
          nothing. He that created them by a word, can by a word destroy them:
          if God should “take away their breath, they die, and return into their
          dust” (Ps. civ. 29). As it was in the power of the Creator that things
          might be, before they actually were, so it is in the power of the
          Creator that things after they are may cease to be what they are; and
          they are, in their own nature, as reducible to nothing as they were
          producible by the power of God from nothing; for there needs no more
          than an act of God’s will to null them, as there needed only an act of
          God’s will to make them. Creatures are all subject to a higher cause:
          they are all reputed as nothing. “He doth according to his will in the
          armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can
          stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou?” (Dan. iv. 35.) But
          God is unchangeable, because he is the highest good; none above him,
          all below him; all dependent on him; himself upon none. 3. No creature
          is absolutely perfect. No creature can be so perfect, or can ever be,
          but something by the infinite power of God may be added to it; for
          whatsoever is finite may receive greater additions, and, therefore, a
          change. No creature you can imagine, but in your thoughts you may
          fancy him capable of greater perfections than you know he hath, or
          than really he hath. The perfections of all creatures are searchable;
          the perfection of God is only unsearchable (Job xi. 6), and,
          therefore, he only immutable. God only is always the same. Time makes
          no addition to him, nor diminisheth anything of him. His nature and
          essence, his wisdom and will, have always been the same from eternity,
          and shall be the same to eternity, without any variation.

          IV. The fourth thing propounded is, Some propositions to clear this
          unchangeableness of God from anything that seems contrary to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. There was no change in God when he began to create the world
          in time. The creation was a real change, but the change was not
          subjectively in God, but in the creature; the creature began to be
          what it was not before. Creation is considered as active or
          passive.617 Active creation is the will and power of God to create.
          This is from eternity, because God willed from eternity to create in
          time; this never had beginning, for God never began in time to
          understand anything, to will anything, or to be able to do anything;
          but he alway understood and alway willed those things which he
          determined from eternity to produce in time. The decree of God may be
          taken for the act decreeing, that is eternal and the same, or for the
          object decreed, that is in time; so that there may be a change in the
          object, but not in the will whereby the object doth exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There was no change in God by the act of creation, because there
          was no new will in him. There was no new act of his will which was not
          before. The creation began in time, but the will of creating was from
          eternity. The work was new, but the decree whence that new work sprung
          was as ancient as the Ancient of Days. When the time of creating came,
          God was not made ex nolente volens, as we are; for whatsoever God
          willed to be now done, he willed from eternity to be done; but he
          willed also that it should not be done till such an instant of time,
          and that it should not exist before such a time. If God had willed the
          creation of the world only at that time when the world was produced,
          and not before, then, indeed, God had been changeable. But though God
          spake that word which he had not spoke before, whereby the world was
          brought into act; yet he did not will that will he willed not before.
          God did not create by a new counsel or new will, but by that which was
          from eternity (Eph. i. 9). All things are wrought according to that
          “purpose in himself,” and according to “the counsel of his will” (ver.
          11); and as the holiness of the elect is the fruit of his eternal will
          “before the foundation of the world” (ver. 4), so, likewise, is the
          existence of things, and of those persons whom he did elect. As when
          an artificer frames a house or a temple according to that model he had
          in his mind some years before, there is no change in the model in his
          mind; the artificer is the same, though the work is produced by him
          some time after he had framed that copy of it in his own mind, but
          there is a change of the thing produced by him according to that
          model. Or, when a rich man intends, four or five years hence, if he
          lives, to build a hospital, is there any change in will, when, after
          the expiration of that time, he builds and endows it? Though it be
          after his will, yet it is the fruit of his precedent will. So God,
          from all eternity, did will and command that the creatures should
          exist in such a part of time; and, by his eternal will, all things,
          whether past, present, or to come, did, do, and shall exist, at that
          point of time which that will did appoint for them: not, as though God
          had a new will when things stood up in being, but only that which was
          prepared in his immutable counsel and will from eternity, doth then
          appear. There can be no instant fixed from eternity, wherein it can be
          said, God did not will the creation of the world; for had the will of
          God for the shortest moment been undetermined to the creation of the
          world, and afterwards resolved upon it, there had been a moral change
          in God from not willing to willing; but this there was not, for God
          executes nothing in time which he had not ordained from eternity, and
          appointed all the means and circumstances whereby it should be brought
          about. As the determination of our Saviour to suffer was not a new
          will, but an eternal counsel, and wrought no change in God (Acts ii.
          23).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is no change in God by the act of creation, because there was
          no new power in God. Had God had a will at the time of creation which
          he had not before, there had been a moral change in him; so had there
          been in him a power only to create then and not before, there had been
          a physical change in him from weakness to ability. There can be no
          more new power in God, than there can be a new will in God; for his
          will is his power, and what he willeth to effect, that he doth effect:
          as he was unchangeably holy, so he was unchangeably almighty, “which
          was, and is, and is to come” (Rev. iv. 8); which was almighty, and is
          almighty, and ever will be almighty. The work therefore makes no
          change in God, but there is a change in the thing wrought by that
          power of God. Suppose you had a seal engraven upon some metal a
          hundred years old, or as old as the creation, and you should this day,
          so many ages after the engraving of it, make an impression of that
          seal upon wax; would you say the engravement upon the seal were
          changed, because it produced that stamp upon the wax now which it did
          not before? No, the change is purely in the wax, which receives a new
          figure or form by the impression; not in the seal, that was capable of
          imprinting the same long before. God was the same from eternity as he
          was when he made a signature of himself upon the creatures by
          creation, and is no more changed by stamping them into several forms,
          than the seal is changed by making impression upon the wax. As when a
          house is enlightened by the sun, or that which was cold is heated by
          it, there is a change in the house from darkness to light, from
          coldness to heat; but is there any change in the light and heat of the
          sun? There is a change in the thing enlightened or warmed by that
          light and heat which remains fixed and constant in the sun, which was
          as capable in itself to produce the same effects before, as at that
          instant when it works them; so when God is the author of a new work,
          he is not changed, because he works it by an eternal will and an
          eternal power.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Nor is there any new relation acquired by God by the creation of
          the world. There was a new relation acquired by the creature, as, when
          a man sins, he hath another relation to God than he had before,—he
          hath relation to God, as a criminal to a Judge; but there is no change
          in God, but in the malefactor. The being of men makes no more change
          in God than the sins of men. As a tree is now on our right hand, and
          by our turning about it is on our left hand, sometimes before us,
          sometimes behind us, according to our motion near it or about it, and
          the turning of the body; there is no change in the tree, which remains
          firm and fixed in the earth, but the change is wholly in the posture
          of the body, whereby the tree may be said to be before us or behind
          us, or on the right hand or on the left hand.618 God gained no new
          relation of Lord or Creator by the creation; for though he had created
          nothing to rule over, yet he had the power to create and rule, though
          he did not create and rule: as a man may be called a skilful writer,
          though he does not write, because he is able to do it when he pleases;
          or a man skilful in physic is called a physician, though he doth not
          practise that skill, or discover his art in the distribution of
          medicines, because he may do it when he pleases; it depends upon his
          own will to show his art when he has a mind to it. So the name Creator
          and Lord belongs to God from eternity, because he could create and
          rule, though he did not create and rule. But, howsoever, if there were
          any such change of relation, that God may be called Creator and Lord
          after the creation and not before, it is not a change in essence, nor
          in knowledge, nor in will; God gains no perfection nor diminution by
          it; his knowledge is not increased by it; he is no more by it than he
          was, and will be, if all those things ceased; and therefore Austin
          illustrates it by this similitude:—as a piece of money when it is
          given as the price of a thing, or deposited only as a pledge for the
          security of a thing borrowed; the coin is the same, and is not
          changed, though the relation it had as a pledge and as a price be
          different from one another: so that suppose any new relation be added,
          yet there is nothing happens to the nature of God which may infer any
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. There was no change in the Divine nature of the Son, when he
          assumed human nature. There was an union of the two natures, but no
          change of the Deity into the humanity, or of the humanity into the
          Deity: both preserved their peculiar properties. The humanity was
          changed by a communication of excellent gifts from the divine nature,
          not by being brought into an equality with it, for that was impossible
          that a creature should become equal to the Creator. He took the “form
          of a servant,” but he lost not the form of God; he despoiled not
          himself of the perfections of the Deity. He was indeed emptied, “and
          became of no reputation” (Phil. ii. 7); but he did not cease to be
          God, though he was reputed to be only a man, and a very mean one too.
          The glory of his divinity was not extinguished nor diminished, though
          it was obscured and darkened, under the veil of our infirmities; but
          there was no more change in the hiding of it, than there is in the
          body of the sun when it is shadowed by the interposition of a cloud.
          His blood while it was pouring out from his veins was the “blood of
          God” (Acts xx. 28); and, therefore, when he was bowing the head of his
          humanity upon the cross, he had the nature and perfections of God; for
          had he ceased to be God, he had been a mere creature, and his
          sufferings would have been of as little value and satisfaction as the
          sufferings of a creature. He could not have been a sufficient
          Mediator, had he ceased to be God: and he had ceased to be God, had he
          lost any one perfection proper to the divine nature; and losing none,
          he lost not this of unchangeableness, which is none of the meanest
          belonging to the Deity. Why by his union with the human nature should
          he lose this, any more than he lost his omniscience, which he
          discovered by his knowledge of the thoughts of men; or his mercy,
          which he manifested to the height in the time of his suffering? That
          is truly a change, when a thing ceaseth to be what it was before: this
          was not in Christ; he assumed our nature without laying aside his own.
          When the soul is united to the body, doth it lose any of those
          perfections that are proper to its nature? Is there any change either
          in the substance or qualities of it? No; but it makes a change in the
          body, and of a dull lump it makes it a living mass, conveys vigor and
          strength to it, and, by its power, quickens it to sense and motion.619
          So did the divine nature and human remain entire; there was no change
          of the one into the other, as Christ by a miracle changed water into
          wine, or men by art change sand or ashes into glass: and when he prays
          “for the glory he had with God before the world was” (John xvii. 5),
          he prays that a glory he had in his Deity might shine forth in his
          person as Mediator, and be evidenced in that height and splendor
          suitable to his dignity, which had been so lately darkened by his
          abasement; that as he had appeared to be the Son of Man in the
          infirmity of the flesh, he might appear to be the Son of God in the
          glory of his person, that he might appear to be the Son of God and the
          Son of Man in one person.620 Again, there could be no change in this
          union; for, in a real change, something is acquired which was not
          possessed before, neither formally nor eminently: but the divinity had
          from eternity, before the incarnation, all the perfections of the
          human nature eminently in a nobler manner than they are in themselves,
          and therefore could not be changed by a real union.621

          Prop. III. Repentance and other affections ascribed to God in
          Scripture, argue no change in God. We often read of God’s repenting,
          repenting of the good he promised (Jer. xviii. 10), and of the evil he
          threatened (Exod. xxxii. 14; John iii. 10), or of the work he hath
          wrought (Gen. vi. 6). We must observe, therefore, that,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Repentance is not properly in God. He is a pure Spirit, and is not
          capable of those passions which are signs of weakness and impotence,
          or subject to those regrets we are subject to. Where there is a proper
          repentance there is a want of foresight, an ignorance of what would
          succeed, or a defect in the examination of the occurrences which might
          fall within consideration. All repentance of a fact is grounded upon a
          mistake in the event which was not foreseen, or upon an after
          knowledge of the evil of the thing which was acted by the person
          repenting. But God is so wise that he cannot err, so holy he cannot do
          evil; and his certain prescience, or foreknowledge, secures him
          against any unexpected events. God doth not act but upon clear and
          infallible reason; and a change upon passion is accounted by all so
          great a weakness in man, that none can entertain so unworthy a conceit
          of God. Where he is said to repent (Gen. vi. 6), he is also said to
          grieve; now no proper grief can be imagined to be in God. As
          repentance is inconsistent with infallible foresight, so is grief no
          less inconsistent with undefiled blessedness. God is “blessed forever”
          (Rom. ix. 8), and therefore nothing can befall him that can stain that
          blessedness. His blessedness would be impaired and interrupted while
          he is repenting, though he did soon rectify that which is the cause of
          his repentance. “God is of one mind, and who can turn him? what his
          soul desires that he doth” (Job xxiii. 13).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But God accommodates himself in the Scripture to our weak capacity.
          God hath no more of a proper repentance, than he hath of a real body;
          though he, in accommodation to our weakness, ascribes to himself the
          members of our bodies to set out to our understanding the greatness of
          his perfections, we must not conclude him a body like us; so, because
          he is said to have anger and repentance, we must not conclude him to
          have passions like us. When we cannot fully comprehend him as he is,
          he clothes himself with our nature in his expressions that we may
          apprehend him as we are able, and by an inspection into ourselves,
          learn something of the nature of God; yet those human ways of speaking
          ought to be understood in a manner agreeable to the infinite
          excellency and majesty of God, and are only designed to mark out
          something in God which hath a resemblance with something in us; as we
          cannot speak to God as gods, but as men, so we cannot understand him
          speaking to us as a God, unless he condescend to speak to us like a
          man. God therefore frames his language to our dulness, not to his own
          state, and informs us by our own phrases, what he would have us learn
          of his nature, as nurses talk broken language to young children. In
          all such expressions, therefore, we must ascribe the perfection we
          conceive in them to God, and lay the imperfection at the door of the
          creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Therefore, repentance in God is only a change of his outward
          conduct, according to his infallible foresight and immutable will. He
          changes the way of his providential proceeding according to the
          carriage of the creature, without changing his will, which is the rule
          of his providence. When God speaks of his repenting “that he had made
          man” (Gen. vi. 6), it is only his changing his conduct from a way of
          kindness to a way of severity, and is a word suited to our capacities
          to signify his detestation of sin, and his resolution to punish it,
          after man had made himself quite another thing, than God had made him;
          “it repents me,” that is, I am purposed to destroy the world, as he
          that repents of his work throws it away;622 as if a potter cast away
          the vessel he had framed, it were a testimony that he repented that
          ever he took pains about it, so the destruction of them seems to be a
          repentance in God that ever he made them; it is a change of events,
          not of counsels. Repentance in us is a grief for a former fact, and a
          changing of our course in it; grief is not in God, but his repentance
          is a willing a thing should not be as it was, which will was fixed
          from eternity; for God, foreseeing man would fall, and decreeing to
          permit it, he could not be said to repent in time of what he did not
          repent from eternity; and therefore, if there were no repentance in
          God from eternity, there could be none in time.623 But God is said to
          repent when he changes the disposition of affairs without himself; as
          men, when they repent, alter the course of their actions, so God
          alters things, extra se, or without himself, but changes nothing of
          his own purpose within himself. It rather notes the action he is about
          to do, than anything in his own nature, or any change in his eternal
          purpose. God’s repenting of his kindness is nothing but an inflicting
          of punishment, which the creature by the change of his carriage hath
          merited: as his repenting of the evil threatened is the withholding
          the punishment denounced, when the creature hath humbly submitted to
          his authority, and acknowledged his crime. Or else we may understand
          those expressions of joy, and grief, and repentance, to signify thus
          much, that the things declared to be the objects of joy, and grief,
          and repentance, are of that nature, that if God were capable of our
          passions, he would discover himself in such cases as we do; as when
          the prophets mention the joys and applaudings of heaven, earth, and
          the sea, they only signify that the things they speak of are so good,
          that if the heavens and the sea had natures capable of joy, they would
          express it upon that occasion in such a manner as we do; so would God
          have joy at the obedience of men, and grief at the unworthy carriage
          of men, and repent of his kindness when men abuse it, and repent of
          his punishment when men reform under his rod, were the majesty of his
          nature capable of such affections.624
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. IV. The not fulfilling of some predictions in Scripture, which
          seem to imply a changeableness of the Divine will, do not argue any
          change in it. As when he reprieved Hezekiah from death, after a
          message sent by the prophet Isaiah, that he should die (2 Kings xx.
          1‒5; Isa. xxxviii. 1‒5), and when he made an arrest of that judgment
          he had threatened by Jonah against Nineveh (Jon. iii. 4‒10). There is
          not, indeed, the same reason of promises and threatenings altogether;
          for in promising, the obligation lies upon God, and the right to
          demand is in the party that performs the condition of the promise: but
          in threatenings, the obligation lies upon the sinner, and God’s right
          to punish is declared thereby; so that though God doth not punish, his
          will is not changed, because his will was to declare the demerit of
          sin, and his right to punish upon the commission of it; though he may
          not punish according to the strict letter of the threatening the
          person sinning, but relax his own law for the honor of his attributes,
          and transfer the punishment from the offender to a person substituted
          in his room: this was the case in the first threatening against man,
          and the substituting a Surety in the place of the malefactor. But the
          answer to these cases is this, that where we find predictions in
          Scripture declared, and yet not executed, we must consider them, not
          as absolute but conditional, or as the civil law calls it, an
          interlocutory sentence.625 God declared what would follow by natural
          causes, or by the demerit of man, not what he would absolutely himself
          do: and in many of those predictions, though the condition be not
          expressed, yet it is to be understood; so the promises of God are to
          be understood, with the condition of perseverance in well doing; and
          threatenings, with a clause of revocation annexed to them, provided
          that men repent: and this God lays down as a general case, alway to be
          remembered as a rule for the interpreting his threatenings against a
          nation, and the same reason will hold in threatenings against a
          particular person. (Jer. xviii. 7‒10) “At what instant I shall speak
          concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to
          pull down, and destroy it; if that nation, against whom I have
          pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I
          thought to do unto them;” and so when he speaks of planting a nation,
          if they do evil, he will repent of the good, &amp;c. It is a universal
          rule by which all particular cases of this nature are to be tried; so
          that when man’s repentance arrives, God remains firm in his first
          will, always equal to himself; and it is not he that changes, but man.
          For since the interposition of the Mediator, with an eye to whom God
          governed the world after the fall, the right of punishing was taken
          off if men repented, and mercy was to flow out, if by a conversion men
          returned to their duty (Ezek. xviii. 20, 21). This, I say, is grounded
          upon God’s entertaining the Mediator; for the covenant of works
          discovered no such thing as repentance or pardon. Now these general
          rules are to be the interpreters of particular cases: so that
          predictions of good are not to be counted absolute, if men return to
          evil; nor predictions of evil, if men be thereby reduced to a
          repentance of their crimes. So Nineveh shall be destroyed, that is,
          according to the general rule, unless the inhabitants repent, which
          they did; they manifested a belief of the threatening, and gave glory
          to God by giving credit to the prophet: and they had a notion of this
          rule God lays down in the other prophets; for they had an apprehension
          that, upon their humbling themselves, they might escape the threatened
          vengeance, and stop the shooting those arrows that were ready in the
          bow.626 Though Jonah proclaimed destruction without declaring any
          hopes of an arrest of judgment, yet their natural notion of God
          afforded some natural hopes of relief if they did their duty, and
          spurned not against the prophet’s message; and therefore, saith one,
          God did not always express this condition, because it was needless;
          his own rule revealed in Scripture was sufficient to some; and the
          natural notion all men had of God’s goodness upon their repentance,
          made it not absolutely necessary to declare it. And besides, saith he,
          it is bootless; the expressing it can do but little good; secure ones
          will repent never the sooner, but rather presume upon their hopes of
          God’s forbearance, and linger out their repentance till it be too
          late. And to work men to repentance, whom he hath purposed to spare,
          he threatens them with terrible judgments; which by how much the more
          terrible and peremptory they are, are likely to be more effectual for
          that end God in his purpose designs them; viz. to humble them under a
          sense of their demerit, and an acknowledgment of his righteous
          justice; and, therefore, though they be absolutely denounced, yet they
          are to be conditionally interpreted with a reservation of repentance.
          As for that answer which one gives, that by forty days was not meant
          forty natural days, but forty prophetical days, that is years, a day
          for a year; and that the city was destroyed forty years after by the
          Medes; the expression of God’s repenting upon their humiliation puts a
          bar to that interpretation; God repented, that is, he did not bring
          the punishment upon them according to those days the prophet had
          expressed; and, therefore, forty natural days are to be understood;
          and if it were meant forty years, and they were destroyed at the end
          of that term, how could God be said to repent, since according to
          that, the punishment threatened was, according to the time fixed,
          brought upon them? and the destruction of it forty years after will
          not be easily evinced, if Jonah lived in the time of Jeroboam, the
          second king of Israel, as he did (2 Kings xiv. 25); and Nineveh was
          destroyed in the time of Josiah, king of Judah. But the other answer
          is plain. God did not fulfil what he had threatened, because they
          reformed what they had committed: when the threatening was made, they
          were a fit object for justice; but when they repented, they were a fit
          object for a merciful respite. To threaten when sins are high, is a
          part of God’s justice; not to execute when sins are revoked by
          repentance, is a part of God’s goodness. And in the case of Hezekiah
          (2 Kings xx. 1, 5), Isaiah comes with a message from God, that he
          should “set his house in order,” for he shall die; that is, the
          disease was mortal, and no outward applications could in their own
          nature resist the distemper: “Behold, I will add to thy days fifteen
          years; I will heal thee” (Isa. xxxviii. 1, 5). It seems to me to be
          one entire message, because the latter part of it was so suddenly
          after the other committed to Isaiah, to be delivered to Hezekiah; for
          he was not gone out of the king’s house, before he was ordered to
          return with the news of his health, by an extraordinary indulgence of
          God against the power of nature and force of the disease, “Behold, I
          will add to thy life;” noting it as an extraordinary thing; he was in
          the second court of the king’s house when this word came to him (2
          Kings xx. 4); the king’s house having three courts, so that he was not
          gone above half‑way out of the palace. God might send this message of
          death, to prevent the pride Hezekiah might swell with for his
          deliverance from Sennacherib: as Paul had a messenger of Satan to
          buffet him to prevent his lifting up (2 Cor. xii. 7); and this good
          man was subject to this sin, as we find afterwards in the case of the
          Babylonish ambassadors; and God delayed this other part of the message
          to humble him, and draw out his prayer: and as soon as ever he found
          Hezekiah in this temper, he sent Isaiah with a comfortable message of
          recovery; so that the will of God was to signify to him the mortality
          of his distemper, and afterwards to relieve him by a message of an
          extraordinary recovery.

          Prop. V. God is not changed, when of loving to any creatures he
          becomes angry with them, or of angry he becomes appeased. The change
          in these cases is in the creature; according to the alteration in the
          creature, it stands in a various relation to God: an innocent creature
          is the object of his kindness, an offending creature is the object of
          his anger; there is a change in the dispensations of God, as there is
          a change in the creature making himself capable of such dispensations.
          God always acts according to the immutable nature of his holiness, and
          can no more change in his affections to good and evil, than he can in
          his essence. When the devils, now fallen, stood as glorious angels,
          they were the objects of God’s love, because holy; when they fell,
          they were the objects of God’s hatred, because impure; the same reason
          which made him love them while they were pure, made him hate them when
          they were criminal. The reason of his various dispensations to them
          was the same in both, as considered in God, his immutable holiness;
          but as respecting the creature, different; the nature of the creature
          was changed, but the Divine holy nature of God remained the same:
          “With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure, and with the froward, thou
          wilt show thyself froward” (Ps. xviii. 26): he is a refreshing light
          to those that obey him, and a consuming fire to those that resist him.
          Though the same angels were not always loved, yet the same reason that
          moved him to love them, moved him to hate them. It had argued a change
          in God if he had loved them alway, in whatsoever posture they were
          towards him; it could not be counted love, but a weakness and impotent
          fondness; the change is in the object, not in the affection of God;
          for the object loved before is not beloved now, because that which was
          the motive of love, is not now in it; so that the creature having a
          different state from what it had, falls under a different affection or
          dispensation. It had been a mutable affection in God to love that
          which was not worthy of love with the same love wherewith he loved
          that which had the greatest resemblance to himself; had God loved the
          fallen angels in that state and for that state, he had hated himself,
          because he had loved that which was contrary to himself and the image
          of his own holiness, which made them appear before, good in his sight.
          The will of God is unchangeably set to love righteousness and hate
          iniquity, and from this hatred to punish it; and if a righteous
          creature contracts the wrath of God, or a sinful creature hath the
          communications of God’s love, it must be by a change in themselves. Is
          the sun changed when it hardens one thing and softens another,
          according to the disposition of the several subjects? Or when the sun
          makes a flower more fragrant, and a dead carcass more noisome? There
          are divers effects, but the reason of that diversity is not in the
          sun, but in the subject; the sun is the same, and produceth those
          different effects by the same quality of heat; so if an unholy soul
          approach to God, God looks angrily upon him; if a holy soul come
          before him, the same immutable perfection in God draws out his
          kindness towards him: as some think, the sun would rather refresh than
          scorch us, if our bodies were of the same nature and substance with
          that luminary. As the will of God for creating the world was no new,
          but an eternal will, though it manifested itself in time, so the will
          of God for the punishment of sin, or the reconciliation of the sinner,
          was no new will: though his wrath in time break out in the effects of
          it upon sinners, and his love flows out in the effects of it upon
          penitents. Christ by his death reconciling God to man, did not alter
          the will of God, but did what was consonant to his eternal will; he
          came not to change his will, but to execute his will: “Lo, I come to
          do thy will, O God” (Heb. x. 7). And the grace of God in Christ was
          not a new grace, but an old grace in a new appearance; “the grace of
          God hath appeared” (Tit. i. 11).

          Prop. VI. A change of laws by God argues no change in God, when God
          abrogates some laws which he had settled in the church, and enacts
          others. I spake of this something the last day; I shall only add this:
          God commanded one thing to the Jews, when the church was in an infant
          state; and removed those laws, when the church came to some growth.
          The elements of the world were suited to the state of children (Gal.
          iv. 3). A mother feeds not the infant with the same diet as she doth
          when it is grown up. Our Saviour acquainted not his disciples with
          some things at one time which he did at another, because they were not
          able to bear them: where was the change; in Christ’s will, or in their
          growth from a state of weakness to that of strength? A physician
          prescribes not the same thing to a person in health, as he doth to one
          conflicting with a distemper; nor the same thing in the beginning as
          he doth in the state or declination of the disease. The physician’s
          will and skill are the same, but the capacity and necessity of the
          patient for this or that medicine, or method of proceeding, are not
          the same. When God changed the ceremonial law, there was no change in
          the Divine will, but an execution of his will; for when God commanded
          the observance of the law he intended not the perpetuity of it; nay,
          in the prophets he declares the cessation of it; he decreed to command
          it, but he decreed to command it only for such a time; so that the
          abrogation of it was no less an execution of his decree, than the
          establishment of it for a season was; the commanding of it was
          pursuant to his decree for the appointing of it, and the nulling of it
          was pursuant to his decree of continuing it only for such a season; so
          that in all this there was no change in the will of God. The counsel
          of God stands sure; what changes soever there are in the world, are
          not in God or his will, but in the events of things, and the different
          relations of things to God: it is in the creature, not in the Creator.
          The sun alway remains of the same hue, and is not discolored in
          itself, because it shines green through a green glass, and blue
          through a blue glass; the different colors come from the glass, not
          from the sun; the change is alway in the disposition of the creature,
          and not in the nature of God or his will.

          1. If God be unchangeable in his nature, and immutability be a
          property of God, then Christ hath a Divine nature. This in the Psalm
          is applied to Christ in the Hebrews (Heb. i. 11), where he joins the
          citation out of this Psalm with that out of Ps. xlv. 6, 7, “Thy
          throne, O God, is forever and ever; thou hast loved righteousness and
          hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with
          the oil of gladness above thy fellows; and thou, Lord, in the
          beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,” &amp;c. As the first
          must necessarily be meant of Christ the Mediator, and therein he is
          distinguished from God, as one anointed by him; so the other must be
          meant of Christ, whereby he is made one with God in regard of the
          creation and dissolution of the world, in regard of eternity and
          immutability. Both the testimonies are linked together by the
          copulative and, “and thou, Lord;” declaring thereby that they are both
          to be understood of the same person, the Son of God. The design of the
          chapter is to prove Christ to be God; and such things are spoken of
          him as could not belong to any creature; no, not to the most excellent
          of the angels. The same person that is said to be anointed above his
          fellows, and is said to lay the foundation of the earth and heavens,
          is said to be the same; that is, the same in himself; the prerogative
          of sameness belongs to that person as well as creation of heaven and
          earth. The Socinians say it is spoken of God, and that God shall
          destroy the heavens by Christ; if so, Christ is not a mere creature,
          not created when he was incarnate; for the same person that shall
          change the world did create the world; if God shall change the world
          by him, God also created the world by him; he was then before the
          world was; for how could God create the world by one that was not;
          that was not in being till after the creation of the world? The
          heavens shall be changed, but the person who is to change the heavens
          is said to be the same, or unchangeable in the creation as well as the
          dissolution of the world. This sameness refers to the whole sentence.
          The Psalm wherein the text is, and whence this in the Hebrews is
          cited, is properly meant of Christ, and redemption by him, and the
          completing of it at the last day, and not of the Babylonish
          captivity;627 that captivity was not so deplorable as the state of the
          Psalmist describes; Daniel and his companions flourished in that
          captivity; it could not reasonably be said of them, that their days
          were consumed like smoke, their hearts withered like grass; that they
          forgot to “eat their bread” (ver. 3, 4). Besides, he complains of
          “shortness of life” (ver. 11); but none had any more reason to
          complain of that in the time of the captivity, than before and after
          it, than at any other time: their deliverance would contribute nothing
          to the natural length of their lives. Besides, when Sion should be
          built, the heathen should “fear the name of the Lord” (that is,
          worship God), and “all the kings of the earth his glory” (ver. 15).
          The rearing the second temple after the deliverance, did not proselyte
          the nations; nor did the kings of the earth worship the glory of God;
          nor did God appear in such glory at the erecting the second temple.
          The second temple was less glorious than the first, for it wanted some
          of the ornaments which were the glory of the first; but it is said of
          this state, that when the Lord should build up Sion, he should “appear
          in his glory” (ver. 16); his proper glory, and extraordinary glory.
          Now that God who shall appear in glory, and build up Sion, is the Son
          of God, the Redeemer of the world; he builds up the church, he causes
          the nations to fear the Lord, and the kings of the earth his glory; he
          broke down the partition wall, and opened a door for the entrance of
          the Gentiles; he struck the chains from off the prisoners, and loosed
          those that were appointed to death by the curse of the law (ver. 20):
          and to this person is ascribed the creation of the world; and he is
          pronounced to remain the same in the midst of an infinite number of
          changes in inferior things. And it is likely the Psalmist considers
          not only the beginning of redemption, but the completing of it at the
          second coming of Christ; for he complains of those evils which shall
          be removed by his second coming, viz., the shortness of life,
          persecutions and reproaches wherewith the church is afflicted in this
          world; and comforts not himself with those attributes which are
          directly opposed to sin, as the mercy of God, the covenant of God, but
          with those that are opposed to mortality and calamities, as the
          unchangeableness and eternity of God; and from thence infers a
          perpetual establishment of believers. “The children of thy servants
          shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee” (ver.
          28): so that the Psalm itself seems to aim in the whole discourse at
          Christ, and asserts his divinity, which the apostle, as an
          interpreter, doth fully evidence; applying it to him, and manifesting
          his deity by his immutability as well as eternity.628 While all other
          things lose their forms, and pass through multitudes of variations, he
          constantly remains the same, and shall be the same, when all the
          empires of the world shall slide away, and a period be put to the
          present motions of the creation: and as there was no change made in
          his being by the creation of things, so neither shall there be by the
          final alteration of things; he shall see them finish, as he saw them
          rise up into being, and be the same after their reign, as he was
          before their original; he is the first and the last (Rev. i. 17).

          2. Here is ground and encouragement for worship. An atheist will make
          another use of this; if God be immutable, why should we worship him,
          why should we pray to him? good will come if he wills it; evil cannot
          be averted by all our supplications, if he hath ordained it to fall
          upon us. But certainly since unchangeableness is knowing, and willing
          goodness is a perfection, an adoration and admiration is due to God,
          upon the account of this excellence. If he be God, he is to be
          reverenced, and the more highly reverenced, because he cannot but be
          God. Again, what comfort could it be to pray to a God, that like the
          chameleon changed colors every day, every moment? What encouragement
          could there be to lift up our eyes to one that were of one mind this
          day and of another mind tomorrow? Who would put up a petition to an
          earthly prince that were so mutable, as to grant a petition one day
          and deny it another, and change his own act? But if a prince promise
          this or that thing upon such or such a condition, and you know his
          promise to be as unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians,
          would any man reason thus? because it is unchangeable we will not seek
          to him, we will not perform the condition, upon which the fruit of the
          proclamation is to be enjoyed. Who would not count such an inference
          ridiculous? What blessings hath not God promised upon the condition of
          seeking him? Were he of an unrighteous nature, or changeable in his
          mind, this would be a bar to our seeking him, and frustrate our hopes;
          but since it is otherwise, is not this excellency of his nature the
          highest encouragement, to ask of him the blessings he hath promised,
          and a beam from heaven to fire our zeal in asking? If you desire
          things against his will, which he hath declared he will not grant,
          prayer then would be an act of disobedience and injury to him, as well
          as an act of folly in itself; his unchangeableness then might stifle
          such desires: but if we ask according to his will, and according to
          our reasonable wants, what ground have we to make such a ridiculous
          argument? He hath willed everything that may be for our good, if we
          perform the condition he hath required; and hath put it upon record,
          that we may know it and regulate our desires and supplications
          according to it. If we will not seek him, his immutability cannot be a
          bar, but our own folly is the cause; and by our neglect we despoil him
          of this perfection as to us, and either imply that he is not sincere,
          and means not as he speaks; or that he is as changeable as the wind,
          sometimes this thing, sometimes that, and not at all to be confided
          in. If we ask according to his revealed will, the unchangeableness of
          his nature will assure us of the grant; and what a presumption would
          it be in a creature dependent upon his sovereign, to ask that which he
          knows he has declared his will against; since there is no good we can
          want, but he hath promised to give, upon our sincere and ardent desire
          for it? God hath decreed to give this or that to man, but
          conditionally, and by the means of inquiring after him, and asking for
          it: “Ask, and you shall receive” (Ezek. xxxvi. 37; Matt. vii. 7): as
          much as to say, You shall not receive unless you ask. When the highest
          promises are made, God expects they should be put in suit; our Saviour
          joins the promise and the petition together; the promise to encourage
          the petition, and the petition to enjoy the promise: he doth not say
          perhaps it shall be given, but it shall, that is, it certainly shall;
          your heavenly Father is unchangeably willing to give you those things.
          We must depend upon his immutability for the thing, and submit to his
          wisdom for the time. Prayer is an acknowledgment of our dependence
          upon God; which dependence could have no firm foundation without
          unchangeableness. Prayer doth not desire any change in God, but is
          offered to God that he would confer those things which he hath
          immutably willed to communicate; but he willed them not without prayer
          as the means of bestowing them. The light of the sun is ordered for
          our comfort, for the discovery of visible things, for the ripening the
          fruits of the earth; but withal it is required that we use our faculty
          of seeing, that we employ our industry in sowing and planting, and
          expose our fruits to the view of the sun, that they may receive the
          influence of it. If a man shuts his eyes, and complains that the sun
          is changed into darkness, it would be ridiculous; the sun is not
          changed, but we alter ourselves; nor is God changed in not giving us
          the blessings he hath promised, because he hath promised in the way of
          a due address to him, and opening our souls to receive his influence,
          and to this, his immutability is the greatest encouragement.

          3. This shows how contrary man is to God in regard of his inconstancy.
          What an infinite distance is there between the immutable God, and
          mutable man, and how should we bewail this flittingness in our nature!
          There is a mutability in us as creatures, and a creature cannot but be
          mutable by nature, otherwise it were not a creature but God. The
          establishment of any creature is from grace and gift; naturally we
          tend to nothing, as we come from nothing. This creature‑mutability is
          not our sin, yet it should cause us to lie down under a sense of our
          own nothingness, in the presence of the Creator. The angels as
          creatures, though not corrupt, cover their faces before him: and the
          arguments God uses to humble Job, though a fallen creature, are not
          from his corruption: for I do not remember that he taxed him with
          that; but from the greatness of his majesty and excellency of his
          nature declared in his works (Job xxxviii.‒xli.); and, therefore, men
          that have no sense of God and humility before him, forget that they
          are creatures as well as corrupt ones. How great is the distance
          between God and us, in regard of our inconstancy in good, which is not
          natural to us by creation: for the mind and affections were regular,
          and by the great artificer were pointed to God as the object of
          knowledge and love. We have the same faculties of understanding, will,
          and affection, as Adam had in innocence; but not with the same light,
          the same bias, and the same ballast. Man, by his fall, wounded his
          head and heart; the wound in his head made him unstable in the truth,
          and that in his heart unsteadfast in his affections: he changed
          himself from the image of God to that of the devil, from innocence to
          corruption, and from an ability to be steadfast to a perpetual
          inconstancy; “his silver became dross, and his wine was mixed with
          water” (Isa. i. 22). He changed,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) To inconstancy in truth, opposed to the immutability of knowledge
          in God. How are our minds floating between ignorance and knowledge!
          Truth in us is like those ephemera, creatures of a day’s
          continuance,—springs up in the morning, and expires at night. How soon
          doth that fly away from us which we have had, not only some weak
          flashes of, but which we have learned and have had some relish of! The
          devil stood not in the truth (John viii. 44), and therefore manages
          his engines to make us as unstable as himself: our minds reel, and
          corrupt reasonings oversway us; like sponges we suck up water, and a
          light compression makes us spout it out again. Truths are not engraven
          upon our hearts, but writ as in dust, defaced by the next puff of
          wind, “carried about with every wind of doctrine” (Eph. iv. 14); like
          a ship without a pilot and sails, at the courtesy of the next storm,
          or like clouds that are tenants to the wind and sun, moved by the wind
          and melted by the sun. The Galatians were no sooner called into the
          grace of God, but they were removed from it (Gal. i. 6); some have
          been reported to have menstruam fidem, kept an opinion for a month;
          and many are like him that believed the soul’s immortality no longer
          than he had Plato’s book of that subject in his hand:629 one likens
          such to children; they play with truths as children do with babies,
          one while embrace them, and a little after throw them into the dirt.
          How soon do we forget what the truth is delivered to us, and what it
          represented us to be (James i. 23, 24). Is it not a thing to be
          bewailed, that man should be such a weathercock, turned about with
          every breath of wind, and shifting aspects as the wind shifts points?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Inconstancy in will, and affections opposed to the immutability
          of will in God. We waver between God and Baal; and while we are not
          only resolving, but upon motion a little way, look back with a
          hankering after Sodom; sometimes lifted up with heavenly intentions,
          and presently cast down with earthly cares, like a ship that by an
          advancing wave seems to aspire to heaven, and the next fall of the
          waves makes it sink down to the depths. We change purposes oftener
          than fashions, and our resolutions are like letters in water, whereof
          no mark remains; we will be as John to‑day to love Christ, and as
          Judas to‑morrow to betray him, and, by an unworthy levity, pass into
          the camp of the enemies of God; resolved to be as holy as angels in
          the morning, when the evening beholds us as impure as devils. How
          often do we hate what before we loved, and shun what before we longed
          for! and our resolutions are like vessels of crystal, which break at
          the first knock, are dashed in pieces by the next temptation. Saul
          resolved not to persecute David any more, but you soon find him upon
          his old game. Pharaoh more than once promised, and probably resolved,
          to let Israel go, but at the end of the storm his purposes vanish
          (Exod. viii. 27, 32). When an affliction pincheth men, they intend to
          change their course, and the next news of ease changes their
          intentions; like a bow not fully bent in their inclinations, they
          cannot reach the mark, but live many years between resolutions of
          obedience and affections to rebellion (Ps. lxxviii. 17): and what
          promises men make to God are often the fruit of their passion, their
          fear, not of their will. The Israelites were startled at the terrors
          wherewith the law was delivered, and promised obedience (Exod. xx.
          19), but a month after forgot them, and make a golden calf, and in the
          sight of Sinai call for, and dance before, their gods (Exod. xxxii.);
          never people more unconstant. Peter, who vowed an allegiance to his
          Master, and a courage to stick to him, forswears him almost with the
          same breath. Those that cry out with a zeal, “The Lord he is God,”
          shortly after return to the service of their idols (1 Kings xviii.
          39). That which seems to be our pleasure this day, is our vexation
          to‑morrow; a fear of a judgment puts us into a religious pang, and a
          love to our lusts reduceth us to a rebellious inclination; as soon as
          the danger is over, the saint is forgotten: salvation and damnation
          present themselves to us, touch us, and engender some weak wishes,
          which are dissolved by the next allurements of a carnal interest. No
          hold can be taken of our promises, no credit is to be given to our
          resolutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Inconstancy in practice. How much beginning in the Spirit, and
          ending in the flesh; one day in the sanctuary, another in the stews;
          clear in the morning as the sun, and clouded before noon; in heaven by
          an excellency of gifts, in hell by a course of profaneness; like a
          flower, which some mention, that changes its color three times a day,
          one part white, then purple, then yellow! The spirit lusts against the
          flesh, and the flesh quickly triumphs over the spirit. In a good man
          how often is there a spiritual lethargy; though he doth not openly
          defame God, yet he doth not always glorify him; he doth not forsake
          the truth, but he doth not always make the attainment of it, and
          settlement in it his business. This levity discovers itself in
          religious duty, “when I would do good, evil is present with me” (Rom.
          vii. 21). Never more present, than when we have a mind to do good, and
          never more present than when we have a mind to do the best and
          greatest good. How hard is it to make our thoughts and affections keep
          their stand! place them upon a good object, and they will be frisking
          from it, as a bird from one bough, one fruit, to another: we vary
          postures according to the various objects we meet with. The course of
          the world is a very airy thing, suited to the uncertain notions of
          that “prince of the power of the air,” which works in it (Eph. ii. 2).
          This ought to be bewailed by us. Though we may stand fast in the
          truth, though we may spin our resolutions into a firm web, though the
          spirit may triumph over the flesh in our practice, yet we ought to
          bewail it, because inconstancy is our nature, and what fixedness we
          have in good is from grace. What we find practised by most men is
          natural to all;630 “as face answers to face in a glass, so doth heart
          to heart” (Prov. xxvii. 19); a face in the glass is not more like a
          natural face, whose image it is, than one man’s heart is naturally
          like another.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. It is natural to those out of the church. Nebuchadnezzar is so
          affected with Daniel’s prophetic spirit, that he would have none
          accounted the true God, but the “God of Daniel” (Dan. ii. 47). How
          soon doth this notion slip from him, and an image must be set up for
          all to worship, upon pain of a most cruel, painful death! Daniel’s God
          is quite forgotten. The miraculous deliverance of the three children,
          for not worshipping his image, makes him settle a decree to secure the
          honor of God from the reproach of his subjects (Dan. iii. 29); yet, a
          little while after, you have him strutting in his palace, as if there
          were no God but himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. It is natural to those in the Church. The Israelites were the only
          church God had in the world, and a notable example of inconstancy.
          After the miracles of Egypt, they murmured against God, when they saw
          Pharaoh marching with an army at their heels. They desired food, and
          soon nauseated the manna they were before fond of. When they came into
          Canaan, they sometimes worshipped God, and sometimes idols, not only
          the idols of one nation, but of all their neighbors. In which regard
          God calls this, his heritage; “a speckled bird” (Jer. xii. 9); a
          peacock, saith Hierom, inconstant, made up of varieties of idolatrous
          colors and ceremonies. This levity of spirit is the root of all
          mischief; it scatters our thoughts in the service of God; it is the
          cause of all revolts and apostasies from him; it makes us unfit to
          receive the communications of God: whatsoever we hear is like words
          writ in sand, ruffled out by the next gale; whatsoever is put into us
          is like precious liquor in a palsy hand, soon spilt: it breeds
          distrust of God when we have an uncertain judgment of him, we are not
          like to confide in him; an uncertain judgment will be followed with a
          distrustful heart. In fine, where it is prevalent, it is a certain
          sign of ungodliness. To be driven with the wind like chaff, and to be
          ungodly, is all one in the judgment of the Holy Ghost (Ps. i. 4); the
          ungodly are “like the chaff which the wind drives away,” which
          signifies not their destruction, but their disposition, for their
          destruction is inferred from it (ver. 5), “therefore the ungodly shall
          not stand in judgment.” How contrary is this to the unchangeable God,
          who is alway the same, and would have us the same, in our religious
          promises and resolutions for good!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If God be immutable, it is sad news to those that are resolved in
          wickedness, or careless of returning to that duty he requires. Sinners
          must not expect that God will alter his will, make a breach upon his
          nature, and violate his own word to gratify their lusts. No, it is not
          reasonable God should dishonor himself to secure them, and cease to be
          God, that they may continue to be wicked, by changing his own nature,
          that they may be unchanged in their vanity. God is the same; goodness
          is as amiable in his sight, and sin as abominable in his eyes now, as
          it was at the beginning of the world. Being the same God, he is the
          same enemy to the wicked as the same friend to the righteous. He is
          the same in knowledge, and cannot forget sinful acts. He is the same
          in will, and cannot approve of unrighteous practices. Goodness cannot
          but be alway the object of his love, and wickedness cannot but be
          alway the object of his hatred: and as his aversion to sin is alway
          the same, so as he hath been in his judgments upon sinners, the same
          he will be still; for the same perfection of immutability belongs to
          his justice for the punishment of sin, as to his holiness for his
          disaffection to sin. Though the covenant of works was changeable by
          the crime of man violating it, yet it was unchangeable in regard of
          God’s justice vindicating it, which is inflexible in the punishment of
          the breaches of his law. The law had a preceptive part, and a minatory
          part: when man changed the observation of the precept, the righteous
          nature of God could not null the execution of the threatening; he
          could not, upon the account of this perfection, neglect his just word,
          and countenance the unrighteous transgression. Though there were no
          more rational creatures in being but Adam and Eve, yet God subjected
          them to that death he had assured them of: and from this immutability
          of his will, ariseth the necessity of the suffering of the Son of God
          for the relief of the apostate creature. His will in the second
          covenant is as unchangeable as that in the first, only repentance is
          settled as the condition of the second, which was not indulged in the
          first; and without repentance, the sinner must irrevocably perish, or
          God must change his nature: there must be a change in man; there can
          be none in God; his bow is bent, his arrows are ready, if the wicked
          do not turn (Ps. vii. 11). There is not an atheist, an hypocrite, a
          profane person, that ever was upon the earth, but God’s soul abhorred
          him as such, and the like he will abhor forever; while any therefore
          continue so, they may sooner expect the heavens should roll as they
          please, the sun stand still at their order, the stars change their
          course at their beck, than that God should change his nature, which is
          opposite to profaneness and vanity; “Who hath hardened himself against
          him, and hath prospered?” (Job ix. 4.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 2. Of comfort. The immutability of a good God is a strong ground
          of consolation. Subjects wish a good prince to live forever, as being
          loth to change him, but care not how soon they are rid of an
          oppressor. This unchangeableness of God’s will shows him as ready to
          accept any that come to him as ever he was; so that we may with
          confidence make our address to him, since he cannot change his
          affections to goodness. The fear of change in a friend hinders a full
          reliance upon him; an assurance of stability encourages hope and
          confidence. This attribute is the strongest prop for faith in all our
          addresses; it is not a single perfection, but the glory of all those
          that belong to his nature; for he is unchangeable in his love (Jer.
          xxxi. 3), in his truth (Ps. cxvii. 2). The more solemn revelation of
          himself in this name, Jehovah, which signifies chiefly his eternity
          and immutability, was to support the Israelites’ faith in expectation
          of a deliverance from Egypt, that he had not retracted his purpose,
          and his promise made to Abraham for giving Canaan to his posterity
          (Exod. iii. 14‒17). Herein is the basis and strength of all his
          promises; therefore, saith the Psalmist, “Those that know thy name,
          will put their trust in thee” (Ps. ix. 10): those that are spiritually
          acquainted with thy name, Jehovah, and have a true sense of it upon
          their hearts, will put their trust in thee. His goodness could not be
          distrusted, if his unchangeableness were well apprehended and
          considered. All distrust would fly before it, as darkness before the
          sun; it only gets advantage of us when we are not well grounded in his
          name; and if ever we trusted God, we have the same reason to trust him
          forever: (Isa. xxvi. 4) “Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord
          Jehovah is everlasting strength;” or, as it is in the Hebrew, “a Rock
          of Ages,” that is, perpetually unchangeable. We find the traces of
          God’s immutability in the creatures. He has, by his peremptory decree,
          set bounds to the sea: “Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and
          here shall thy proud waves be stayed” (Job xxxviii. 11). Do we fear
          the sea overflowing us in this island? No, because of his fixed
          decree. And is not his promise in his Word as unchangeable as his word
          concerning inanimate things, as good a ground to rest upon?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The covenant stands unchangeable. Mutable creatures break their
          leagues and covenants, and snap them asunder like Samson’s cords, when
          they are not accommodated to their interests. But an unchangeable God
          keeps his: “The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but
          my kindness shall not depart from thee, nor shall the covenant of my
          peace be removed” (Isa. liv. 10). The heaven and earth shall sooner
          fall asunder, and the strongest and firmest parts of the creation
          crumble to dust, sooner than one iota of my covenant shall fail. It
          depends upon the unchangeableness of his will and the unchangeableness
          of his word, and, therefore, is called “the immutability of his
          counsel” (Heb. vi. 17). It is the fruit of the everlasting purpose of
          God; whence the apostle links purpose and grace together (2 Tim. i.
          9). A covenant with a nation may be changeable, because it may not be
          built upon the eternal purpose of God, “to put his fear in the heart;”
          but with respect to the creature’s obedience. Thus God chose Jerusalem
          as the place wherein he would “dwell forever” (Ps. cxxxii. 14), yet he
          threatens to depart from them when they had broken covenant with him;
          “and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city to the
          mountain on the east side” (Ezek. xi. 33). The covenant of grace doth
          not run, “I will be your God if you will be my people;” but “I will be
          their God, and they shall be my people” (Hos. ii. 19, &amp;c.) “I will
          betroth thee to me forever; I will say, Thou art my people, and they
          shall say, Thou art my God.” His everlasting purpose is, to write his
          laws in the hearts of the elect. He puts a condition to his covenant
          of grace, the condition of faith, and he resolves to work that
          condition in the hearts of the elect; and, therefore, believers have
          two immutable pillars for their support, stronger than those erected
          by Solomon at the porch of the temple (1 Kings vii. 21), called Jakin
          and Boaz, to note the firmness of that building dedicated to God;
          these are election, or the standing, counsel of God, and the covenant
          of grace. He will not revoke the covenant, and blot the names of his
          elect out of the book of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Perseverance is ascertained. It consists not with the majesty of
          God to call a person effectually to himself to‑day, to make him fit
          for his eternal love, to give him faith, and take away that faith
          to‑morrow. His effectual call is the fruit of his eternal election,
          and that counsel hath no other foundation but his constant and
          unchangeable will; a foundation that stands sure, and, therefore,
          called the foundation of God, and not of the creature; “the foundation
          of God stands sure, the Lord knows who are his” (2 Tim. ii. 19). It is
          not founded upon our own natural strength; it may be then subject to
          change, as all the products of nature are. The fallen angels had
          created grace in their innocency, but lost it by their fall. Were this
          the foundation of the creature, it might soon be shaken; since man,
          after his revolt, can ascribe nothing constant to himself, but his own
          inconstancy. But the foundation is not in the infirmity of nature, but
          the strength of grace, and of the grace of God, who is immutable, who
          wants not virtue to be able, nor kindness to be willing, to preserve
          his own foundation.631 To what purpose doth our Saviour tell his
          disciples their names “were written in heaven” (Luke x. 20), but to
          mark the infallible certainty of their salvation by an opposition to
          those things which perish, and have their “names written in the earth”
          (Jer. xvii. 23); or upon the sand, where they may be defaced? And why
          should Christ order his disciples to rejoice that their names were
          written in heaven, if God were changeable to blot them out again? or
          why should the apostle assure us, that though God had rejected the
          greatest part of the Jews, he had not, therefore, rejected his people
          elected according to his purpose and immutable counsel; because there
          are none of the elect of God but will come to salvation? For, saith
          he, the “election hath obtained it” (Rom. xi. 7); that is, all those
          that are of the election have obtained it, and the others are
          hardened. Where the seal of sanctification is stamped, it is a
          testimony of God’s election, and that foundation shall stand sure:
          “The foundation of the Lord stands sure, having this seal, the Lord
          knows who are his;” that is the foundation, the “naming the name of
          Christ,” or believing in Christ, and “departing from iniquity,” is the
          seal.632 As it is impossible when God calls those things that are not,
          but that they should spring up into being and appear before him; so it
          is impossible but that the seed of God, by his eternal purpose, should
          be brought to a spiritual life, and that calling cannot be retracted;
          for that “gift and calling is without repentance” (Rom. xi. 29). And
          when repentance is removed from God in regard of some works, the
          immutability of those works is declared; and the reason of that
          immutability is their pure dependence on the eternal favor and
          unchangeable grace of God “purposed in himself” (Eph. i. 9, 11), and
          not upon the mutability of the creature. Hence their happiness is not
          as patents among men, quam diu bene se gesserint, so long as they
          behave themselves well; but they have a promise that they shall behave
          themselves so as never wholly to depart from God (Jer. xxxii. 40): “I
          will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away
          from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts,
          that they shall not depart from me.” God will not turn from them, to
          do them good, and promiseth that they shall not turn from him forever,
          or forsake him. And the bottom of it is the everlasting covenant, and,
          therefore, believing and sealing for security are linked together
          (Eph. i. 13). And when God doth inwardly teach us his law, he puts in
          a will not to depart from it: (Ps. cxix. 102) “I have not departed
          from thy judgments;” what is the reason? “For thou hast taught me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. By this eternal happiness is insured. This is the inference made
          from the eternity and unchangeableness of God in the verse following
          the text (ver. 28): “The children of thy servants shall continue, and
          their seed shall be established before thee.” This is the sole
          conclusion drawn from those perfections of God solemnly asserted
          before. The children which the prophets and apostles have begotten to
          thee, shall be totally delivered from the relics of their apostasy,
          and the punishment due to them, and rendered partakers of immortality
          with thee, as sons to dwell in their Father’s house forever. The
          Spirit begins a spiritual life here, to fit for an immutable life in
          glory hereafter, where believers shall be placed upon a throne that
          cannot be shaken, and possess a crown that shall not be taken off
          their heads forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use 3. Of exhortation. 1. Let a sense of the changeableness and
          uncertainty of all other things beside God, be upon us. There are as
          many changes as there are figures in the world. The whole fashion of
          the world is a transient thing; every man may say as Job, “Changes and
          war are against me” (Job x. 17). Lot chose the plain of Sodom, because
          it was the richer soil. He was but a little time there before he was
          taken prisoner, and his substance made the spoil of his enemies. That
          is again restored; but a while after, fire from heaven devours his
          wealth, though his person was secured from the judgment by a special
          Providence. We burn with a desire to settle ourselves, but mistake the
          way, and build castles in the air, which vanish like bubbles of soap
          in water. And, therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Let not our thoughts dwell much upon them. Do but consider those
          souls that are in the possession of an unchangeable God, that behold
          his never‑fading glory! Would it not be a kind of hell to them to have
          their thoughts starting out to these things, or find any desire in
          themselves to the changeable trifles of the earth? Nay, have we not
          reason to think that they cover their faces with shame, that ever they
          should have such a weakness of spirit when they were here below, as to
          spend more thoughts upon them than were necessary for this present
          life; much more that they should at any time value and court them
          above an unchangeable good? Do they not disdain themselves that they
          should ever debase the immutable perfections of God, as to have
          neglecting thoughts of him at any time, for the entertainment of such
          a mean and inconstant rival?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Much less should we trust in them, or rejoice in them. The best
          things are mutable, and things of such a nature are not fit objects of
          confidence. Trust not in riches, they have their wanes as well as
          increases; they rise sometimes like a torrent, and flow in upon men,
          but resemble also a torrent in as sudden a fall and departure, and
          leave nothing but slime behind them. Trust not in honor; all the honor
          and applause in the world is no better than an inheritance of wind,
          which the pilot is not sure of, but shifts from one corner to another,
          and stands not perpetually in the same point of the heavens. How, in a
          few ages did the house of David, a great monarch, and a man after
          God’s own heart, descend to a mean condition, and all the glory of
          that house shut up in the stock of a carpenter? David’s sheep‑hook was
          turned into a sceptre, and the sceptre by the same hand of Providence
          turned into a hatchet in Joseph his descendant. Rejoice not
          immoderately in wisdom; that, and learning languish with age. A wound
          in the head may impair that which is the glory of man. If an organ be
          out of frame, folly may succeed, and all a man’s prudence be wound up
          in an irrecoverable dotage. Nebuchadnezzar was no fool, yet, by a
          sudden hand of God, he became not only a fool or a madman, but a kind
          of brute. Rejoice not in strength; that decays, and a mighty man may
          live to see his strong arm withered, and a grasshopper to become a
          burthen (Eccles. xii. 5): “The strong men shall bow themselves, and
          the grinders shall cease because they are few” (ver. 3): nor rejoice
          in children; they are like birds upon a tree, that make a little
          chirping music, and presently fall into the fowler’s net. Little did
          Job expect such sad news as the loss of all his progeny at a blow,
          when the messenger knocked at his gate; and such changes happen
          oftentimes when our expectations of comfort, and a contentment in
          them, are at the highest. How often doth a string crack when the
          musician hath wound it up to a just height for a tune, and all his
          pains and delight marred in a moment! Nay, all these things change
          while we are using them, like ice that melts between our fingers, and
          flowers that wither while we are smelling to them. The apostle gave
          them a good title when he called them “uncertain riches,” and thought
          it a strong argument to dissuade them from trusting in them (1 Tim.
          vi. 17). The wealth of the merchant depends upon the winds and waves,
          and the revenue of the husbandman upon the clouds; and since they
          depend upon those things which are used to express the most
          changeableness, they can be no fit object for trust. Besides, God
          sometimes kindles a fire under all a man’s glory, which doth
          insensibly consume it (Isa. x. 16); and while we have them, the fear
          of losing them renders us not very happy in the fruition of them; we
          can scarce tell whether they are contentments or no, because sorrow
          follows them so close at the heels. It is not an unnecessary
          exhortation for good men; the best men have been apt to place too much
          trust in them. David thought himself immutable in his prosperity, and
          such thoughts could not be without some immoderate outlets of the
          heart to them, and confidences in them; and Job promised himself to
          die in his nest, and “multiply his days as the sand,” without any
          interruption (Job xxix. 18, 19, &amp;c.); but he was mistaken and
          disappointed. Let me add this: trust not in men, who are as inconstant
          as anything else, and often change their most ardent affections into
          implacable hatred; and though their affections may not be changed, the
          power to help you may. Haman’s friends, that depended on him one day,
          were crest‑fallen the next, when their patron was to exchange his
          chariot of state for an ignominious gallows.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Prefer an immutable God before mutable creatures. Is it not a
          horrible thing to see what we are, and what we possess, daily
          crumbling to dust, and in a continual flux from us, and not seek out
          something that is permanent, and always abide the same, for our
          portion? In God, or Wisdom, which is Christ, there is substance (Prov.
          viii. 21), in which respect he is opposed to all the things in the
          world, that are but shadows, that are shorter or longer, according to
          the motion of the sun; mutable also, by every little body that
          intervenes. God is subject to no decay within, to no force without;
          nothing in his own nature can change him from what he is, and there is
          no power above can hinder him from being what he will to the soul. He
          is an ocean of all perfection: he wants nothing without himself to
          render him blessed, which may allure him to a change. His creatures
          can want nothing out of him to make them happy, whereby they may be
          enticed to prefer anything before him. If we enjoy other things, it is
          by God’s donation, who can as well withdraw them as bestow them; and
          it is but a reasonable, as well as a necessary thing, to endeavor the
          enjoyment of the immutable Benefactor, rather than his revocable
          gifts. If the creatures had a sufficient virtue in themselves to
          ravish our thoughts and engross our souls; yet when we take a prospect
          of a fixed and unchangeable Being, what beauty, what strength have any
          of those things to vie with him? How can they bear up and maintain
          their interest against a lively thought and sense of God? All the
          glory of them would fly before him like that of the stars before the
          sun. They were once nothing, they may be nothing again; as their own
          nature brought them not out of nothing, so their nature secures them
          not from being reduced to nothing. What an unhappiness is it to have
          our affections set upon that which retains something of its non esse
          with its esse, its not being with its being; that lives indeed, but in
          a continual flux, and may lose that pleasurableness to‑morrow which
          charms us to‑day?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This doctrine will teach us patience under such providences as
          declare his unchangeable will. The rectitude of our wills consists in
          conformity to the Divine, as discovered in his words, and manifested
          in his providence, which are the effluxes of his immutable will. The
          time of trial is appointed by his immutable will (Dan. xi. 35); it is
          not in the power of the sufferer’s will to shorten it, nor in the
          power of the enemies’ will to lengthen it. Whatsoever doth happen hath
          been decreed by God (Eccles. vi. 10), “That which hath been is named
          already;” therefore to murmur or be discontented is to contend with
          God, who is mightier than we, to maintain his own purposes. God doth
          act all things conveniently for that immutable end intended by
          himself, and according to the reason of his own will, in the true
          point of time most proper for it and for us, not too soon or too slow,
          because he is unchangeable in knowledge and wisdom. God doth not act
          anything barely by an immutable will, but by an immutable wisdom, and
          an unchangeable rule of goodness; and, therefore, we should not only
          acquiesce in what he works, but have a complacency in it; and by
          having our wills thus knitting themselves with the immutable will of
          God, we attain some degree of likeness to him in his own
          unchangeableness. When, therefore, God hath manifested his will in
          opening his decree to the world by his work of providence, we must
          cease all disputes against it, and, with Aaron hold our peace, though
          the affliction be very smart (Rev. x. 3). “All flesh must be silent
          before God” (Zech. ii. 13); for whatsoever is his counsel shall stand,
          and cannot be recalled. All struggling against it is like a brittle
          glass contending with a rock; for “if he cut off and shut up, or
          gather together, then who can hinder him?” (Job xi. 10.) Nothing can
          help us, if he hath determined to afflict us, as nothing can hurt us,
          if he hath determined to secure us. The more clearly God hath
          evidenced this or that to be his will, the more sinful is our
          struggling against it. Pharaoh’s sin was the greater in keeping
          Israel, by how much the more God’s miracles had been demonstrations of
          his settled will to deliver them. Let nothing snatch our hearts to a
          contradiction to him, but let us fear and give glory to him, when the
          hour of judgment which he hath appointed is come (Rev. xiv. 7); that
          is, comply with the unchangeable will of his precept, the more he
          declares the immutable will of his providence. We must not think God
          must disgrace his nature and change his proceedings for us; better the
          creature should suffer, than God be impaired in any of his
          perfections. If God changed his purpose he would change his nature.
          Patience is the way to perform the immutable will of God, and a means
          to attain a gracious immutability for ourselves by receiving the
          promise (Heb. x. 36), “Ye have need of patience, that after ye have
          done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.”

        <p>
          3. This doctrine will teach us to imitate God in this perfection, by
          striving to be immovable in goodness. God never goes back from
          himself; he finds nothing better than himself for which he should
          change; and can we find anything better than God, to allure our hearts
          to a change from him? The sun never declines from the ecliptic line,
          nor should we from the paths of holiness. A steadfast obedience is
          encouraged by an unchangeable God to reward it (1 Cor. xv. 58): “Be
          steadfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
          knowing that your labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.”
          Unsteadfastness is the note of a hypocrite (Ps. lxxviii. 37):
          steadfastness in that which is good is the mark of a saint; it is the
          character of a righteous person to “keep the truth” (Isa. xxvi. 2).
          And it is as positively said that “he that abides not in the doctrine
          of Christ hath not God” (2 John, 9); but he that doth, “hath both the
          Father and the Son.” So much of uncertainty, so much of nature, so
          much of firmness in duty, so much of grace. We can never honor God
          unless we finish his work; as Christ did not glorify God but in
          finishing the work God gave him to do (John xvii. 4). The nearer the
          world comes to an end, the more is God’s immutability seen in his
          promises and predictions, and the more must our unchangeableness be
          seen in our obedience (Heb. x. 23, 25): “Let us hold fast the
          profession of our faith without wavering, and so much the more as you
          see the day approaching.” The christian Jews were to be the more
          tenacious of their faith, the nearer they saw the day approaching, the
          day of Jerusalem’s destruction prophesied of by Daniel (Dan. ix. 26),
          which accomplishment must be a great argument to establish the
          christian Jews in the profession of Christ to be the Messiah, because
          the destruction of the city was not to be before the cutting off the
          Messiah. Let us be, therefore, constant in our profession and service
          of God, and not suffer ourselves to be driven from him by the ill
          usage, or flattered from him by the caresses of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is reasonable. If God be unchangeable in doing us good, it is
          reason we should be unchangeable in doing him service. If he assure us
          that he is our God, our “I Am,” he would also that we should be his
          people; his we are. If he declare himself constant in his promises, he
          expects we should be so in our obedience. As a spouse, we should be
          unchangeably faithful to him as a Husband; as subjects, have an
          unchangeable allegiance to him as our Prince. He would not have us
          faithful to him for an hour or a day, but “to the death” (Rev. ii.
          10); and it is reason we should be his, and if we be his children,
          imitate him in his constancy of his holy purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is our glory and interest. To be a reed shaken with every wind
          is no commendation among men, and it is less a ground of praise with
          God. It was Job’s glory that he held fast his integrity (Job i. 22):
          “In all this Job sinned not;” in all this,—which whole cities and
          kingdoms would have thought ground enough of high exclamations against
          God, and also against the temptation of his wife,—he retained his
          integrity (Job ii. 9): “Dost thou still retain thy integrity?” The
          devil, who by God’s permission stripped him of his goods and health,
          yet could not strip him of his grace. As a traveller, when the wind
          and snow beats in his face, wraps his cloak more closely about him to
          preserve that and himself. Better we had never made profession, than
          afterwards to abandon it; such a withering profession serves for no
          other use than to aggravate the crime, if any of us fly like a coward,
          or revolt like a traitor; what profit will it be to a soldier, if he
          hath withstood many assaults, and turn his back at last? If we would
          have God crown us with an immutable glory, we must crown our
          beginnings with a happy perseverance (Rev. ii. 10): “Be faithful to
          the death, and I will give thee a crown of life;” not as though this
          were the cause to merit it, but a necessary condition to possess it:
          constancy in good is accompanied with an immutability of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) By an unchangeable disposition to good, we should begin the
          happiness of heaven upon earth. This is the perfection of blessed
          spirits, those that are nearest to God as angels and glorified souls,
          they are immutable; not, indeed, by nature, but by grace; yet not only
          by a necessity of grace, but a liberty of will: grace will not let
          them change; and that grace doth animate their wills that they would
          not change; an immutable God fills their understandings and
          affections, and gives satisfaction to their desires. The saints when
          they were below, tried other things, and found them deficient; but now
          they are so fully satisfied with the beatific vision, that if Satan
          should have an entrance among the angels and sons of God, it is not
          likely he should have any influence upon them; he could not present to
          their understandings anything that could either at the first glance,
          or upon a deliberate view, be preferable to what they enjoy and are
          fixed in. Well, then, let us be immovable in the knowledge and love of
          God. It is the delight of God to see his creatures resemble him in
          what they are able. Let not our affections to him be as Jonah’s gourd,
          growing up in one night and withering the next. Let us not only fight
          a good fight, but do so till we have finished our course, and imitate
          God in an unchangeableness of holy purposes; and to that purpose,
          examine ourselves daily what fixedness we have arrived unto; and to
          prevent any temptation to a revolt, let us often possess our minds
          with thoughts of the immutability of God’s nature and will, which,
          like fire under water, will keep a good matter boiling up in us, and
          make it both retain and increase its heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Let this doctrine teach us to have recourse to God, and aim at a
          near conjunction with him. When our spirits begin to flag, and a cold
          aguish temper is drawing upon us, let us go to him who can only fix
          our hearts, and furnish us with a ballast to render them steadfast. As
          he is only immutable in his nature, so he is the only principle of
          immutability, as well as being in the creature. Without his grace, we
          shall be as changeable in our appearances as the chameleon, and in our
          turnings as the wind. When Peter trusted in himself, he changed to the
          worse; it was his Master’s recourse to God for him that preserved in
          him a reducing principle, which changed him again for the better, and
          fixed him in it (Luke xxii. 32). It will be our interest to be in
          conjunction with him, that moves not about with the heavens, nor is
          turned by the force of nature, nor changed by the accidents in the
          world; but sits in the heavens, moving all things by his powerful arm,
          according to his infinite skill. While we have him for our God, we
          have his immutability as well as any other perfection of his nature
          for our advantage; the nearer we come to him, the more stability we
          shall have in ourselves; the further from him, the more liable to
          change. The line that is nearest to the place where it is first fixed,
          is least subject to motion; the further it is stretched from it, the
          weaker it is, and more liable to be shaken. Let us also affect those
          things which are nearest to him in this perfection; the righteousness
          of Christ that shall never wear out, and the graces of the Spirit that
          shall never burn out; by this means, what God is infinitely by nature,
          we shall come to be finitely immutable by grace, as much as the
          capacity of a creature can contain.
