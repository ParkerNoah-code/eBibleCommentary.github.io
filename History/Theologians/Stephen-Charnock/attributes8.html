        <h2>DISCOURSE VIII.</h2>
        <p>ON GOD’S KNOWLEDGE.</p>
        <p>
          Psalm cxlvii. 5.—Great is our Lord, and of great power; his
          understanding is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is uncertain who was the author of this psalm, and when it was
          penned; some think after the return from the Babylonish captivity. It
          is a psalm of praise, and is made up of matter of praise from the
          beginning to the end: God’s benefits to the church, his providence
          over his creatures, and the essential excellency of his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The psalmist doubles his exhortation to praise God (ver. 1), “Praise
          ye the Lord, sing praise to our God;” to praise him from his dominion
          as “Lord,” from his grace and mercy as “our God;” from the excellency
          of the duty itself, “it is good, it is comely:” some read it comely,
          some lovely, or desirable, from the various derivations of the word.
          Nothing doth so much delight a gracious soul, as an opportunity of
          celebrating the perfections and goodness of the Creator. The highest
          duties a creature can render to the Creator are pleasant and
          delightful in themselves; “it is comely.” Praise is a duty that
          affects the whole soul. The praise of God is a decent thing; the
          excellency of God’s nature deserves it, and the benefits of God’s
          grace requires it. It is comely when done as it ought to be, with the
          heart as well as with the voice; a sinner sings ill, though his voice
          be good; the soul in it is to be elevated above earthly things. The
          first matter of praise is God’s erecting and preserving his church
          (ver. 2): “The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, he gathers together the
          outcasts of Israel.” The walls of demolished Jerusalem are now
          re‑edified; God hath brought back the captivity of Jacob, and reduced
          his people from their Babylonish exile, and those that were dispersed
          into strange regions, he hath restored to their habitations. Or, it
          may be prophetic of the calling of the Gentiles, and the gathering the
          outcasts of the spiritual Israel, that were before as without God in
          the world, and strangers to the covenant of promise. Let God be
          praised, but especially for building up his church, and gathering the
          Gentiles, before counted as outcasts (Isa. xi. 12); he gathers them in
          this world to the faith, and hereafter to glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obs. 1. From the two first verses, observe: 1. All people are under
          God’s care; but he has a particular regard to his church. This is the
          signet on his hand, as a bracelet upon his arm; this is his garden
          which he delights to dress; if he prunes it, it is to purge it; if he
          digs about his vine, and wounds the branches, it is to make it
          beautiful with new clusters, and restore it to a fruitful vigor. 2.
          All great deliverances are to be ascribed to God, as the principal
          Author, whosoever are the instruments. The Lord doth build up
          Jerusalem, he gathers together the outcasts of Israel. This great
          deliverance from Babylon is not to be ascribed to Cyrus or Darius, or
          the rest of our favorers; it is the Lord that doth it; we had his
          promise for it, we have now his performance. Let us not ascribe that
          which is the effect of his truth, only to the good will of men; it is
          God’s act, not by might, nor by power, nor by weapons of war, or
          strength of horses, but by the Spirit of the Lord. He sent prophets to
          comfort us while we were exiles; and now he hath stretched out his own
          arm to work our deliverance according to his word; blind man looks so
          much upon instruments, that he hardly takes notice of God, either in
          afflictions or mercies, and this is the cause that robs God of so much
          prayer and praise in the world. (ver. 3.) “He heals the broken in
          heart, and binds up their wounds.” He hath now restored those who had
          no hope but in his word; he hath dealt with them as a tender and
          skilful chirurgeon; he hath applied his curing plasters, and dropped
          in his sovereign balsams; he hath now furnished our fainting hearts
          with refreshing cordials, and comforted our wounds with strengthening
          ligatures. How gracious is God, that restores liberty to the captives,
          and righteousness to the penitent! Man’s misery is the fittest
          opportunity for God to make his mercy illustrious in itself, and most
          welcome to the patient. He proceeds (ver. 4), wonder not that God
          calls together the outcasts, and singles them out from every corner
          for a return; why can he not do this, as well as tell the number of
          the stars, and call them all by their names? There are none of his
          people so despicable in the eye of man, but they are known and
          regarded by God; though they are clouded in the world, yet they are
          the stars of the world; and shall God number the inanimate stars in
          the heavens, and make no account of his living stars on the earth? No,
          wherever they are dispersed, he will not forget them; however they are
          afflicted, he will not despise them; the stars are so numerous, that
          they are innumerable by man; some are visible and known by men; others
          lie more hid and undiscovered in a confused light, as those in the
          milky way; man cannot see one of them distinctly. God knows all his
          people. As he can do what is above the power of man to perform, so he
          understands what is above the skill of man to discover; shall man
          measure God by his scantiness? Proud man must not equal himself to
          God, nor cut God as short as his own line. He tells the number of the
          stars, and calls them all by their names. He hath them all in his
          list, as generals the names of their soldiers in their muster‑roll,
          for they are his host, which he marshals in the heavens, as in Isaiah
          xl. 26, where you have the like expression; he knows them more
          distinctly than man can know anything, and so distinctly, as to call
          “them all by their names.” He knows their names, that is, their
          natural offices, influences the different degrees of heat and light,
          their order and motion; and all of them, the least glimmering star, as
          well as the most glaring planet: this, man cannot do; “Tell the stars
          if thou be able to number them” (Gen. xv. 5), saith God to Abraham,
          whom Josephus represents as a great astronomer: “Yea, they cannot be
          numbered” (Jer. xxxiii. 22); and the uncertainty of the opinions of
          men, evidenceth their ignorance of their number; some reckoning 1022;
          others 1025; others 1098; others 7000, beside those that by reason of
          their mixture of light with one another, cannot be distinctly
          discerned, and others, perhaps so high, as not to be reached by the
          eye of man. To impose names on things, and names according to their
          natures, is both an argument of power and dominion, and of wisdom and
          understanding: from the imposition of names upon the creatures by
          Adam, the knowledge of Adam is generally concluded; and it was also a
          fruit of that dominion God allowed him over the creatures. Now he that
          numbers and names the stars that seem to lie confused among one
          another, as well as those that appear to us in an unclouded night, may
          well be supposed accurately to know his people, though lurking in
          secret caverns, and know those that are fit to be instruments of their
          deliverance; the one is as easy to him as the other; and the number of
          the one as distinctly known by him as the multitude of the other. “For
          great is our Lord, and of great power; his understanding is infinite”
          (ver. 5). He wants not knowledge to know the objects, nor power to
          effect his will concerning them. Of great power, רב כוח. Much power,
          plenteous in power; so the word רב, is rendered (Ps. v. 15), רב חסד, a
          multitude of power, as well as a multitude of mercy; a power that
          exceeds all created power and understanding. His understanding is
          infinite. You may not imagine, how he can call all the stars by name,
          the multitude of the visible being so great, and the multitude of the
          invisible being greater; but you must know, that as God is Almighty,
          so he is omniscient; and as there is no end of his power, so no
          account can exactly be given of his understanding; his understanding
          is infinite, אין מספר. No number or account of it; and so the same
          words are rendered, “a nation strong, and without number” (Joel i. 6):
          no end of his understanding: (Syriac) no measure, no bounds. His
          essence is infinite, and so is his power and understanding; and so
          vast is his knowledge, that we can no more comprehend it, than we can
          measure spaces that are without limits, or tell the minutes or hours
          of eternity. Who, then, can fathom that whereof there is no number,
          but which exceeds all, so that there is no searching of it out? He
          knows universals, he knows particulars: we must not take understanding
          here, as noting a faculty, but the use of the understanding in the
          knowledge of things, and the judgment, תבונה, in the consideration of
          them, and so it is often used. In the verse there is a description of
          God. 1. In his essence, “great is our Lord.” 2. In his power of “great
          power.” 3. In his knowledge, “his understanding is infinite:” his
          understanding is his eye, and his power is his arm. Of his infinite
          understanding I am to discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. God hath an infinite knowledge and understanding. All
          knowledge. Omnipresence, which before we spake of, respects his
          essence; omniscience respects his understanding, according to our
          manner of conception. This is clear in Scripture; hence God is called
          a God of knowledge (Sam. ii. 3), “the Lord is a God of knowledge,”
          (Heb.) knowledges, in the plural number, of all kind of knowledge; it
          is spoken there to quell man’s pride in his own reason and parts; what
          is the knowledge of man but a spark to the whole element of fire, a
          grain of dust, and worse than nothing, in comparison of the knowledge
          of God, as his essence is in comparison of the essence of God? All
          kind of knowledge. He knows what angels know, what man knows, and
          infinitely more; he knows himself, his own operations, all his
          creatures, the notions and thoughts of them; he is understanding above
          understanding, mind above mind, the mind of minds, the light of
          lights; this the Greek word, Θεὸς, signifies in the etymology of it,
          of Θείσθαι, to see, to contemplate; and δαίμων of δαίω, scio. The
          names of God signify a nature, viewing and piercing all things; and
          the attribution of our senses to God in Scripture, as hearing and
          seeing, which are the senses whereby knowledge enters into us,
          signifies God’s knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The notion of God’s knowledge of all things lies above the ruins of
          nature; it was not obliterated by the fall of man. It was necessary
          offending man was to know that he had a Creator whom he had injured,
          that he had a Judge to try and punish him; since God thought fit to
          keep up the world, it had been kept up to no purpose, had not this
          notion been continued alive in the minds of men; there would not have
          been any practice of his laws, no bar to the worst of crimes. If men
          had thought they had to deal with an ignorant Deity, there could be no
          practice of religion. Who would lift up his eyes, or spread his hands
          towards heaven, if he imagined his devotion were directed to a God as
          blind as the heathens imagined fortune? To what boot would it be for
          them to make heaven and earth resound with their cries, if they had
          not thought God had an eye to see them, and an ear to hear them? And
          indeed the very notion of a God at the first blush, speaks him a Being
          endued with understanding; no man can imagine a Creator void of one of
          the noblest perfections belonging to those creatures, that are the
          flower and cream of his works.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Therefore all nations acknowledge this, as well as the existence
          and being of God. No nation but had their temples, particular
          ceremonies of worship, and presented their sacrifices, which they
          could not have been so vain as to do, without an acknowledgment of
          this attribute. This notion of God’s knowledge owed not its rise to
          tradition, but to natural implantation; it was born and grew up with
          every rational creature. Though the several nations and men of the
          world agreed not in one kind of deity, or in their sentiments of his
          nature or other perfections, some judging him clothed with a fine and
          pure body, others judging him an uncompounded spirit, some fixing him
          to a seat in the heavens, others owning his universal presence in all
          parts of the world; yet they all agreed in the universality of his
          knowledge, and their own consciences reflecting their crimes, unknown
          to any but themselves, would keep this notion in some vigor, whether
          they would or no. Now this being implanted in the minds of all men by
          nature, cannot be false, for nature imprints not in the minds of all
          men an assent to a falsity. Nature would not pervert the reason and
          minds of men. Universal notions of God are from original, not lapsed
          nature, and preserved in mankind in order to a restoration from a
          lapsed state. The heathens did acknowledge this: in all the solemn
          covenants, solemnized with oaths and the invocation of the name of
          God, this attribute was supposed.679 They confessed knowledge to be
          peculiar to the Deity; scientia deorum vita, saith Cicero. Some called
          him Νοῦς, mens, mind, pure understanding, without any note, Ἐπόπτης,
          the inspector of all. As they called him life, because he was the
          author of life, so they called him intellectus, because he was the
          author of all knowledge and understanding in his creatures; and one
          being asked, whether any man could be hid from God? no, saith he, not
          so much as thinking.680 Some call him the eye of the world; and the
          Egyptians represented God by an eye on the top of a sceptre, because
          God is all eye, and can be ignorant of nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the same nation made eyes and ears of the most excellent metals,
          consecrating them to God, and hanging them up in the midst of their
          temples, in signification of God’s seeing and hearing all things;
          hence they called God light, as well as the Scripture, because all
          things are visible to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the better understanding of this, we will enquire, I. What kind of
          knowledge or understanding there is in God. II. What God knows. III.
          How God knows things. IV. The proof that God knows all things. V. The
          use of all to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. What kind of understanding or knowledge there is in God. The
          knowledge of God in Scripture hath various names, according to the
          various relations or objects of it: in respect of present things, it
          is called knowledge or sight; in respect of things past, remembrance;
          in respect of things future, or to come, it is called foreknowledge,
          or prescience (1 Pet. i. 2); in regard of the universality of the
          objects, it is called omniscience; in regard to the simple
          understanding of things, it is called knowledge; in regard of acting
          and modelling the ways of acting, it is called wisdom and prudence
          (Eph. i. 8). He must have knowledge, otherwise he could not be wise;
          wisdom is the flower of knowledge, and knowledge is the root of
          wisdom. As to what this knowledge is, if we know what knowledge is in
          man, we may apprehend what it is in God, removing all imperfection
          from it, and ascribing to him the most eminent way of understanding;
          because we cannot comprehend God, but as he is pleased to condescend
          to us in his own ways of discovery, that is, under some way of
          similitude to his perfectest creatures, therefore we have a notion of
          God by his understanding and will; understanding, whereby he conceives
          and apprehends things; will, whereby he extends himself in acting
          according to his wisdom, and whereby he doth approve or disapprove;
          yet we must not measure his understanding by our own, or think it to
          be of so gross a temper as a created mind; that he hath eyes of flesh,
          or sees or knows as man sees (Job x. 4). We can no more measure his
          knowledge by ours than we can measure his essence by our essence. As
          he hath an incomprehensible essence, to which ours is but as a drop of
          a bucket, so he hath an incomprehensible knowledge, to which ours is
          but as a grain of dust, or mere darkness: his thoughts are above our
          thoughts, as the heavens are above the earth. The knowledge of God is
          variously divided by the schools, and acknowledged by all divines.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A knowledge visionis et simplicis intelligentiæ; the one we may
          call a sight, the other an understanding; the one refers to sense, the
          other to the mind. (1.) A knowledge of vision or sight. Thus God knows
          himself and all things that really were, are, or shall be in time; all
          those things which he hath decreed to be, though they are not yet
          actually sprung up in the world, but lie couchant in their causes.
          (2.) A knowledge of intelligence or simple understanding. The object
          of this is not things that are in being, or that shall by any decree
          of God ever be existent in the world, but such things as are possible
          to be wrought by the power of God, though they shall never in the
          least peep up into being, but lie forever wrapt up in darkness and
          nothing.681 This also is a necessary knowledge to be allowed to God,
          because the object of this knowledge is necessary. The possibility of
          more creatures than ever were or shall be, is a conclusion that hath a
          necessary truth in it; as it is necessary that the power of God can
          produce more creatures, though it be not necessary that it should
          produce more creatures, so it is necessary that whatsoever the power
          of God can work, is possible to be. And as God knows this possibility,
          so he knows all the objects that are thus possible; and herein doth
          much consist the infiniteness of his knowledge, as shall be shown
          presently. These two kinds of knowledge differ; that of vision, is of
          things which God hath decreed to be, though they are not yet; that of
          intelligence is of things which never shall be; yet they may be, or
          are possible to be, if God please to will and order their being; one
          respects things that shall be, the other, things that may be, and are
          not repugnant to the nature of God to be. The knowledge of vision
          follows the act of God’s will, and supposeth an act of God’s will
          before, decreeing things to be. (If we could suppose any first or
          second in God’s decree, we might say God knew them as possible before
          he decreed them; he knew them as future, because he decreed them.) For
          without the will of God decreeing a thing to come to pass, God cannot
          know that it will infallibly come to pass. But the knowledge of
          intelligence stands without any act of his will, in order to the being
          of those things he knows; he knows possible things only in his power;
          he knows other things both in his power as able to effect them, and in
          his will, as determining the being of them; such knowledge we must
          grant to be in God, for there is such a kind of knowledge in man; for
          man doth not only know and see what is before his eyes in this world,
          but he may have a conception of many more worlds, and many more
          creatures, which he knows are possible to the power of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is a speculative and practical knowledge in God. (1.) A
          speculative knowledge is, when the truth of a thing is known without a
          respect to any working or practical operation. The knowledge of things
          possible is in God only speculative,682 and some say God’s knowledge
          of himself is only speculative, because there is nothing for God to
          work in himself: and though he knows himself, yet this knowledge of
          himself doth not terminate there, but flowers into a love of himself,
          and delight in himself; yet this love of himself, and delight in
          himself, is not enough to make it a practical knowledge, because it is
          natural, and naturally and necessarily flows from the knowledge of
          himself and his own goodness: he cannot but love himself, and delight
          in himself, upon the knowledge of himself. But that which is properly
          practice, is where there is a dominion over the action, and it is
          wrought not naturally and necessarily, but in a way of freedom and
          counsel. As when we see a beautiful flower or other thing, there
          ariseth a delight in the mind; this no man will call practice, because
          it is a natural affection of the will, arising from the virtue of the
          object, without any consideration of the understanding in a practical
          manner by counselling, commanding, &amp;c. (2.) A practical knowledge:
          which tends to operation and practice, and is the principle of working
          about things that are known; as the knowledge an artificer hath in an
          art or mystery. This knowledge is in God: the knowledge he hath of the
          things he hath decreed, is such a kind of knowledge; for it terminates
          in the act of creation, which is not a natural and necessary act, as
          the loving himself, and delighting in himself is, but wholly free: for
          it was at his liberty whether he would create them or no; this is
          called discretion (Jer. x. 12): “He hath stretched out the heavens by
          his discretion.” Such also is his knowledge of the things he hath
          created, and which are in being, for it terminates in the government
          of them for his own glorious ends. It is by this knowledge “the depths
          are broken up, and the clouds drop down their dew” (Prov. iii. 20).
          This is a knowledge whereby he knows the essence, qualities, and
          properties of what he creates and governs in order to his own glory,
          and the common good of the world over which he resides; so that
          speculative knowledge is God’s knowledge of himself and things
          possible; practical knowledge is his knowledge of his creatures and
          things governable; yet in some sort this practical knowledge is not
          only of things that are made, but of things which are possible, which
          God might make, though he will not: for as he knows that they can be
          created, so he knows how they are to be created, and how to be
          governed, though he never will create them. This is a practical
          knowledge: for it is not requisite to constitute a knowledge
          practical, actually to act, but that the knowledge in itself be
          referable to action.683
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is a knowledge of approbation, as well as apprehension. This
          the Scripture often mentions. Words of understanding are used to
          signify the acts of affection. This knowledge adds to the simple act
          of the understanding, the complacency and pleasure of the will, and is
          improperly knowledge, because it belongs to the will, and not to the
          understanding; only it is radically in the understanding, because
          affection implies knowledge: men cannot approve of that which they are
          ignorant of. Thus knowledge is taken (Amos iii. 2), “You only have I
          known of all the families of the earth;” and (2 Tim. ii. 19), “The
          Lord knows who are his,” that is, he loves them; he doth not only know
          them, but acknowledges them for his own. It notes, not only an exact
          understanding, but a special care of them; and so is that to be
          understood (Gen. i.), “God saw every thing that he had made, and
          behold it was very good:” that is, he saw it with an eye of
          approbation, as well as apprehension. This is grounded upon God’s
          knowledge of vision, his sight of his creatures; for God doth not love
          or delight in anything but what is actually in being, or what he hath
          decreed to bring into being. On the contrary, also, when God doth not
          approve, he is said not to know (Matt. xxv. 12), “I know you not,” and
          (Matt. vii. 23), “I never knew you;” he doth not approve of their
          works. It is not an ignorance of understanding, but an ignorance of
          will; for while he saith he never knew them, he testifies that he did
          know them, in rendering the reason of his disapproving them, because
          he knows all their works: so he knows them, and doth not know them in
          a different manner: he knows them so as to understand them, but he
          doth not know them so as to love them. We must, then, ascribe an
          universal knowledge to God. If we deny him a speculative knowledge, or
          knowledge of intelligence, we destroy his Deity, we make him ignorant
          of his own power: if we deny him practical knowledge, we deny
          ourselves to be his creatures; for, as his creatures, we are the
          fruits of this, his discretion, discovered in creation: if we deny his
          knowledge of vision, we deny his governing dominion. How can he
          exercise a sovereign and uncontrollable dominion, that is ignorant of
          the nature and qualities of the things he is to govern? If he had not
          knowledge he could make no revelation; he that knows not cannot
          dictate; we could then have no Scripture. To deny God knowledge, is to
          dash out the Scripture, and demolish the Deity. God is described in
          Zech. iii. 9, “with seven eyes,” to show his perfect knowledge of all
          things, all occurrences in the world; and the cherubims, or whatsoever
          is meant by the wings, are described to be full of eyes, both “before
          and behind” (Ezek. i. 18), round about them; much more is God all eye,
          all ear, all understanding. The sun is a natural image of God; if the
          sun had an eye, it would see; if it had an understanding, it would
          know all visible things; it would see what it shines upon, and
          understand what it influenceth, in the most obscure bowels of the
          earth. Doth God excel his creature, the sun, in excellency and beauty,
          and not in light and understanding? certainly more than the sun excels
          an atom or grain of dust. We may yet make some representation of this
          knowledge of God by a lower thing, a picture, which seems to look upon
          every one, though there be never so great a multitude in the room
          where it hangs; no man can cast his eye upon it, but it seems to
          behold him in particular, and so exactly, as if there were none but
          him upon whom the eye of it were fixed; and every man finds the same
          cast of it: shall art frame a thing of that nature, and shall not the
          God of art and all knowledge, be much more in reality than that is in
          imagination? Shall not God have a far greater capacity to behold
          everything in the world, which is infinitely less to him than a wide
          room to a picture?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thing, What God knows; how far his understanding
          reaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God knows himself, and only knows himself. This is the first and
          original knowledge, wherein he excels all creatures. No man doth
          exactly know himself; much less doth he understand the full nature of
          a spirit; much less still the nature and perfections of God; for what
          proportion can there be between a finite faculty and an infinite
          object? Herein consists the infiniteness of God’s knowledge, that he
          knows his own essence, that he knows that which is unknowable to any
          else. It doth not so much consist in knowing the creatures, which he
          hath made, as in knowing himself, who was never made. It is not so
          much infinite, because he knows all things which are in the world, or
          that shall be; or things that he can make, because the number of them
          is finite; but because he hath a perfect and comprehensive knowledge
          of his own infinite perfections.684 Though it be said that angels “see
          his face” (Matt. xviii. 10), that sight notes rather their immediate
          attendance, than their exact knowledge; they see some signs of his
          presence and majesty, more illustrious and express than ever appeared
          to man in this life; but the essence of God is invisible to them, hid
          from them in the secret place of eternity; none knows God but himself
          (1 Cor. ii. 11): “What man knows the things of a man save the spirit
          of a man? so the things of God knows no man but the Spirit of God; the
          Spirit of God searches the deep things of God;” searcheth, that is,
          exactly knows, thoroughly understands, as those who have their eyes in
          every chink and crevice, to see what lies hid there; the word search
          notes not an inquiry, but an exact knowledge, such as men have of
          things upon a diligent scrutiny: as when God is said to search the
          heart and the reins, it doth not signify a precedent ignorance, but an
          exact knowledge of the most intimate corners of the hearts of men. As
          the conceptions of men are unknown to any but themselves, so the
          depths of the divine essence, perfections, and decrees, are unknown to
          any but to God himself; he only knows what he is, and what he knows,
          what he can do, and what he hath decreed to do. For first, if God did
          not know himself, he would not be perfect. It is the perfection of a
          creature to know itself, much more a perfection belonging to God. If
          God did not comprehend himself, he would want an infinite perfection,
          and so would cease to be God, in being defective in that which
          intellectual creatures in some measure possess. As God is the most
          perfect being, so he must have the most perfect understanding: if he
          did not understand himself, he would be under the greatest ignorance,
          because he would be ignorant of the most excellent object. Ignorance
          is the imperfection of the understanding; and ignorance of one’s self
          is a greater imperfection than ignorance of things without. If God
          should know all things without himself, and not know himself, he would
          not have the most perfect knowledge, because he would not have the
          knowledge of the best of objects. Secondly, Without the knowledge of
          himself, he could not be blessed. Nothing can have any complacency in
          itself, without knowledge of itself. Nothing can in a rational manner
          enjoy itself, without understanding itself. The blessedness of God
          consists not in the knowledge of anything without him, but in the
          knowledge of himself and his own excellency, as the principle of all
          things; if, therefore, he did not perfectly know himself and his own
          happiness, he could not enjoy a happiness; for to be, and not to know
          to be, is as if a thing were not. “He is God, blessed forever” (Rom.
          ix. 5.), and therefore forever had a knowledge of himself. Thirdly,
          Without the knowledge of himself, he could create nothing. For he
          would be ignorant of his own power, and his own ability; and he that
          doth not know how far his power extends, could not act: if he did not
          know himself, he could know nothing; and he that knows nothing, can do
          nothing; he could not know an effect to be possible to him, unless he
          knew his own power as a cause. Fourthly, Without the knowledge of
          himself, he could govern nothing. He could not, without the knowledge
          of his own holiness and righteousness, prescribe laws to men, nor
          without a knowledge of his own nature order himself a manner of
          worship suitable to it. All worship must be congruous to the dignity
          and nature of the object worshipped: he must therefore know his own
          authority, whereby worship was to be enacted; his own excellency, to
          which worship was to be suited; his own glory, to which worship was to
          be directed. If he did not know himself, he did not know what to
          punish, because he would not know what was contrary to himself: not
          knowing himself, he would not know what was a contempt of him, and
          what an adoration of him; what was worthy of God, and what was
          unworthy of him. In fine, he could not know other things, unless he
          knew himself; unless he knew his own power, he could not know how he
          created things; unless he knew his own wisdom, he could not know the
          beauty of his works; unless he knew his own glory, he could not know
          the end of his works; unless he knew his own holiness, he could not
          know what was evil; and unless he knew his own justice, he could not
          know how to punish the crimes of his offending creatures. And,
          therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God knows himself, because his knowledge, with his will, is the
          cause of all other things that can fall under his cognizance: he knows
          himself first, before he can know any other thing; that is, first
          according to our conceptions; for, indeed, God knows himself and all
          other things at once; he is the first truth, and therefore is the
          first object of his own understanding. There is nothing more excellent
          than himself, and therefore nothing more known to him than himself. As
          he is all knowledge, so he hath in himself the most excellent object
          of knowledge. To understand, is properly to know one’s self. No object
          is so intelligible to God as God is to himself, nor so intimately and
          immediately joined with his understanding as himself; for his
          understanding is his essence, himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He knows himself by his own essence. He knows not himself and his
          own power by the effect, because he knows himself from eternity,
          before there was a world, or any effect of his power extant. It is not
          a knowledge by the cause, for God hath no cause; nor a knowledge of
          himself by any species, or anything from without: if it were anything
          from without himself, that must be created or uncreated; if uncreated
          it would be God; and so we must either own many Gods, or own it to be
          his essence, and so not distinct from himself: if created, then his
          knowledge of himself would depend upon a creature: he could not, then,
          know himself from eternity, but in time, because nothing can be
          created from eternity, but in time. God knows not himself by any
          faculty, for there is no composition in God; he is not made up of
          parts, but is a simple being; some, therefore, have called God, not
          intellectus, understanding, because that savors of a faculty, but
          intellectio, intellection: God is all act in the knowledge of himself
          and his knowledge of other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God, therefore, knows himself perfectly, comprehensively. Nothing
          in his own nature is concealed from him; he reflects upon everything
          that he is.685 There is a positive comprehension, so God doth not
          comprehend himself; for what is comprehended hath bounds, and what is
          comprehended by itself is finite to itself; and there is a negative
          comprehension—God so comprehends himself; nothing in his own nature is
          obscure to him, unknown by him; for there is as great a perfection in
          the understanding of God to know, as there is in the divine nature to
          be known. The understanding of God, and the nature of God, are both
          infinite, and so equal to one another: his understanding is equal to
          himself; he knows himself so well, that nothing can be known by him
          more perfectly than himself is known to himself. He knows himself in
          the highest manner, because nothing is so proportioned to the
          understanding of God as himself. He knows his own essence, goodness,
          power; all his perfections, decrees, intentions, acts, the infinite
          capacity of his own understanding, so that nothing of himself is in
          the dark to himself: and, in this respect, some use this expression,
          that the infiniteness of God is in a manner finite to himself, because
          it is comprehended by himself. Thus God transcends all creatures; thus
          his understanding is truly infinite, because nothing but himself is an
          infinite object for it: what angels may understand of themselves
          perfectly I know not, but no creature in the world understands
          himself. Man understands not fully the excellency and parts of his own
          nature; upon God’s knowledge of himself depends the comfort of his
          people, and the terror of the wicked: this is also a clear argument
          for his knowledge of all other things without himself; he that knows
          himself, must needs know all other things less than himself, and which
          were made by himself; when the knowledge of his own immensity and
          infiniteness is not an object too difficult for him, the knowledge of
          a finite and limited creature, in all his actions, thoughts,
          circumstances, cannot be too hard for him: since he knows himself, who
          is infinite, he cannot but know whatsoever is finite. This is the
          foundation of all his other knowledge; the knowledge of everything
          present, past, and to come, is far less than the knowledge of himself.
          He is more incomprehensible in his own nature, than all things
          created, or that can be created, put together can be. If he, then,
          have a perfect comprehensive knowledge of his own nature, any
          knowledge of all other things is less than the knowledge of himself;
          this ought to be well considered by us, as the fountain whence all his
          other knowledge flows.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Therefore God knows all other things, whether they be possible,
          past, present, or future; whether they be things that he can do, but
          will never do, or whether they be things that he hath done, but are
          not now; things that are now in being, or things that are not now
          existing, that lie in the womb of their proper and immediate
          causes.686 If his understanding be infinite, he then knows all things
          whatsoever that can be known, else his understanding would have
          bounds, and what hath limits is not infinite, but finite. If he be
          ignorant of any one thing that is knowable, that is a bound to him, it
          comes with an exception, a but, God knows all things but this; a bar
          is then set to his knowledge. If there were anything, any particular
          circumstance in the whole creation or non‑creation, and possible to be
          known by him, and yet were unknown to him, he could not be said to be
          omniscient; as he would not be Almighty if any one thing, that implied
          not a repugnancy to his nature, did transcend his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, All things possible. No question but God knows what he could
          create, as well as what he hath created; what he would not create, as
          well as what he resolved to create; he knew what he would not do
          before he willed to do it; this is the next thing which declares the
          infiniteness of his understanding; for, as his power is infinite, and
          can create innumerable worlds and creatures, so is his knowledge
          infinite, in knowing innumerable things possible to his power.
          Possibles are infinite; that is, there is no end of what God can do,
          and therefore no end of what God doth know; otherwise his power would
          be more infinite than his knowledge: if he knew only what is created,
          there would be an end of his understanding, because all creatures may
          be numbered, but possible things cannot be reckoned up by any
          creature. There is the same reason of this in eternity; when never so
          many numbers of years are run out, there is still more to come, there
          still wants an end; and when millions of worlds are created, there is
          no more an end of God’s power than of eternity. Thus there is no end
          of his understanding; that is, his knowledge is not terminated by
          anything. This the Scripture gives us some account of: God knows
          things that are not, “for he calls things that are not as if they
          were” (Rom. iv. 17); he calls things that are not, as if they were in
          being; what he calls is not unknown to him: if he knows things that
          are not, he knows things that may never be; as he knows things that
          shall be, because he wills them, so he knows things that might be,
          because he is able to effect them: he knew that the inhabitants of
          Keilah would betray David to Saul if he remained in that place (1 Sam.
          xxiii. 11); he knew what they would do upon that occasion, though it
          was never done; as he knew what was in their power and in their wills,
          so he must needs know what is within the compass of his own power; as
          he can permit more than he doth permit so he knows what he can permit,
          and what, upon that permission, would be done by his creatures; so God
          knew the possibility of the Tyrians’ repentance, if they had had the
          same means, heard the same truths, and beheld the same miracles which
          were offered to the ears, and presented to the eyes of the Jews (Matt.
          xi. 21). This must needs be so, because,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man knows things that are possible to him, though he will never
          effect them. A carpenter knows a house in the model he hath of it in
          his head, though he never build a house according to that model. A
          watch‑maker hath the frame of a watch in his mind, which he will never
          work with his instruments; man knows what he could do, though he never
          intends to do it.687 As the understanding of man hath a virtue, that
          where it sees one man it may imagine thousands of men of the same
          shape, stature, form, parts; yea, taller, more vigorous, sprightly,
          intelligent, than the man he sees; because it is possible such a
          number may be. Shall not the understanding of God much more know what
          he is able to effect, since the understanding of man can know what he
          is never able to produce, yet may be produced by God, viz. that he who
          produced this man which I see, can produce a thousand exactly like
          him? If the Divine understanding did not know infinite things, but
          were confined to a certain number, it may be demanded whether God can
          understand anything farther than that number, or whether he cannot? If
          he can, then he doth actually understand all those things which he
          hath a power to understand; otherwise there would be an increase of
          God’s knowledge, if it were actually now, and not before, and so he
          would be more perfect than he was before; if he cannot understand
          them, then he cannot understand what a human mind can understand; for
          our understandings can multiply numbers in infinitum; and there is no
          number so great, but a man can still add to it: we must suppose the
          divine understanding more excellent in knowledge. God knows all that a
          man can imagine, though it never were, nor never shall be; he must
          needs know whatsoever is in the power of man to imagine or think,
          because God concurs to the support of the faculty in that imagination;
          and though it may be replied, an atheist may imagine that there is no
          God, a man may imagine that God can lie, or that he can be destroyed;
          doth God know therefore that he is not? or that he can lie, or cease
          to be? No, he knows he cannot; his knowledge extends to things
          possible, not to things impossible to himself; he knows it as
          imaginable by man, not as possible in itself; because it is utterly
          impossible, and repugnant to the nature of God,688 since he eminently
          contains in himself all things possible, past, present, and to come;
          he cannot know himself without knowing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God knowing his own power, knows whatsoever is in his power to
          effect. If he knows not all things possible, he could not know the
          extent of his own power, and so would not know himself, as a cause
          sufficient for more things than he hath created. How can he comprehend
          himself, who comprehends not all effluxes of things possible that may
          come from him, and be wrought by him? How can he know himself as a
          cause, if he know not the objects and works which he is able to
          produce?689 Since the power of God extends to numberless things, his
          knowledge also extends to numberless objects; as if a unit is, could
          see the numbers it could produce, it would see infinite numbers: for a
          unit, as it were, all number. God knowing the fruitfulness of his own
          virtue, knows a numberless multitude of things which he can do, more
          than have been done, or shall be done by him; he therefore knows
          innumerable worlds, innumerable angels, with higher perfections, than
          any of them which he hath created have: so that if the world should
          last many millions of years, God knows that he can every day create
          another world more capacious than this; and having created an
          inconceivable number, he knows he could still create more: so that he
          beholds infinite worlds, infinite numbers of men, and other creatures
          in himself, infinite kinds of things, infinite species, and
          individuals under those kinds, even as many as he can create, if his
          will did order and determine it; for not being ignorant of his own
          power, he cannot be ignorant of the effects wherein it may display and
          discover itself. A comprehensive knowledge of his own power doth
          necessarily include the objects of that power; so he knows whatsoever
          he could effect, and whatsoever he could permit, if he pleased to do
          it. If God could not understand more than he hath created, he could
          not create more than he hath created: for it cannot be conceived how
          he can create anything that he is ignorant of; what he doth not know,
          he cannot do: he must know also the extent of his own goodness, and
          how far anything is capable to partake of it: so much therefore, as
          any detract from the knowledge of God, they detract from his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is further evident that God knows all possible things, because
          he knew those things which he has created, before they were created,
          when they were yet in a possibility. If God knew things before they
          were created, he knew them when they were in a possibility, and not in
          actual reality. It is absurd to imagine that his understanding did
          lackey after the creatures, and draw knowledge from them after they
          were created. It is absurd to think that God did create, before he
          knew what he could or would create. If he knew those things he did
          create when they were possible, he must know all things which he can
          create, and therefore all things that are possible. To conclude this,
          we must consider that this knowledge is of another kind than his
          knowledge of things that are or shall be. He sees possible things as
          possible, not as things that ever are or shall be. If he saw them as
          existing or future, and they shall never be, this knowledge would be
          false, there would be a deceit in it, which cannot be. He knows those
          things not in themselves, because they are not, nor in their causes,
          because they shall never be: he knows them in his own power, not in
          his will: he understands them as able to produce them, not as willing
          to effect them. Things possible he knows only in his power; things
          future he knows both in his power and his will, as he is both able and
          determined in his own good pleasure to give being to them. Those that
          shall never come to pass, he knows only in himself as a sufficient
          cause; those things that shall come into being, he knows in himself as
          the efficient cause, and also in their immediate second causes. This
          should teach us to spend our thoughts in the admiration of the
          excellency of God, and the divine knowledge; his understanding is
          infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, God knows all things past. This is an argument used by God
          himself to elevate his excellency above all the commonly adored idols
          (Isa. xli. 22): “Let them show the former things, what they be, that
          we may consider them, and know the latter end of them.” He knows them
          as if they were now present, and not past: for indeed in his eternity
          there is nothing past or future to his knowledge. This is called
          remembrance, in Scripture, as when God remembered Rachel’s prayer for
          a child (Gen. xxx. 22), and he is said to put tears into his bottle,
          and write them in his book of accompts, which signifies the exact and
          unerring knowledge in God of the minute circumstances past in the
          world; and this knowledge is called a book of remembrance (Mal. iii.
          16), signifying the perpetual presence of things past, before him.
          There are two elegant expressions, signifying the certainty and
          perpetuity of God’s knowledge of sins past (Job xiv. 17), “My
          transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine
          iniquity;” a metaphor, taken from men that put up in a bag the money
          they would charily keep, tie the bag, sew up the holes, and bind it
          hard, that nothing may fall out; or a vessel, wherein they reserve
          liquors, and daub it with pitch and glutinous stuff, that nothing may
          leak out, but be safely kept till the time of use; or else, as some
          think, from the bags attornies carry with them, full of writings, when
          they are to manage a cause against a person. Thus we find God often in
          Scripture calling to men’s minds their past actions, upbraiding them
          with their ingratitude, wherein he testifies his remembrance of his
          own past benefits and their crimes. His knowledge in this regard hath
          something of infinity in it, since though the sins of all men that
          have been in the world are finite in regard of number, yet when the
          sins of one man in thoughts, words, and deeds, are numberless in his
          own account, and perhaps in the count of any creature, the sins of all
          the vast numbers of men that have been, or shall be, are much more
          numberless, it cannot be less than infinite knowledge that can make a
          collection of them, and take a survey of them all at once. If past
          things had not been known by God, how could Moses have been acquainted
          with the original of things? How could he have declared the former
          transactions, wherein all histories are silent but the Scripture? How
          could he know the cause of man’s present misery so many ages after,
          wherewith all philosophy was unacquainted? How could he have writ the
          order of the creation, the particulars of the sin of Adam, the
          circumstances of Cain’s murder, the private speech of Lamech to his
          wives, if God had not revealed them? And how could a revelation be
          made, if things past were forgotten by him? Do we not remember many
          things done among men, as well as by ourselves, and reserve the forms
          of divers things in our minds, which rise as occasions are presented
          to draw them forth? And shall not God much more, who hath no cloud of
          darkness upon his understanding? A man that makes a curious picture,
          hath the form of it in his mind before he made it; and if the fire
          burn it, the form of it in his mind is not destroyed by the fire, but
          retained in it. God’s memory is no less perfect than his
          understanding. If he did not know things past, he could not be a
          righteous Governor, or exercise any judicial act in a righteous
          manner; he could not dispense rewards and punishments, according to
          his promises and threatenings, if things that were past could be
          forgotten by him; he could not require that which is past (Eccles.
          iii. 15), if he did not remember that which is past. And though God be
          said to forget in Scripture, and not to know his people, and his
          people pray to him to remember them, as if he had forgotten them (Ps.
          cxix. 49), this is improperly ascribed to God.690 As God is said to
          repent, when he changes things according to his counsel beyond the
          expectation of men, so he is said to forget, when he defers the making
          good his promise to the godly, or his threatenings to the wicked; this
          is not a defect of memory belonging to his mind, but an act of his
          will. When he is said to remember his covenant, it is to will grace
          according to his covenant; when he is said to forget his covenant, it
          is to intercept the influences of it, whereby to punish the sin of his
          people; and when he is said not to know his people, it is not an
          absolute forgetfulness of them, but withdrawing from them the
          testimonies of his kindness, and clouding the signs of his favor; so
          God in pardon is said to forget sin, not that he ceaseth to know it,
          but ceaseth to punish it. It is not to be meant of a simple
          forgetfulness, or a lapse of his memory, but of a judicial
          forgetfulness; so when his people in Scripture pray, Lord, remember
          thy word unto thy servant, no more is to be understood but, Lord,
          fulfil thy word and promise to thy servant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, He knows things present (Heb. iv. 13): “All things are naked
          and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do;” this is
          grounded upon the knowledge of himself; it is not so difficult to know
          all creatures exactly, as to know himself, because they are finite,
          but himself is infinite; he knows his own power, and therefore
          everything through which his omnipotence is diffused, all the acts and
          objects of it; not the least thing that is the birth of his power, can
          be concealed from him; he knows his own goodness, and therefore every
          object upon which the warm beams of his goodness strike; he therefore
          knows distinctly the properties of every creature, because every
          property in them is a ray of his goodness; he is not only the
          efficient, but the exemplary cause; therefore as he knows all that his
          power hath wrought, as he is the efficient, so he knows them in
          himself as the pattern; as a carpenter can give an account of every
          part and passage in a house he hath built, by consulting the model in
          his own mind, whereby he built it. “He looked upon all things after he
          had made them, and pronounced them good” (Gen. i. 3), full of a
          natural goodness he had endowed them with: he did not ignorantly
          pronounce them so, and call them good, whether he knew them or not;
          and therefore he knows them in particular, as he knew them all in
          their first presence. Is there any reason he should be ignorant of
          everything now present in the world, or that anything that derives an
          existence from him as a free cause, should be concealed from him? If
          he did not know things present in their particularities, many things
          would be known by man, yea, by beasts, which the infinite God were
          ignorant of; and if he did not know all things present, but only some,
          it is possible for the most blessed God to be deceived and be
          miserable: ignorance is a calamity to the understanding: he could not
          prescribe laws to his creatures, unless he knew their natures to which
          those laws were to be suited: no, not natural ordinances to the sun,
          moon, and heavenly bodies, and inanimate creatures, unless he knew the
          vigor and virtue in them, to execute those ordinances; for to
          prescribe laws above the nature of things, is inconsistent with the
          wisdom of government; he must know how far they were able to obey;
          whether the laws were suited to their ability: and for his rational
          creatures, whether the punishments annexed to the law were proper, and
          suited to the transgression of the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He knows all creatures from the highest to the lowest, the least as
          well as the greatest. He knows the ravens and their young ones (Job
          xxxviii. 41); the drops of rain and dew which he hath begotten (Job
          xxxviii. 29); every bird in the air, as well as any man doth what he
          hath in a cage at home (Ps. l. 11): “I know all the fowls in the
          mountains, and the wild beasts in the field;” which some read creeping
          things. The clouds are numbered in his wisdom (Job xxxviii. 37); every
          worm in the earth, every drop of rain that falls upon the ground, the
          flakes of snow, and the knots of hail, the sands upon the sea‑shore,
          the hairs upon the head; it is no more absurd to imagine that God
          knows them, than that God made them; they are all the effects of his
          power, as well as the stars which he calls by their names, as well as
          the most glorious angel and blessed spirit; he knows them as well as
          if there were none but them in particular for him to know; the least
          things were framed by his art as well as the greatest; the least
          things partake of his goodness as well as the greatest; he knows his
          own arts, and his own goodness, and therefore all the stamps and
          impressions of them upon all his creatures; he knows the immediate
          causes of the least, and therefore the effects of those causes. Since
          his knowledge is infinite, it must extend to those things which are at
          the greatest distance from him, to those which approach nearest to not
          being; since he did not want power to create, he cannot want
          understanding to know everything he hath created, the dispositions,
          qualities, and virtues of the minutest creature. Nor is the
          understanding of God embased, and suffers a diminution by the
          knowledge of the vilest and most inconsiderable things. Is it not an
          imperfection to be ignorant of the nature of anything? and can God
          have such a defect in his most perfect understanding? Is the
          understanding of man of an impurer alloy by knowing the nature of the
          rankest poisons? by understanding a fly, or a small insect? or by
          considering the deformity of a toad? Is it not generally counted a
          note of a dignified mind to be able to discourse of the nature of
          them? Was Solomon, who knew all from the cedar to the hyssop, debased
          by so rich a present of wisdom from his Creator? Is any glass defiled
          by presenting a deformed image? Is there anything more vile than the
          “imaginations, which are only evil, and continually?” Doth not the
          mind of man descend to the mud of the earth, play the adulterer or
          idolater with mean objects, suck in the most unclean things? yet God
          knows these in all their circumstances, in every appearance, inside
          and outside. Is there anything viler than some thoughts of men? than
          some actions of men? their unclean beds and gluttonous vomiting, and
          Luciferian pride? yet do not these fall under the eye of God, in all
          their nakedness? The Second Person’s taking human nature, though it
          obscured, yet it did not disparage the Deity, or bring any disgrace to
          it. Is gold the worse for being formed into the image of a fly? doth
          it not still retain the nobleness of the metal? When men are despised
          for descending to the knowledge of mean and vile things, it is because
          they neglect the knowledge of the greater, and sin in their inquiries
          after lesser things, with a neglect of that which concerns more the
          honor of God and the happiness of themselves; to be ambitious of such
          a knowledge, and careless of that of more concern, is criminal and
          contemptible. But God knows the greatest as well as the least; mean
          things are not known by him to exclude the knowledge of the greater;
          nor are vile things governed by him to exclude the order of the
          better. The deformity of objects known by God doth not deform him, nor
          defile him; he doth not view them without himself, but within himself,
          wherein all things in their ideas are beautiful and comely: our
          knowledge of a deformed thing is not a deforming of our understanding,
          but is beautiful in the knowledge, though it be not in the object; nor
          is there any fear that the understanding of God should become material
          by knowing material things, any more than our understandings lose
          their spirituality by knowing the nature of bodies; it is to be
          observed, therefore, that only those senses of men, as seeing,
          hearing, smelling, which have those qualities for their objects that
          come nearest the nature of spiritual things, as light, sounds,
          fragrant odors, are ascribed to God in Scripture; not touching or
          tasting, which are senses that are not exercised without a more
          immediate commerce with gross matter; and the reason may be, because
          we should have no gross thoughts of God, as if he were a body, and
          made of matter, like the things he knows.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As he knows all creatures, so God knows all the actions of
          creatures. He counts in particular all the ways of men. “Doth he not
          see all my ways, and count all my steps” (Job xxxi. 4)? He “tells”
          their “wanderings,” as if one by one (Ps. lvi. 8). “His eyes are upon
          all the ways of man, and he sees all his goings” (Job xxxiv. 21); a
          metaphor taken from men, when they look wistly, with fixed eyes upon a
          thing, to view it in every circumstance, whence it comes, whether it
          goes, to observe every little motion of it. God’s eye is not a
          wandering, but a fixed eye; and the ways of man are not only “before
          his eyes,” but he doth exactly “ponder them” (Prov. v. 21); as one
          that will not be ignorant of the least mite in them, but weigh and
          examine them by the standard of his law; he may as well know the
          motions of our members, as the hairs of our heads; the smallest
          actions before they be, whether civil, natural, or religious, fall
          under his cognizance; what meaner than a man carrying a pitcher, yet
          our Saviour foretels it (Luke xxii. 10); God knows not only what men
          do, but what they would have done, had he not restrained them; what
          Abimelech would have done to Sarah, had not God put a bar in his way
          (Gen. xx. 6); what a man that is taken away in his youth would have
          done, had he lived to a riper age; yea, he knows the most secret words
          as well as actions; the words spoken by the king of Israel in his
          bed‑chamber, were revealed to Elisha (2 Kings vi. 12); and indeed, how
          can any action of man be concealed from God? Can we view the various
          actions of a heap of ants, or a hive of bees in a glass, without
          turning our eyes; and shall not God behold the actions of all men in
          the world, which are less than bees or ants in his sight, and more
          visible to him than an ant‑hill or bee‑hive can be to the acutest eye
          of man?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As God knows all the actions of creatures, so he knows all the
          thoughts of creatures. The thoughts are the most closeted acts of man,
          hid from men and angels, unless disclosed by some outward expressions;
          but God descends into the depths and abysses of the soul, discerns the
          most inward contrivances; nothing is impenetrable to him; the sun doth
          not so much enlighten the earth, as God understands the heart; all
          things are as visible to him, as flies and motes enclosed in a body of
          transparent crystal; this man naturally allows to God. Men often speak
          to God by the motions of their minds and secret ejaculations, which
          they would not do, if it were not naturally implanted in them, that
          God knows all their inward motions; the Scripture is plain and
          positive in this, “He tries the heart and the reins” (Ps. vii. 9), as
          men, by the use of fire, discern the drossy and purer parts of metals.
          The secret intentions and aims, the most lurking affections seated in
          the reins; he knows that which no man, no angel, is able to know,
          which a man himself knows not, nor makes any particular reflection
          upon; yea, “he weighs the Spirit” (Prov. xvi. 2); he exactly numbers
          all the devices and inclinations of men, as men do every piece of coin
          they tell out of a heap. “He discerns the thoughts and intents of the
          heart” (Heb. iv. 12); all that is in the mind, all that is in the
          affections, every stirring and purpose; “so that not one thought can
          be withheld from him” (Job xlii. 2); yea, “Hell and destruction are
          before him, much more then the hearts of the children of men” (Prov.
          xv. 11); he works all things in the bowels of the earth, and brings
          forth all things out of that treasure, say some; but more naturally,
          God knows the whole state of the dead, all the receptacles and graves
          of their bodies, all the bodies of men consumed by the earth, or
          devoured by living creatures; things that seem to be out of all being;
          he knows the thoughts of the devils and damned creatures, whom he hath
          cast out of his care forever into the arms of his justice, never more
          to cast a delightful glance towards them; not a secret in any soul in
          hell (which he hath no need to know, because he shall not judge them
          by any of the thoughts they now have, since they were condemned to
          punishment) is hid from him; much more is he acquainted with the
          thoughts of living men, the counsels of whose hearts are yet to be
          manifested, in order to their trial and censure; yea, he knows them
          before they spring up into actual being (Ps. cxxxix. 2): “Thou
          understandest my thoughts afar off;” my thoughts, that is, every
          thought; though innumerable thoughts pass through me in a day, and
          that in the source and fountain, when it is yet in the womb, before it
          is our thought; if he knows them before their existence, before they
          can be properly called ours, much more doth he know them when they
          actually spring up in us: he knows the tendency of them; where the
          bird will light when it is in flight; he knows them exactly, he is
          therefore called a “discerner” or criticiser “of the heart” (Heb. iv.
          12), as a critic discerns every letter, point, and stop; he is more
          intimate with us than our souls with our bodies, and hath more the
          possession of us than we have of ourselves; he knows them by an
          inspection into the heart, not by the mediation of second causes, by
          the looks or gestures of men, as men may discern the thoughts of one
          another. (1.) God discerns all good motions of the mind and will.
          These he puts into men, and needs must God know his own act; he knew
          the son of “Jeroboam to have some good thing in him towards the Lord
          God of Israel” (1 Kings xiv. 13); and the integrity of David and
          Hezekiah; the freest motions of the will and affections to him: “Lord,
          thou knowest that I love thee,” saith Peter (John xxi. 17). Love can
          be no more restrained, than the will itself can; a man may make
          another to grieve and desire, but none can force another to love. (2.)
          God discerns all the evil motions of the mind and will; “Every
          imagination of the heart” (Gen. vi. 5); the vanity of “men’s thoughts”
          (Ps. xciv. 11); their inward darkness, and deceitful disguises. No
          wonder that God, who fashioned the heart, should understand the
          motions of it (Ps. xxxiii. 13, 15): “He looks from heaven and beholds
          all the children of men; he fashioneth their hearts alike, and
          considers all their works.” Doth any man make a watch, and yet be
          ignorant of its motion? Did God fling away the key to this secret
          cabinet, when he framed it, and put off the power of unlocking it when
          he pleased? He did not surely frame it in such a posture as that
          anything in it should be hid from his eye; he did not fashion it to be
          privileged from his government; which would follow if he were ignorant
          of what was minted and coined in it. He could not be a Judge to punish
          men, if the inward frames and principles of men’s actions were
          concealed from him; an outward action may glitter to an outward eye,
          yet the secret spring be a desire of applause, and not the fear and
          love of God. If the inward frames of the heart did lie covered from
          him in the secret recesses of the heart; those plausible acts, which
          in regard of their principles, would merit a punishment, would meet
          with a reward; and God should bestow happiness where he had denounced
          misery. As without the knowledge of what is just, he could not be a
          wise Lawgiver, so without the knowledge of what is inwardly committed,
          he could not be a righteous Judge: acts that are rotten in the spring,
          might be judged good by the fair color and appearance. This is the
          glory of God at the last day, “to manifest the secrets of all hearts”
          (1 Cor. iv. 5); and the prophet Jeremiah links the power of judging
          and the prerogative of trying the hearts together (Jer. xi. 20): “But
          thou, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins
          and the heart;” and (Jer. xvii. 10): “I, the Lord, search the heart, I
          try the reins;” to what end? even to “give every man according to his
          way, and according to the fruit of his doings.” And, indeed, his
          binding up the whole law with that command of not coveting, evidenceth
          that he will judge men by the inward affections and frames of their
          hearts. Again, God sustains the mind of man in every act of thinking;
          in him we have not only the principle of life, but every motion, the
          motion of our minds as well as of our members: “In him we live and
          move,” &amp;c. (Acts xvii. 28). Since he supports the vigor of the
          faculty in every act, can he be ignorant of those acts which spring
          from the faculty, to which he doth at that instant communicate power
          and ability? Now this knowledge of the thoughts of men is,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. An incommunicable property, belonging only to the Divine
          understanding. Creatures, indeed, may know the thoughts of others by
          divine revelation, but not by themselves; no creature hath a key
          immediately to open the minds of men, and see all that lodgeth there;
          no creature can fathom the heart by the line of created knowledge.691
          Devils may have a conjectural knowledge, and may guess at them, by the
          acquaintance they have with the disposition and constitution of men,
          and the images they behold in their fancies; and by some marks which
          an inward imagination may stamp upon the brain, blood, animal spirits,
          face, &amp;c. But the knowing the thoughts merely as thought, without
          any impression by it, is a royalty God appropriates to himself, as the
          main secret of his government, and a perfection declarative of his
          Deity, as much as any else (Jer. xvii. 9, 10): “The heart of man is
          desperately wicked, who can know it?” yes, there is one, and but one,
          “I, the Lord, search the heart, I try the reins.” “Man looks on the
          outward appearance, but the Lord looks upon the heart” (1 Sam. xvi.
          7); where God is distinguished by this perfection from all men
          whatsoever, others may know by revelation, as Elisha did what was in
          Gehazi’s heart (2 Kings, v. 26). But God knows a man more than any man
          knows himself; what person upon earth understands the windings and
          turnings of his own heart, what reserves it will have, what
          contrivances, what inclinations? all which God knows exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. God acquires no new knowledge of the thoughts and hearts by the
          discovery of them in the actions. He would then be but equal in this
          part of knowledge to his creature; no man or angel but may thus arrive
          to the knowledge of them; God were then excluded from an absolute
          dominion over the prime work of his lower creation; he would have made
          a creature superior in this respect to himself, upon whose will to
          discover, his knowledge of their inward intentions should depend; and
          therefore when God is said to search the heart, we must not understand
          it as if God were ignorant before, and was fain to make an exact
          scrutiny and inquiry, before he attained what he desired to know; but
          God condescends to our capacity in the expression of his own
          knowledge, signifying that his knowledge is as complete as any man’s
          knowledge can be of the designs of others, after he hath sifted them
          by a strict and thorough examination, and wrung out a discovery of
          their intentions; that he knows them as perfectly as if he had put
          them upon the rack, and and forced them to make a discovery of their
          secret plottings. Nor must we understand that in Gen. xxii. 12, where
          God saith, after Abraham had stretched out his hand to sacrifice his
          son, “Now I know that thou fearest God,” as though God was ignorant of
          Abraham’s gracious disposition to him; did Abraham’s drawing his knife
          furnish God with a new knowledge? no, God knew Abraham’s pious
          inclinations before (Gen. xviii. 19): “I know him, that he will
          command his children after him,” &amp;c. Knowledge is sometimes taken
          for approbation; then the sense will be, Now I approve this fact as a
          testimony of thy fear of me, since thy affection to thy Isaac is
          extinguished by the more powerful flame of affection to my will and
          command; I now accept thee, and count thee a meet subject of my
          choicest benefits: or, Now I know, that is, I have made known and
          manifested the faith of Abraham to himself and to the world: thus Paul
          uses the word know (1 Cor. ii. 2): “I have determined to know
          nothing;” that is, to declare and teach nothing, to make known nothing
          but Christ crucified: or else, Now I know, that is, I have an evidence
          and experiment in this noble fact, that thou fearest me. God often
          condescends to our capacity in speaking of himself after the manner of
          men, as if he had (as men do) known the inward affections of others by
          their outward actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God knows all the evils and sins of creatures. (1.) God knows all
          sin. This follows upon the other. If he knows all the actions and
          thoughts of creatures, he knows also all the sinfulness in those acts
          and thoughts. This Zophar infers from God’s punishing men (Job xi.
          11); for he knows vain man, he sees his wickedness also; he knows
          every man, and sees the wickedness of every man; he looks down from
          heaven, and beholds not only the filthy persons, but what is filthy in
          them (Psal. xiv. 2, 3), all nations in the world, and every man of
          every nation; none of their iniquity is hid from his eyes; he searches
          Jerusalem with candles (Jer. xvi. 17). God follows sinners step by
          step, with his eye, and will not leave searching out till he hath
          taken them; a metaphor taken from one that searches all chinks with a
          candle, that nothing can be hid from him. He knows it distinctly in
          all the parts of it, how an adulterer rises out of his bed to commit
          uncleanness, what contrivances he had, what steps he took, every
          circumstance in the whole progress; not only evil in the bulk, but
          every one of the blacker spots upon it, which may most aggravate it.
          If he did not know evil, how could he permit it, order it, punish it,
          or pardon it? Doth he permit he knows not what? order to his own holy
          ends what he is ignorant of? punish or pardon that which he is
          uncertain whether it be a crime or no? “Cleanse me,” saith David,
          “from my secret faults” (Ps. xix. 12), secret in regard of others,
          secret in regard of himself; how could God cleanse him from that
          whereof he was ignorant? He knows sins before they are committed, much
          more when they are in act; he foreknew the idolatry and apostacy of
          the Jews; what gods they would serve, in what measure they would
          provoke him, and violate his covenant (Deut. xxxi. 20, 21); he knew
          Judas’ sin long before Judas’ actual existence, foretelling it in the
          Psalms; and Christ predicts it before he acted it. He sees sins future
          in his own permitting will; he sees sins present in his own supporting
          act. As he knows things possible to himself, because he knows his own
          power, so he knows things practicable by the creature, because he
          knows the power and principles of the creature.692 This sentiment of
          God is naturally written in the fears of sinners, upon lightning,
          thunder, or some prodigious operation of God in the world; what is the
          language of them, but that he sees their deeds, hears their words,
          knows the inward sinfulness of their hearts; that he doth not only
          behold them as a mere spectator, but considers them as a just judge.
          And the poets say, that the sins of men leaped into heaven, and were
          writ in parchments of Jupiter,693 scelus in terram geritur, in cœlo
          scribitur: sin is acted on earth, and recorded in heaven. God indeed
          doth not behold evil with the approving eye; he knows it not with a
          practical knowledge to be the author of it, but with a speculative
          knowledge, so as to understand the sinfulness of it; or a knowledge
          simplicis intelligentiæ, of simple intelligence, as he permits them,
          not positively wills them; he knows them not with a knowledge of
          assent to them, but dissent from them. Evil pertains to a dissenting
          act of the mind, and an aversive act of the will; and what though evil
          formerly taken, hath no distinct conception, because it is a
          privation; a defect hath no being, and all knowledge is by the
          apprehension of some being; would not this lie as strongly against our
          own knowledge of sin? Sin is a privation of the rectitude due to an
          act; and who doubts man’s knowledge of sin? by his knowing the act, he
          knows the deficiency of the act; the subject of evil hath a being, and
          so hath a conception in the mind; that which hath no being cannot be
          known by itself, or in itself; but will it follow that it cannot be
          known by its contrary? as we know darkness to be a privation of light,
          and folly to be a privation of wisdom. God knows good all by himself,
          because he is the sovereign good; is it strange then, that he should
          know all evil, since all evil is in some natural good. (2.) The manner
          of God’s knowing evil is not so easily known. And indeed, as we cannot
          comprehend the essence of God, though it is easily intelligible that
          there is such a Being, so we can as little comprehend the manner of
          God’s knowledge, though we cannot but conclude him to be an
          intelligent Being, a pure understanding, knowing all things. As God
          hath a higher manner of being than his creatures, so he hath another
          and higher manner of knowing; and we can as little comprehend the
          manner of his knowing, as we can the manner of his being. But as to
          the manner, doth not God know his own law? and shall he not know how
          much any action comes short of his rule? he cannot know his own rule
          without knowing all the deviations from it. He knows his own holiness,
          and shall he not see how any action is contrary to the holiness of his
          own nature? Doth not God know everything that is true? and is it not
          true that this or that is evil? and shall God be ignorant of any
          truth? How doth God know that he cannot lie, but by knowing his own
          veracity? How doth God know that he cannot die, but by knowing his own
          immutability? and by knowing those, he knows what a lie is, he knows
          what death is; so if sin never had been, if no creature had ever been,
          God would have known what sin was, because he knows his own holiness;
          because he knew what law was fit to be appointed to his creatures if
          he should create them, and that that law might be transgressed by
          them. God knows all good, all goodness in himself; he therefore hath a
          foundation in himself to know all that comes short of that goodness,
          that is opposite to that holiness: as if light were capable of
          understanding, it would know darkness only by knowing itself; by
          knowing itself, it would know what is contrary to itself. God knows
          all created goodness which he hath planted in the creature; he knows
          then all defects from this goodness, what perfection an act is
          deprived of; what is opposite to that goodness, and that is evil. As
          we know sickness by health, discord by harmony, blindness by sight,
          because it is a privation of sight, whosoever knows one contrary knows
          the other; God knows unrighteousness by the idea which he hath of
          righteousness, and sees an act deprived of that rectitude and goodness
          which ought to be in it; he knows evil because he knows the causes
          whence evil proceeds.694 A painter knows a picture of his own framing,
          and if any one dashes any base color upon it, shall not he also know
          that? God by his hand painted all creatures, impressed upon man the
          fair stamp and color of his own image; the devil defiles it; man daubs
          it. Doth not God, that knows his own work, know how this piece is
          become different from his work? Doth not God, that knows his
          creatures’ goodness, which himself was the fountain of, know the
          change of this goodness? Yea, he knew before, that the devil would sow
          tares where he had sown wheat; and therefore that controversy of some
          in the schools, whether God knew evil by its opposition to created or
          uncreated goodness, is needless. We may say God knows sin as it is
          opposite to created goodness, yet he knows it radically by his own
          goodness, because he knows the goodness he hath communicated to the
          creature by his own essential goodness in himself. To conclude this
          head: The knowledge of sin doth not bespot the holiness of God’s
          nature; for the bare knowledge of a crime doth not infect the mind of
          man with the filth and pollution of that crime, for then every man
          that knows an act of murder committed by another, would, by that bare
          knowledge, be tainted with his sin; yea, and a judge that condemns a
          malefactor, may as well condemn himself if this were so: the knowledge
          of sins infects not the understandings that knows them, but only the
          will that approves them. It is no discredit to us to know evil, in
          order to pass a right judgment upon it; so neither can it be to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, God knows all future things, all things to come. The
          differences of time cannot hinder a knowledge of all things by him,
          who is before time, above time, that is not measured by hours, or
          days, or years; if God did not know them, the hindrance must be in
          himself, or in the things themselves, because they are things to come:
          not in himself; if it did, it must arise from some impotency in his
          own nature, and so we render him weak; or from an unwillingness to
          know, and so we render him lazy, and an enemy to his own perfection;
          for, simply considered, the knowledge of more things is a greater
          perfection than the knowledge of a few; and if the knowledge of a
          thing includes something of perfection, the ignorance of a thing
          includes something of imperfection. The knowledge of future things is
          a greater perfection than not to know them, and is accounted among men
          a great part of wisdom, which they call foresight; it is then surely a
          greater perfection in God to know future things, than to be ignorant
          of them. And would God rather have something of imperfection than be
          possessor of all perfection? Nor doth the hindrance lie in the things
          themselves, because their futurition depends upon his will; for as
          nothing can actually be without his will, giving it existence, so
          nothing can be future without his will, designing the futurity of it.
          Certainly if God knows all things possible, which he will not do, he
          must know all things future, which he is not only able, but resolved
          to do, or resolved to permit. God’s perfect knowledge of himself, that
          is, of his own infinite power and concluding will, necessarily
          includes a foreknowledge of what he is able to do, and what he will
          do. Again, if God doth not know future things, there was a time when
          God was ignorant of most things in the world; for before the deluge he
          was more ignorant than after; the more things were done in the world,
          the more knowledge did accrue to God, and so the more perfection; then
          the understanding of God was not perfect from eternity, but in time;
          nay, is not perfect yet, if he be ignorant of those things which are
          still to come to pass; he must tarry for a perfection he wants, till
          those futurities come to be in act, till those things which are to
          come, cease to be future, and begin to be present. Either God knows
          them, or desires to know them; if he desires to know them and doth
          not, there is something wanting to him; all desire speaks an absence
          of the object desired, and a sentiment of want in the person desiring:
          if he doth not desire to know them, nay, if he doth not actually know
          them, it destroys all providence, all his government of affairs; for
          his providence hath a concatenation of means with a prospect of
          something that is future: as in Joseph’s case, who was put into the
          pit, and sold to the Egyptians in order to his future advancement, and
          the preservation both of his father and his envious brethren. If God
          did not know all the future inclinations and actions of men, something
          might have been done by the will of Potiphar, or by the free‑will of
          Pharaoh, whereby Joseph might have been cut short of his advancement,
          and so God have been interrupted in the track and method of his
          designed providences. He that hath decreed to govern man for that end
          he hath designed him, knows all the means before, whereby he will
          govern him, and therefore hath a distinct and certain knowledge of all
          things; for a confused knowledge is an imperfection in government; it
          is in this the infiniteness of his understanding is more seen than in
          knowing things past or present; his eyes are a flame of fire (Rev. i.
          14), in regard of the penetrating virtue of them into things
          impenetrable by any else. To make it further appear that God knows all
          things future, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Everything which is the object of God’s knowledge without himself
          was once only future. There was a moment when nothing was in being but
          himself: he knew nothing actually past, because nothing was past;
          nothing actually present, because nothing had any existence but
          himself; therefore only what was future. And why not everything that
          is future now, as well as only what was future and to come to pass
          just at the beginning of the creation? God indeed knows everything as
          present, but the things themselves known by him were not present, but
          future; the whole creation was once future, or else it was from
          eternity; if it begun in time, it was once future in itself, else it
          could never have begun to be. Did not God know what would be created
          by him, before it was created by him?695 Did he create he knew not
          what, and knew not before, what he should create? Was he ignorant
          before he acted, and in his acting, what his operation would tend to?
          or did he not know the nature of things, and the ends of them, till he
          had produced them and saw them in being? Creatures, then, did not
          arise from his knowledge, but his knowledge from them; he did not then
          will that his creatures should be, for he had then willed what he knew
          not, and knew not what he willed; they, therefore, must be known
          before they were made, and not known because they were made; he knew
          them to make them, and he did not make them to know them; By the same
          reason that he knew what creatures should be before they were, he
          knows still what creatures shall be before they are;696 for all things
          that are, were in God, not really in their own nature, but in him as a
          cause; so the earth and heavens were in him, as a model is in the mind
          of a workman, which is in his mind and soul, before it be brought
          forth into outward act.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The predictions of future things evidence this. There is not a
          prophecy of any thing to come, but is a spark of his foreknowledge,
          and bears witness to the truth of this assertion, in the punctual
          accomplishment of it; this is a thing challenged by God as his own
          peculiar, wherein he surmounts all the idols that man’s inventions
          have godded in the world (Isa. xli. 21, 22): Let them bring them forth
          (speaking of the idols) and show us what shall happen, or declare us
          things to come: show the things that are to come hereafter, that we
          may know that you are gods. Such a fore‑knowledge of things to come,
          is here ascribed to God by God himself, as a distinction of him from
          all false gods; such a knowledge, that if any could prove that they
          were possessors of, he would acknowledge them gods as well as himself:
          “that we may know that you are gods.” He puts his Deity to stand or
          fall upon this account, and this should be the point which should
          decide the controversy, whether he or the heathen idols were the true
          God; the dispute is managed by this medium,—He that knows things to
          come, is God; I know things to come, ergo, I am God; the idols know
          not things to come, therefore they are not gods; God submits the being
          of his Deity to this trial. If God know things to come no more than
          the heathen idols, which were either devils or men, he would be, in
          his own account, no more a God than devils or men, no more a God than
          the pagan idols he doth scoff at for this defect. If the heathen idols
          were to be stripped of their deity for want of this foreknowledge of
          things to come, would not the true God also fall from the same
          excellency if he were defective in knowledge? He would, in his own
          judgment, no more deserve the title and character of a God than they.
          How could he reproach them for that, if it were wanting in himself? It
          cannot be understood of future things in their causes, when the
          effects necessarily arise from such causes, as light from the sun, and
          heat from the fire: many of these men know; more of them angels and
          devils know: if God, therefore, had not a higher and farther knowledge
          than this, he would not by this be proved to be God any more than
          angels and devils, who know necessary effects in their causes. The
          devils, indeed, did predict some things in the heathen oracles; but
          God is differenced from them here by the infiniteness of his
          knowledge, in being able to predict things to come that they knew not,
          or things in their particularities, things that depended on the
          liberty of man’s will, which the devils could lay no claim to a
          certain knowledge of. Were it only a conjectural knowledge that is
          here meant, the devils might answer, they can conjecture, and so their
          deity was as good as God’s; for, though God might know more things,
          and conjecture nearer to what would be, yet still it would be but
          conjectural, and therefore not a higher kind of knowledge than what
          the devils might challenge. How much, then, is God beholden to the
          Socinians for denying the knowledge of all future things to him, upon
          which here he puts the trial of his Deity? God asserts his knowledge
          of things to come, as a manifest evidence of his Godhead; those that
          deny, therefore, the argument that proves it, deny the conclusion too;
          for this will necessarily follow, that if he be God, because he knows
          future things then he that doth not know future things is not God; and
          if God knows not future things but only by conjecture, then there is
          no God, because a certain knowledge, so as infallibly to predict
          things to come, is an inseparable perfection of the Deity: it was,
          therefore, well said of Austin, that it was as high a madness to deny
          God to be, as to deny him the foreknowledge of things to come. The
          whole prophetic part of Scripture declares this perfection of God;
          every prophet’s candle was lighted at this torch; they could not have
          this foreknowledge of themselves; why might not many other men have
          the same insight, if it were nature? It must be from some superior
          Agent; and all nations owned prophecy as a beam from God, a fruit of
          Divine illumination.697 Prophecy must be totally expunged if this be
          denied; for the subjects of prophecy are things future, and no man is
          properly a prophet but in prediction. Now prediction is nothing but
          foretelling, and things foretold are not yet come, and the foretelling
          of them supposeth them not to be yet, but that they shall be in time;
          several such predictions we have in Scripture, the event whereof hath
          been certain. The years of famine in Egypt foretold that he would
          order second causes for bringing that judgment upon them; the
          captivity of his people in Babylon, the calling of the Gentiles, the
          rejection of the Jews. Daniel’s revelation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream;
          that prince refers to God as the revealer of secrets (Dan. ii. 47). By
          the same reason that he knows one thing future by himself, and by the
          infiniteness of his knowledge before any causes of them appear, he
          doth know all things future.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Some future things are known by men; and we must allow God a
          greater knowledge than any creature. Future things in their causes may
          be known by angels and men, (as I said before); whosoever knows
          necessary causes, and the efficacy of them, may foretell the effects;
          and when he sees the meeting and concurrence of several causes
          together, he may presage what the consequent effect will be of such a
          concurrence: so physicians foretel the progress of a disease, the
          increase or diminution of it by natural signs; and astronomers foretel
          eclipses by their observation of the motion of heavenly bodies, many
          years before they happen;698 can they be hid from God, with whom are
          the reasons of all things?699 An expert gardener, by knowing the root
          in the depth of winter, can tell what flowers and what fruit it will
          bear, and the month when they will peep out their heads; and shall not
          God much more, that knows the principles of all his creatures, and is
          exactly privy to all their natures and qualities, know what they will
          be, and what operations shall be from those principles? Now, if God
          did know things only in their causes, his knowledge would not be more
          excellent than the knowledge of angels and men, though he might know
          more than they of the things that will come to pass, from every cause
          singly, and from the concurrence of many. Now, as God is more
          excellent in being than his creature, so he is more excellent in the
          objects of his knowledge, and the manner of his knowledge; well, then,
          shall a certain knowledge of something future, and a conjectural
          knowledge of many things, be found among men? and shall a determinate
          and infallible knowledge of things to come be found nowhere, in no
          being? If the conjecture of future things savours of ignorance, and
          God knows them only by conjecture, there is, then, no such thing in
          being as a perfect intelligent Being, and so no God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God knows his own decree and will, and therefore must needs know
          all future things. If anything be future, or to come to pass, it must
          be from itself or from God: not from itself, then it would be
          independent and absolute: if it hath its futurity from God, then God
          must know what he hath decreed to come to pass; those things that are
          future, in necessary causes, God must know, because he willed them to
          be causes of such effects; he, therefore, knows them, because he knows
          what he willed. The knowledge of God cannot arise from the things
          themselves, for then the knowledge of God would have a cause without
          him; and knowledge, which is an eminent perfection, would be conferred
          upon him by his creatures. But as God sees things possible in the
          glass of his own power, so he sees things future in the glass of his
          own will; in his effecting will, if he hath decreed to produce them;
          in his permitting will, as he hath decreed to suffer them and dispose
          of them; nothing can pass out of the rank of things merely possible
          into the order of things future, before some act of God’s will hath
          passed for its futurition.700 It is not from the infiniteness of his
          own nature, simply considered, that God knows things to be future;701
          for as things are not future because God is infinite (for then all
          possible things should be future), so neither is any thing known to be
          future only because God is infinite, but because God hath decreed it;
          his declaration of things to come, is founded upon his appointment of
          things to come.702 In Isaiah xliv. 7, it is said, “And who, as I,
          shall call and declare it, since I appointed the ancient people, and
          the things that are coming?”703 Nothing is created or ordered in the
          world but what God decreed to be created and ordered. God knows his
          own decree, and therefore all things which he hath decreed to exist in
          time; not the minutest part of the world could have existed without
          his will, not an action can be done without his will; as life, the
          principle, so motion, the fruit of that life, is by and from God; as
          he decreed life to this or that thing, so he decreed motion as the
          effect of life, and decreed to exert his power in concurring with
          them, for producing effects natural from such causes; for without such
          a concourse they could not have acted anything, or produced anything;
          and therefore as for natural things, which we call necessary causes,
          God foreseeing them all particularly in his own decree, foresaw also
          all effects which must necessarily flow from them, because such causes
          cannot but act when they are furnished with all things necessary for
          action: he knows his own decrees, and therefore necessarily knows what
          he hath decreed, or else we must say things come to pass whether God
          will or no, or that he wills he knows not what; but this cannot be,
          for “known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the
          world” (Acts xv. 18). Now this necessarily flows from that principle
          first laid down, that God knows himself, since nothing is future
          without God’s will; if God did not know future things, he would not
          know his own will; for as things possible could not be known by him,
          unless he knew the fulness of his own power, so things future could
          not be known by his understanding, unless he knew the resolves of his
          own will. Thus the knowledge of God differs from the knowledge of
          men;704 God’s knowledge of his works precedes his works; man’s
          knowledge of God’s works follows his works, just as an artificer’s
          knowledge of a watch, instrument, or engine, which he would make, is
          before his making of it; he knows the motion of it, and the reason of
          those motions before it is made, because he knows what he hath
          determined to work; he knows not those motions from the consideration
          of them after they were made, as the spectator doth, who, by viewing
          the instrument after it is made, gains a knowledge from the sight and
          the consideration of it, till he understands the reason of the whole;
          so we know things from the consideration of them after we see them in
          being, and therefore we know not future things: but God’s knowledge
          doth not arise from things because they are, but because he wills them
          to be; and therefore he knows everything that shall be, because it
          cannot be without his will, as the Creator and maintainer of all
          things; knowing his own substance, he knows all his works.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If God did not know all future things, he would be mutable in his
          knowledge. If he did not know all things that ever were or are to be,
          there would be upon the appearance of every new object, an addition of
          light to his understanding, and therefore such a change in him as
          every new knowledge causes in the mind of a man, or as the sun works
          in the world upon its rising every morning, scattering the darkness
          that was upon the face of the earth; if he did not know them before
          they came, he would gain a knowledge by them when they came to pass,
          which he had not before they were effected; his knowledge would be new
          according to the newness of the objects, and multiplied according to
          the multitude of the objects. If God did know things to come as
          perfectly as he knew things present and past, but knew those
          certainly, and the others doubtfully and conjecturally, he would
          suffer some change, and acquire some perfection in his knowledge, when
          those future things should cease to be future, and become present; for
          he would know it more perfectly when it were present, than he did when
          it was future, and so there would be a change from imperfection to a
          perfection; but God is every way immutable. Besides, that perfection
          would not arise from the nature of God, but from the existence and
          presence of the thing; but who will affirm that God acquires any
          perfection of knowledge from his creatures, any more than he doth of
          being? he would not then have that knowledge, and consequently that
          perfection from eternity, as he had when he created the world, and
          will not have a full perfection of the knowledge of his creature till
          the end of the world, nor of immortal souls, which will certainly act
          as well as live to eternity; and so God never was, nor ever will be,
          perfect in knowledge; for when you have conceived millions of years,
          wherein angels and souls live and act, there is still more coming than
          you can conceive, wherein they will act. And if God be always changing
          to eternity, from ignorance to knowledge, as those acts come to be
          exerted by his creatures, he will not be perfect in knowledge, no, not
          to eternity, but will always be changing from one degree of knowledge
          to another; a very unworthy conceit to entertain of the most blessed,
          perfect, and infinite God! Hence, then, it follows, that
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God foreknows all his creatures. All kinds which he determined to
          make; all particulars that should spring out of every species; the
          time when they should come forth of the womb; the manner how; “In thy
          Book all my members were written” (Ps. cxxxix. 16). Members is not in
          the Heb. whence some refer all, to all living creatures whatsoever,
          and all the parts of them which God did foresee; he knew the number of
          creatures with all their parts; they were written in the book of his
          foreknowledge; the duration of them, how long they shall remain in
          being, and act upon the stage; he knows their strength, the links of
          one cause with another, and what will follow in all their
          circumstances, and the series and combinations of effects with their
          causes. The duration of everything is foreknown, because determined
          (Job. xiv. 5); “seeing his days are determined, the number of his
          months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds, that he cannot
          pass;” bounds are fixed, beyond which none shall reach; he speaks of
          days and months, not of years, to give us notice of God’s particular
          foreknowledge of everything, of every day, month, year, hour of a
          man’s life.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) All the acts of his creatures are foreknown by him. All natural
          acts, because he knows their causes; voluntary acts I shall speak of
          afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This foreknowledge was certain. For it is an unworthy notion of
          God to ascribe to him a conjectural knowledge; if there were only a
          conjectural knowledge, he could but conjecturally foretel anything;
          and then it is possible the events of things might be contrary to his
          predictions. It would appear then that God were deceived and mistaken,
          and then there could be no rule of trying things, whether there were
          from God or no; for the rule God sets down to discern his words from
          the words of false prophets, is the event and certain accomplishment
          of what is predicted (Deut. xviii. 21) to that question, “How shall we
          know whether God hath spoken or no?” he answers, that “if the thing
          doth not come to pass, the Lord hath not spoken.” If his knowledge of
          future things were not certain, there were no stability in this rule,
          it would fall to the ground: we never yet find God deceived in any
          prediction, but the event did answer his forerevelation; his
          foreknowledge, therefore, is certain and infallible. We cannot make
          God uncertain in his knowledge, but we must conceive him fluctuating
          and wavering in his will; but if his will be not yea and nay, but yea,
          his knowledge is certain, because he doth certainly will and resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) This foreknowledge was from eternity. Seeing he knows things
          possible in his power, and things future in his will; if his power and
          resolves were from eternity, his knowledge must be so too, or else we
          must make him ignorant of his own power, and ignorant of his own will
          from eternity; and consequently not from eternity blessed and perfect.
          His knowledge of possible things must run parallel with his power, and
          his knowledge of future things run parallel with his will. If he
          willed from eternity, he knew from eternity what he willed; but that
          he did will from eternity, we must grant, unless we would render him
          changeable, and conceive him to be made in time of not willing,
          willing. The knowledge God hath in time, was always one and the same,
          because his understanding is his proper essence, and of an immutable
          nature.705 And indeed the actual existence of a thing is not simply
          necessary to its being perfectly known; we may see a thing that is
          past out of being, when it doth actually exist; and a carpenter may
          know the house he is to build, before it be built, by the model of it
          in his own mind; much more we may conceive the same of God whose
          decrees were before the foundation of the world;706 and to be before
          time was, and to be from eternity, hath no difference. As God in his
          being exceeds all beginning of time, so doth his knowledge all motions
          of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) God foreknows all things as present with him from eternity. As he
          knows mutable things with an immutable and firm knowledge, so he knows
          future things with a present knowledge;707 not that the things which
          are produced in time, were actually and really present with him in
          their own beings from eternity; for then they could not be produced in
          time; had they a real existence, then they would not be creatures, but
          God; and had they actual being, then they could not be future, for
          future speaks a thing to come that is not yet. If things had been
          actually present with him, and yet future, they had been made before
          they were made, and had a being before they had a being; but they were
          all present to his knowledge as if they were in actual being, because
          the reason of all things that were to be made, was present with him.
          The reason of the will of God that they shall be, was equally eternal
          with him, wherein he saw what, and when, and how he would create
          things, how he would govern them, to what ends he would direct
          them.708 Thus all things are present to God’s knowledge, though in
          their own nature they may be past or future, not in esse reali, but in
          esse intelligibili, objectively, not actually present;709 for as the
          unchangeableness and infiniteness of God’s knowledge of changeable and
          finite things, doth not make the things he knows immutable and
          infinite, so neither doth the eternity of his knowledge make them
          actually present with him from eternity; but all things are present to
          his understanding, because he hath at once a view of all successions
          of times; and his knowledge of future things is as perfect as of
          present things, or what is past; it is not a certain knowledge of
          present things, and an uncertain knowledge of future, but his
          knowledge of one is as certain and unerring as his knowledge of the
          other;710 as a man that beholds a circle with several lines from the
          centre, beholds the lines as they are joined in the centre, beholds
          them also as they are distant and severed from one another, beholds
          them in their extent and in their point all at once, though they may
          have a great distance from one another. He saw from the beginning of
          time to the last minute of it, all things coming out of their causes,
          marching in their order according to his own appointment; as a man may
          see a multitude of ants, some creeping one way, some another, employed
          in several businesses for their winter provision. The eye of God at
          once runs through the whole circle of time; as the eye of man upon a
          tower sees all the passengers at once, though some be past, some under
          the tower, some coming at a farther distance. “God,” saith Job, “looks
          to the end of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven” (Job xxviii.
          24); the knowledge of God is expressed by sight in Scripture, and
          futurity to God is the same thing as distance to us; we can with a
          perspective‑glass make things that are afar off appear as if they were
          near; and the sun, so many thousand miles distant from us, to appear
          as if it were at the end of the glass: why, then, should future things
          be at so great a distance from God’s knowledge, when things so far
          from us may be made to approach so near to us? God considers all
          things in his own simple knowledge, as if they were now acted; and
          therefore some have chosen to call the knowledge of things to come,
          not prescience, or foreknowledge, but knowledge; because God sees all
          things in one instant, scientiâ nunquam deficientis instantiæ.711 Upon
          this account, things that are to come, are set down in Scripture as
          present, and sometimes as past (Isa. ix. 6): “Unto us a child is
          born,” though not yet born; so of the sufferings of Christ (Isa. liii.
          4, &amp;c.): “He hath borne our griefs, he was wounded for our
          transgressions, he was taken from prison,” &amp;c., not shall be; and
          (Ps. xxii. 18): “they part my garments among them,” as if it were
          present; all to express the certainty of God’s foreknowledge, as if
          things were actually present before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) This is proper to God, and incommunicable to any creature.
          Nothing but what is eternal can know all things that are to come.
          Suppose a creature might know things that are to come, after he is in
          being, he cannot know things simply as future, because there were
          things future before he was in being. The devils know not men’s
          hearts, therefore cannot foretel their actions with any certainty;
          they may indeed have a knowledge of some things to come, but it is
          only conjectural, and often mistaken; as the devil was in his
          predictions among the heathen, and in his presage of “Job’s cursing
          God to his face” upon his pressing calamities (Job i. 11). Sometimes,
          indeed, they have a certain knowledge of something future by the
          revelation of God, when he uses them as instruments of his vengeance,
          or for the trial of his people, as in the case of Job, when he gave
          him a commission to strip him of his goods; or, as the angels have,
          when he uses them as instruments of the deliverance of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7.) Though this be certain, that God foreknows all things and
          actions, yet the manner of his knowing all things before they come, is
          not so easily resolved. We must not, therefore, deny this perfection
          in God, because we understand not the manner how he hath the knowledge
          of all things. It were unworthy for us to own no more of God than we
          can perfectly conceive of him; we should then own no more of him than
          that he doth exist. “Canst thou,” saith Job, “by searching, find out
          God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?” (Job xi. 7).
          Do we not see things unknown to inferior creatures, to be known to
          ourselves? Irrational creatures do not apprehend the nature of a man,
          nor what we conceived of them when we look upon them; nor do we know
          what they fancy of us when they look wistly upon us; for ought as I
          know, we understand as little the manner of their imaginations, as
          they do of ours; and shall we ascribe a darkness in God as to future
          things, because we are ignorant of them, and of the manner how he
          should know them?712 shall we doubt whether God doth certainly know
          those things which we only conjecture? As our power is not the measure
          of the power of God, so neither is our knowledge the judge of the
          knowledge of God, no better nor so well as an irrational nature can be
          the judge of our reason. Do we perfectly know the manner how we know?
          shall we therefore deny that we know anything? We know we have such a
          faculty which we call understanding, but doth any man certainly know
          what it is? and because he doth not, shall he deny that which is plain
          and evident to him? Because we cannot ascertain ourselves of the
          causes of the ebbing and flowing of the sea, of the manner how
          minerals are engendered in the earth, shall we therefore deny that
          which our eyes convince us of? And this will be a preparation to the
          last thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly, God knows all future contingencies, that is, God knows all
          things that shall accidentally happen, or, as we say, by chance; and
          he knows all the free motions of men’s wills that shall be to the end
          of the world. If all things be open to him (Heb. iv. 13), then all
          contingencies are, for they are in the number of things; and as,
          according to Christ’s speech, those things that are impossible to man,
          are possible to God, so those things which are unknown to man, are
          known to God; because of the infinite fulness and perfection of the
          divine understanding. Let us see what a contingent is. That is
          contingent which we commonly call accidental, as when a tile falls
          suddenly upon a man’s head as he is walking in the street; or when one
          letting off a musket at random shoots another he did not intend to
          hit; such was that arrow whereby Ahab was killed, shot by a soldier at
          a venture (1 Kings xxii. 39); this some call a mixed contingent, made
          up partly of necessity, and partly of accident; it is necessary the
          bullet, when sent out of the gun, or arrow out of the bow, should fly
          and light somewhere; but it is an accident that it hits this or that
          man, that was never intended by the archer. Other things, as voluntary
          actions, are purely contingents, and have nothing of necessity in
          them; all free actions that depend upon the will of man, whether to
          do, or not to do, are of this nature, because they depend not upon a
          necessary cause, as burning doth upon the fire, moistening upon water,
          or as descent or falling down is necessary to a heavy body; for those
          cannot in their own nature do otherwise; but the other actions depend
          upon a free agent, able to turn to this or that point, and determine
          himself as he pleases. Now we must know, that what is accidental in
          regard of the creature, is not so in regard of God; the manner of
          Ahab’s death was accidental, in regard of the hand by which he was
          slain, but not in regard of God who foretold his death, and foreknew
          the shot, and directed the arrow; God was not uncertain before of the
          manner of his fall, nor hovered over the battle to watch for an
          opportunity to accomplish his own prediction; what may be or not be,
          in regard of us, is certain in regard of God; to imagine that what is
          accidental to us, is so to God, is to measure God by our short line.
          How many events following upon the results of princes in their
          counsels, seem to persons, ignorant of those counsels, to be a
          haphazard, yet were not contingencies to the prince and his
          assistants, but foreseen by him as certainly to issue so as they do,
          which they knew before would be the fruit of such causes and
          instruments they would knit together! That may be necessary in regard
          of God’s foreknowledge, which is merely accidental in regard of the
          natural disposition of the immediate causes which do actually produce
          it; contingent in its own nature, and in regard of us, but fixed in
          the knowledge of God. One illustrates it by this similitude;713 a
          master sends two servants to one and the same place, two several ways,
          unknown to one another; they meet at the place which their master had
          appointed them; their meeting is accidental to them, one knows not of
          the other, but it was foreseen by the master that they should so meet;
          and that in regard of them it would seem a mere accident, till they
          came to explain the business to one another; both the necessity of
          their meeting, in regard of their master’s order, and the
          accidentalness of it in regard of themselves, were in both their
          circumstances foreknown by the master that employed them. For the
          clearing of this, take it in this method.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is an unworthy conceit of God in any to exclude him from the
          knowledge of these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It will be a strange contracting of him to allow him no greater a
          knowledge than we have ourselves. Contingencies are known to us when
          they come into act, and pass from futurity to reality; and when they
          are present to us, we can order our affairs accordingly; shall we
          allow God no greater a measure of knowledge than we have, and make him
          as blind as ourselves, not to see things of that nature before they
          come to pass? Shall God know them no more? Shall we imagine God knows
          no otherwise than we know? and that he doth, like us, stand gazing
          with admiration at events? man can conjecture many things; is it fit
          to ascribe the same uncertainty to God, as though he, as well as we,
          could have no assurance till the issue appear in the view of all? If
          God doth not certainly foreknow them, he doth but conjecture them; but
          a conjectural knowledge is by no means to be fastened on God; for that
          is not knowledge, but guess, and destroys a Deity by making him
          subject to mistake; for he that only guesseth, may guess wrong; so
          that this is to make God like ourselves, and strip him of an
          universally acknowledged perfection of omniscience. A conjectural
          knowledge, saith one,714 is as unworthy of God as the creature is
          unworthy of omniscience. It is certain man hath a liberty to act many
          things this or that way as he pleases; to walk to this or that
          quarter, to speak or not to speak; to do this or that thing, or not to
          do it; which way a man will certainly determine himself, is unknown
          before to any creature, yea, often at the present to himself, for he
          may be in suspense; but shall we imagine this future determination of
          himself is concealed from God? Those that deny God’s foreknowledge in
          such cases, must either say, that God hath an opinion that a man will
          resolve rather this way than that; but then if a man by his liberty
          determine himself contrary to the opinion of God, is not God then
          deceived? and what rational creature can own him for a God that can be
          deceived in anything? or else they must say that God is at
          uncertainty, and suspends his opinion without determining it any way;
          then he cannot know free acts till they are done; he would then depend
          upon the creature for his information; his knowledge would be every
          instant increased, as things, he knew not before, came into act; and
          since there are every minute an innumerable multitude of various
          imaginations in the minds of men, there would be every minute an
          accession of new knowledge to God which he had not before; besides,
          this knowledge would be mutable according to the wavering and
          weathercock resolutions of men, one while standing to this point,
          another while to that, if he depended upon the creature’s
          determination for his knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If the free acts of men were unknown before to God, no man can
          see how there can be any government of the world by him. Such
          contingencies may happen, and such resolves of men’s free‑wills
          unknown to God, as may perplex his affairs, and put him upon new
          counsels and methods for attaining those ends which he settled at the
          first creation of things; if things happen which God knows not of
          before, this must be the consequence; where there is no foresight,
          there is no providence; things may happen so sudden, if God be
          ignorant of them, that they may give a check to his intentions and
          scheme of government, and put him upon changing the whole model of it.
          How often doth a small intervening circumstance, unforeseen by man,
          dash in pieces a long meditated and well‑formed design! To govern
          necessary causes, as sun and stars, whose effects are natural and
          constant in themselves, is easy to be imagined; but how to govern the
          world that consists of so many men of free‑will, able to determine
          themselves to this or that, and which have no constancy in themselves,
          as the sun and stars have, cannot be imagined; unless we will allow in
          God as great a certainty of foreknowledge of the designs and actions
          of men, as there is inconstancy in their resolves. God must be
          altering the methods of his government every day, every hour, every
          minute, according to the determinations of men, which are so various
          and changeable in the whole compass of the world in the space of one
          minute; he must wait to see what the counsels of men will be, before
          he could settle his own methods of government; and so must govern the
          world according to their mutability, and not according to any
          certainty in himself. But his counsel is stable in the midst of
          multitudes of free devices in the heart of man (Prov. xix. 21), and
          knowing them all before, orders them to be subservient to his own
          stable counsel. If he cannot know what to‑morrow will bring forth in
          the mind of a man, how can he certainly settle his own determination
          of governing him? His decrees and resolves must be temporal, and arise
          pro re nata, and he must alway be in counsel what he should do upon
          every change of men’s minds. This is an unworthy conceit of the
          infinite majesty of heaven, to make his government depend upon the
          resolves of men, rather than their resolves upon the design of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is therefore certain, that God doth foreknow the free and
          voluntary acts of man. How could he else order his people to ask of
          him things to come, in order to their deliverance, such things as
          depended upon the will of man, if he foreknew not the motions of their
          will (Isa. xlv. 11)?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Actions good or indifferent depending upon the liberty of man’s
          will as much as any whatsoever. Several of these he hath foretold; not
          only a person to build up Jerusalem was predicted by him, but the name
          of that person, Cyrus (Isa. xliv. 28). What is more contingent, or is
          more the effect of the liberty of man’s will, than the names of their
          children? Was not the destruction of the Babylonish empire foretold,
          which Cyrus undertook, not by any compulsion, but by a free
          inclination and resolve of his own will? And was not the dismission of
          the Jews into their own country a voluntary act in that conqueror? If
          you consider the liberty of man’s will, might not Cyrus as well have
          continued their yoke, as have struck off their chains, and kept them
          captive, as well as dismissed them? Had it not been for his own
          interest, rather to have strengthened the fetters of so turbulent a
          people, who being tenacious of their religion and laws different from
          that professed by the whole world, were like to make disturbances more
          when they were linked in a body in their own country, than when they
          were transplanted and scattered into the several parts of his empire?
          It was in the power of Cyrus (take him as a man) to choose one or the
          other; his interest invited him to continue their captivity, rather
          than grant their deliverance; yet God knew that he would willingly do
          this rather than the other; he knew this which depended upon the will
          of Cyrus; and why may not an infinite God foreknow the free acts of
          all men, as well as of one? If the liberty of Cyrus’ will was no
          hindrance to God’s certain and infallible foreknowledge of it, how can
          the contingency of any other thing be a hindrance to him? for there is
          the same reason of one and all; and his government extends to every
          village, every family, every person, as well as to kingdoms and
          nations. So God foretold, by his prophet, not only the destruction of
          Jeroboam’s altar, but the name of the person that should be the
          instrument of it (1 Kings xiii. 2), and this about 300 years before
          Josiah’s birth. It is a wonder that none of the pious kings of Judah,
          in detestation of idolatry, and hopes to recover again the kingdom of
          Israel, had in all that space named one of their sons by that name of
          Josiah, in hopes that that prophecy should be accomplished by him;
          that Manasseh only should do this, who was the greatest imitator of
          Jeroboam’s idolatry among all the Jewish kings, and indeed went beyond
          them; and had no mind to destroy in another kingdom what he propagated
          in his own. What is freer than the imposition of a name? yet this he
          foreknew, and this Josiah was Manasseh’s son (2 Kings xxi. 26). Was
          there anything more voluntary than for Pharaoh to honor the butler by
          restoring him to his place, and punish the baker by hanging him on a
          gibbet? yet this was foretold (Gen. xl. 8). And were not all the
          voluntary acts of men, which were the means of Joseph’s advancement,
          foreknown by God, as well as his exaltation, which was the end he
          aimed at by those means? Many of these may be reckoned up. Can all the
          free acts of man surmount the infinite capacity of the Divine
          understanding? If God singles out one voluntary action in man as
          contingent as any, and lying among a vast number of other designs and
          resolutions, both antecedent and subsequent, why should he not know
          the whole mass of men’s thoughts and actions, and pierce into all that
          the liberty of man’s will can effect? why should he not know every
          grain, as well as one that lies in the midst of many of the same kind?
          And since the Scripture gives so large an account of contingents,
          predicted by God, no man can certainly prove that anything is
          unforeknown to him. It is as reasonable to think he knows every
          contingent, as that he knows some that lie as much hid from the eye of
          any creature, since there is no more difficulty to an infinite
          understanding to know all, than to know some.715 Indeed, if we deny
          God’s foreknowledge of the voluntary actions of men, we must strike
          ourselves off from the belief of scripture predictions that yet remain
          unaccomplished, and will be brought about by the voluntary engagements
          of men, as the ruin of antichrist, &amp;c. If God foreknows not the
          secret motions of man’s will, how can he foretel them? if we strip him
          of this perfection of prescience, why should we believe a word of
          scripture predictions? all the credit of the word of God is torn up by
          the roots. If God were uncertain of such events, how can we reconcile
          God’s declaration of them to his truth; and his demanding our belief
          of them to his goodness? Were it good and righteous in God to urge us
          to the belief of that he were uncertain of himself, how could he be
          true in predicting things he were not sure of? or good, in requiring
          credit to be given to that which might be false? This would
          necessarily follow, if God did not foreknow the motions of men’s
          wills, whereby many of his predictions were fulfilled, and some remain
          yet to be accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) God foreknows the voluntary sinful motions of men’s wills. First,
          God had foretold several of them. Were not all the minute sinful
          circumstances about the death of our blessed Redeemer, as the piercing
          him, giving him gall to drink, foretold, as well as the not breaking
          his bones, and parting his garments? What were those but the free
          actions of men, which they did willingly without any constraint? and
          those foretold by David, Isaiah, and other prophets; some above a
          thousand, some eight hundred, and some more, some fewer years before
          they came to pass; and the events punctually answered the prophesies.
          Many sinful acts of men, which depended upon their free will, have
          been foretold. The Egyptians’ voluntary oppressing Israel (Gen. xv.
          13); Pharaoh’s hardening his heart against the voice of Moses (Exod.
          iii. 19); that Isaiah’s message would be in vain to the people (Isa.
          vi. 9); that the Israelites would be rebellious after Moses’ death,
          and turn idolaters (Deut. xxxi. 16); Judas’ betraying of our Saviour,
          a voluntary action (John vi. ult.); he was not forced to do what he
          did, for he had some kind of repentance for it; and not violence, but
          voluntariness falls under repentance. Second, His truth had depended
          upon this foresight. Let us consider that in Gen. xv. 16, “But in the
          fourth generation they shall come hither again;” that is, the
          posterity of Abraham shall come into Canaan, for the iniquity of the
          Amorites is not yet full.716 God makes a promise to Abraham, of giving
          his posterity the land of Canaan, not presently, but in the fourth
          generation; if the truth of God be infallible in the performance of
          his promise, his understanding is as infallible in the foresight of
          the Amorites’ sin; the fullness of their iniquity was to precede the
          Israelites’ possession. Did the truth of God depend upon an
          uncertainty? did he make the promise hand over head (as we say)? How
          could he, with any wisdom and truth, assure Israel of the possession
          of the land in the fourth generation, if he had not been sure that the
          Amorites would fill up the measure of their iniquities by that time?
          If Abraham had been a Socinian, to deny God’s knowledge of the free
          acts of men, had he not a fine excuse for unbelief? What would his
          reply have been to God? Alas, Lord, this is not a promise to be relied
          upon, the Amorites’ iniquity depends upon the acts of their free will,
          and such thou canst have no knowledge of; thou canst see no more than
          a likelihood of their iniquity being full, and therefore there is but
          a likelihood of thy performing thy promise, and not a certainty! Would
          not this be judged not only a saucy, but a blasphemous answer? And
          upon these principles the truth of the most faithful God had been
          dashed to uncertainty and a peradventure. Third, God provided a remedy
          for man’s sin, and therefore foresaw the entrance of it into the world
          by the fall of Adam. He had a decree before the foundation of the
          world, to manifest his wisdom in the gospel by Jesus Christ, an
          “eternal purpose in Jesus Christ” (Eph. iii. 11), and a decree of
          election past before the foundation of the world;—a separation of some
          to redemption, and forgiveness of sin in the blood of Christ, in whom
          they were from eternity chosen, as well as in time accepted in Christ
          (Eph. i. 4, 6, 7), which is called a “purpose in himself” (ver. 9);
          had not sin entered, there had been no occasion for the death of the
          Son of God, it being everywhere in Scripture laid upon that score;—a
          decree for the shedding of blood, supposed a decree for the permission
          of sin, and a certain foreknowledge of God, that it would be committed
          by man. An uncertainty of foreknowledge, and a fixedness of purpose,
          are not consistent in a wise man, much less in the only wise God.
          God’s purpose to manifest his wisdom to men and angels in this way
          might have been defeated, had God had only a conjectural foreknowledge
          of the fall of man; and all those solemn purposes of displaying his
          perfections in those methods had been to no purpose;717 the provision
          of a remedy supposed a certainty of the disease. If a sparrow fall not
          to the ground without the will of God, how much less could such a
          deplorable ruin fall upon mankind, without God’s will permitting it,
          and his knowledge foreseeing it? It is not hard to conceive how God
          might foreknow it?718 he indeed decreed to create man in an excellent
          state; the goodness of God could not but furnish him with a power to
          stand; yet in his wisdom he might foresee that the devil would be
          envious to man’s happiness, and would, out of envy, attempt his
          subversion. As God knew of what temper the faculties were he had
          endued man with, and how far they were able to endure the assaults of
          a temptation, so he also foreknew the grand subtelties of Satan, how
          he would lay his mine, and to what point he would drive his
          temptation; how he would propose and manage it, and direct his battery
          against the sensitive appetite, and assault the weakest part of the
          fort; might he not foresee that the efficacy of the temptation would
          exceed the measure of the resistance; cannot God know how far the
          malice of Satan would extend, what shots he would, according to his
          nature, use, how high he would charge his temptation without his
          powerful restraint, as well as an engineer judge how many shots of a
          cannon will make a breach in a town, and how many casks of powder will
          blow up a fortress, who never yet built the one, nor founded the
          other? We may easily conclude God could not be deceived in the
          judgment of the issue and event, since he knew how far he would let
          Satan loose, how far he would permit man to act; and since he dives to
          the bottom of the nature of all things, he foresaw that Adam was
          endued with an ability to stand; as he foresaw that Benhadad might
          naturally recover of his disease; but he foresaw also that Adam would
          sink under the allurements of the temptation, as he foresaw that
          Hazael would let Benhadad live (2 Kings viii. 10). Now since the whole
          race of mankind lies in corruption, and is subject to the power of the
          devil (1 John iii. 18), may not God, that knows that corruption in
          every man’s nature, and the force of every man’s spirit, and what
          every particular nature will incline him to upon such objects proposed
          to him, and what the reasons of the temptation will be, know also the
          issues? is there any difficulty in God’s foreknowing this, since man
          knowing the nature of one he is well acquainted with, can conclude
          what sentiments he will have, and how he will behave himself upon
          presenting this or that object to him? If a man that understands the
          disposition of his child or servant, knows before what he will do upon
          such an occasion, may not God much more, who knows the inclination of
          all his creatures, and from eternity run with his eyes over all the
          works he intended? Our wills are in the number of causes; and since
          God knows our wills, as causes, better than we do ourselves, why
          should he be ignorant of the effects? God determines to give grace to
          such a man, not to give it to another, but leave him to himself, and
          suffer such temptations to assault him; now God knowing the corruption
          of man in the whole mass, and in every part of it, is it not easy for
          him to foreknow what the future actions of the will will be, when the
          tinder and fire meet together, and how such a man will determine
          himself, both us to the substance and manner of the action? Is it not
          easy for him to know how a corrupted temper and a temptation will
          suit? God is exactly privy to all the gall in the hearts of men, and
          what principles they will have, before they have a being. He “knows
          their thoughts afar off” (Ps. cxxxix. 2), as far off as eternity, as
          some explain the words, and thoughts are as voluntary as anything; he
          knows the power and inclinations of men in the order of second causes;
          he understands the corruption of men, as well as “the poison of
          dragons, and the venom of asps;” this is “laid up in store with him,
          and sealed among his treasures” (Deut. xxxii. 33, 34): among the
          treasures of his foreknowledge, say some. What was the cruelty of
          Hazael, but a free act? yet God knew the frame of his heart, and what
          acts of murder and oppression would spring from that bitter fountain,
          before Hazael had conceived them in himself (2 Kings viii. 12), as a
          man that knows the minerals through which the waters pass, may know
          what relish they will have before they appear above the earth, so our
          Saviour knew how Peter would deny him; he knew what quantity of powder
          would serve for such a battery, in what measure he would let loose
          Satan, how far he would leave the reins in Peter’s hands, and then the
          issue might easily be known; and so in every act of man, God knows in
          his own will what measure of grace he will give, to determine the will
          to good, and what measure of grace he will withdraw from such a
          person, or not give to him; and, consequently, how far such a person
          will fall or not. God knows the inclinations of the creature; he knows
          his own permissions, what degrees of grace he will either allow him,
          or keep from him, according to which will be the degree of his sin.
          This may in some measure help our conceptions in this, though, as was
          said before, the manner of God’s foreknowledge is not so easily
          explicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God’s foreknowledge of man’s voluntary actions doth not
          necessitate the will of man. The foreknowledge of God is not deceived,
          nor the liberty of man’s will diminished. I shall not trouble you with
          any school distinctions, but be as plain as I can, laying down several
          propositions in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. It is certain all necessity doth not take away liberty,
          indeed a compulsive necessity takes away liberty, but a necessity of
          immutability removes not liberty from God; why should, then, a
          necessity of infallibility in God remove liberty from the creature?
          God did necessarily create the world, because he decreed it; yet
          freely, because his will from eternity stood to it, he freely decreed
          it and freely created it, as the apostle saith in regard of God’s
          decrees, “Who hath been his counsellor” (Rom. xi. 34)? so in regard of
          his actions I may say, Who hath been his compeller? he freely decreed,
          and he freely created. Jesus Christ necessarily took our flesh,
          because he had covenanted with God so to do, yet he acted freely and
          voluntarily according to that covenant, otherwise his death had not
          been efficacious for us. A good man doth naturally, necessarily, love
          his children, yet voluntarily: it is part of the happiness of the
          blessed to love God unchangeably, yet freely, for it would not be
          their happiness if it were done by compulsion. What is done by force
          cannot be called felicity, because there is no delight or complacency
          in it; and, though the blessed love God freely, yet, if there were a
          possibility of change, it would not be their happiness, their
          blessedness would be damped by their fear of falling from this love,
          and consequently from their nearness to God, in whom their happiness
          consists: God foreknows that they will love him forever, but are they
          therefore compelled forever to love him? If there were such a kind of
          constraint, heaven would be rendered burdensome to them, and so no
          heaven. Again, God’s foreknowledge of what he will do, doth not
          necessitate him to do: he foreknew that he would create a world, yet
          he freely created a world. God’s foreknowledge doth not necessitate
          himself; why should it necessitate us more than himself? We may
          instance in ourselves: when we will a thing, we necessarily use our
          faculty of will; and when we freely will any thing, it is necessary
          that we freely will; but this necessity doth not exclude, but include,
          liberty; or, more plainly, when a man writes or speaks, whilst he
          writes or speaks, those actions are necessary, because to speak and be
          silent, to write and not to write, at the same time, are impossible;
          yet our writing or speaking doth not take away the power not to write
          or to be silent at that time if a man would be so; for he might have
          chose whether he would have spoke or writ. So there is a necessity of
          such actions of man, which God foresees; that is, a necessity of
          infallibility, because God cannot be deceived, but not a coactive
          necessity, as if they were compelled by God to act thus or thus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. No man can say in any of his voluntary actions that he ever
          found any force upon him. When any of us have done anything according
          to our wills, can we say we could not have done the contrary to it?
          were we determined to it in our own intrinsic nature, or did we not
          determine ourselves? did we not act either according to our reason, or
          according to outward allurements? did we find anything without us, or
          within us, that did force our wills to the embracing this or that?
          Whatever action you do, you do it because you judge it fit to be done,
          or because you will do it. What, though God foresaw that you would do
          so, and that you would do this or that, did you feel any force upon
          you? did you not act according to your nature? God foresees that you
          will eat or walk at such a time; do you find anything that moves you
          to eat, but your own appetite? or to walk, but your own reason and
          will? If prescience had imposed any necessity upon man, should we not
          probably have found some kind of plea from it in the mouth of Adam? he
          knew as much as any man ever since knew of the nature of God, as
          discoverable in creation; he could not in innocence fancy an ignorant
          God, a God that knew nothing of future things; he could not be so
          ignorant of his own action, but he must have perceived a force upon
          his will, had there been any; had he thought that God’s prescience
          imposed any necessity upon him, he would not have omitted the plea,
          especially when he was so daring as to charge the providence of God in
          the gift of the woman to him, to be the cause of his crime (Gen. iii.
          12.) How come his posterity to invent new charges against God, which
          their father Adam never thought of, who had more knowledge than all of
          them? He could find no cause of his sin but the liberty of his own
          will; he charges it, not upon any necessity from the devil, or any
          necessity from God; nor doth he allege the gift of the woman as a
          necessary cause of his sin, but an occasion of it, by giving the fruit
          to him. Judas knew that our Saviour did foreknow his treachery, for he
          had told him of it in the hearing of his disciples (John xiii. 21‒26),
          yet he never charged the necessity of his crime upon the foreknowledge
          of his Master; if Judas had not done it freely, he had had no reason
          to repent of it; his repentance justifies Christ from imposing any
          necessity upon him by that foreknowledge. No man acts anything, but he
          can give an account of the motives of his action; he cannot father it
          upon a blind necessity; the will cannot be compelled, for then it
          would cease to be the will: God doth not root up the foundations of
          nature, or change the order of it, and make men unable to act like
          men, that is, as free agents. God foreknows the actions of irrational
          creatures; this concludes no violence upon their nature, for we find
          their actions to be according to their nature, and spontaneous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. III. God’s foreknowledge is not, simply considered, the cause of
          anything. It puts nothing into things, but only beholds them as
          present, and arising from their proper causes. The knowledge of God is
          not the principle of things, or the cause of their existence, but
          directive of the action; nothing is because God knows it, but because
          God wills it, either positively or permissively; God knows all things
          possible; yet, because God knows them they are not brought into actual
          existence, but remain still only as things possible; knowledge only
          apprehends a thing, but acts nothing; it is the rule of acting, but
          not the cause of acting; the will is the immediate principle, and the
          power the immediate cause; to know a thing is not to do a thing, for
          then we may be said to do everything that we know: but every man knows
          those things which he never did, nor never will do; knowledge in
          itself is an apprehension of a thing, and is not the cause of it. A
          spectator of a thing is not the cause of that thing which he sees,
          that is, he is not the cause of it, as he beholds it. We see a man
          write, we know before that he will write at such a time; but this
          foreknowledge is not the cause of his writing. We see a man walk, but
          our vision of him brings no necessity of walking upon him; he was free
          to walk or not to walk.719 We foreknow that death will seize upon all
          men, we foreknow that the seasons of the year will succeed one
          another, yet is not our foreknowledge the cause of this succession of
          spring after winter, or of the death of all men, or any man? We see
          one man fighting with another; our sight is not the cause of that
          contest, but some quarrel among themselves, exciting their own
          passions. As the knowledge of present things imposeth no necessity
          upon them while they are acting, and present, so the knowledge of
          future things imposeth no necessity upon them while they are coming.
          We are certain there will be men in the world to‑morrow, and that the
          sea will ebb and flow; but is this knowledge of ours the cause that
          those things will be so? I know that the sun will rise to‑morrow, it
          is true that it shall rise; but it is not true that my foreknowledge
          makes it to rise. If a physician prognosticates, upon seeing the
          intemperances and debaucheries of men, that they will fall into such a
          distemper, is his prognostication any cause of their disease, or of
          the sharpness of any symptoms attending it? The prophet foretold the
          cruelty of Hazael before he committed it; but who will say that the
          prophet was the cause of his commission of that evil? And thus the
          foreknowledge of God takes not away the liberty of man’s will, no more
          than a foreknowledge that we have of any man’s actions takes away his
          liberty. We may upon our knowledge of the temper of a man, certainly
          foreknow, that if he falls into such company, and get among his cups,
          he will be drunk; but is this foreknowledge the cause that he is
          drunk? No; the cause is the liberty of his own will, and not resisting
          the temptation. God purposes to leave such a man to himself and his
          own ways; and man being so left, God foreknows what will be done by
          him according to that corrupt nature which is in him; though the
          decree of God of leaving a man to the liberty of his own will be
          certain, yet the liberty of man’s will as thus left, is the cause of
          all the extravagances he doth commit. Suppose Adam had stood, would
          not God certainly have foreseen that he would have stood? yet it would
          have been concluded that Adam had stood, not by any necessity of God’s
          foreknowledge, but by the liberty of his own will. Why should then the
          foreknowledge of God add more necessity to his falling than to his
          standing? And though it be said sometimes in Scripture, that such a
          thing was done “that the Scripture might be fulfilled,” as John xii.
          38, “that the saying of Esais might be fulfilled, Lord, who hath
          believed our report?” the word that doth not infer that the prediction
          of the prophet was the cause of the Jews’ belief, but infers this,
          that the prediction was manifested to be true by their unbelief, and
          the event answered the prediction; this prediction was not the cause
          of their sin, but their foreseen sin was the cause of this prediction;
          and so the particle that is taken (Ps. li. 6), “Against thee, thee
          only have I sinned, that thou mightest be justified,” &amp;c.; the
          justifying God was not the end and intent of the sin, but the event of
          it upon his acknowledgment.720
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. IV. God foreknows things, because they will come to pass; but
          things are not future, because God knows them. Foreknowledge
          presupposeth the object which is foreknown; a thing that is to come to
          pass is the object of the Divine knowledge, but not the cause of the
          act of divine knowledge; and though the foreknowledge of God doth in
          eternity precede the actual presence of a thing which is foreseen as
          future, yet the future thing, in regard of its futurity, is as eternal
          as the foreknowledge of God: as the voice is uttered before it be
          heard, and a thing is visible before it be seen, and a thing knowable
          before it be known. But how comes it to be knowable to God? it must be
          answered, either in the power of God as a thing possible, or in the
          will of God as a thing future; he first willed, and then knew what he
          willed; he knew what he willed to effect, and he knew what he willed
          to permit; as he willed the death of Christ by a determinate counsel,
          and willed the permission of the Jew’s sin, and the ordering of the
          malice of their nature to that end (Acts ii. 22). God decrees to make
          a rational creature, and to govern him by a law; God decrees not to
          hinder this rational creature from transgressing his law; and God
          foresees that what he would not hinder, would come to pass. Man did
          not sin because God foresaw him; but God foresaw him to sin, because
          man would sin. If Adam and other men would have acted otherwise, God
          would have foreknown that they would have acted well; God foresaw our
          actions because they would so come to pass by the motion of our
          freewill, which he would permit, which he would concur with, which he
          would order to his own holy and glorious ends, for the manifestation
          of the perfection of his nature. If I see a man lie in a sink, no
          necessity is inferred upon him from my sight to lie in that filthy
          place, but there is a necessity inferred by him that lies there, that
          I should see him in that condition if I pass by, and cast my eye that
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. V. God did not only foreknow our actions, but the manner of our
          actions. That is, he did not only know that we would do such actions,
          but that we would do them freely; he foresaw that the will would
          freely determine itself to this or that; the knowledge of God takes
          not away the nature of things; though God knows possible things, yet
          they remain in the nature of possibility; and though God knows
          contingent things, yet they remain in the nature of contingencies; and
          though God knows free agents, yet they remain in the nature of
          liberty. God did not foreknow the actions of man, as necessary, but as
          free; so that liberty is rather established by this foreknowledge,
          than removed. God did not foreknow that Adam had not a power to stand,
          or that any man hath not a power to omit such a sinful action, but
          that he would not omit it. Man hath a power to do otherwise than that
          which God foreknows he will do. Adam was not determined by any inward
          necessity to fall, nor any man by any inward necessity to commit this
          or that particular sin; but God foresaw that he would fall, and fall
          freely; for he saw the whole circle of means and causes whereby such
          and such actions should be produced, and can be no more ignorant of
          the motions of our wills, and the manner of them, than an artificer
          can be ignorant of the motions of his watch, and how far the spring
          will let down the string in the space of an hour; he sees all causes
          leading to such events in their whole order, and how the free‑will of
          man will comply with this, or refuse that; he changes not the manner
          of the creature’s operation, whatsoever it be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VI. But what if the foreknowledge of God, and the liberty of the
          will, cannot be fully reconciled by man? shall we therefore deny a
          perfection in God to support a liberty in ourselves? Shall we rather
          fasten ignorance upon God, and accuse him of blindness, to maintain
          our liberty? That God doth foreknow everything, and yet that there is
          liberty in the rational creature, are both certain; but how fully to
          reconcile them, may surmount the understanding of man. Some truths the
          disciples were not capable of bearing in the days of Christ; and
          several truths our understandings cannot reach as long as the world
          doth last; yet, in the mean time, we must, on the one hand, take heed
          of conceiving God ignorant, and on the other hand, of imagining the
          creature necessitated; the one will render God imperfect, and the
          other will seem to render him unjust, in punishing man for that sin
          which he could not avoid, but was brought into by a fatal necessity.
          God is sufficient to render a reason of his own proceedings, and clear
          up all at the day of judgment; it is a part of man’s curiosity, since
          the fall, to be prying into God’s secrets, things too high for him;
          whereby he singes his own wings, and confounds his own understanding.
          It is a cursed affectation that runs in the blood of Adam’s posterity,
          to know as God, though our first father smarted and ruined his
          posterity in that attempt; the ways and knowledge of God are as much
          above our thoughts and conceptions as the heavens are above the earth
          (Isa. lv. 9),721 and so sublime, that we cannot comprehend them in
          their true and just greatness; his designs are so mysterious, and the
          ways of his conduct so profound, that it is not possible to dive into
          them. The force of our understandings is below his infinite wisdom,
          and therefore we should adore him with an humble astonishment, and cry
          out with the apostle (Rom. xi. 33): “O the depth of the riches of the
          wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and
          his ways past finding out!” Whenever we meet with depths that we
          cannot fathom, let us remember that he is God, and we his creatures;
          and not be guilty of so great extravagance, as to think that a subject
          can pierce into all the secrets of a prince, or a work understand all
          the operations of the artificer. Let us only resolve not to fasten
          anything on God that is unworthy of the perfection of his nature, and
          dishonorable to the glory of his majesty; nor imagine that we can ever
          step out of the rank of creatures to the glory of the Deity, to
          understand fully everything in his nature. So much for the second
          general, what God knows.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third is, how God knows all things. As it is necessary we
          should conceive God to be an understanding being, else he could not be
          God, so we must conceive his understanding to be infinitely more pure
          and perfect than ours in the act of it, else we liken him to
          ourselves, and debase him as low as his footstool.722 As among
          creatures there are degrees of being and perfection, plants above
          earth and sand, because they have a power of growth, beasts above
          plants, because to their power of growth there is an addition of
          excellency of sense, rational creatures above beasts, because to sense
          there is added the dignity of reason. The understanding of man is more
          noble than all the vegetative power of plants, or the sensative power
          of beasts: God therefore must be infinitely more excellent in his
          understanding, and therefore in the manner of it. As man differs from
          a beast in regard of his knowledge, so doth God also from man, in
          regard of his knowledge. As God therefore is in being and perfection,
          infinitely more above a man than a man is above a beast, the manner of
          his knowledge must be infinitely more above a man’s knowledge, than
          the knowledge of a man is above that of a beast; our understanding can
          clasp an object in a moment that is at a great distance from our
          sense; our eye, by one elevated motion, can view the heavens; the
          manner of God’s understanding must be unconceivably above our
          glimmerings; as the manner of his being is infinitely more perfect
          than all beings, so must the manner of his understanding be infinitely
          more perfect than all created understandings.723 Indeed, the manner of
          God’s knowledge can no more be known by us than his essence can be
          known by us; and the same incapacity in man, which renders him unable
          to comprehend the being of God, renders him as unable to comprehend
          the manner of God’s understanding. As there is a vast distance between
          the essence of God and our beings, so there is between the thoughts of
          God and our thoughts; the heavens are not so much higher than the
          earth, as the thoughts of God are above the thoughts of men, yea, and
          of the highest angel (Isa. lv. 8, 9), yet though we know not the
          manner of God’s knowledge, we know that he knows; as though we know
          not the infiniteness of God, yet we know that he is infinite. It is
          God’s sole prerogative to know himself, what he is; and it is equally
          his prerogative to know how he knows; the manner of God’s knowledge
          therefore must be considered by us as free from those imperfections
          our knowledge is encumbered with. In general, God doth necessarily
          know all things; he is necessarily omnipresent, because of the
          immensity of his essence; so he is necessarily omniscient, because of
          the infiniteness of his understanding. It is no more at the liberty of
          his will, whether he will know all things, than whether he will be
          able to create all things; it is no more at the liberty of his will,
          whether he will be omniscient, than whether he will be holy; he can as
          little be ignorant, as he can be impure; he knows not all things,
          because he will know them, but because it is essential to his nature
          to know them. In particular,
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. God knows by his own essence; that is, he sees the nature of
          things in the ideas of his own mind, and the events of things in the
          decrees of his own will; he knows them not by viewing the things, but
          by viewing himself; his own essence is the mirror and book, wherein he
          beholds all things that he doth ordain, dispose and execute; and so he
          knows all things in their first and original cause; which is no other
          than his own essence willing, and his own essence executing what he
          wills; he knows them in his power, as the physical principle; in his
          will, as the moral principle of things, as some speak. He borrows not
          the knowledge of creatures from the creatures, nor depends upon them
          for means of understanding, as we poor worms do, who are beholden to
          the objects abroad to assist us with images of things, and to our
          senses to convey them into our minds; God would then acquire a
          perfection from those things which are below himself, and an
          excellency from those things which are vile; his knowledge would not
          precede the being of the creatures, but the creatures would be before
          the act of his knowledge. If he understood by images drawn from the
          creatures, as we do, there would be something in God which is not God,
          viz. the images of things drawn from outward objects: God would then
          depend upon creatures for that which is more noble than a bare being;
          for to be understanding, is more excellent than barely to be. Besides,
          if God’s knowledge of his creatures were derived from the creatures by
          the impression of anything upon him, as there is upon us, he could not
          know from eternity, because from eternity there was no actual
          existence of anything but himself; and therefore there could not be
          any images shot out from anything, because there was not anything in
          being but God; as there is no principle of being to anything but by
          his essence, so there is no principle of the knowledge of anything by
          himself but his essence; if the knowledge of God were distinct from
          his essence, his knowledge were not eternal, because there is nothing
          eternal but his essence. His understanding is not a faculty in him as
          it is in us, but the same with his essence, because of the simplicity
          of his nature; God is not made up of various parts, one distinct from
          another, as we are, and therefore doth not understand by a part of
          himself, but by himself; so that to be, and to understand, is the same
          with God; his essence is not one thing, and the power whereby he
          understands another; he would then be compounded, and not be the most
          simple being. This is also necessary for the perfection of God; for
          the more perfect and noble the way and manner of knowing is, the more
          perfect and noble is the knowledge. The perfection of knowledge
          depends upon the excellency of the medium whereby we know. As a
          knowledge by reason, is a more noble way of knowing than knowledge by
          sense; so it is more excellent for God to know by his essence, than by
          anything without him, anything mixed with him; the first would render
          him dependent, and the other would demolish his simplicity. Again, the
          natures of all things are contained in God, not formally; for then the
          nature of the creatures would be God; but eminently, “He that planted
          the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?”
          (Ps. xciv. 9.) He hath in himself eminently the beauty, perfection,
          life and vigor of all creatures; he created nothing contrary to
          himself, but everything with some footsteps of himself in them; he
          could not have pronounced them good, as he did, had there been
          anything in them contrary to his own goodness; and therefore as his
          essence primarily represents itself, so it represents the creatures,
          and makes them known to him. As the essence of God is eminently all
          things, so by understanding his essence, he eminently understands all
          things.724 And therefore he hath not one knowledge of himself, and
          another knowledge of the creatures; but by knowing himself as the
          original and exemplary cause of all things, he cannot be ignorant of
          any creature which he is the cause of; so that he knows all things,
          not by an understanding of them, but by an understanding of himself;
          by understanding his own power as the efficient of them, his own will
          as the orderer of them, his own goodness as the adorner and beautifier
          of them, his own wisdom as the disposer of them, and his own holiness,
          to which many of their actions are contrary. As he sees all things
          possible in his own power, because he is able to produce them; so he
          sees all things future in his own will, decreeing to effect them, if
          they be good, or decreeing to permit them if they be evil.725 In this
          class he sees what he will give being to, and what he will suffer to
          fall into a deficiency, without looking out of himself, or borrowing
          knowledge from his creatures; he knows all things in himself. And thus
          his knowledge is more noble, and of a higher elevation than ours, or
          the knowledge of any creature can be; he knows all things by one
          comprehension of the causes in himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. God knows all things by one act of intuition. This the
          schools call an intuitive knowledge. This follows upon the other; for
          if he know by his own essence, he knows all things by one act, there
          would be otherwise a division in his essence, a first and a last, a
          nearness and a distance. As what he made, he made by one word; so what
          he sees, he pierceth into by one glance from eternity to eternity: as
          he wills all things by one act of his will, so he knows all things by
          one act of his understanding: he knows not some things discursively
          from other things, nor knows one thing successively after another. As
          by one act he imparts essence to things; so by one act he knows the
          nature of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He doth not know by discourse, as we do;—that is, by deducing one
          thing from another, and from common notions drawing out other rational
          conclusions and arguing one thing from another, and springing up
          various consequences from some principle assented to. But God stands
          in no need of reasonings; the making inferences and abstracting
          things, would be stains in the infinite perfection of God; here would
          be a mixture of knowledge and ignorance; while he knew the principle,
          he would not know the consequence and conclusion, till he had actually
          deduced it; one thing would be known after another, and so he would
          have an ignorance, and then a knowledge; and there would be different
          conceptions in God, and knowledge would be multiplied according to the
          multitude of objects; as it is in human understandings. But God knows
          all things before they did exist, and never was ignorant of them (Acts
          xv. 18): “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
          world.” He therefore knows them all at once; the knowledge of one
          thing was not before another, nor depended upon another, as it doth in
          the way of human reasoning.726 Though, indeed, some make a virtual
          discourse in God; that is, though God hath a simple knowledge, yet it
          doth virtually contain a discourse by the flowing of one knowledge
          from another; as from the knowledge of his own power, he knows what
          things are possible to be made by him; and from the knowledge of
          himself, he passes to the knowledge of the creatures; but this is only
          according to our conception, and because of our weakness they are
          apprehended as two distinct acts in God, one of which is the reason of
          another; as we say that one attribute is the reason of another; as his
          mercy may be said to be the reason of his patience; and his
          omnipresence to be the reason of the knowledge of present things done
          in the world. God, indeed, by one simple act, knows himself and the
          creatures; but when that act whereby he knows himself, is conceived by
          us to pass to the knowledge of the creatures, we must not understand
          it to be a new act, distinct from the other; but the same act upon
          different terms or objects; such an order is in our understandings and
          conceptions, not in God’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Nor doth he know successively as we do: that is, not by drops, one
          thing after another. This follows from the former; a knowledge of all
          things without discourse, is a knowledge without succession.727 The
          knowledge of one thing is not in God before another, one act of
          knowledge doth not beget another; in regard of the objects, one thing
          is before another, one year before another, one generation of men
          before another, one is the cause, the other is the effect; in the
          creatures there is such a succession, and God knows there will be such
          a succession; but there is no such order in God’s knowledge, for he
          knows all those successions by one glance, without any succession of
          knowledge in himself. Man, in his view of things, must turn sometimes
          his body, sometimes only his eyes, he cannot see all the contents of a
          letter at once; and though he beholds all the lines in the page of a
          book at once, and a whole country in a map, yet to know what is
          contained in them, he must turn his eye from word to word, and line to
          line, and so spin out one thing after another by several acts and
          motions. We behold a great part of the sea at once,728 but not all the
          dimensions of it; for to know the length of the sea, we move our eyes
          one way; to see the breadth of it, we turn our eyes another way; to
          behold the depth of it, we have another motion of them. And when we
          cast our eyes up to heaven, we seem to receive in an instant, the
          whole extent of the hemisphere; yet there is but one object the eye
          can attentively pitch upon, and we cannot distinctly view what we see
          in a lump, without various motions of our eyes, which is not done
          without succession of time.729 And certainly the understanding of
          angels is bounded, according to the measure of their beings; so that
          it cannot extend itself at one time, to a quantity of objects, to make
          a distinct application of them, but the objects must present
          themselves one by one; but God is all eye, all understanding; as there
          is no succession in his essence, so there is none in his knowledge;
          his understanding in the nature and in the act, is infinite, as it is
          in the text. He therefore sees, eternally and universally, all things
          by one act, without any motion, much less various motions; the various
          changes of things, in their substance, qualities, places, and
          relations, withdraw not anything from his eye, nor bring any new thing
          to his knowledge; he doth not upon consideration of present things
          turn his mind from past; or when he beholds future things turn his
          mind from present; but he sees them not one after another, but all at
          once and all together; the whole circle of his own counsels, and all
          the various lines drawn forth from the centre of his will, to the
          circumference of his creatures; just as if a man were able in one
          moment to read a whole library; or, as if you should imagine a
          transparent crystal globe, hung up in the midst of a room, and so
          framed as to take in the images of all things in the room, the
          fret‑work in the ceiling, the inlaid parts of the floor and the
          particular parts of the tapestry about it, the eye of a man would
          behold all the beauty of the room at once in it. As the sun by one
          light and heat frames sensible things, so God by one simple act knows
          all things; as he knows mutable things by an immutable knowledge,
          bodily things by a spiritual knowledge, so he knows many things by one
          knowledge (Heb. iv. 13): “All things are open and naked to him,” more
          than any one thing can be to us; and therefore he views all things at
          once, as well as we can behold and contemplate one thing alone. As he
          is the Father of lights, a God of infinite understanding, there is no
          variableness in his mind, nor any shadow of turning of his eye, as
          there is of ours, to behold various things (James i. 17); his
          knowledge being eternal, includes all times; there is nothing past or
          future with him, and therefore he beholds all things by one and the
          same manner of knowledge, and comprehends all knowable things by one
          act, and in one moment. This must needs be so,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Because of the eminency of God. God is above all, and therefore
          cannot but see the motions of all. He that sits in a theatre, or at
          the top of a place, sees all things, all persons; by one aspect he
          comprehends the whole circle of the place; whereas, he that sits
          below, when he looks before, he cannot see things behind; God being
          above all, about all, in all, sees at once the motions of all. The
          whole world, in the eye of God, is less than a point that divides one
          sentence from another in a book; as a cypher, a “grain of dust” (Isa.
          xl. 15); so little a thing can be seen by man at once; and all things
          being as little in the eye of God, are seen at once by him. As all
          time is but a moment to his eternity, so all things are but as a point
          to the immensity of his knowledge, which he can behold with more ease
          than we can move or turn our eye.

          (2.) Because all the perfections of knowing are united in God.730 As
          particular senses are divided in man,—by one he sees, by another he
          smells, yet all those are united in one common sense, and this common
          sense comprehends all,—so the various and distinct ways of knowledge
          in the creatures are all eminently united in God. A man when he sees a
          grain of wheat, understands at once all things that can in time
          proceed from that seed; so God, by beholding his own virtue and power,
          beholds all things which shall in time be unfolded by him. We have a
          shadow of this way of knowledge in our own understanding; the sense
          only perceives a thing present, and one object only proper and
          suitable to it; as the eye sees color, the ear hears sounds; we see
          this and that man, one time this, another minute that; but the
          understanding abstracts a notion of the common nature of man, and
          frames a conception of that nature wherein all men agree; and so in a
          manner beholds and understands all men at once, by understanding the
          common nature of man, which is a degree of knowledge above the sense
          and fancy; we may then conceive an infinite vaster perfection in the
          understanding of God. As to know, is simply better than not to know at
          all; so to know by one act comprehensive, is a greater perfection than
          to know by divided acts, by succession to receive information, and to
          have an increase or decrease of knowledge; to be like a bucket, always
          descending into the well, and fetching water from thence. It is a
          man’s weakness that he is fixed on one object only at a time; it is
          God’s perfection that he can behold all at once, and is fixed upon one
          no more than upon another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. III. God knows all things independently. This is essential to an
          infinite understanding. He receives not his knowledge from anything
          without him; he hath no tutor to instruct him, or book to inform him:
          “Who hath been his counsellor?” saith the prophet (Isa. xl. 13); he
          hath no need of the counsels of others, nor of the instructions of
          others. This follows upon the first and second propositions; if he
          knows things by his essence, then, as his essence is independent from
          the creatures, so is his knowledge; he borrows not any images from the
          creature; hath no species or pictures of things in his understanding,
          as we have; no beams from the creature strike upon him to enlighten
          him, but beams from him upon the world; the earth sends not light to
          the sun, but the sun to the earth. Our knowledge, indeed, depends upon
          the object, but all created objects depend upon God’s knowledge and
          will; we could not know creatures unless they were; but creatures
          could not be unless God knew them. As nothing that he wills is the
          cause of his will, so nothing that he knows is the cause of his
          knowledge; he did not make things to know them, but he knows them to
          make them: who will imagine that the mark of the foot in the dust is
          the cause that the foot stands in this or that particular place? If
          his knowledge did depend upon the things, then the existence of things
          did precede God’s knowledge of them: to say that they are the cause of
          God’s knowledge, is to say that God was not the cause of their being;
          and if he did create them, it was effected by a blind and ignorant
          power; he created he knew not what, till he had produced it. If he be
          beholden for his knowledge to the creatures he hath made, he had then
          no knowledge of them before he made them. If his knowledge were
          dependent upon them, it could not be eternal, but must have a
          beginning when the creatures had a beginning, and be of no longer a
          date than since the nature of things was in actual existence; for
          whatsoever is a cause of knowledge, doth precede the knowledge it
          causes, either in order of time, or order of nature: temporal things,
          therefore, cannot be the cause of that knowledge which is eternal. His
          works could not be foreknown to him, if his knowledge commenced with
          the existence of his works (Acts xv. 18): if he knew them before he
          made them, he could not derive a knowledge from them after they were
          made. He made all things in wisdom (Ps. civ. 24). How can this be
          imagined, if the things known where the cause of his knowledge, and so
          before his knowledge, and therefore before his action?731 God would
          not then be the first in the order of knowing agents, because he would
          not act by knowledge, but act before he knew, and know after he had
          acted; and so the creature which he made would be before the act of
          his understanding, whereby he knew what he made. Again, since
          knowledge is a perfection, if God’s knowledge of the creatures
          depended upon the creatures, he would derive an excellency from them,
          they would derive no excellency from any idea in the Divine mind; he
          would not be infinitely perfect in himself; if his perfection in
          knowledge were gained from anything without himself and below himself,
          he would not be sufficient of himself, but be under an indigence,
          which wanted a supply from the things he had made, and could not be
          eternally perfect till he had created and seen the effects of his own
          power, goodness, and wisdom, to render him more wise and knowing in
          time than he was from eternity. Who can fancy such a God as this
          without destroying the Deity he pretends to adore? for if his
          understanding be perfected by something without him, why may not his
          essence be perfected by something without him; that, as he was made
          knowing by something without him, he might be made God by something
          without him? How could his understanding be infinite if it depended
          upon a finite object, as upon a cause? Is the majesty of God to be
          debased to a mendicant condition, to seek for a supply from things
          inferior to himself? Is it to be imagined that a fool, a toad, a fly,
          should be assistant to the knowledge of God? that the most noble being
          should be perfected by things so vile; that the Supreme Cause of all
          things should receive any addition of knowledge, and be determined in
          his understanding, by the notion of things so mean? To conclude this
          particular, all things depend upon his knowledge, his knowledge
          depends upon nothing, but is as independent as himself and his own
          essence.

        <p>
          Prop. IV. God knows all things distinctly. His understanding is
          infinite in regard of clearness; “God is light, and in him is no
          darkness at all” (John i. 5); he sees not through a mist or cloud;
          there is no blemish in his understanding, no mote or beam in his eye,
          to render any thing obscure to him. Man discerns the surface and
          outside side of things; little or nothing of the essence of things; we
          see the noblest thing but “as in a glass darkly” (1 Cor. xiii. 12);
          the too great nearness, as well as the too great distance of a thing,
          hinders our sight; the smallness of a mote escapes our eye, and so our
          knowledge; also the weakness of our understanding is troubled with the
          multitude of things, and cannot know many things but confusedly: but
          God knows the forms and essence of things, every circumstance; nothing
          is so deep, but he sees to the bottom; he sees the mass, and sees the
          motes of beings; his understanding being infinite, is not offended
          with a multitude of things, or distracted with the variety of them; he
          discerns every thing infinitely more clearly and perfectly than Adam
          or Solomon could any one thing in the circle of their knowledge; what
          knowledge they had, was from him; he hath, therefore, infinitely a
          more perfect knowledge than they were capable in their natures to
          receive a communication of. All things are open to him (Heb. iv. 13);
          the least fibre, in its nakedness and distinct frame, is transparent
          to him, as, by the help of glasses, the mouth, feet, hands, of a small
          insect, are visible to a man, which seem to the eye, without that
          assistance, one entire piece, not diversified into parts. All the
          causes, qualities, natures, properties of things, are open to him; “he
          brings out the host of heaven by number, and calleth them by names”
          (Isa. xl. 26); he numbers the hairs of our heads: what more distinct
          than number? Thus God beholds things in every unity, which makes up
          the heap; he knows, and none else can, every thing in its true and
          intimate causes, in its original and intermediate causes; in himself,
          as the cause of every particular of their being, every property in
          their being. Knowledge by the causes is the most noble and perfect
          knowledge, and most suited to the infinite excellency of the Divine
          Being; he created all things, and ordered them to a universal and
          particular end; he, therefore, knows the essential properties of every
          thing, every activity of their nature, all their fitness for those
          distinct ends, to which he orders them, and for which he governs and
          disposeth them, and understands their darkest and most hidden
          qualities infinitely clearer than any eye can behold the clear beams
          of the sun. He knows all things as he made them; he made them
          distinctly, and therefore knows them distinctly, and that every
          individual; therefore God is said (Gen. i. 31) to see every thing that
          he had made; he took a review of every particular creature he had
          made, and upon his view pronounced it good. To pronounce that good,
          which was not exactly known in every creek, in every mite of its
          nature, had not consisted with his veracity; for every one that speaks
          truth ignorantly, that knows not that he speaks truth, is a liar in
          speaking that which is true. God knows every act of his own will,
          whether it be positive or permissive, and therefore every effect of
          his will. We must needs ascribe to God a perfect knowledge; but a
          confused knowledge cannot challenge that title. To know things only in
          a heap is unworthy of the Divine perfection; for if God knows his own
          ends in the creation of things, he knows distinctly the means whereby
          he will bring them to those ends for which he hath appointed them: no
          wise man intends an end, without a knowledge of the means conducing to
          that end; an ignorance, then, of any thing in the world, which falls
          under the nature of a means to a Divine end (and there is nothing in
          the world but doth), would be inconsistent with the perfection of God;
          it would ascribe to him a blind providence in the world. As there can
          be nothing imperfect in his being and essence, so there can be nothing
          imperfect in his understanding and knowledge, and therefore not a
          confused knowledge, which is an imperfection. “Darkness and light are
          both alike to him” (Ps. cxxxix. 12); he sees distinctly into the one,
          as well as the other; what is darkness to us, is not so to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. V. God knows all things infallibly. His understanding is
          infinite in regard of certainty; every tittle of what he knows is as
          far from failing as what he speaks; our Saviour affirms the one (Matt.
          v. 18), and there is the same reason of the certainty of one as well
          as the other; his essence is the measure of his knowledge; whence it
          is as impossible that God should be mistaken in the knowledge of the
          least thing in the world, as it is that he should be mistaken in his
          own essence; for, knowing himself comprehensively, he must know all
          others things infallibly; since he is essentially omniscient, he is no
          more capable of error in his understanding than of imperfection in his
          essence; his counsels are as unerring as his essence is perfect, and
          his knowledge as infallible as his essence is free from defect. Again,
          since God knows all things with a knowledge of vision, because he
          wills them, his knowledge must be as infallible as his purpose; now
          his purpose will certainly be effected; “what he hath thought shall
          come to pass, and what he hath purposed shall stand” (Isa. xiv. 24);
          “his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure” (Isa. xlvi.
          10). There may be interruptions of nature, the foundation of it may be
          out of course, but there can be no bar upon the Author of nature; he
          hath an infinite power to carry on and perfect the resolves of his own
          will; he can effect what he pleases by a word. Speech is one of the
          least motions; yet when God said, “let there be light, there was
          light” arising from darkness. No reason can be given why God knows a
          thing to be, but because he infallibly wills it to be. Again,732 the
          schools make this difference between the knowledge of the good and bad
          angels, that the good are never deceived; for that is repugnant to
          their blessed state; for deceit is an evil and an imperfection
          inconsistent with that perfect blessedness the good angels are
          possessed of; and would it not much more be a stain upon the
          blessedness of that God, that is blessed forever, to be subject to
          deceit? His knowledge therefore is not an opinion, for an opinion is
          uncertain; a man knows not what to think, but leans to one part of the
          question proposed, rather than to the other. If things did not come to
          pass therefore as God knows them, his knowledge would be imperfect;
          and since he knows by his essence, his essence also would be
          imperfect, if God were exposed to any deceit in his knowledge; he
          knows by himself, who is the highest truth; and therefore it is
          impossible he should err in his understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VI. God knows immutably. His understanding else could not be
          infinite; everything and every act that is mutable, is finite, it hath
          its bounds; for there is a term from which it changeth, and a term to
          which it changes.733 There is a change in the understanding, when we
          gain the knowledge of a thing, which was unknown to us before; or when
          we actually consider a thing which we did not know before, though we
          had the principles of the knowledge of it; or, when we know that
          distinctly, which we before knew confusedly. None of these can be
          ascribed to God without a manifest disparagement of his infiniteness.
          Our knowledge indeed is alway arriving to us or flowing from us; we
          pass from one degree to another; from worse to better, or from better
          to worse; but God loses nothing by the ages that are run, nor will
          gain anything by the ages that are to come. If there were a variation
          in the knowledge of God, by the daily and hourly changes in the world,
          he would grow wiser than he was, he was not then perfectly wise
          before. A change in the objects known, infers not any change in the
          understanding exercised about them; the wheel moves round, the spokes
          that are lowest are presently highest, and presently return to be low
          again; but the eye that beholds them changes not with the motions of
          the wheels. God’s knowledge admits no more of increase or decrease,
          than his essence doth; since God knows by his essence, and the essence
          of God is God himself, his knowledge must be void of any change. The
          knowledge of possible things, arising from the knowledge of his own
          power, cannot be changed unless his power be changed, and God become
          weak and impotent; the knowledge of future things cannot be changed,
          because that knowledge ariseth from his will, which is irreversible,
          “the counsel of the Lord that shall stand” (Prov. xix. 21); so that if
          God can never decay into weakness, and never turn to inconstancy,
          there can be no variation of his knowledge. He knows what he can do,
          and he knows what he will do; and both these being immutable, his
          knowledge must, consequently, be so too. It was not necessary that
          this or that creature should be, and therefore it was not necessary
          that God should know this or that creature with a knowledge of vision;
          but after the will of God had determined the existence of this or that
          creature, his knowledge being then determined to this or that object,
          did necessarily continue unchangeable. God, therefore, knows no more
          now than he did before; and at the end of the world, he shall know no
          more than he doth now; and from eternity, he knows no less than he
          doth now, and shall do to eternity. Though things pass into being and
          out of being, the knowledge of God doth not vary with them, for he
          knows them as well before they were, as when they are, and knows them
          as well when they are past, as when they are present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VII. God knows all things perpetually, i. e. in act. Since he
          knows by his essence, he always knows, because his essence never
          ceaseth, but is a pure act; so that he doth not know only in habit,
          but in act. Men that have the knowledge of some art or science, have
          it always in habit, though when they are asleep they have it not in
          act: a musician hath the habit of music, but doth not so much as think
          of it when his senses are bound up. But God is an unsleepy eye;734 he
          never slumbers nor sleeps; he never slumbers, in regard of his
          providence, and therefore never slumbers in regard of his knowledge.
          He knows not himself, nor any other creature more perfectly at one
          time than at another; he is perpetually in the act of knowing, as the
          sun is in the act of shining; the sun never ceased to shine in one or
          other part of the world, since it was first fixed in the heavens; nor
          God to be in the act of knowledge, since he was God; and therefore
          since he always was, and always will be God, he always was and always
          will be in the act of knowledge; always knowing his own essence, he
          must alway actually know what hath been gone and ceased from being,
          and what shall come and arise into being; as a watchmaker knows what
          watch he intends to make, and after he hath made it, though it be
          broken to pieces, or consumed by the fire, he still knows it, because
          he knows the copy of it in his own mind. Some, therefore, in regard of
          this perpetual act of the Divine knowledge, have called God not
          intellectus, but the intellection of intellections; we have no proper
          English word to express the act of the understanding; as his power is
          co‑eternal with him, so is his knowledge; all times past, present, and
          to come, are embraced in the bosom of his understanding; he fixed all
          things in their seasons, that nothing new comes to him, nothing old
          passes from him.735 What is done in a thousand years, is actually
          present with his knowledge, as what is done in one day, or in one
          watch in the night, is with ours; since a “thousand years are no more
          to God than a day,” or a “watch in the night” is to us (Ps. xc. 4).
          God is in the highest degree of being, and therefore in the highest
          degree of understanding. Knowledge is one of the most perfect acts in
          any creature. God therefore hath all actual, as well as essential and
          habitual knowledge; his understanding is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>IV. The fourth general is, Reasons to prove this.</p>
        <p>
          Reason 1. God must know what any creature knows, and more than any
          creature knows. There is nothing done in the world but is known by
          some creature or other; every action is at least known by the person
          that acts, and therefore known by the Creator, who cannot be exceeded
          by any of the creatures, or all of them together; and every creature
          is known by him, since every creature is made by him.736 And as God
          works all things by an infinite power, so he knows all things by an
          infinite understanding. First, the perfection of God requires this.737
          All perfections that include no essential defect, are formally in God;
          but knowledge includes no essential defect in itself, therefore it is
          in God. Knowledge in itself is desirable, and an excellency; ignorance
          is a defect; it is impossible that the least grain of defect can be
          found in the most perfect Being. Since God is wise, he must be
          knowing; for wisdom must have knowledge for the basis of it. A
          creature can no more be wise without knowledge, than he can be active
          without strength. Now God is “only wise” (Rom. xvi. 27); and,
          therefore, only knowing in the highest degree of knowledge,
          incomprehensibly beyond all degrees of knowledge, because infinite.
          Again, the more spiritual anything is, the more understanding it is.
          The dull body understands nothing; sense perceives, but the
          understanding faculty is seated in the soul, which is of a spiritual
          nature, which knows things that are present, remembers things that are
          past, foresees many things to come. What is the property of a
          spiritual nature, must be, in a most eminent manner, in the supreme
          spirit of the world; that is, in the highest degree of spirituality,
          and most remote from any matter. Again, nothing can enjoy other
          things, but by some kind of understanding them; God hath the highest
          enjoyment of himself, of all things he hath created, of all the glory
          that accrues to him by them; nothing of perfection and blessedness can
          be wanting to him. Felicity doth not consist with ignorance, and all
          imperfect knowledge is a degree of ignorance: God, therefore, doth
          perfectly know himself, and all things from whence he designs any
          glory to himself. The most noble manner of acting must be ascribed to
          God, as being the most noble and excellent Being; to act by knowledge
          is the most excellent manner of acting; God hath, therefore, not only
          knowledge, but the most excellent manner of knowledge; for as it is
          better to know than to be ignorant, so it is better to know in the
          most excellent manner, than to have a mean and low kind of knowledge;
          his knowledge, therefore, must be every way as perfect as his essence,
          infinite as well as that. An infinite nature must have an infinite
          knowledge: a God ignorant of anything cannot be counted infinite, for
          he is not infinite to whom any degree of perfection is wanting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 2. All the knowledge in any creature is from God. And you must
          allow God a greater and more perfect knowledge than any creature hath,
          yea, than all creatures have. All the drops of knowledge any creature
          hath, come from God; and all the knowledge in every creature, that
          ever was, is, or shall be, in the whole mass, was derived from him. If
          all those several drops in particular creatures, were collected into
          one spirit, into one creature, it would be an unconceivable knowledge,
          yet still lower than what the Author of all that knowledge hath; for
          God cannot give more knowledge than he hath himself; nor is the
          creature capable of receiving so much knowledge as God hath. As the
          creature is incapable of receiving so much power as God hath, for then
          it would be almighty, so it is incapable of receiving so much
          knowledge as God hath, for then it would be God. Nothing can be made
          by God equal to him in anything; if anything could be made as knowing
          as God, it would be eternal as God, it would be the cause of all
          things as God. The knowledge that we poor worms have, is an argument
          God uses for the asserting the greatness of his own knowledge (Ps.
          xciv. 10): “He that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?” Man
          hath here knowledge ascribed to him; the author of this knowledge is
          God; he furnished him with it, and therefore doth in a higher manner
          possess it, and much more than can fall under the comprehension of any
          creature; as the sun enlightens all things, but hath more light in
          itself than it darts upon the earth or the heavens: and shall not God
          eminently contain all that knowledge he imparts to the creatures, and
          infinitely more exact and comprehensive?
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 3. The accusations of conscience evidence God’s knowledge of
          all actions of his creatures. Doth not conscience check for the most
          secret sins, to which none are privy but a man’s self, the whole world
          beside being ignorant of his crime? Do not the fears of another Judge
          gall the heart? If a judgment above him be feared, an understanding
          above him discerning their secrets is confessed by those fears; whence
          can those horrors arise, if there be not a superior that understands
          and records the crime? What perfection of the Divine Being can this
          relate unto, but omniscience? What other attribute is to be feared, if
          God were defective in this? The condemnation of us by our own hearts,
          when none in the world can condemn us, renders it legible, that there
          is One “greater than our hearts” in respect of knowledge, who “knoweth
          all things” (1 John iii. 20). Conscience would be a vain principle,
          and stingless without this; it would be an easy matter to silence all
          its accusations, and mockingly laugh in the face of its severest
          frowns. What need any trouble themselves, if none knows their crimes
          but themselves? Concealed sins, gnawing the conscience, are arguments
          of God’s omniscience of all present and past actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 4. God is the first cause of everything, every creature is his
          production. Since all creatures, from the highest angel to the lowest
          worm, exist by the power of God, if God understands his own power and
          excellency, nothing can be hid from him, that was brought forth by
          that power, as well as nothing can be unknown to him, that that power
          is able to produce. “If God knows nothing besides himself, he may then
          believe there is nothing besides himself; we shall then fancy a God
          miserably mistaken: if he knows nothing besides himself, then things
          were not created by him, or not understandingly and voluntarily
          created, but dropped from him before he was aware.”738 To think that
          the First Cause of all should be ignorant of those things he is the
          cause of, is to make him not a voluntary, but natural agent, and
          therefore necessary; and then that the creature came from him as light
          from the sun, and moisture from the water; this would be an absurd
          opinion of the world’s creation; if God be a voluntary agent, as he
          is, he must be an intelligent agent. The faculty of will is not in any
          creature, without that of understanding also. If God be an intelligent
          agent, his knowledge must extend as far as his operation, and every
          object of his operation, unless we imagine God hath lost his memory,
          in that long tract of time since the first creation of them. An
          artificer cannot be ignorant of his own work: if God knows himself, he
          knows himself to be a cause; how can he know himself to be a cause,
          unless he know the effects he is the cause of? One relation implies
          another; a man cannot know himself to be a father, unless he hath a
          child, because it is a name of relation, and in the notion of it
          refers to another. The name of cause is a name of relation, and
          implies an effect; if God therefore know himself in all his
          perfections, as the cause of things, he must know all his acts, what
          his wisdom contrived, what his counsel determined, and what his power
          effected. The knowledge of God is to be supposed in a free
          determination of himself; and that knowledge must be perfect, both of
          the object, act, and all the circumstances of it. How can his will
          freely produce anything that was not first known in his understanding?
          From this the prophet argues the understanding of God, and the
          unsearchableness of it, because he is the “Creator of the ends of the
          earth” (Isa. xl. 28), and the same reason David gives of God’s
          knowledge of him, and of everything he did, and that afar off, because
          he was formed by him (Ps. cxxxix. 2, 15, 16). As the perfect making of
          things only belongs to God: so doth the perfect knowledge of things;
          it is as absurd to think, that God should be ignorant of what he hath
          given being to; that he should not know all the creatures and their
          qualities, the plants and their virtues; as that a man should not know
          the letters that are formed by him in writing. Everything bears in
          itself the mark of God’s perfection; and shall not God know the
          representation of his own virtue?
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason 5. Without this knowledge, God could no more be the Governor,
          than he could be the Creator of the world. Knowledge is the basis of
          providence; to know things, is before the government of things; a
          practical knowledge cannot be without a theoretical knowledge. Nothing
          could be directed to its proper end, without the knowledge of the
          nature of it, and its suitableness to answer that end for which it is
          intended. As everything, even the minutest, falls under the conduct of
          God, so everything falls under the knowledge of God. A blind coachman
          is not able to hold the reins of his horses, and direct them in right
          paths: since the providence of God is about particulars, his knowledge
          must be about particulars; he could not else govern them in
          particular; nor could all things be said to depend upon him in their
          being and operations. Providence depends upon the knowledge of God,
          and the exercise of it upon the goodness of God; it cannot be without
          understanding and will; understanding, to know what is convenient, and
          will to perform it. When our Saviour therefore speaks of providence,
          he intimates these two in a special manner, “Your heavenly Father
          knows that you have need of these things” (Matt. vi. 32), and
          goodness, in Luke xi. 13. The reason of providence is so joined with
          omniscience, that they cannot be separated. What a kind of God would
          he be that were ignorant of those things that were governed by him!
          The ascribing this perfection to him, asserts his providence; for it
          is as easy for one that knows all things, to look over the whole
          world, if writ with monosyllables, in every little particular of it;
          as it is with a man to take a view of one letter in an alphabet.
          Again, if God were not omniscient, how could he reward the good, and
          punish the evil? the works of men are either rewardable or punishable;
          not only according to their outward circumstances, but inward
          principles and ends, and the degrees of venom lurking in the heart.739
          The exact discerning of these, without a possibility to be deceived,
          is necessary to pass a right and infallible judgment upon them, and
          proportion the censure and punishment to the crime: without such a
          knowledge and discerning, men would not have their due; nay, a
          judgment just for the matter, would be unjust in the manner, because
          unjustly past, without an understanding of the merit of the cause. It
          is necessary therefore that the Supreme Judge of the world should not
          be thought to be blindfold, when he distributes his rewards and
          punishments, and muffle his face when he passes his sentence. It is
          necessary to ascribe to him the knowledge of men’s thoughts and
          intentions; the secret wills and aims; the hidden works of darkness in
          every man’s conscience, because every man’s work is to be measured by
          the will and inward frame. It is necessary that he should perpetually
          retain all those things in the indelible and plain records of his
          memory, that there may not be any work without a just proportion of
          what is due to it. This is the glory of God, to discover the secrets
          of all hearts at last, as 1 Cor. iv. 5, “The Lord shall bring to light
          the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of
          all hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God.” This
          knowledge fits him to be a judge; the reason why the ungodly shall not
          stand in judgment, is because God knows their ways, which is implied
          in his knowing the way of the righteous (Ps. i. 5, 6). I now proceed
          to the use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use I. is of information or instruction. If God hath all knowledge;
          then,

        <p>
          Instruct. 1. Jesus Christ is not a mere creature. The two titles of
          wonderful Counsellor, and mighty God, are given him in conjunction
          (Isa. ix. 6), not only the Angel of the covenant, as he is called
          (Malach. iii. 1), or the executor of his counsels, but a counsellor,
          in conjunction with him in counsel as well as power: this title is
          superior to any title given to any of the prophets in regard of their
          predictions; and therefore I should take it rather as the note of his
          perfect understanding, than of his perfect teaching and discovering;
          as Calvin doth. He is not only the revealer of what he knows, so were
          the prophets according to their measures; but the counsellor of what
          he revealed, having a perfect understanding of all the counsels of
          God, as being interested in them, as the mighty God. He calls himself
          by the peculiar title of God, and declares that he will manifest
          himself by this prerogative to all the churches (Rev. ii. 23): “And
          all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and
          hearts,” the most hidden operations of the minds of men, that lie
          locked up from the view of all the world besides. And this was no new
          thing to Him, after his ascension; for the same perfection he had in
          the time of his earthly flesh (Luke vi. 8), he knew their thoughts;
          his eyes are therefore compared (Cant. v. 12) to doves’ eyes, which
          are clear and quick; and to a flame of fire (Rev. i. 14), not only
          heat to consume his enemies, but light to discern their contrivances
          against the church; he pierceth by his knowledge, into all parts, as
          fire pierceth into the closest particle of iron, and separates between
          the most united parts of metals; and some tell us, he is called a Roe,
          from the perspicacity of his sight, as well as from the swiftness of
          his motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He hath a perfect knowledge of the Father; he knows the Father, and
          none else knows the Father; angels know God, men know God, but Christ
          in a peculiar manner knows the Father; no man knows the Son but the
          Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son (Matt. xi. 27);
          he knows so, as that he learns not from any other; he doth perfectly
          comprehend him, which is beyond the reach of any creature, with the
          addition of all the divine virtue; not because of any incapacity in
          God to reveal, but the incapacity of the creature to receive; finite
          is incapable of being made infinite, and therefore incapable of
          comprehending infinite; so that Christ cannot be Deus factus, made of
          a creature a God, to comprehend God; for then of finite he would
          become infinite, which is a contradiction. As the Spirit is God,
          because he searches the deep things of God (1 Cor. ii. 10), that is
          comprehends them,740 as the spirit of a man doth the things of a man
          (now the spirit of man understands what it thinks, and what it wills),
          so the Spirit of God understands what is in the understanding of God,
          and what is in the will of God. He hath an absolute knowledge ascribed
          to him, and such as could not be ascribed to anything but a divinity:
          now if the Spirit knows the deep things of God, and takes from Christ
          what he shows to us of him (John xvi. 15), he cannot be ignorant of
          those things himself; he must know the depths of God, that affords us
          that Spirit, that is not ignorant of any of the counsels of the
          Father’s will; since he comprehends the Father, and the Father him, he
          is in himself infinite; for God whose essence is infinite, is
          infinitely knowable; but no created understanding can infinitely know
          God. The infiniteness of the object hinders it from being understood
          by anything that is not infinite. Though a creature should understand
          all the works of God, yet it cannot be therefore said to understand
          God himself: as though I may understand all the volitions and motions
          of my soul, yet it doth not follow that therefore I understand the
          whole nature and substance of my soul; or if a man understood all the
          effects of the sun, that therefore he understands fully the nature of
          the sun. But Christ knows the Father, he lay in the bosom of the
          Father, was in the greatest intimacy with him (John i. 18), and from
          this intimacy with him, he saw him and knew him; so he knows God as
          much as he is knowable; and therefore knows him perfectly as the
          Father knows himself by a comprehensive vision; this is the knowledge
          of God wherein properly the infiniteness of his understanding appears:
          and our Saviour uses such expressions which manifest his knowledge to
          be above all created knowledge, and such a manner of knowledge of the
          Father, as the Father hath of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christ knows all creatures. That knowledge which comprehends God,
          comprehends all created things as they are in God; it is a knowledge
          that sinks to the depths of his will, and therefore extends to all the
          acts of his will in creation and providence; by knowing the Father he
          knows all things that are contained in the virtue, power, and will of
          God; “whatsoever the Father doth, that the Son doth” (John v. 19). As
          the Father therefore knows all things he is the cause of, so doth the
          Son know all things he is the worker of; as the perfect making of all
          things belongs to both, so doth the perfect knowledge of all things
          belong to both; where the action is the same, the knowledge is the
          same. Now the Father did not create one thing and Christ another; “but
          all things were created by him, and for him, all things both in heaven
          and earth” (Col. i. 16): as he knows himself as the cause of all
          things, and the end of all things, he cannot be ignorant of all things
          that were effected by him, and are referred to him; he knows all
          creatures in God, as he knows the essence of God, and knows all
          creatures in themselves, as he knows his own acts and the fruits of
          his power; those things must be in his knowledge that were in his
          power; all the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God are hid in
          him (Col. ii. 3). Now it is not the wisdom of God to know in part, and
          be in part ignorant. He cannot be ignorant of anything, since there is
          nothing but what was made by him (John i. 3), and since it is less to
          know than create; for we know many things which we cannot make.741 If
          he be the Creator, he cannot but be the discerner of what he made;
          this is a part of wisdom belonging to an artificer, to know the nature
          and quality of what he makes. Since he cannot be ignorant of what he
          furnished with being, and with various endowments, he must know them
          not only universally, but particularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ knows the heart and affections of men. Peter scruples not to
          ascribe to him this knowledge, among the knowledge of all other things
          (John xxi. 17). “Lord thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I
          love thee.” From Christ’s knowledge of all things, he concludes his
          knowledge of the inward frames and dispositions of men. To search the
          heart is the sole prerogative of God (1 Kings viii. 39), for thou,
          even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men: shall we
          take only here with a limitation, as some that are no friends to the
          Deity of Christ would, and say, God only knows the hearts of men from
          himself, and by his own infinite virtue? Why may we not take only in
          other places with a limitation, and make nonsense of it, as Ps.
          lxxxvi. 10, “Thou art God alone.” Is it to be understood that God is
          God alone from himself, but other gods may be made by him, and so
          there may be numberless infinites? As God is God alone, so that none
          can be God but himself; so he alone knows all the hearts of all the
          children of men, and none but he can know them; this knowledge is from
          his nature. The reason why God knows the hearts of men, is rendered in
          the Scripture double, because he created them, and because he is
          present everywhere (Ps. xxxiii. 13, 15),742 these two are by the
          confession of Christians and Pagans universally received as the proper
          characters of divinity, whereby the Deity is distinguished from all
          creatures. Now when Christ ascribes this to himself, and that with
          such an emphasis, that nothing greater than that could be urged, as he
          doth (Rev. ii. 23), we must conclude that he is of the same essence
          with God, one with him in his nature, as well as one with him in his
          attributes. God only knows the hearts of the children of men; there is
          the unity of God: Christ searches the hearts and reins; there is a
          distinction of persons in a oneness of essence; he knows the hearts of
          all men, not only of those that were with him in the time of the
          flesh, that have been, and shall be, since his ascension; but of those
          that lived and died before his coming; because he is to be the Judge
          of all that lived before his humiliation on earth, as well as after
          his exaltation in heaven. It pertains to him, as a Judge, to know
          distinctly the merits of the cause of which he is to judge; and this
          excellency of searching the hearts is mentioned by himself with
          relation to his judicial proceeding, “I will give to every one of you
          according to your works.” And though a creature may know what is in a
          man’s heart, if it be revealed to him, yet such a knowledge is a
          knowledge only by report, not by inspection; yet this latter is
          ascribed to Christ (John ii. 24, 25): “he knew all men, and needed not
          that any should testify of man, for he knew what was in man:” he
          looked into their hearts. The Evangelist, to allay the amazement of
          men at his relation of our Saviour’s knowledge of the inward falsity
          of those that made a splendid profession of him, doth not say the
          Father revealed it to him, but intimates it to be an unseparable
          property of his nature. No covering was so thick as to bound his eye;
          no pretence so glittering as to impose upon his understanding. Those
          that made a profession of him, and could not be discerned by the eye
          of man from his faithfulest attendants, were in their inside known to
          him plainer than their outside was to others; and, therefore, he
          committed not himself to them, though they seemed to be persuaded to a
          real belief in his name, because of the power of his miracles, and
          were touched with an admiration of him, as some great prophet, and,
          perhaps, declared him to be the Messiah (ver. 23).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. He had a foreknowledge of the particular inclinations of men,
          before those distinct inclinations were in actual being in them. This
          is plainly asserted, John vi. 64: “But there are some of you that
          believe not; for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that
          believed not, and who should betray him.” When Christ assured them,
          from the knowledge of the hearts of his followers, that some of them
          were void of that faith they professed, the Evangelist, to stop their
          amazement that Christ should have such a power and virtue, adds, that
          he “knew from the beginning;” that he had not only a present
          knowledge, but a foreknowledge, of every one’s inclination; he knew,
          not only now and then what was in the hearts of his disciples, but
          from the beginning, of any one’s giving up their names to him; he knew
          whether it were a pretence or sincere; he knew who should betray him;
          and there was no man’s inward affection but was foreseen by him.743
          “From the beginning,” whether we understand it from the beginning of
          the world, as when Christ saith, concerning divorces, “From the
          beginning it was not so,” that is, from the beginning of the world,
          from the beginning of the law of nature; or, from the beginning of
          their attending him, as it is taken, Luke i. 2; he had a certain
          prescience of the inward dispositions of men’s hearts, and their
          succeeding sentiments; he foreknew the treacherous heart of Judas in
          the midst of his splendid profession, and discerned his resolution in
          the root, and his thought in the confused chaos of his natural
          corruption; he knew how it would spring up before it did spring up,
          before Judas had any distinct and formal conception of it himself, or
          before there was any actual preparation to a resolve. Peter’s denial
          was not unknown to him, when Peter had a present resolution, and no
          question spake it in the present sincerity of his soul, “never to
          forsake him;” he foreknew what would be the result of that poison
          which lurked in Peter’s nature, before Peter himself imagined anything
          of it; he discerned Peter’s apostatizing heart, when Peter resolved
          the contrary: our Saviour’s prediction was accomplished, and Peter’s
          valiant resolution languished into cowardice. Shall we then conclude
          our blessed Saviour a creature, who perfectly and only knew the
          Father, who knew all creatures; who had all the treasures of wisdom
          and knowledge who knew the inward motions of men’s hearts by his own
          virtue, and had, not only a present knowledge, but a prescience of
          them?

          an infinite knowledge and understanding. Then there is a providence
          exercised by God in the world, and that about everything. As
          providence infers omniscience as the guide of it, so omniscience
          infers providence as the end of it. What exercise would there be of
          this attribute, but in the government of the world? To this, this
          infinite perfection refers (Jer. xvii. 10), “I the Lord search the
          heart, I try the reins, to give every man according to his ways, and
          according to the fruit of his doings.” He searches the heart to
          reward, he rewards every man according to the rewardableness of his
          actions; his government, therefore, extends to every man in the world;
          there is no heart but he searches, therefore no heart but he governs;
          to what purpose, else, would be this knowledge of all his creatures?
          for a mere contemplation of them? No. What pleasure can that be to
          God, who knows himself, who is infinitely more excellent than all his
          creatures? Doth he know them to neglect all care of them? this must be
          either out of sloth; but how incompatible is laziness to a pure and
          infinite activity! or out of majesty; but it is no less for the glory
          of his majesty to conduct them, than it was for the glory of his power
          to erect them into being. He that counts nothing unworthy of his arms
          to make, nothing unworthy of his understanding to know, why should he
          count anything unworthy of his wisdom to govern? If he knows them to
          neglect them, it must be because he hath no will to it, or no goodness
          for it; either of these would be a stain upon God; to want goodness is
          to be evil, and to want will is to be negligent and scornful, which
          are inconsistent with an infinite, active goodness. Doth a father
          neglect providing for the wants of the family which he knows? or a
          physician, the cure of that disease he understands? God is omniscient,
          he therefore sees all things; he is good, he doth not therefore
          neglect anything, but conducts it to the end he appointed it. There is
          nothing so little that can escape his knowledge, and therefore nothing
          so little but falls under his providence; nothing so sublime as to be
          above his understanding, and therefore nothing can be without the
          compass of his conduct; nothing can escape his eye, and therefore
          nothing can escape his care; nothing is known to him in vain, as
          nothing was made by him in vain; there must be acknowledged,
          therefore, some end of this knowledge of all his creatures.

          Instruct. 3. Hence, then, will follow the certainty of a day of
          judgment. To what purpose can we imagine this attribute of
          omniscience, so often declared and urged in Scripture to our
          consideration, but in order to a government of our practice, and a
          future trial? Every perfection of the Divine nature hath sent out
          brighter rays in the world than this of his infinite knowledge. His
          power hath been seen in the being of the world, and his wisdom in the
          order and harmony of the creatures; his grace and mercy hath been
          plentifully poured out in his mission of a Redeemer, and his justice
          hath been elevated by the dying groans of the Son of God upon the
          cross. But hath his omniscience yet met with a glory proportionable to
          that of his other perfections? All the attributes of God that have
          appeared in some beautiful glimmerings in the world, wait for a more
          full manifestation in glory, as the creatures do for the
          “manifestation of the sons of God” (Rom. viii. 19); but especially
          this, since it hath been less evidenced than others, and as much, or
          more, abused than any; it expects, therefore, a public righting in the
          eye of the world. There have been, indeed, some few sparks of this
          perfection sensibly struck out now and then in the world in some
          horrors of conscience, which have made men become their own accusers
          of unknown crimes, in bringing out hidden wickedness to a public view
          by various providences. This hath also been the design of sprinklings
          of judgments upon several generations, as (Ps. xc. 8), “We are
          consumed by thy anger, and by thy wrath we are troubled; thou hast set
          our iniquities before thee, and our secret sins in the light of thy
          countenance.” The word עלומנו signifies youth, as well as secret, i.
          e., sins committed long ago, and that with secrecy. By this he hath
          manifested that secret sins are not hid from his eye. Though inward
          terrors and outward judgments have been let loose to worry men into a
          belief of this, yet the corruptions of men would still keep a contrary
          notion in their minds, that “God hath forgotten, that he hides his
          face from transgression, and will not regard their impiety” (Ps. x.
          11). There must, therefore, be a time of trial for the public
          demonstration of this excellency, that it may receive its due honor,
          by a full testimony that no secrecy can be a shelter from it. As his
          justice, which consists in giving every one his due, could not be
          glorified, unless men were called to an account for their actions, so
          neither would his omniscience appear in its illustrious colors,
          without such a manifestation of the secret motions of men’s hearts,
          and of villanies done under lock and key, when none were conscious to
          them, but the committers of them. Now the last judgment is the time
          appointed for the “opening of the books” (Dan. vii. 10). The book of
          God’s records, and conscience the counterpart, were never fully opened
          and read before, only now and then some pages turned to, in particular
          judgments; and out of those “books shall men be judged according to
          their works” (Rev. xx. 12). Then shall the defaced sins be brought,
          with all their circumstances, to every man’s memory; the counsels of
          men’s hearts fled far from their present remembrance, all the habitual
          knowledge they had of their own actions, shall, by God’s knowledge of
          them, be excited to an actual review; and their works not only made
          manifest to themselves, but notorious to the world: all the words,
          thoughts, deeds of men, shall be brought forth into the light of their
          own minds by the infinite light of God’s understanding reflecting on
          them. His knowledge renders him an unerring witness, as well as his
          justice “a swift witness” (Mal. iii. 5); a swift witness, because he
          shall, without any circuit, or length of speech, convince their
          consciences, by an inward illumination of them, to take notice of the
          blackness and deformity of their hearts and works. In all judgments
          God is somewhat known to be the searcher of hearts; the time of
          judgment is the time of his remembrance (Hos. viii. 13): “Now will he
          remember their iniquity, and visit their sins;” but the great instant,
          or now, of the full glorifying it, is the grand day of account. This
          attribute must have a time for its full discovery; and no time can be
          fit for it but a time of a general reckoning. Justice cannot be
          exercised without omniscience; for as justice is a giving to every one
          his due, so there must be knowledge to discern what is due to every
          man; the searching the heart is in order to the rewarding the works.

          resurrection. Who can think this too hard for his power, since not the
          least atom of the dust of our bodies can escape his knowledge? An
          infinite understanding comprehends every mite of a departed carcase;
          this will not appear impossible, nor irrational, to any, upon a
          serious consideration, of this excellency in God. The body is
          perished, the matter of it hath been since clothed with different
          forms and figures; part of it hath been made the body of a worm, part
          of it returned to the dust that hath been blown away by the wind; part
          of it hath been concocted in the bodies of canibals, fish, ravenous
          beasts; the spirits have evaporated into air, part of the blood melted
          into water; what, then, is the matter of the body annihilated? is that
          wholly perished? no; the foundation remains, though it hath put on a
          variety of forms; the body of Abel, the first man that died, nor the
          body of Adam, are not, to this day, reduced to nothing; indeed, the
          quantity and the quality of those bodies have been lost by various
          changes they have past through since their dissolution; but the
          matter, or substance of them, remains entire, and is not capable to be
          destroyed by all those transforming alterations, in so long a
          revolution of time. The body of a man in his infancy and his old age,
          if it were Methuselah’s, is the same in the foundation in those
          multitude of years; though the quantity of it be altered, the quality
          different; though the color and other things be changed in it, the
          matter of this body remains the same among all the alterations after
          death. And can it be so mixed with other natures and creatures, as
          that it is past finding out by an infinite understanding? Can any
          particle of this matter escape the eye of Him that makes and beholds
          all those various alterations, and where every mite of the substance
          of those bodies is particularly lodged, so as that he cannot compact
          it together again for a habitation of that soul, that many a year
          before fled from it?744 Since the knowledge of God is infinite, and
          his providence extensive over the least as well as the greatest parts
          of the world, he must needs know the least as well as the greatest of
          his creatures in their beginning, progress, and dissolution; all the
          forms through which the bodies of all creatures roll, the particular
          instants of time, and the particular place when and where those
          changes are made, they are all present with him; and, therefore, when
          the revolution of time allotted by him for the reunion of souls and
          deceased bodies is come, it cannot be doubted but, out of the
          treasures of his knowledge, he can call forth every part of the matter
          of the bodies of men, from the first to the last man that expired, and
          strip it of all those forms and figures which it shall then have, to
          compact it to be a lodging for that soul which before it entertained;
          and though the bodies of men have been devoured by wild beasts in the
          earth, and fish in the sea, and been lodged in the stomachs of
          barbarous men‑eaters, the matter is not lost. There is but little of
          the food we take that is turned into the substance of our own bodies;
          that which is not proper for nourishment, which is the greatest part,
          is separated, and concocted, and rejected; whatsoever objections are
          made, are answered by this attribute. Nothing hinders a God of
          infinite knowledge from discerning every particle of the matter,
          wheresoever it is disposed; and since he hath an eye to discern, and a
          hand to recollect and unite, what difficulty is there in believing
          this article of the christian faith? he that questions this revealed
          truth of the resurrection of the body, must question God’s omniscience
          as well as his omnipotence and power.

          justification in the sight of God by anything in ourselves? Is there
          any action done by any of us, but upon a scrutiny we may find flaws
          and deficiency in it? What then? shall not this perfection of God
          discern them? the motes that escape our eyes cannot escape his (1 John
          iii. 20): “God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things;” so
          that it is in vain for any man to flatter himself with the rectitude
          of any work, or enter into any debate with him who can bring a
          thousand articles against us, out of his own infinite records, unknown
          to us, and unanswerable by us. If conscience, a representative or
          counterpart of God’s omniscience in our own bosoms, find nothing done
          by us, but in a copy short of the original, and beholds, if not blurs,
          yet imperfections in the best actions, God must much more discern
          them; we never knew a copy equally exact with the original. If our own
          conscience be as a thousand witnesses, the knowledge of God is as
          millions of witnesses against us; if our corruption be so great, and
          our holiness so low, in our own eyes, how much greater must the one,
          and how much meaner must the other, appear in the eyes of God? God
          hath an unerring eye to see, as well as an unspotted holiness to hate,
          and an unbribable justice to punish; he wants no more understanding to
          know the shortness of our actions, than he doth holiness to enact, and
          power to execute, his laws; nay, suppose we could recollect many
          actions, wherein there were no spot visible to us, the consideration
          of this attribute should scare us from resting upon any or all of
          them, since it is the Lord that, by a piercing eye, sees and judges
          according to the heart, and not according to appearance. The least
          crookedness of a stick, not sensible to an acute eye, yet will appear
          when laid to the line; and the impurity of a counterfeit metal be
          manifest when applied to the touchstone; so will the best action of
          any mere man in the world, when it comes to be measured in God’s
          knowledge by the straight line of his law. Let every man, therefore,
          as Paul, though he should know nothing by himself, think not himself
          therefore justified; since it is the Lord, who is of an infinite
          understanding, that judgeth (1 Cor. iv. 4). A man may be justified in
          his own sight, “but not any living man can be justified in the sight
          of God” (Ps. cxliii. 2); in his sight, whose eye pierceth into our
          unknown secrets and frames: it was, therefore, well answered of a good
          man upon his death bed, being asked “What he was afraid of?” “I have
          labored,” saith he, “with all my strength to observe the commands of
          God; but since I am a man, I am ignorant whether my works are
          acceptable to God, since God judges in one manner, and I in another
          manner.” Let the consideration therefore of this attribute, make us
          join with Job in his resolution (Job ix. 21): “Though we were perfect,
          yet would we not know our own souls.” I would not stand up to plead
          any of my virtues before God. Let us, therefore, look after another
          righteousness, wherein the exact eye of the Divine omniscience, we are
          sure, can discern no stain or crookedness.

          God for this perfection! Do we not honor a man that is able to
          predict? do we not think it a great part of wisdom? Have not all
          nations regarded such a faculty as a character and a mark of divinity?
          There is something more ravishing in the knowledge of future things,
          both to the person that knows them, and the person that hears them,
          than there is in any other kind of knowledge; whence the greatest
          prophets have been accounted in the greatest veneration, and men have
          thought it a way to glory, to divine and predict. Hence it was that
          the devils and pagan oracles gained so much credit; upon this
          foundation were they established, and the enemies of mankind owned for
          a true God;—I say, from the prediction of future things, though their
          oracles were often ambiguous, many times false; yet those poor
          heathens framed many ingenious excuses to free their adored gods from
          the charge of falsity and imposture: and shall we not adore the true
          God, the God of Israel, the God blessed for ever, for this
          incommunicable property, whereby he flies above the wings of the wind,
          the understandings of men and cherubims?745 Consider how great it is
          to know the thoughts and intentions, and works of one man, from the
          beginning to the end of his life; to foreknow all these before the
          being of this man, when he was lodged afar off in the loins of his
          ancestors, yea, of Adam; how much greater is it to foreknow and know
          the thoughts and works of three or four men, of a whole village or
          neighborhood! It is greater still to know the imaginations and actions
          of such a multitude of men as are contained in London, Paris, or
          Constantinople; how much greater still to know the intentions and
          practices, the clandestine contrivances of so many millions that have,
          do, or shall swarm in all quarters of the world, every person of them
          having millions of thoughts, desires, designs, affections, and
          actions! Let this attribute, then, make the blessed God honorable in
          our eyes, and adorable in all our affections; especially since it is
          an excellency which hath so lately discovered itself, in bringing to
          light the hidden things of darkness, in opening, and in part
          confounding, the wicked devices of bloody men. Especially let us adore
          God for it, and admire it in God, since it is so necessary a
          perfection, that without it the goodness of God had been impotent, and
          could not have relieved us; for what help can a distressed person
          expect from a man of the sweetest disposition and the strongest arm,
          if the eyes which should discover the danger, and direct the defence
          and rescue, were closed up by blindness and darkness? Adore God for
          this wonderful perfection.

          low thoughts should we have of our own knowledge, and how humble ought
          we to be before God! There is nothing man is more apt to be proud of
          than his knowledge; it is a perfection he glories in; but if our own
          knowledge of the little outside and barks of things puffs us up, the
          consideration of the infiniteness of God’s knowledge should abate the
          tumor: as our beings are nothing in regard to the infiniteness of his
          essence, so our knowledge is nothing in regard of the vastness of his
          understanding. We have a spark of being, but nothing to the heat of
          the sun; we have a drop of knowledge, but nothing to the Divine ocean.
          What a vain thing is it for a shallow brook to boast of its streams
          before a sea, whose depths are unfathomable! As it is a vanity to brag
          of our strength, when we remember the power of God, and of our
          prudence, when we glance upon the wisdom of God, so it is no less a
          vanity to boast of our knowledge, when we think of the understanding
          and knowledge of God. How hard is it for us to know anything!746 Too
          much noise deafens us, and too much light dazzles us; too much
          distance alienates the object from us, and too much nearness bars up
          our sight from beholding it. When we think ourselves to be near the
          knowledge of a thing, as a ship to the haven, a puff of wind blows us
          away, and the object which we desired to know eternally flies from us;
          we burn with a desire of knowledge, and yet are oppressed with the
          darkness of ignorance; we spend our days more in dark Egypt, than in
          enlightened Goshen. In what narrow bounds is all the knowledge of the
          most intelligent persons included!747 How few understand the exact
          harmony of their own bodies, the nature of the life they have in
          common with other animals! Who understands the nature of his own
          faculties, how he knows, and how he wills; how the understanding
          proposeth, and how the will embraceth; how his spiritual soul is
          united to his material body; what the nature is of the operation of
          our spirits? Nay, who understands the nature of his own body, the
          offices of his senses, the motion of his members, how they come to
          obey the command of the will, and a thousand other things? What a
          vain, weak, and ignorant thing is man, when compared with God! yet
          there is not a greater pride to be found among devils, than among
          ignorant men, with a little, very little, flashy knowledge. Ignorant
          man is as proud as if he knew as God. As the consideration of God’s
          omniscience should render him honorable in our eyes, so it should
          render us vile in our own. God, because of his knowledge, is so far
          from disdaining his creatures, that his omniscience is a minister to
          his goodness. No knowledge that we are possessed of should make us
          swell with too high a conceit of ourselves, and a disdain of others.
          We have infinitely more of ignorance than knowledge. Let us therefore
          remember, in all our thoughts of God, that he is God, and we are men;
          and therefore ought to be humble, as becomes men, and ignorant and
          foolish men, to be; as weak creatures should lie low before an
          Almighty God, and impure creatures before a holy God, false creatures
          before a faithful God, finite creatures before an infinite God, so
          should ignorant creatures before an all‑knowing God. All God’s
          attributes teach admiring thoughts of God, and low thoughts of
          ourselves.

          Instruct. 8. It may inform us how much this attribute is injured in
          the world. The first error after Adam’s eating the forbidden fruit was
          the denial of this, as well as the omnipresence of God, (Gen. iii.
          10,) “I heard thy voice in the garden, and I hid myself;” as if the
          thickness of the trees could screen him from the eye of his Creator.
          And after Cain’s murder, this is the first perfection he affronts,
          (Gen. iv. 9), “Where is Abel, thy brother?” saith God. How roundly
          doth he answer, “I know not!” as if God were as weak as man, to be put
          off with a lie. Man doth as naturally hate this perfection as much as
          he cannot naturally but acknowledge it; he wishes God stripped of this
          eminency, that he might be incapable to be an inspector of his crimes,
          and a searcher of the closets of his heart. In wishing him deprived of
          this, there is a hatred of God himself; for it is a loathing an
          essential property of God, without which he would be a pitiful
          Governor of the world. What a kind of God should that be, of a
          sinner’s wishing, that had wanted eyes to see a crime, and
          righteousness to punish it! The want of the consideration of this
          attribute, is the cause of all sin in the world (Hos. vii. 2), “They
          consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness;”
          they speak not to their hearts, or make any reflection upon the
          infiniteness of my knowledge; it is a high contempt of God, as if he
          were an idol, a senseless stock or stone; in all evil practices this
          is denied. We know God sees all things, yet we live and walk as if he
          knew nothing. We call him omniscient, and live as if he were ignorant;
          we say he is all eye, yet act as if he were wholly blind.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, this attribute is injured, by invading the peculiar
          rights of it, by presuming on it, and by a practical denial of it.
          First, By invading the peculiar rights of it. 1. By invocation of
          creatures. Praying to saints, by the Romanists, is a disparagement to
          this divine excellency; he that knows all things, is only fit to have
          the petitions of men presented to him; prayer supposeth an omniscient
          Being, as the object of it; no other being but God ought to have that
          honor acknowledged to it; no understanding but his is infinite; no
          other presence but his is everywhere; to implore any deceased creature
          for a supply of our wants, is to own in them a property of the Deity,
          and make them deities that were but men; and increase their glory by a
          diminution of God’s honor, in ascribing that perfection to creatures
          which belongs only to God. Alas! they are so far from understanding
          the desires of our souls, that they know not the words of our lips: it
          is against reason to address our supplications to them that neither
          understand us nor discern us (Isa. lxiii. 16), “Abraham is ignorant of
          us, and Israel acknowledges us not.” The Jews never called upon
          Abraham, though the covenant was made with him for the whole seed; not
          one departed saint for the whole four thousand years, between the
          creation of the world, and the coming of Christ, was ever prayed to by
          the Israelites, or ever imagined to have a share in God’s omniscience:
          so that to pray to St. Peter, St. Paul, much less to St. Roch, St.
          Swithin, St. Martin, St. Francis, &amp;c. is such a superstition, that
          hath no footing in the Scripture. To desire the prayers of the living,
          with whom we have a communion, who can understand and grant our
          desires, is founded upon a mutual charity; but to implore persons that
          are absent, at a great distance from us, with whom we have not, nor
          know how to have, any commerce, supposeth them, in their departure, to
          have put off humanity, and commenced gods, and endued with some part
          of the Divinity to understand our petitions; we are, indeed, to
          cherish their memories, consider their examples, imitate their graces,
          and observe their doctrines; we are to follow them as saints, but not
          elevate them as gods, in ascribing to them such a knowledge, which is
          the only necessary right of their and our common Creator.748 As the
          invocation of saints mingles them with Christ, in the exercise of his
          office, so it sets them equal with God in the throne of his
          omniscience, as if they had as much credit with God as Christ, by way
          of mediation, and as much knowledge of men’s affairs as God himself.
          Omniscience is peculiar to God, and incommunicable to any creature; it
          is the foundation of all religion, and therefore one of the choicest
          acts of it; viz. prayer and invocation. To direct our vows and
          petitions to any one else, is to invade the peculiarity of this
          perfection in God, and to rank some creatures in a partnership with
          him in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This attribute is injured by curiosity of knowledge; especially of
          future things, which God hath not discovered in natural causes, or
          supernatural revelation. It is a common error of men’s spirits to
          aspire to know what God would have hidden, and to pry into Divine
          secrets; and many men are more willing to remain without the knowledge
          of those things which may, with a little industry, be attained, than
          be divested of the curiosity of inquiring into those things which are
          above their reach; it is hence that some have laid aside the study of
          the common remedies of nature to find out the philosopher’s stone,
          which scarce any ever yet attempted but sunk in the enterprise.749
          From this inclination to know the most abstruse and difficult things,
          it is that the horrors of magic and vanities of astrology have sprung,
          whereby men have thought to find, in a commerce with devils and the
          jurisdiction of the stars, the events of their lives, and the disposal
          of states and kingdoms. Hence, also, arose those multitudes of ways of
          divination, invented among the heathen, and practised too commonly in
          these ages of the world. This is an invasion of God’s prerogative, to
          whom secret things belong (Deut. xxix. 29); “Secret things belong unto
          the Lord our God, but revealed things belong to us and our children.”
          It is an intolerable boldness to attempt to fathom those, the
          knowledge whereof God hath reserved to himself, and to search that
          which God will have to surpass our understandings, whereby we more
          truly envy God a knowledge superior to our own, than we, in Adam,
          imagined that he envied us. Ambition is the greatest cause of this;
          ambition to be accounted some great thing among men, by reason of a
          knowledge estranged from the common mass of mankind, but more
          especially that soaring pride to be equal with God, which lurks in our
          nature ever since the fall of our first parents: this is not yet laid
          aside by men, though it was the first thing that embroiled the world
          with the wrath of God. Some think a curiosity of knowledge was the
          cause of the fall of devils; I am sure it was the fall of Adam, and is
          yet the crime of his posterity; had he been contented to know what God
          had furnished him with, neither he nor his posterity had smarted under
          the venom of the serpent’s breath. All curious and bold inquiries into
          things not revealed are an attempt upon the throne of God, and are
          both sinful and pernicious, like to glaring upon the sun, where,
          instead of a greater acuteness, we meet with blindness, and too dearly
          buy our ignorance in attempting a superfluous knowledge. As God’s
          knowledge is destined to the government of the world, so should ours
          be to the advantage of the world, and not degenerate into vain
          speculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This attribute is injured by swearing by creatures. To swear by the
          name of God, in a righteous cause,750 when we are lawfully called to
          it by a superior power, or for the necessary decision of some
          controversy, for the ends of charity and justice, is an act of
          religion, and a part of worship, founded upon, and directed to, the
          honor of this attribute; by it we acknowledge the glory of his
          infallible knowledge of all things; but to swear by false gods, or by
          any creature, is blasphemous; it sets the creature in the place of
          God, and invests it in that which is the peculiar honor of the
          Divinity; for when any swear truly, they intend the invocation of an
          infallible Witness, and the bringing an undoubted testimony for what
          they do assert: while, any, therefore, swear by a creature, or a false
          god, they profess that that creature, or that which they esteem to be
          a god, is an infallible witness, which to be is only the right of God;
          they attribute to the creature that which is the property of God
          alone, to know the heart, and to be a witness whether they speak true
          or no: and this was accounted, by all nations, the true design of an
          oath. As to swear falsely is a plain denial of the all‑knowledge of
          God, so to swear by any creature is to set the creature upon the
          throne of God, in ascribing that perfection to the creature which
          sovereignly belongs to the Creator; for it is not in the power of any
          to witness to the truth of the heart, but of him that is the searcher
          of hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We sin against this attribute by censuring the hearts of others. An
          open crime, indeed, falls under our cognizance, and therefore under
          our judgment; for whatsoever falls under the authority of man to be
          punished, falls under the judgment of man to be censured, as an act
          contrary to the law of God; yet, when a censure is built upon the evil
          of the act which is obvious to the view, if we take a step farther to
          judge the heart and state, we leave the revealed rule of the law, and
          ambitiously erect a tribunal equal with God’s, and usurp a judicial
          power, pertaining only to the Supreme Governor of the world, and
          consequently pretend to be possessed of the perfection of omniscience,
          which is necessary to render him capable of the exercise of that
          sovereign authority: for it is in respect of his dominion that God
          hath the supreme right to judge; and in respect of his knowledge that
          he hath an incommunicable capacity to judge. In an action that is
          doubtful, the good or evil whereof depends only upon God’s
          determination, and wherein much of the judgment depends upon the
          discerning the intention of the agent, we cannot judge any man without
          a manifest invasion of God’s peculiar right: such actions are to be
          tried by God’s knowledge, not by our surmises; God only is the master
          in such cases, to whom a person stands or falls (Rom. xiv. 4). ’Till
          the true principle and ends of an action be known by the confession of
          the party acting it, a true judgment of it is not in our power.
          Principles and ends lie deep and hid from us; and it is intolerable
          pride to pretend to have a joint key with God to open that cabinet
          which he hath reserved to himself. Besides the violation of the rule
          of charity in misconstruing actions which may be great and generous in
          their root and principle, we invade God’s right, as if our ungrounded
          imaginations and conjectures were in joint commission with this
          sovereign perfection; and thereby we become usurping judges of evil
          thoughts (James ii. 4). It is, therefore, a boldness worthy to be
          punished by the judge, to assume to ourselves the capacity and
          authority of him who is the only Judge: for as the execution of the
          Divine law, for the inward violation of it, belongs only to God, so is
          the right of judging a prerogative belonging only to his omniscience;
          his right is, therefore, invaded, if we pretend to a knowledge of it.
          This humor of men the apostle checks, when he saith (1 Cor. iv. 5),
          “He that judgeth me is the Lord; therefore judge nothing before the
          time, until the Lord come, who will manifest the counsels of all
          hearts.” It is not the time yet for God to erect the tribunal for the
          trial of men’s hearts, and the principles of their actions; he hath
          reserved the glorious discovery of this attribute for another season:
          we must not, therefore, presume to judge of the counsels of men’s
          hearts till God hath revealed them by opening the treasures of his own
          knowledge; much less are we to judge any man’s final condition.
          Manasseh may sacrifice to devils, and unconverted Paul tear the church
          in pieces; but God had mercy on them, and called them. The actions may
          be censured, not the state, for we know not whom God may call. In
          censuring men, we may doubly imitate the devil, in a false accusation
          of the brethren, as well as in an ambitious usurpation of the rights
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, This perfection is injured by presuming upon it, or making
          an ill use of it. As in the neglect of prayer for the supply of men’s
          wants, because God knows them already, so that that which is an
          encouragement to prayer, they make the reason of restraining it before
          God. Prayer is not to administer knowledge to God, but to acknowledge
          this admirable perfection of the Divine nature. If God did not know,
          there were indeed no use of prayer; it would be as vain a thing to
          send up our prayers to heaven, as to implore the senseless statue, or
          picture of a prince, for a protection. We pray because God knows: for
          though he knows our wants with a knowledge of vision, yet he will not
          know them with a knowledge of supply, till he be sought unto (Matt.
          vi. 32, 33; vii. 11.) All the excellencies of God are ground of
          adoration; and this excellency is the ground of that part of worship
          we call prayer. If God be to be worshipped, he is to be called upon:
          invocations of his name in our necessities is a chief act of worship;
          whence the temple, the place of solemn worship, was not called the
          house of sacrifice, but the house of prayer. Prayer was not appointed
          for God’s information, as if he were ignorant, but for the expression
          of our desires; not to furnish him with a knowledge of what we want,
          but to manifest to him, by some rational sign convenient to our
          nature, our sense of that want, which he knows by himself. So that
          prayer is not designed to acquaint God with our wants, but to express
          the desire of a remedy of our wants. God knows our wants, but hath not
          made promises barely to our wants, but to our asking, that his
          omniscience in hearing, as well as his sufficiency in supplying, may
          have a sensible honor in our acknowledgments and receipts. It is
          therefore an ill use of this excellency of God to neglect prayer to
          him as needless, because he knows already.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. This perfection of God is wronged by a practical denial of
          it. It is the language of every sin, and so God takes it when he comes
          to reckon with men for their impieties. Upon this he charges the
          greatness of the iniquity of Israel, the overflowing of blood in the
          land, and the perverseness of the city: “They say, the Lord hath
          forsaken the earth, and the Lord sees not” (Ezek. ix. 9): they deny
          his eyes to see, and his resolution to punish.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It will appear, in forbearing sin from a sense of man’s knowledge,
          not of God’s. Open impieties are refrained because of the eye of man,
          but secret sins are not checked because of the eye of God. Wickedness
          is committed in darkness, that is restrained in light, as if darkness
          were as great a clog to God’s eyes as it is to ours; as though his
          eyes were muffled with the curtains of the night (Job xxii. 14.) This,
          it is likely, was at the root of Jonah’s flight; he might have some
          secret thought that his Master’s eye could not follow him, as though
          the close hatches of a ship could secure him from the knowledge of
          God, as well as the sides of a ship could from the dashing of the
          waves. What lies most upon the conscience when it is graciously
          wounded, is least regarded or contemned when it is basely inclined.
          David’s heart smote him not only for his sin in the gross, but as
          particularly cirumstantiated by the commission of it in the sight of
          God (Ps. li. 4): “Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this
          evil in thy sight.” None knew the reason of Uriah’s death but myself,
          and because others knew it not, I neglected any regard to this Divine
          eye. When Jacob’s sons used their brother Joseph so barbarously, they
          took care to hide it from their father, but cast away all thoughts of
          God, from whom it could not be concealed. Doth not the presence of a
          child bridle a man from the act of a longed‑for sin, when the eye of
          God is of no force to restrain him, as if God’s knowledge were of less
          value than the sight of a little boy or girl, as if a child only could
          see, and God were blind? He that will forbear an unworthy action for
          fear of an informer, will not forbear it for God; as if God’s
          omniscience were not as full an intelligencer to him, as man can be an
          informer to a magistrate. As we acknowledge the power of men seeing us
          when we are ashamed to commit a filthy action in their view, so we
          discover the power of God seeing us, when we regard not what we do
          before the light of his eyes. Secret sins are more against God than
          open: open sins are against the law; secret sins are against the law,
          and this prime perfection of his nature. The majesty of God is not
          only violated, but the omniscience of God disowned, who is the only
          witness; we must, in all of them, either imagine him to be without
          eyes to behold us, or without an arm of justice to punish us. And
          often it is, I believe, in such cases, that if any thoughts of God’s
          knowledge strike upon men, they quickly damp them, lest they should
          begin to know what they fear, and fear that they might not eat their
          pleasant sinful morsels.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It appears in partial confessions of sin before God. As by a free,
          full, and ingenious confession, we offer a due glory to this
          attribute, so by a feigned and curtailed confession, we deny him the
          honor of it: for, though by any confession we in part own him to be a
          Sovereign and Judge, yet by a half and pared acknowledgment, we own
          him to be no more than a humane and ignorant one. Achan’s full
          confession gave God the glory of his omniscience, manifested in the
          discovery of his secret crime. “And Joshua said unto Achan, My son,
          give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make
          confession unto him” (Joshua vii. 19). And so (Ps. l. 23): “Whoso
          offereth praise glorifieth me,” or confession, as the word signifieth,
          in which sense I would rather take it, referring to this attribute,
          which God seems to tax sinners with the denial of (ver. 21), telling
          them that he would open the records of their sins before them, and
          indict them particularly for every one. If, therefore, you would
          glorify this attribute, which shall one day break open your
          consciences, offer to me a sincere confession. When David speaks of
          the happiness of a pardoned man, he adds, “in whose spirit there is no
          guile,”751 not meaning a sincerity in general, but an ingenuity in
          confessing. To excuse, or extenuate sin, is to deny God the knowledge
          of the depths of our deceitful hearts: when we will mince it rather
          than aggravate it; lay it upon the inducements of others, when it was
          the free act of our own wills, study shifts to deceive our Judge; this
          is to speak lies of him, as the expression is (Hos. vii. 13), as
          though he were a God easy to be cheated, and knew no more than we were
          willing to declare. What did Saul’s transferring his sin from himself
          to the people (1 Sam. xv. 15), but charge God with a defect in this
          attribute? When man could not be like God, in his knowledge, he would
          fancy a God like to him in his ignorance, and imagine a possibility of
          hiding himself from his knowledge. And all men tread, more or less, in
          their father’s steps, and are fruitful to devise distinctions to
          disguise errors in doctrine, and excuses to palliate errors in
          practice: this crime Job removes from himself, when he speaks of
          several acts of his sincerity (Job xxxi. 33): “If I covered my
          transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:” I hid not
          any of my sins in my own conscience, but acknowledged God a witness to
          them, and gave him the glory of his knowledge by a free confession. I
          did not conceal it from God as Adam did, or as men ordinarily do; as
          if God could understand no more of their secret crimes than they will
          let him, and had no more sense of their faults than they would furnish
          him with. As the first rise of confession is the owning of this
          attribute (for the justice of God would not scare men, nor the
          holiness of God awe them, without a sense of his knowledge of their
          iniquities), so to drop out some fragments of confession, discover
          some sins, and conceal others, is a plain denial of the extensiveness
          of the Divine knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is discovered by putting God off with an outside worship. Men
          are often flatterers of God, and think to bend him by formal glavering
          devotions, without the concurrence of their hearts; as though he could
          not pierce into the darkness of the mind, but did as little know us as
          one man knows another. There are such things as feigned lips (Ps.
          xvii. 1), a contradiction between the heart and the tongue, a clamor
          in the voice, and scoffing in the soul; a crying out to God, thou art
          my Father, the guide of my youth, and yet speaking and doing evil to
          the utmost of our power (Jer. iii. 4, 5). As if God could be imposed
          upon by fawning pretences; and like old Isaac, take Jacob for Esau,
          and be cozened by the smell of his garments: as if he could not
          discern the negro heart under an angel’s garb. Thus Ephraim, the ten
          tribes, apostatized from the true religion, would go with their flocks
          and their herds to seek the Lord (Hos. v. 6), would sacrifice
          multitudes of sheep and heifers, which was the main outside of the
          Jewish religion; only with their flocks and their herds, not with
          their hearts, with those inward qualifications of deep humiliation and
          repentance for sin; as though outside appearances limited God’s
          observation, whereas God had told them before (ver. 3), that he “knew
          Ephraim, and Israel was not hid from him.” Thus to do is to put a
          cheat upon God, and think to blind his all‑seeing eye, and therefore
          it is called deceit (Ps. lxxviii. 36). They did flatter him with their
          mouths. The word פתה signifies to deceive, as well as to flatter; not
          that they, or any else, can deceive God, but it implies an endeavor to
          deceive him, by a few dissembling words and gestures, or an
          imagination that God was satisfied with bare professions, and would
          not concern himself in a further inquisition. This is an unworthy
          conceit of God, to fancy that we can satisfy for inward sins, and
          avert approaching judgments, by external offerings, by a loud voice
          with a false heart, as if God (like children) would be pleased with
          the glittering of an empty shell, or the rattling of stones, the
          chinkling of money, a mere voice and crying, without inward frames and
          intentions of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In cherishing multitudes of evil thoughts. No man but would blush
          for shame, if the base, impure, slovenly thoughts, either in or out of
          duties of worship, were visible to the understanding of man; how
          diligent would he be to curb his luxuriant and unworthy fancies, as
          well as bite in his words! but when we give the reins to the motions
          of our hearts, and suffer them to run at random without a curb, it is
          an evidence we are not concerned for their falling under the notice of
          the eye of God; and it argues a very weak belief of this perfection,
          or scarce any belief at all. Who can think any man’s heart, possessed
          with a sense of this infinite excellency, that suffers his mind, in
          his meditations on God, to wander into every sty, and be picking up
          stones upon a dunghill? What doth it intimate, but that those thoughts
          are as invisible, or unaudible to God, as they are to men without the
          garments of words?752 When a man thinks of obscene things, his own
          natural notions, if revived, would tell him that God discerns what he
          thinks, that the depths of his heart are open to him: and the voice of
          those notions are—deface those vain imaginations out of your minds.
          But what is done? Men cast away rational light, muster up conceits
          that God sees them not, knows them not, and so sink into the puddle of
          their sordid imaginations, as though they remained in darkness to God.
          I might further instance. In omissions of prayer, which arise
          sometimes from a flat atheism: who will call upon a God, that believes
          no such Being? or from partial atheism, either a denial of God’s
          sufficiency to help, or of his omniscience to know, as if God were
          like the statue of Jupiter in Crete, framed without ears. In the
          hypocritical pretences of men, to exempt them from the service God
          calls them to. When men pretend one thing and intend another: this
          lurks in the veins sometimes of the best men; sometimes it ariseth
          from the fear of man; when men are more afraid of the power of man,
          than of dissembling with the Almighty, it will pretend a virtue to
          cover a secret wile, and choose the tongue of the crafty as the
          expression in Job (ch. xv. 5). The case is plain in Moses, who, when
          ordered to undertake an eminent service, pretends a want of eloquence,
          and an ungrateful “slowness of speech” (Exod. iv. 10). This generous
          soul, that before was not afraid to discover himself in the midst of
          Egypt for his countrymen, answers sneakingly to God, and would veil
          his carnal fear with a pretence of insufficiency and humility; “Who am
          I, that I should go unto Pharaoh” (Exod. iii. 11)? He could not well
          allege an inability to go to Pharaoh, since he had had an education in
          the Egyptian learning, which rendered him capable to appear at court.
          God at last uncaseth him, and shews it all to be a dissimulation, and
          whatsoever was the pretence, fear lay at the bottom. He was afraid of
          his life upon his appearance before Pharaoh, from whose face he had
          fled upon the slaying the Egyptians; which God intimates to him (Exod.
          iv. 19), “Go, and return into Egypt, for all the men are dead which
          sought thy life.” What doth this carriage speak, but as if God’s eye
          were not upon our inward parts, as though we could lock him out of our
          hearts, that cannot be shut out from any creek of the hearts of men
          and angels?
        </p>
        <p>
          Use II. is of comfort. It is a ground of great comfort under the
          present dispensation wherein we are; we have heard the doctrinal part,
          and God hath given us the experimental part of it in his special
          providence this day, upon the stage of the world.753 And, blessed be
          God, that he hath given us a ground of comfort, without going out of
          our ordinary course to fetch it, whereby it seems to be peculiarly of
          God’s ordering for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a comfort in all the clandestine contrivances of men against
          the church. His eyes pierce as far as the depths of hell. Not one of
          his church’s adversaries lies in a mist; all are as plain as the stars
          which he numbers: “Mine adversaries are all before thee” (Ps. lxix.
          19), more exactly known to thee than I can recount them. It is a
          prophecy of Christ, wherein Christ is brought in speaking to God of
          his own and the church’s enemies: he comforts himself with this, that
          God hath his eye upon every particular person among his adversaries:
          he knows where they repose themselves, when they go out to consult,
          and when they come in with their resolves. He discerns all the rage
          that spirits their hearts, in what corner it lurks, how it acts; all
          the disorders, motions of it, and every object of that rage; he cannot
          be deceived by the closest and subtlest person. Thus God speaks
          concerning Sennacherib and his host against Jerusalem (Isa. xxxvii.
          28, 29). After he had spoke of the forming of his church, and the
          weakness of it, he adds, “But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and
          thy coming in, and thy rage against me. Because thy rage against me,
          and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my
          hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee
          back,” &amp;c. He knows all the methods of the counsels, the stages
          they had laid, the manner of the execution of their designs, all the
          ways whither they turned themselves, and would use them no better than
          men do devouring fish and untamed beasts, with a hook in the nose, and
          a bridle in the mouth. Those statesmen (in Isa. xxix. 15) thought
          their contrivances too deep for God to fathom, and too close for God
          to frustrate; “they seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord;
          surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the
          potter’s clay,” of no more force and understanding than a potter’s
          vessel, which understands not its own form wrought by the artificer,
          nor the use it is put to by the buyer and possessor; or shall be
          esteemed as a potter’s vessel, that can be as easily flung back into
          the mass from whence it was taken, as preserved in the figure it is
          now endued with. No secret designer is shrouded from God’s sight, or
          can be sheltered from God’s arm; he understands the venom of their
          hearts better than we can feel it, and discovers their inward fury
          more plainly than we can see the sting or teeth of a viper when they
          are opened for mischief; and to what purpose doth God know and see
          them, but in order to deliver his people from them in his own due
          time? “I know their sorrow, and am come down to deliver them” (Exod.
          iii. 7, 8). The walls of Jerusalem are continually before him; he
          knows, therefore, all that would undermine and demolish them; none can
          hurt Zion by any ignorance or inadvertency in God. It is observable,
          that our Saviour, assuming to himself a different title in every
          epistle to the seven churches, doth particularly ascribe to himself
          this of knowledge and wrath in that to Thyatira, an emblem or
          description of the Romish state (Rev. ii. 18): “And unto the angel of
          the church of Thyatira write, These things, saith the Son of God, who
          hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass.” His
          eyes, like a flame of fire, are of a piercing nature, insinuating
          themselves into all the pores and parts of the body they encounter
          with, and his feet like brass, to crush them with, is explained (ver.
          23), “I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall
          know that I am he which searches the reins and the heart, and I will
          give to every one of you according to your works.” He knows every
          design of the Romish party, designed by that church of Thyatira.754
          Jezebel, there, signifies a whorish church; such a church as shall act
          as Jezebel, Ahab’s wife, who was not only a worshipper of idols, but
          propagated idolatry in Israel, slew the prophets, persecuted Elijah,
          murdered Naboth, the name whereof signifies prophecy, seized upon his
          possession. And if it be said that (ver. 19) this church was commended
          for her works, faith, patience, it is true Rome did at first strongly
          profess Christianity, and maintained the interest of it, but
          afterwards fell into the practice of Jezebel, and committed spiritual
          adultery: and is she to be owned for a wife, that now plays the
          harlot, because she was honest and modest at her first marriage? And
          though she shall be destroyed, yet not speedily (ver. 22); “I will
          cast her into a bed,” seems to intimate the destruction of Jezebel,
          not to be at once and speedily, but in a lingering way, and by
          degrees, as sickness consumes a body.755
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This perfection of God fits him to be a special object of trust. If
          he were forgetful, what comfort could we have in any promise? How
          could we depend upon him, if he were ignorant of our state? His
          compassion to pity us, his readiness to relieve us, his power to
          protect and assist us, would be insignificant, without his omniscience
          to inform his goodness, and direct the arm of his power. This
          perfection is, as it were, God’s office of intelligence: as you go to
          your memorandum‑book to know what you are to do, so doth God to his
          omniscience; this perfection is God’s eye, to acquaint him with the
          necessities of his church, and directs all his other attributes in
          their exercise for and about his people. You may depend upon his mercy
          that hath promised, and upon his truth to perform; upon his
          sufficiency to supply you, and his goodness to relieve you, and his
          righteousness to reward you; because he hath an infinite understanding
          to know you and your wants, you and your services. And without this
          knowledge of his, no comfort could be drawn from any other perfection;
          none of them could be a sure nail to hang our hopes and confidence
          upon. This is that the church alway celebrated (Ps. cv. 7): “He hath
          remembered his covenant forever, and the word which he hath commanded
          to a thousand generations;” and (ver. 42), “He remembered his holy
          promise;” “And he remembered for them his covenant” (Ps. cvi. 45). He
          remembers and understands his covenant, therefore his promise to
          perform it, and therefore our wants to supply them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And the rather, because God knows the persons of all his own. He
          hath in his infinite understanding, the exact number of all the
          individual persons that belong to him (2 Tim. ii. 19): “The Lord knows
          them that are his.” He knows all things, because he hath created them;
          and he knows his people because he hath not only made them, but also
          chose them; he could no more choose he knew not what, than he could
          create he knew not what; and he knows them under a double title; of
          creation as creatures, in the common mass of creation; as new
          creatures by a particular act of separation. He cannot be ignorant of
          them in time, whom he foreknew from eternity; his knowledge in time is
          the same he had from eternity; he foreknew them that he intended to
          give the grace of faith unto; and he knows them after they believe,
          because he knows his own act, in bestowing grace upon them, and his
          own mark and seal wherewith he hath stamped them. No doubt but he that
          “calls the stars of heaven by their names” (Ps. clxvii. 4), knows the
          number of those living stars that sparkle in the firmament of his
          church. He cannot be ignorant of their persons, when he numbers the
          hairs of their heads, and hath registered their names in the book of
          life. As he only had an infinite mercy to make the choice, so he only
          hath an infinite understanding to comprehend their persons. We only
          know the elect of God by a moral assurance in the judgment of charity,
          when the conversation of men is according to the doctrine of God. We
          have not an infallible knowledge of them, we may be often mistaken;
          Judas, a devil, may be judged by man for a saint, till he be stripped
          of his disguise. God only hath an infallible knowledge of them, he
          knows his own records, and the counterparts in the hearts of his
          people; none can counterfeit his seal, nor can any rase it out. When
          the church is either scattered like dust by persecution, or overgrown
          with superstition and idolatry, that there is scarce any grain of true
          religion appearing, as in the time of Elijah, who complained that he
          was left alone, as if the church had been rooted out of that corner of
          the world (1 Kings xix. 14, 18); yet God knew that he had a number fed
          in a cave, and had reserved seven thousand men that had preserved the
          purity of his worship, and not bowed their knee to Baal.756 Christ
          knew his sheep, as well as he is known of them; yea, better than they
          can know him (John x. 14). History acquaints us, that Cyrus had so
          vast a memory, that he knew the name of every particular soldier in
          his army, which consisted of divers nations; shall it be too hard for
          an infinite understanding to know every one of that host that march
          under his banners? may he not as well know them, as know the number,
          qualities, influences, of those stars which lie concealed from our
          eye, as well as those that are visible to our sense? Yes, he knows
          them, as a general to employ them, as a shepherd to preserve them; he
          knows them in the world to guard them, and he knows them when they are
          out of the world to gather them, and cull out their bodies, though
          wrapped up in a cloud of the putrified carcases of the wicked. As he
          knew them from all eternity to elect them, so he knows them in time to
          clothe their persons with righteousness, to protect their persons in
          calamity, according to his good pleasure, and at last to raise and
          reward them according to his promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We may take comfort from hence, that our sincerity cannot be
          unknown to an infinite understanding. Not a way of the righteous is
          concealed from him, and, therefore, “they shall stand in judgment
          before him” (Ps. i. 6): “The Lord knows the way of the righteous;” he
          knows them to observe them, and he knows them to reward them. How
          comfortable is it to appeal to this attribute of God for our
          integrity, with Hezekiah (2 Kings xx. 3)! “Remember, Lord, how I have
          walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.” Christ himself
          is brought in in this prophetical psalm, drawing out the comfort of
          this attribute (Ps. xl. 9): “I have not restrained my lips, O Lord,
          thou knowest;” meaning his faithfulness in declaring the righteousness
          of God. Job follows the same steps, “Also now behold, my record is in
          heaven, and my witness is on high” (Job xvi. 19); my innocence hath
          the testimony of men, but my greatest support is in the records of
          God. Also now, or, besides the testimony of my own heart, I have
          another witness in heaven, that knows the heart, and can only judge of
          the principles of my actions, and clear me from the scorns of my
          friends and the accusations of men, with a justification of my
          innocence; he repeats it twice, to take the greater comfort in it. God
          knows that we do that in the simplicity of our hearts, which may be
          judged by men to be done for unworthy and sordid ends: he knows not
          only the outward action, but the inward affection, and praises that
          which men often dispraise, and writes down that with an Euge! “Well
          done, good and faithful servant,” which men daub with their severest
          censures (Rom. ii. 29). How refreshing is it to consider, that God
          never mistakes the appearance for reality, nor is led by the judgment
          of man! He sits in heaven, and laughs at their follies and censures.
          If God had no sounder and no more piercing a judgment than man, woe be
          to the sincerest souls that are often judged hypocrites by some. What
          a happiness is it for integrity to have a judge of infinite
          understanding, who will one day wipe off the dirt of worldly
          reproaches! Again, God knows the least dram of grace and righteousness
          in the hearts of his people, though but as a smoking flax, or the
          least bruise of a saving conviction (Matt. xii. 20), and knows it so
          as to cherish it; he knows that work he hath begun, and never hath his
          eye off from it to abandon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The consideration of this excellent perfection in God may comfort
          us in our secret prayers, sighs, and works. If God were not of
          infinite understanding to pierce into the heart, what comfort hath a
          poor creature that hath a scantiness of expressions but a heart in a
          flame? If God did not understand the heart, faith and prayer, which
          are eternal works, would be in vain. How could he give that mercy our
          hearts plead for if he were ignorant of our inward affections?
          Hypocrites might scale heaven by lofty expressions, and a sincere soul
          come short of the happiness he is prepared for, for want of
          flourishing gifts. Prayer is an eternal work; words are but the
          garment of prayer; meditation is the body, and affection the soul and
          life of prayer; “Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation”
          (Ps. v. 1). Prayer is a rational act; an act of the mind, not the act
          of a parrot: prayer is an act of the heart, though the speaking prayer
          is the work of the tongue; now God gives ear to the words, but he
          considers the meditation of the frame of the heart. Consideration is a
          more exact notice than hearing; the act only of the ear. Were not God
          of an infinite understanding, and omniscient, he might take fine
          clothes, a heap of garments, for the man himself, and be put off by
          glittering words, without a spiritual frame. What matter of rejoicing
          is it that we call not upon a deaf and ignorant idol, but on one that
          listens to our secret petitions, to give them a dispatch, that knows
          our desires afar off, and from the infiniteness of his mercy, joined
          with his omniscience, stands ready to give us a return? Hath he not a
          book of remembrance for them that fear him, and for their sighs and
          ejaculations to him, as well as their discourses of him, (Mal. iii.
          16); and not only what prayers they utter, but what gracious and holy
          thoughts they have of him that thought upon his name? Though millions
          of supplications be put up at the same time, yet they have all a
          distinct file (as I may say) in an infinite understanding, which
          perceives and comprehends them all. As he observes millions of sins
          committed at the same time, by a vast number of persons, to record
          them in order to punishment, so he distinctly discerns an infinite
          number of cries, at the same moment, to register them in order to an
          answer. A sigh cannot escape an infinite understanding, though crowded
          among a mighty multitude of cries from others, or covered with many
          unwelcome distractions in ourselves, no more than a believing touch
          from the woman that had the bloody issue could be concealed from
          Christ, and be undiscerned from the press of the thronging multitudes:
          our groans are as audible and intelligible to him as our words, and he
          knows what is the mind of his own Spirit, though expressed in no
          plainer language than sobs and heavings (Rom. viii. 27). Thus David
          cheers up himself under the neglects of his friends (Ps. xxxviii. 9);
          “Lord, my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from
          thee.” Not a groan of a panting spirit shall be lost, till God hath
          lost his knowledge; not a petition forgotten while God hath a record,
          nor a tear dried while God hath a bottle to reserve it in (Ps. lvi.
          8). Our secret works are also known and observed by him; not only our
          outward labor, but our inward love in it (Heb. vi. 10). If, with
          Isaac, we go privately into the field to meditate, or secretly “cast
          our bread upon the waters,” he keeps his eye upon us to reward us, and
          returns the fruit into our own bosoms (Matt. vi. 4, 6); yea, though it
          be but a cup of cold water, from an inward spring of love, given to a
          disciple, “He sees your works, and your labor, and faith, and
          patience” in working them (Rev. ii. 2); all the marks of your
          industry, and strength of your intentions, and will be as exact at
          last, in order to a due praise, as to open sins, in order to a just
          recompense (1 Cor. iv. 5).

          6. The consideration of this excellent attribute affords comfort in
          the afflictions of good men. He knows their pressures, as well as
          hears their cries (Exod. iii. 7). His knowledge comes not by
          information from us; but his compassionate listening to our cries
          springs from his own inspection into our sorrows; he is affected with
          them, before we make any discovery of them; he is not ignorant of the
          best season, when they may be usefully inflicted, and when they may be
          profitably removed. The tribulation and poverty of his church is not
          unknown to him (Rev. ii. 8, 9); “I know thy works and tribulation,”
          &amp;c. He knows their works, and what tribulation they meet with for
          him; he sees their extremities, when they are toiling against the wind
          and tide of the world (Mark vi. 48); yea, the natural exigencies of
          the multitude are not neglected by him; he discerns to take care of
          them. Our Saviour considered the three days’ fasting of his followers,
          and miraculously provides a dish for them in the wilderness. No good
          man is ever out of God’s mind, and therefore never out of his
          compassionate care: his eye pierceth into their dungeons, and pities
          their miseries. Joseph may forget his brethren, and the disciples not
          know Christ, when he walks upon the midnight waves and turbulent
          sea,757 but a lion’s den cannot obscure a Daniel from his sight, nor
          the depths of the whale’s belly bury Jonah from the Divine
          understanding: he discerns Peter in his chains, and Stephen under the
          stones of martyrdom; he knows Lazarus under his tattered rags, and
          Abel wallowing in his blood; his eye and knowledge goes along with his
          people, when they are transplanted into foreign countries, and sold
          for slaves into the islands of the Grecians, “for he will raise them
          out of the place” (Joel iii. 6, 7). He would defeat the hopes of the
          persecutors, and applaud the patience of his people. He knows his
          people in the tabernacle of life, and in the valley of the shadow of
          death (Ps. xxiii). He knows all penal evils, because he commissions
          and directs them. He knows the instruments, because they are his sword
          (Ps. xvii. 13); and he knows his gracious sufferer because he hath his
          mark. He discerns Job in his anguish, and the devil in his malice. By
          the direction of this attribute he orders calamities, and rescues from
          them. “Thou hast seen it, for thou beholdest mischief and spite” (Ps.
          x. 14). That is the comfort of the psalmist, and the comfort of every
          believer, and the ground of committing themselves to God under all the
          injustice of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. It is a comfort in all our infirmities. As he knows our sins to
          charge them, so he knows the weakness of our nature to pity us. As his
          infinite understanding may scare us, because he knows our
          transgressions, so it may relieve us, because he knows our natural
          mutability in our first creation; “he knows our frame, he remembers
          that we are dust” (Ps. ciii. 14). ’Tis the reason of the precedent
          verses why he removes our transgression from us, why he is so backward
          in punishing, so patient in waiting, so forward in pitying; Why? He
          doth not only remember our sins, but remember our frame of forming;
          what brittle, though clear glasses we were by creation, how easy to be
          cracked! He remembers our impotent and weak condition by corruption;
          what a sink we have of vain imaginations that remain in us after
          regeneration; he doth not only consider that we were made according to
          his image, and therefore able to stand, but that we were made of dust
          and weak matter, and had a sensitive soul, like that of beasts, as
          well as an intellectual nature, like that of angels, and therefore
          liable to follow the dictates of it, without exact care and
          watchfulness. If he remembered only the first, there would be no issue
          but indignation; but the consideration of the latter moves his
          compassion. How miserable should we be for want of this perfection in
          the Divine nature, whereby God remembers and reflects upon his past
          act in our first frame, and the mindfulness of our condition excites
          the motion of his bowels to us! Had he lost the knowledge how he first
          framed us, did he not still remember the mutability of our nature, as
          we were formed and stamped in his mint, how much more wretched would
          our condition be than it is! If his remembrance of our original be one
          ground of his pity, the sense of his omniscience should be a ground of
          our comfort in the stirring of our infirmities: he remembers we were
          but dust when he made us, and yet remembers we are but dust while he
          preserves and forbears us.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. It is some comfort in the fears of some lurking corruption in our
          hearts. We know by this whither to address ourselves for the search
          and discovery of it: perhaps some blessings we want are retarded; some
          calamities we understand not the particular cause of, are inflicted;
          some petitions we have put up, hang too long for an answer; and the
          chariot wheels of Divine goodness move slow, and are long in coming.
          Let us beg the aid of this attribute to open to us the remoras, to
          discover what base affection there is that retards the mercies we
          want, or attracts the affliction we feel, or bars the door against the
          return of our supplications. What our dim sight cannot discover, the
          clear eye of God can make visible to us (Job x. 2): “Show me wherefore
          thou contendest with me.” As in want of pardon, we particularly plead
          his mercy, and in our desires for the performance of his promise, we
          argue with him from his faithfulness, so in the fear of any
          insincerity or hidden corruption we should implore his omniscience:
          for as God is a God in covenant, our God, our God in the whole of his
          nature, so the perfections of his nature are employed in their several
          stations, as assistances of his creatures. This was David’s practice
          and comfort, after that large meditation, on the omniscience and
          omnipresence of God, he turns his thoughts of it into petitions for
          the employment of it in the concerns of his soul, and begs a mercy
          suitable to the glory of this perfection (Ps. cxxxix. 23): “Search me,
          O God, and try my heart, try me, and know my thoughts;” dive to the
          bottom (ver. 24), “and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
          me in the way everlasting.” His desire is not barely that God should
          know him, for it would be senseless to beg of God that he should have
          mercy, or faithfulness, or power, or knowledge in his nature; but he
          desires the exercise of this attribute, in the discovery of himself to
          himself, in order to his sight of any wicked way, and humiliation for
          it, and reformation of it, in order to his conduct to everlasting
          life. As we may appeal to this perfection to judge us when the
          sincerity of our actions is censured by others, so we may implore it
          to search us when our sincerity is questioned by ourselves, that our
          minds may be enlightened by a beam from his knowledge, and the little
          thieves may be pulled out of their dens in our hearts by the hand of
          his power. In particular, it is our comfort that we can, and our
          necessity that we must address particularly to this, when we engage
          solemnly in a work of self‑examination; that we may have a clearer eye
          to direct us than our own, that we may not mistake brass for gold, or
          counterfeit graces for true; that nothing that is filthy and fit to be
          cast out, may escape our sight, and preserve its station. And we need
          not question the laying at the door of this neglect (viz. not calling
          in this attribute to our aid, whose proper office it is, as I may so
          say, to search and inquire) all the mistakes, ill success, and
          fruitlessness of our endeavors in self‑examination, because we would
          engage in it in the pitiful strength of our own dimness, and not in
          the light of God’s countenance, and the assistance of his eye, which
          can discern what we cannot see, and discover that to us which we
          cannot manifest to ourselves. It is a comfort to a learner of an art
          to have a skilful eye to overlook his work, and inform him of the
          defects. Beg the help of the eye of God in all your searches and
          self‑examinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. The consideration of this attribute is comfortable in our
          assurances of, and reflections upon, the pardon of sin, or seeking of
          it. As God punishes men for sin according to his knowledge of them,
          which is greater than the knowledge their own consciences have of
          them, so he pardons according to his knowledge: he pardons not only
          according to our knowledge, but according to his own; he is greater
          than any man’s heart, to condemn for that which a man is at present
          ignorant of; and greater than our hearts, to pardon that which is not
          at present visible to us; he knows that which the most watchful
          conscience cannot take a survey of: if God had not an infinite
          understanding of us, how could we have a perfect and full pardon from
          him? It would not stand with his honor to pardon he knew not what. He
          knows what crimes we have to be pardoned, when we know not all of them
          ourselves, that stand in need of a gracious remission; his omniscience
          beholds every sin to charge it upon our Saviour. If he knows our sins
          that are black, he knows every mite of Christ’s righteousness which is
          pure, and the utmost extent of his merits, as well as the demerit of
          our iniquities. As he knows the filth of our sin, he also knows the
          covering of our Saviour: he knows the value of the Redeemer’s
          sufferings, and exactly understands every plea in the intercession of
          our Advocate. Though God knows our sins oculo indice, yet he doth not
          see them oculo judice, with a judicial eye: his omniscience stirs not
          up his justice to revenge, but his mercy to pity. His infinite
          understanding of what Christ hath done, directs him to disarm his
          justice, and sound an alarm to his bowels. As he understands better
          than we what we have committed, so he understands better than we what
          our Saviour hath merited; and his eye directs his hand in the blotting
          out guilt, and applying the remedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use III. shall be to sinners, to humble them, and put them upon
          serious consideration. This attribute speaks terrible things to a
          profligate sinner. Basil thinks that the ripping open the sins of the
          damned to their faces by this perfection of God, is more terrible than
          their other torments in hell. God knows the persons of wicked men, not
          one is exempted from his eye; he sees all the actions of men, as well
          as he knows their persons (Job xi. 11): “He knows vain men, he sees
          wickedness also” (Job xxxiv. 21): “His eye is upon all their goings.”
          He hears the most private whispers (Ps. cxxxix. 4), the scope, manner,
          circumstance of speaking, he knows it altogether: he understands all
          our thoughts, the first bubblings of that bitter spring (Ps. cxxxix.
          2); the quickest glances of the fancy, the closest musings of the
          mind, and the abortive wouldings or wishes of the will, the language
          of the heart, as well as the language of the tongue; not a foolish
          thought, or an idle word, not a wanton glance, or a dishonest action,
          not a negligent service, or a distracting fancy, but is more visible
          to him, than the filth of a dunghill can be to any man by the help of
          a sun beam. How much better would it be for desperate sinners to have
          their crimes known to all the angels in heaven, and men upon earth,
          and devils in hell, than that they should be known to their Sovereign,
          whose laws they have violated, and to their Judge, whose righteousness
          obligeth him to revenge the injury!
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Consider what a poor refuge is secrecy to a sinner. Not the mists
          of a foggy day, nor the obscurity of the darkest night, not the
          closest curtains, nor the deepest dungeon, can hide any sin from the
          eye of God. Adam is known in his thickets, and Jonah in his cabin.
          Achan’s wedge of gold is discerned by him, though buried in the earth,
          and hooded with a tent. Shall Sarah be unseen by him, when she
          mockingly laughs behind the door? Shall Gehazi tell a lie, and comfort
          himself with an imagination of his master’s ignorance, as long as God
          knows it? Whatsoever works men do, are not hid from God, whether done
          in the darkness or daylight, in the midnight darkness, or the noon‑day
          sun: he is all eye to see, and he hath a great wrath to punish. The
          wheels of Ezekiel are full of eyes: a piercing eye to behold the
          sinner, and a swift wheel of wrath to overtake him. God is light, and
          of all things light is most difficultly kept out. The secretest sins
          are set in the light of his countenance (Ps. xc. 8), as legible to
          him, as if written with a sun‑beam; more visible to him than the
          greatest print to the sharpest eye. The fornications of the Samaritan
          woman, perhaps known only to her own conscience, were manifest to
          Christ (John iv. 16.) There is nothing so secretly done, but there is
          an infallible witness to prepare a charge. Though God be invisible to
          us, we must not imagine we are so to him; it is a vanity, therefore,
          to think that we can conceal ourselves from God, by concealing the
          notions of God from our sense and practice. If men be as close from
          the eyes of all men, as from those of the sun, yea, if they could
          separate themselves from their own shadow, they could not draw
          themselves from God’s understanding: how, then, can darkness shelter
          us, or crafty artifices defend us? With what shame will sinners be
          filled, when God, who hath traced their steps, and writ their sins in
          a book, shall make a repetition of their ways, and unveil the web of
          their wickedness!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What a dreadful consideration is this to the juggling hypocrite,
          that masks himself with an appearance of piety? An infinite
          understanding judges not according to veils and shadows, but according
          to truth; “He judges not according to appearance” (1 Sam. xvi. 7). The
          outward comeliness of a work imposeth not on him, his knowledge, and
          therefore his estimations are quite of another nature than those of
          men. By this perfection God looks through the veil, and beholds the
          litter of abominations in the secrets of the soul; the true quality
          and principle of every work, and judges of them as they are, and not
          as they appear. Disguised pretexts cannot deceive him; the disguises
          are known afar off, before they are weaved; he pierceth into the
          depths of the most abstruse wills; all secret ends are dissected
          before him; every action is naked in its outside, and open in its
          inside; all are as clear to him as if their bodies were of crystal; so
          that if there be any secret reserves, he will certainly reprove us
          (Job xiii. 10). We are often deceived; we may take wolves for sheep,
          and hypocrites for believers; for the eyes of men are no better than
          flesh, and dive no further than appearance; but an infinite
          understanding, that fathoms the secret depths of the heart, is too
          knowing to let a dream pass for a truth, or mistake a shadow for a
          body. Though we call God Father all our days, speak the language of
          angels, or be endowed with the gifts of miracles, he can discern
          whether we have his mark upon us; he can espy the treason of Judas in
          a kiss; Herod’s intent of murdering under a specious pretence of
          worship; a Pharisee’s fraud under a broad phylactery; a ravenous wolf
          under the softness of a sheep’s skin; and the devil in Samuel’s
          mantle, or when he would shroud himself among the sons of God (Job i.
          6, 7). All the rooms of the heart, and every atom of dust in the least
          chink of it, is clear to his eye; he can strip sin from the fairest
          excuses, pierce into the heart with more ease than the sun can through
          the thinnest cloud or vapor; and look through all Ephraim’s ingenuous
          inventions to excuse his idolatry (Hos. v. 3). Hypocrisy, then, is a
          senseless thing, since it cannot escape unmasking, by an infinite
          understanding. As all our force cannot stop his arm, when he is
          resolved to punish, so all our sophistry cannot blind his
          understanding, when he comes to judge. Woe to the hypocrite, for God
          sees him; all his juggling is open and naked to infinite
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Is it not also a senseless thing to be careless of sins committed
          long ago? The old sins forgotten by men, stick fast in an infinite
          understanding: time cannot rase out that which hath been known from
          eternity. Why should they be forgotten many years after they were
          acted, since they were foreknown in an eternity before they were
          committed, or the criminal capable to practise them? Amalek must pay
          their arrears of their ancient unkindness to Israel in the time of
          Saul, though the generation that committed them were rotten in their
          graves (1 Sam. xv. 2). Old sins are written in a book, which lies
          always before God; and not only our own sins, but the sins of our
          fathers, to be requited upon their posterity.758 What a vanity is it
          then to be regardless of the sins of an age that went before us!
          because they are in some measure out of our knowledge, are they
          therefore blotted out of God’s remembrance? Sins are bound up with
          him, as men do bonds, till they resolve to sue for the debt; the
          iniquity of Ephraim is bound up (Hos. xiii. 12). As his foreknowledge
          extends to all acts that shall be done, so his remembrance extends to
          all acts that have been done. We may as well say, God foreknows
          nothing that shall be done to the end of the world, as that he forgets
          anything that hath been done from the beginning of the world. The
          former ages of the world are no further distant from him than the
          latter. God hath a calendar (as it were) or an account book of men’s
          sins ever since the beginning of the world, what they did in their
          childhood, what in their youth, what in their manhood, and what in
          their old age: he hath them in store among his treasures (Deut. xxxii.
          34): he hath neither lost his understanding to know them, nor his
          resolution to revenge them: as it follows, “to me vengeance belongs”
          (ver. 35). He intends to enrich his justice with a glorious
          manifestation, by rendering a due recompense. And it is to be
          observed, that God doth not only necessarily remember them, but
          sometimes binds himself by an oath to do it (Amos viii. 7); “The Lord
          hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any
          of their works.” Or, in the Hebrew, “If I ever forget any of their
          works;” that is, let me not be accounted a God forever, if I do
          forget; let me lose my godhead, if I lose my remembrance. It is not
          less a misery to the wicked, than it is a comfort to the godly, that
          their record is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Let it be observed, that this infinite understanding doth exactly
          know the sins of men; he knows so as to consider. He doth not only
          know them, but intently behold them (Ps. xi. 4): “His eyelids try the
          children of men,” a metaphor taken from men that contract the eyelids,
          when they would wistly and accurately behold a thing; it is not a
          transient and careless look (Ps. x. 14): “Thou hast seen it;” thou
          hast intently beheld it, as the word properly signifies: he beholds
          and knows the actions of every particular man, as if there were none
          but he in the world; and doth not only know, but ponder (Prov. v. 21),
          and consider their works (Ps. xxxiii. 15); he is not a bare spectator,
          but a diligent observer (1 Sam. ii. 3); “By him actions are weighed:”
          to see what degree of good or evil there is in them, what there is to
          blemish them, what to advantage them, what the quality and quantity of
          every action is. Consideration takes in every circumstance of the
          considered object: notice is taken of the place where, the minute
          when, the mercy against which it is committed; the number of them is
          exact in God’s book: “They have tempted me now these ten times” (Numb.
          xiv. 22), against the demonstrations of my glory in Egypt and the
          wilderness. The whole guilt in every circumstance is spread before
          him: his knowledge of men’s sins is not confused; such an imperfection
          an infinite understanding cannot be subject to: it is exact, for
          iniquity is marked before him (Jer. ii. 22).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. God knows men’s miscarriage so as to judge. This use his
          omniscience is put to, to maintain his sovereign authority in the
          exercise of his justice. His notice of the sins of men is in order to
          a just retribution (Ps. x. 14): “Thou hast seen mischief to requite it
          with thy hand.” The eye of his knowledge directs the hand of his
          justice; and no sinful action that falls under his cognizance, but
          will fall under his revenge; they can as little escape his censure as
          they can his knowledge: he is a witness in his omniscience, that he
          may be a judge in his righteousness; he knows the hearts of the
          wicked, so as to hate their works, and testify his abhorrency of that
          which is of high value with men (Luke xvi. 15). Sin is not preserved
          in his understanding, or written down in his book to be moth‑eaten as
          an old manuscript, but to be opened one day, and copied out in the
          consciences of men: he writes them to publish them, and sets them in
          the light of his countenance, to bring them to the light of their
          consciences. What a terrible consideration is it, to think that the
          sins of a day are upon record in an infallible understanding, much
          more the sins of a week; what a number, then, do the sins of a month,
          a year, ten or forty years, arise to! How many actions against
          charity, against sincerity! what an infinite number is there of them,
          all bound up in the court rolls of God’s omniscience, in order to a
          trial, to be brought out before the eyes of men! Who can seriously
          consider all those bonds, reserved in the cabinet of God’s knowledge,
          to be sued out against the sinner in due time, without an
          inexpressible horror?
        </p>
        <p>
          Use IV. is of exhortation. Let us have a sense of God’s knowledge upon
          our hearts. All wickedness hath a spring from a want of due
          consideration and sense of it. David concludes it so (Ps. lxxxvi. 14),
          “the proud rose against him, and violent men sought after his soul,
          because they did not set God before them.” They think God doth not
          know, and therefore care not what, nor how they act. When the fear of
          this attribute is removed, a door is opened to all impiety. What is
          there so villanous, but the minds of men will attempt to act? What
          reverence of a Deity can be left, when the sense of his infinite
          understanding is extinguished? What faith could there be in judgments
          in witnesses? How would the foundations of human society be
          overturned; the pillars upon which commerce stands, be utterly broken
          and dissolved! What society can be preserved, if this be not truly
          believed, and faithfully stuck to! But how easily would oaths be
          swallowed and quickly violated, if the sense of this perfection were
          rooted out of the minds of men! What fear could they have of calling
          to witness a Being they imagine blind and ignorant? Men secretly
          imagine, that God knows not, or soon forgets, and then make bold to
          sin against him (Ezek. viii. 12). How much does it therefore concern
          us to cherish and keep alive the sense of this? “If God writes us upon
          the palms of his hands,” as the expression is, to remember us, let us
          engrave him upon the tables of our hearts to remember him. It would be
          a good motto to write upon our minds, God knows all, he is of infinite
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This would give check to much iniquity. Can a man’s conscience
          easily and delightfully swallow that which he is sensible falls under
          the cognizance of God, when it is hateful to the eyes of his holiness,
          and renders the actor odious to him? “Doth he not see my ways, and
          count all my steps,” saith Job (xxxi. 4)? To what end doth he fix this
          consideration? To keep him from wanton glances; temptations have no
          encouragement to come near him, that is constantly armed with the
          thoughts that his sin is booked in God’s omniscience. If any impudent
          devil hath the face to tempt us, we should not have the impudence to
          join issue with him under the sense of an infinite understanding. How
          fruitless would his wiles be against this consideration! How easily
          would his snares be cracked by one sensible thought of this! This doth
          Solomon prescribe to allay the heat of carnal imaginations (Prov. v.
          20, 21). It were a useful question to ask, at the appearance of every
          temptation, at the entrance upon every action, as the church did in
          temptations to idolatry (Ps. xliv. 21): “Shall not God search this
          out, for he knows the secrets of the heart?” His understanding
          comprehends us more than our consciences can our acts, or our
          understanding our thoughts. Who durst speak treason against a prince,
          if he were sure he heard him, or that it would come to his knowledge?
          A sense of God’s knowledge of wickedness in the first motion, and
          inward contrivance, would bar the accomplishment and execution. The
          consideration of God’s infinite understanding would cry stand to the
          first glances of the heart to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It would make us watchful over our hearts and thoughts. Should we
          harbor any unworthy thoughts in our cabinet, if our heads and hearts
          were possessed with this useful truth, that God knows everything which
          comes into our minds (Ezek. xi. 5)? We should as much blush at the
          rising of impure thoughts before the understanding of God, as at the
          discovery of unworthy actions to the knowledge of men, if we lived
          under a sense, that not a thought of all those millions, which flutter
          about our minds, can be concealed from him. How watchful and careful
          should we be of our hearts and thoughts!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It would be a good preparation to every duty. This consideration
          should be the preface to every service; the Divine understanding knows
          how I now act. This would engage us to serious intention, and quell
          wandering and distracting fancies. Who would come before God, with a
          careless and ignorant soul, under a sense of his infinite
          understanding, and prerogative of searching the heart? “O thou that
          sittest in heaven!” was a consideration the psalmist had at the
          beginning of his prayer (Ps. cxxiii. 1): whereby he testifies not only
          an apprehension of the majesty and power of God, but of his
          omniscience; as one sitting above, beholds all that is below; would we
          offer to God such raw and undigested petitions? would there be so much
          flatness in our services? should our hearts so often give us the slip?
          would any hang down their heads like a bulrush, by an affected or
          counterfeit humility, while the heart is filled with pride, if we did
          actuate faith in this attribute? No; our prayers would be more sound,
          our devotions more vigorous, our hearts more close, our spirits like
          the chariots of Aminadab, more swift in their motions: everything
          would be done by us with all our might, which would be very feeble and
          faint, if we conceived God to be of a finite understanding like
          ourselves. Let us therefore, before every duty, not draw, but open the
          curtains between God and our souls, and think that we are going before
          him that sees us, before him that knows us (Gen. xvi. 12). And the
          stronger impressions of the Divine knowledge are upon our minds, the
          better would our preparation be for, and the more active our frames in
          every service: and certainly we may judge of the suitableness of our
          preparations, by the strength of such impressions upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This would tend to make us sincere in our whole course. This
          prescription David gave to Solomon, to maintain a soundness and health
          of spirit in his walk before God (1 Chron. xxviii. 9): “And thou,
          Solomon, my son, know the God of thy fathers, and serve him with a
          perfect heart, for the Lord understands all the imaginations of the
          thoughts.” Josephus gives this reason for Abel’s holiness, that he
          believed God was ignorant of nothing.759 As the doctrine of
          omniscience is the foundation of all religion, so the impression of it
          would promote the practice of all religion. When all our ways are
          imagined by us to be before the Lord, we shall then keep his precepts
          (Ps. cxix. 168). And we can never be perfect or sincere till we “walk
          before God” (Gen. xvii. 1); as under the eye of God’s knowledge. What
          we speak, what we think, what we act, is in his sight; he knows every
          place where we are, everything that we do, as well as Christ knew
          Nathaniel under the fig‑tree. As he is too powerful to be vanquished,
          so he is too understanding to be deceived; the sense of this would
          make us walk with as much care, as if the understanding of all men did
          comprehend us and our actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The consideration of this attribute would make us humble. How
          dejected would a person be if he were sure all the angels in heaven
          and men upon earth, did perfectly know his crimes, with all their
          aggravations! But what is created knowledge to an infinite and just
          censuring understanding! When we consider that he knows our actions,
          whereof there are multitudes, and our thoughts, whereof there are
          millions; that he views all the blessings bestowed upon us; all the
          injuries we have returned to him; that he exactly knows his own
          bounty, and our ingratitude; all the idolatry, blasphemy, and secret
          enmity in every man’s heart against him; all tyrannical oppressions,
          hidden lusts, omissions of necessary duties, violations of plain
          precepts, every foolish imagination, with all the circumstances of
          them, and that perfectly in their full anatomy, every mite of
          unworthiness and wickedness in every circumstance; and add to this his
          knowledge, the wonders of his patience, which are miraculous upon the
          score of his omniscience, that he is not as quick in his revenge as he
          is in his understanding, but is so far from inflicting punishment,
          that he continues his former benefits, arms not his justice against
          us, but solicits our repentance, and waits to be gracious with all
          this knowledge of our crimes; should not the consideration of this
          melt our hearts into humiliation before him, and make us earnest in
          begging pardon and forgiveness of him? Again, do we not all find a
          worm in our best fruit, a flaw in our soundest duties? Shall any of us
          vaunt, as if God beheld only the gold, and not any dross; as if he
          knew one thing only, and not another? If we knew something by
          ourselves to cheer us, do we not also know something, yea, many
          things, to condemn us, and therefore to humble us? Let the sense of
          God’s infinite knowledge, therefore, be an incentive and argument for
          more humiliation in us. If we know enough to render ourselves vile in
          our own eyes, how much more doth God know to render us vile in his!
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The consideration of this excellent perfection should make us to
          acquiesce in God, and rely upon him in every strait. In public, in
          private; he knows all cases, and he knows all remedies; he knows the
          seasons of bringing them, and he knows the seasons of removing them,
          for his own glory. What is contingent in respect of us, and of our
          foreknowledge, and in respect of second causes, is not so in regard of
          God’s, who hath the knowledge of the futurition of all things; he
          knows all causes in themselves, and, therefore, knows what every cause
          will produce, what will be the event of every counsel and of every
          action. How should we commit ourselves to this God of infinite
          understanding, who knows all things, and foreknows everything; that
          cannot be forced through ignorance to take new counsel, or be
          surprised with anything that can happen to us! This use the Psalmist
          makes of it (Ps. x. 14): “Thou hast seen it, the poor committeth
          himself unto thee.” Though “some trust in chariots and horses” (Ps.
          xx. 7), some in counsels and counsellors, some in their arms and
          courage, and some in mere vanity and nothing; yet, let us remember the
          name and nature of the Lord our God, his divine perfections, of which
          this of his infinite understanding and omniscience is none of the
          least, but so necessary, that without it he could not be God, and the
          whole world would be a mere chaos and confusion.
