        <p>'Jesus ... said, It is finished.' -- JOHN xix.30.</p>
        <p>'He said unto me, It is done.' -- REV. xxi.6.</p>
        <p>
          One of these sayings was spoken from the Cross, the other from the
          Throne. The Speaker of both is the same. In the one, His voice 'then
          shook the earth,' as the rending rocks testified; in the other, His
          voice 'will shake not the earth only but also heaven'; for 'new
          heavens and a new earth' accompanied the proclamation. In the one,
          like some traveller ready to depart, who casts a final glance over his
          preparations, and, satisfied that nothing is omitted, gives his
          charioteer the signal and rolls away, Jesus Christ looked back over
          His life's work, and, knowing that it was accomplished, summoned His
          servant Death, and departed. In the other, He sets His seal to the
          closed book of the world's history, and ushers in a renovated
          universe. The one masks the completion of the work on which the
          world's redemption rests, the other marks the completion of the age-
          long process by which the world's redemption is actually realised. The
          one proclaims that the foundation is laid, the other that the
          headstone is set on the finished building. The one bids us trust in a
          past perfected work; the other bids us hope in the perfect
          accomplishment of the results of that work. Taken singly, these
          sayings are grand; united, they suggest thoughts needed always, never
          more needful than to-day.
        </p>
        <p>I. We see here the work which was finished on the Cross.</p>
        <p>
          The Evangelist gives great significance to the words of my first text,
          as is shown by his statement in a previous verse: 'Jesus, knowing that
          all things were now accomplished, said, I thirst,' and then -- 'It is
          finished.' That is to say, there is something in that dying voice a
          great deal deeper and more wonderful than the ordinary human utterance
          with which a dying man might say, 'It is all over now. I have done,'
          for this utterance came from the consciousness that all things had
          been accomplished by Him, and that He had done His life's work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there, taking the words even in their most superficial sense, we
          come upon the strange peculiarity which marks off the life of Jesus
          Christ from every other life that was ever lived. There are no loose
          ends left, no unfinished tasks drop from His nerveless hands, to be
          taken up and carried on by others. His life is a rounded whole, with
          everything accomplished that had been endeavoured, and everything done
          that had been commanded. 'His hands have laid the foundation; His
          hands shall also finish.' He alone of the sons of men, in the deepest
          sense, completed His task, and left nothing for successors. The rest
          of us are taken away when we have reared a course or two of the
          structure, the dream of building which brightened our youth. The pen
          drops from paralysed hands in the middle of a sentence, and a fragment
          of a book is left. The painter's brush falls with his palette at the
          foot of his easel, and but the outline of what he conceived is on the
          canvas. All of us leave tasks half done, and have to go away before
          the work is completed. The half-polished columns that lie at Baalbec
          are but a symbol of the imperfection of every human life. But this Man
          said, 'It is finished,' and 'gave up the ghost.' Now, if we ponder on
          what lies in that consciousness of completion, I think we find,
          mainly, three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ rendered a complete obedience. All through His life we see Him,
          hearing with the inward ear the solemn voice of the Father, and
          responding to it with that 'I must' which runs through all His days,
          from the earliest dawning of consciousness, when He startled His
          mother with 'I must be about My Father's business,' until the very
          last moments. In that obedience to the all-present necessity which He
          cheerfully embraced and perfectly discharged, there was no flaw. He
          alone of men looks back upon a life in which His clear consciousness
          detected neither transgression nor imperfection. In the midst of His
          career He could front His enemies with 'Which of you convinceth Me of
          sin?' and no man then, and no man in all the generations that have
          elapsed since -- though some have been blind enough to try it, and
          malicious enough to utter their attempts, -- has been able to answer
          the challenge. In the midst of His career He said, 'I do always the
          things that please Him'; and nobody then or since has been able to lay
          his finger upon an act of His in which, either by excess or defect, or
          contrariety, the will of God has not been fully represented. At the
          beginning of His career He said, in answer to the Baptist's
          remonstrance, 'It becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,' and at the
          end of His career He looked back, and knowing that He had thus done
          what became Him -- namely, fulfilled it all -- He said, 'It is
          finished!'
        </p>
        <p>
          The utterance further expresses Christ's consciousness of having
          completed the revelation of God. Jesus Christ has made known the
          Father, and the generations since have added nothing to His
          revelation. The very people, to-day, that turn away from Christianity,
          in the name of higher conceptions of the divine nature, owe their
          conceptions of it to the Christ from whom they turn. Not in broken
          syllables; not 'at sundry times and in divers manners,' but with the
          one perfect, full-toned name of God on His lips, and vocal in His
          life, He has declared the Father unto us. In the course of His career
          He said, 'He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father'; and, looking
          back on His life of manifestation of God, He proclaimed, 'It is
          finished!' And the world has since, with all its thinking, added
          nothing to the name which Christ has declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The utterance farther expresses His consciousness of having made a
          completed, atoning Sacrifice. Remember that the words of my first text
          followed that awful cry that came from the darkness, and as by one
          lightning flash, show us the waves and billows rolling over His head.
          'My God! My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?' In that infinitely
          pathetic and profound utterance, to the interpretation of which our
          powers go but a little way, Jesus Christ blends together, in the most
          marvellous fashion, desolation and trust, the consciousness that God
          is His God, and the consciousness that He is bereft of the light of
          His presence. Brethren! I know of no explanation of these words which
          does justice to both the elements that are intertwined so intimately
          in them, except the old one, which listens to Him as they come from
          His quivering lip, and says, 'The Lord hath made to meet on Him the
          iniquity of us all.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, brethren! unless there was something a great deal more than the
          physical shrinking from physical death in that piteous cry, Jesus
          Christ did not die nearly as bravely as many a poor, trembling woman
          who, at the stake or the block, has owed her fortitude to Him. Many a
          blood-stained criminal has gone out of life with less tremor than that
          which, unless you take the explanation that Scripture suggests of the
          cry, marred the last hours of Jesus Christ. Having drained the cup, He
          held it up inverted when He said 'It is finished!' and not a drop
          trickled down the edge. He drank it that we might never need to drink
          it; and so His dying voice proclaimed that 'by one offering for sin
          for ever,' He 'obtained eternal redemption' for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, note the work which began from the Cross. Between
          my two texts lie untold centuries, and the whole development of the
          consequences of Christ's death, like some great valley stretching
          between twin mountain-peaks on either side, which from some points of
          view will be foreshortened and invisible, but when gazed down upon, is
          seen to stretch widely leagues broad, from mountain ridge to mountain
          ridge. So my two texts, by the fact that millenniums have to interpose
          between the time when 'It is finished!' is spoken, and the time when
          'It is done!' can be proclaimed from the Throne, imply that the
          interval is filled by a continuous work of our Lord's, which began at
          the moment when the work on the Cross ended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it has very often been the case, as I take leave to think, that
          the interpretation of the former of these two texts has been of such a
          kind as to distort the perspective of Christian truth, and to obscure
          the fact of that continuous work of our Lord's. Therefore it may not
          be out of place if, in a sentence or two, I recall to you the plain
          teaching of the New Testament upon this matter. 'It is finished!' Yes;
          and as the lower course of some great building is but the foundation
          for the higher, when 'finished' it is but begun. The work which, in
          one aspect, is the close, in another aspect is the commencement of
          Christ's further activity. What did He say Himself, when He was here
          with His disciples? 'I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to
          you.' What was the last word that came fluttering down, like an olive
          leaf, into the bosoms of the men as they stood with uplifted faces
          gazing upon Him as He disappeared? 'Lo! I am with you alway, even to
          the end of the ages.' What is the keynote of the book which carries on
          the story of the Gospels in the history of the militant Church? 'The
          former treatise have I made... of all that Jesus <i>began</i> both to
          do and to teach, until the day in which He was taken up' -- and, being
          taken up, continued, in a new form, both the doing and the teaching.
          Thus that book, misnamed the Acts of the Apostles, sets Him forth as
          the Worker of all the progress of the Church. Who is it that 'adds to
          the Church daily such as were being saved?' The Lord. Who is it that
          opened the hearts of the hearers to the message? The Lord. Who is it
          that flings wide the prison-gates when His persecuted servants are in
          chains? The Lord. Who is it that bids one man attach himself to the
          chariot of the eunuch of Ethiopia, and another man go and bear witness
          in Rome? The Lord. Through the whole of that book there runs the
          keynote, as its dominant thought, that men are but the instruments,
          and the hand that wields them is Christ's, and that He who wrought the
          finished work that culminated on Calvary is operating a continuous
          work through the ages from His Throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take that last book of Scripture, which opens with a view of the
          ascended Christ 'walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks, and
          holding the stars in His right hand;' which further draws aside the
          curtains of the heavenly sanctuary, and lets us see 'the Lamb in the
          midst of the Throne,' opening the seven seals -- that is to say,
          setting loose for their progress through the world the forces that
          make the history of humanity, and which culminates in the vision of
          the final battle in which the Incarnate Word of God goes forth to
          victory, with all the armies of heaven following Him. Are not its
          whole spirit and message that Jesus Christ, the Lamb who is the
          Antagonist of the Beast, is working through all the history of the
          world, and will work till its kingdoms are 'become the kingdoms of our
          God and of His Christ?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, that continuous operation of Jesus Christ in the midst of men is
          not to be weakened down to the mere continued influence of the truths
          which He proclaimed, or the Gospel which He brought. There is
          something a great deal more than the diminishing vibrations of a force
          long since set in operation, and slowly ceasing to act. Dead teachers
          do still 'rule our spirits from their urns'; but it is no dead Christ
          who, by the influence of what He did when He was living, sways the
          world and comforts His Church; it is a living Christ who to-day is
          working in His people, by His Spirit. Further, He works on the world
          through His people by the Word; they plant and water, He 'gives the
          increase.' And He is working in the world, for His Church and for the
          world, by His wielding of all power that is given to Him, in heaven
          and on earth. So that the work that is done upon earth He doeth it all
          Himself; and Christian people unduly limit the sphere of Christ's
          operations when they look back only to the Cross, and talk about a
          'finished work' there, and forget that that finished work there is but
          the vestibule of the continuous work that is being done to-day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian people! The present work of Christ needs working servants.
          We are here in order to carry on His work. The Apostle ventured to say
          that he was appointed 'to fill up that which is behind of the
          sufferings of Christ'; we may well venture to say that we are here
          mainly to apply to the world the benefits resulting from the finished
          work upon the Cross. The accomplishment of redemption, and the
          realisation of the accomplished redemption, are two wholly different
          things. Christ has done the one. He says to us, 'You are honoured to
          help Me to do the other.' According to the accurate rendering of a
          great saying of the Old Testament, 'Take no rest, and give Him no
          rest, till He establish and make Jerusalem a praise in the earth,
          Christ's work is finished; there is nothing for us to do with it but
          trust it. Christ's work is going on; come to His help. Ye are fellow-
          labourers with and to the Incarnate Truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I need not say more than a word about the third thought,
          suggested by these texts -- viz., the completion of the work which
          began on the Cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It is done!' That lies, no man knows how far, ahead of us. As surely
          as astronomers tell us that all this universe is hastening towards a
          central point, so surely 'that far-off divine event' is that 'to which
          the whole creation moves.' It is the blaze of light which fills the
          distant end of the dim vista of human history. Its elements are in
          part summed up in the context -- the tabernacle of God with men, the
          perfected fellowship of the human with the divine, the housing of men
          in the very home and heart of God; 'a new heaven and a new earth,' a
          renovated universe; the removal of all evil, suffering, sorrow, sin,
          and tears. These things are to be, and shall be, when He says 'It is
          done!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren! nothing else than such an issue can be the end of Creation,
          for nothing else than such is the purpose of God for man, and God is
          not going to be beaten by the world and the devil. Nothing else than
          such can be the issue of the Cross; for 'He shall see of the travail
          of His soul, and shall be satisfied,' and Christ is not going to
          labour in vain, and spend His life, and give His breath and His blood
          for nought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing but the work finished on the Cross guarantees the coming of
          that perfected issue. I know not where else there is hope for mankind,
          looking on the history of humanity, except in that great message, that
          Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has come, has died, lives for ever, and
          is the world's King and Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for ourselves, in regard to the one part of the work, let us listen
          to Him saying 'It is finished!' abandon all attempts to eke it out by
          additions of our own, and cast ourselves on the finished Revelation,
          the finished Obedience, the finished Atonement, made once for all on
          the Cross. But as for the continuous work going on through the ages,
          let us cast ourselves into it with earnestness, self- sacrifice,
          consecration, and continuity, for we are fellow-workers with Christ,
          and Christ will work in, with, and for us if we will work for Him.
