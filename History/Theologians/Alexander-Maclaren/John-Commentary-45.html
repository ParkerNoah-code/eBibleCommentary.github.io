          'Peter, seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do!
          Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
          that to thee? Follow thou Me.' -- John xxi.21, 22.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have seen in a former sermon that the charge of the risen Christ to
          Peter, which immediately precedes these verses, allotted to him
          service and suffering. The closing words of that charge 'Follow Me!'
          had a deep significance, as uniting both parts of his task in the one
          supreme command of imitation of his Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the same words had also a simpler meaning, as inviting the Apostle
          to come apart with Christ at the moment, for some further token of His
          love or indication of His will. Peter follows; but in following,
          naturally turns to see what the little group, sitting silent there by
          the coal fire on the beach, may be doing, and he notices John coming
          towards them, with intent to join them.
        </p>
        <p>
          What emboldened John to thrust himself, uncalled for, into so secret
          an interview? The words in which he is described in the context answer
          the question. 'He was the disciple whom Jesus loved, which also leaned
          on His breast at Supper, and said, Lord! which is he that betrayeth
          Thee?' He was also bound by close ties to Peter. So with the
          familiarity of 'perfect love which casteth out fear,' he felt that the
          Master could have no secrets from him, and no charge to give to his
          friend which he might not share.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter's swift question, 'Lord! and what shall this man do?' though it
          has been often blamed, does not seem very blameworthy. There was
          perhaps a little touch of his old vivacity in it, indicating that he
          had not been sufficiently subdued and sobered by the prospect which
          Christ had held out to him; but far more than that there was a natural
          interest in his friend's fate, and something of a wish to have his
          company on the path which he was to tread. Christ's answer, 'If I will
          that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me!'
          gently rebukes any leaven of evil that there may have been in the
          question; warns him against trying to force other people into his
          groove; with solemn emphasis reiterates his own duty; and, in effect,
          bids him let his brother alone, and see that he himself discharges the
          ministry which he has received of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enigmatical words of Christ, and the long life of the Apostle,
          which seemed to explain them, naturally bred an interpretation of them
          in the Early Church which is recorded here, as I believe, by the
          Evangelist himself, to the effect that John, like another Enoch at the
          beginning of a new world, was to escape the common lot. And very
          beautiful is the quiet way in which the Evangelist put that error on
          one side, by the simple repetition of his Master's words, emphasising
          their hypothetical form and their enigmatical character: 'Jesus said
          not unto him, He shall not die; but <i>if</i> I will that he
          <i>tarry</i> till I come, what is that to thee?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Now all this, I think, is full of lessons. Let me try to draw one or
          two of them briefly now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we have in that majestic 'If I will!' the revelation
          of the risen Christ as the Lord of life and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          In His charge to Peter, Christ had asserted His right absolutely to
          control His servant's conduct and fix his place in the world, and His
          power to foresee and forecast his destiny and his end. But in these
          words He goes a step further. 'I <i>will</i> that he tarry'; to
          communicate life and to sustain life is a divine prerogative; to act
          by the bare utterance of His will upon physical nature is a divine
          prerogative. Jesus Christ here claims that His will goes out with
          sovereign power amongst the perplexities of human history and into the
          depths of that mystery of life; and that He, the Son of Man, 'quickens
          whom He will,' and has power 'to kill and to make alive.' The words
          would be absurd, if not something worse, upon any but divine lips,
          that opened with conscious authority, and whose Utterer knew that His
          hand was laid upon the innermost springs of being.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in this entirely incidental fashion, you have one of the strongest
          and plainest instances of the quiet, unostentatious and habitual
          manner in which Jesus Christ claimed for Himself properly divine
          prerogatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that He who thus spoke was standing before these seven men
          there, in the morning light, on the beach, fresh from the grave. His
          resurrection had proved Him to be the Lord of death. He had bound it
          to His chariot-wheels as a Conqueror. He had risen and He stood there
          before them with no more mark of the corruption of the grave upon Him
          than there are traces of the foul water in which a sea bird may have
          floated, on its white wing that flashes in the sunshine as it soars.
          And surely as these men looked to Christ, 'declared to be the Son of
          God with power, by His resurrection from the dead, 'they may have
          begun, however 'foolish and slow of heart' they were 'to believe,' to
          understand that 'to this end Christ both died and rose and revived,
          that He might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living,' both of
          death and of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two Apostles' later history was full of proofs that Christ's
          claim was valid. Peter is shut up in prison and delivered once, at the
          very last moment, when hope was almost dead, in order that he might
          understand that when he was put into another prison and
          <i>not</i> delivered, the blow of martyrdom fell upon him, not because
          of the strength of his persecutors, but because of the will of his
          Lord. And John had to see his brother James, to whom he had been so
          closely knit, with whom he had pledged himself to drink the cup that
          Christ drank of, whom he had desired to have associated with himself
          in the special honours in the Messianic Kingdom -- he had to see him
          slain, first of the Apostles, while he himself lingered here long
          after all his early associates were gone. He had, no doubt, many a
          longing to depart. Solitary, surrounded by a new world, pressed by
          many cares, he must often have felt that the cross which he had to
          carry was no lighter than that laid on those who had passed to their
          rest by martyrdom. To him it would often be martyrdom to live. His
          personal longing is heard for a moment in the last words of the
          Apocalypse, 'Amen! even so, come, Lord Jesus!' -- but undoubtedly for
          the most part he stayed his heart on his Lord's will, and waited in
          meek patience till he heard the welcome announcement, 'The Master is
          come and calleth for thee.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And, dear friends! that same belief that the risen Christ is the Lord
          of life and death, is the only one that can stay our hearts, or make
          us bow with submission to His divine will. He who has conquered death
          by undergoing it is death's Lord as well as ours, and when He wills to
          bring His friends home to Himself, saith to that black-robed servant,
          'Go, and he goeth; do this and he doeth it.' The vision which John saw
          long after this on another shore, washed by a stormier sea, spoke the
          same truth as does this majestic 'I will' -- 'He that liveth and
          became dead and is alive for evermore,' is by virtue of His divine
          eternal life, and has become in His humanity by virtue of His death
          and resurrection the Lord of life and death. The hands that were
          nailed to the Cross turn the keys of death and Hades. 'He openeth and
          no man shutteth; He shutteth and no man openeth.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have here before us, in this incident, the service of patient
          waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If I will that he tarry, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me.' Peter
          is the man of action, not great at reflection; full of impulse,
          restless until his hands can do something to express his thoughts and
          his emotions. On the very Mount of Transfiguration he wanted to set to
          work and build 'three tabernacles,' instead of listening awed to the
          divine colloquy. In Galilee he cannot wait quietly for his Master to
          come, but must propose to his friends to 'go a fishing.' In the
          fishing-boat, as soon as he sees the Lord he must struggle through the
          sea to get at Him; whilst John sits quiet in the boat, blessed in the
          consciousness of his Master's presence and in silently gazing at Him
          verily there. All through the first part of the Acts of the Apostles
          his bold energy goes flashing and flaming. It is always his voice that
          rings out in the front, whether preaching on the Pentecost Day,
          bringing healing to the sick, or fronting the Sanhedrim. His element
          is in the shock of conflict and the strain of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          John, on the other hand, seldom appears in the narrative. When he does
          so he stands a silent figure by the side of Peter, and disappears from
          it altogether before very long. We do not hear that he did anything.
          He seems to have had no part in the missionary work of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          He 'tarried,' that was all. The word is the same -- 'abide' -- which
          is so often upon his lips in his Gospel and in his Epistles, as
          expressive of the innermost experience of the Christian soul, the
          condition of all fruitfulness, blessedness, knowledge and Christ-
          likeness. Christ's charge to John to 'tarry' did not only, as his
          brethren misinterpreted it, mean that his life was to be continued,
          but it prescribed the manner of his life. It was to be patient
          contemplation, a 'dwelling in the house of the Lord,' a keeping of his
          heart still, like some little tarn up amongst the silent hills, for
          heaven with all its blue to mirror itself in.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that quiet life of contemplation bore its fruit. In his meditation
          the deeds and words of his Master slowly grew ever more and more
          luminous to him. Deeper meanings came out, revealing new
          constellations, as he gazed into that opening heaven of memory. He
          reaped 'the harvest of a quiet eye' and garnered the sheaves of it in
          his Gospel, the holy of holies of the New Testament; and in his
          Epistles, in which he proclaims the first and last word of revelation,
          'God is love' -- the pure diamond that hangs at the end of the golden
          chain let down from Heaven. Often, no doubt, his brethren thought him
          'but an idler in the land,' but at last his 'tarrying' was vindicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, dear brethren! in all times of the world's history that form of
          Christian service needs to be pressed upon busy people. And there
          never was a time in the world's history, or in the Church's history,
          when it more needed to be pressed upon the ordinary Christian man than
          at this day. The good and the bad of our present Christianity, and of
          our present social life, conspire to make people think that those who
          are not at work in some external form of Christian service for the
          good of their fellows are necessarily idlers. Many of them are so, but
          by no means all, and there is always the danger that the external work
          which good, earnest people do shall become greater than can be
          wholesomely and safely done by them without their constant recourse to
          this solitary meditation, and to tarrying before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stress and bustle of our everyday life; the feverish desire for
          immediate results; the awakened conviction that Christianity is
          nothing if not practical; the new sense of responsibility for the
          condition of our fellows; the large increase of all sorts of domestic,
          evangelistic, and missionary work among all churches in this day --
          things to be profoundly thankful for, like all other good things have
          their possible dangers; and it is laid on my heart to warn you of
          these now. For the sake of our own personal hold on Jesus Christ, for
          the sake of our progress in the knowledge of His truth, and for the
          sake of the very work which some of us count so precious, there is
          need that we shall betake ourselves to that still communion. The
          stream that is to water half a continent must rise high in the lonely
          hills, and be fed by many a mountain rill in the solitude, and the men
          who are to keep the freshness of their Christian zeal, and of the
          consecration which they will ever feel is being worn away by the
          attrition even of faithful service, can only renew and refresh it by
          resorting again to the Master, and imitating Him who prepared Himself
          for a day of teaching in the Temple by a night of communion on the
          Mount of Olives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, there is here a lesson of tolerance for us all. Practical men
          are always disposed, as I said, to force everybody else into their
          groove. Martha is always disposed to think that Mary is idle when she
          is 'sitting at Christ's feet,' and wants to have her come into the
          kitchen and help her there. The eye which sees must not say to the
          hand which toils, nor the hand to the eye, 'I have no need of thee.'
          There are men who cannot think much; there are men who cannot work
          much. There are men whom God has chosen for diligent external service;
          there are men whom God has chosen for solitary retired musing; and we
          cannot dispense with either the one or the other. Did not John Bunyan
          do more for the world when he was shut up in Bedford Gaol and dreamed
          his dream than by all his tramping about Bedfordshire, preaching to a
          handful of cottagers? And has not the Christian literature of the
          prison, which includes three at least of Paul's Epistles, proved of
          the greatest service and most precious value to the Church?
        </p>
        <p>
          We need all to listen to the voice which says, 'Come ye apart by
          yourselves into a solitary place, and rest awhile.' Work is good, but
          the foundation of work is better. Activity is good, but the life which
          is the basis of activity is even more. There is plenty of so- called
          Christian work to-day which I fear me is not life but mechanism; has
          slipped off its original foundations, and is, therefore, powerless.
          Let us tolerate the forms of service least like our own, not seek to
          force other men into our paths nor seek to imitate them. Let Peter
          flame in the van, and beard high priests, and stir and fight; and let
          John sit in his quiet horns, caring for his Lord's mother, and holding
          fellowship with his Lord's Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, we have here the lesson of patient acquiescence in
          Christ's undisclosed will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The error into which the brethren of the Apostle fell as to the
          meaning of the Lord's words was a very natural one, especially when
          taken with the commentary which John's unusually protracted life
          seemed to append to it. We know that that belief lingered long after
          the death of the Apostle; and that legends, like the stories that are
          found in many nations of heroes that have disappeared, but are
          sleeping in some mountain recess, clustered round John's grave; over
          which the earth was for many a century believed to heave and fall with
          his gentle breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          John did not know exactly what his Master meant. He would not venture
          upon a counter-interpretation. Perhaps his brethren were right, he
          does not know; perhaps they were wrong, he does not know. One thing he
          is quite sure of, that what his Master said was: '<i>If</i> I will
          that he tarry.' And he acquiesces quietly in the certainty that it
          shall be as his Master wills; and, in the uncertainty what that will
          is, he says in effect: 'I do not know, and it does not much matter. If
          I am to go to find Him, well! If He is to come to find me, well again!
          Whichever way it be, I know that the patient tarrying here will lead
          to a closer communion hereafter, and so I leave it all in His hands.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren! that is a blessed state that you and I may come to; a
          state of quiet submission, not of indifference but of acquiescence in
          the undisclosed will of our loving Christ about all matters, and about
          this alternative of life or death amongst the rest. The soul that has
          had communion with Jesus Christ amidst the imperfections here will be
          able to refer all the mysteries and problems of its future to Him with
          unshaken confidence. For union with Him carries with it the assurance
          of its own perpetuity, and 'in its sweetness yieldeth proof that it
          was born for immortality.' The Psalmist learned to say, 'Thou shalt
          afterward receive me to glory,' because he could say, 'I am
          continually with Thee.' And in like manner we may all rise from the
          experience of the present to confidence in that immortal future. Death
          with his 'abhorred shears' cuts other close ties, but their edge turns
          on the knot that binds the soul to its Saviour. He who has felt the
          power of communion with the ever-living Christ cannot but feel that
          such union must be for ever, and that because Christ lives, and as
          long as Christ lives, he will live also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, to the soul thus abiding in Christ that alternative of life
          or death which looms so large to us when we have not Christ with us,
          will dwindle down into very small dimensions. If I live there will be
          work for me to do here, and His love to possess; if I die there will
          be work for me to do there too, and His love to possess in still more
          abundant measure. So it will not be difficult for such a soul to leave
          the decision of this as of all other things with the Lord of life and
          death, and to lie acquiescent in His gracious hands. That calm
          acceptance of His will and patience with Christ's '<i>If</i>' is the
          reward of tarrying in silent communion with Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friend! has death to you dwindled to a very little thing? Can
          you say that you are quite sure that it will not touch your truest
          self? Are you able to leave the alternative in His hands, content with
          His decision and content with the uncertainty that wraps His decision?
          Can you say,
        </p>
        <p>'Lord! It belongs not to my care,<br />Whether I die or live'?</p>
        <p>
          The answer to these questions is involved in the answer to the other:
          -- Have you trusted your sinful soul for salvation to Jesus Christ,
          and are you drawing from Him a life which bears fruit in glad service
          and in patient communion? Then it will not much matter whether you are
          in heaven or on earth, for in both places and states the essence of
          your life will be the same, your Companion one, and your work
          identical. If it be 'Christ' for me to live it will be 'gain' for me
          to die.
