          'These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
          They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that
          whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these
          things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father,
          nor Me. But these things have I told you, that, when the time shall
          come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said
          not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go My
          way to Him that sent Me; and none of you asketh Me, Whither goest
          Thou? But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
          filled your heart.' -- JOHN xvi.1-6.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unbroken flow of thought, and the many subtle links of connection
          between the parts, of these inexhaustible last words of our Lord make
          any attempt at grouping them into sections more or less unsatisfactory
          and artificial. But I have ventured to throw these, perhaps too many,
          verses together for our consideration now, because a phrase of
          frequent recurrence in them manifestly affords a key to their main
          subject. Notice how our Lord four times repeats the expression, 'These
          things have I spoken unto you.' He is not so much adding anything new
          to His words, as rather contemplating the reasons for His speech now,
          the reasons for His silence before, and the imperfect apprehension of
          the things spoken which His disciples had, and which led to their
          making His announcement, thus imperfectly understood, an occasion for
          sorrow rather than for joy. There is a kind of landing place or pause
          here in the ascending staircase. Our Lord meditates for Himself, and
          invites us to meditate with Him, rather upon His past utterances than
          upon anything additional to them. So, then, whilst it is true that we
          have in two of these verses a repetition, in a somewhat more intense
          and detailed form, of the previous warnings of the hostility of the
          world, in the main the subject of the present section is that which I
          have indicated. And I take the fourfold recurrence of that clause to
          which I have pointed as marking out for us the leading ideas that we
          are to gather from these words.
        </p>
        <p>I. There is, first, our Lord's loving reason for His speech.</p>
        <p>
          This is given in a double form. 'These things have I spoken unto you,
          that ye should not be offended.' And, again, 'These things have I told
          you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of
          them.' These two statements substantially coalesce and point to the
          same idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are separated, as I have said, by a reiteration, in more emphatic
          form, of the dark prospect which He has been holding out to His
          disciples. He tells them that the world which hates them is to be
          fully identified with the apostate Jewish Church. 'The synagogue' is
          for them 'the world.' There is a solemn lesson in that. The organised
          body that calls itself God's Church and House may become the most
          rampant enemy of Christ's people, and be the truest embodiment on the
          face of the earth of all that He means by 'the world.' A formal church
          is the true world always; and to-day as then. And such a body will do
          the cruellest things and believe that it is offering up Christ's
          witnesses as sacrifices to God. That is partly an aggravation and
          partly an alleviation of the sin. It is possible that the inquisitor
          and the man in the <i>San Benito</i>, whom he ties to the stake, may
          shake hands yet at His side up yonder. But a church which has become,
          the world will do its persecution and think that it is worship, and
          call the burning of God's people an <i>auto-da-fe</i> (act of faith);
          and the bottom of it all is that, in the blaze of light, and calling
          themselves God's, 'they do not know' either God or Christ. They do not
          know the one because they will not know the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that is all parenthetical in the present section, and so I say
          nothing more about it; and ask you, rather, just to look at the loving
          reasons which Christ here suggests for His present speech -- 'that ye
          should not be offended,' or stumble. He warns them of the storm before
          it bursts, lest, when it bursts, it should sweep them away from their
          moorings. Of course, there could be nothing more productive of
          intellectual bewilderment, and more likely to lead to doubt as to
          one's own convictions, than to find oneself at odds with the synagogue
          about the question of the Messiah. A modest man might naturally say,
          'Perhaps I am wrong and they are right.' A coward would be sure to
          say, 'I will sink my convictions and fall in with the majority.' The
          stumbling-block for these first Jewish converts, in the attitude of
          the whole mass of the nation towards Christ and His pretensions, is
          one of such a magnitude as we cannot, by any exercise of our
          imagination, realise. 'And,' says Christ, 'the only way by which you
          will ever get over the temptation to intellectual doubt or to cowardly
          apostasy that arises from your being thrown out of sympathy with the
          whole mass of your people, and the traditions of the generations, is
          to reflect that I told you it would be so, before it came to pass.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course all that has a special bearing upon those to whom it was
          originally addressed, and then it has a secondary bearing upon
          Christians, whose lot it is to live in a time of actual persecution.
          But that does not in the slightest degree destroy the fact that it
          also has a bearing upon every one of us. For if you and I are
          Christian people, and trying to live like our Master, and to do as He
          would have us to do, we too shall often have to stand in such a very
          small minority, and be surrounded by people who take such an entirely
          opposite view of duty and of truth, as that we shall be only too much
          disposed to give up and falter in the clearness, fullness, and
          braveness of our utterance, and think, 'Well, perhaps after all it is
          better for me to hold my tongue.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, besides this, there are all the cares and griefs which
          befall each of us, with regard to which also, as well as with regard
          to the difficulties and dangers and oppositions which we may meet with
          in a faithful Christian life, the principles of my text have a
          distinct and direct application. He has told us in order that we might
          not stumble, because when the hour comes and the sorrow comes with it,
          we remember that He told us all about it before.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one of the characteristics of Christianity that Jesus Christ
          does not try to enlist recruits by highly-coloured, rosy pictures of
          the blessing and joy of serving Him, keeping His hand all the while
          upon the weary marches and the wounds and pains. He tells us plainly
          at the beginning, 'If you take My yoke upon you, you will have to
          carry a heavy burden. You will have to abstain from a great many
          things that you would like to do. You will have to do a great many
          things that your flesh will not like. The road is rough, and a high
          wall on each side. There are lovely flowers and green pastures on the
          other side of the hedge, where it is a great deal easier walking upon
          the short grass than it is upon the stony path. The roadway is narrow,
          and the gateway is very strait, but the track goes steadily up. Will
          you accept the terms and come in and walk upon it?'
        </p>
        <p>
          It is far better and nobler, and more attractive also, to tell us
          frankly and fully the difficulties and dangers than to try and coax us
          by dwelling on pleasures and ease. Jesus Christ will have no service
          on false pretences, but will let us understand at the beginning that
          if we serve under His flag we have to make up our minds to hardships
          which otherwise we may escape, to antagonisms which otherwise will not
          be provoked, and to more than an ordinary share of sorrow and
          suffering and pain. 'Through much tribulation we must enter the
          Kingdom.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And the way by which all these troubles and cares, whether they be
          those incident and peculiar to Christian life, or those common to
          humanity, can best be met and overcome, is precisely by this thought,
          'The Master has told us before.' Sorrows anticipated are more easily
          met. It is when the vessel is caught with all its sails set that it is
          almost sure to go down, and, at all events, sure to be badly damaged
          in the typhoon. But when the barometer has been watched, and its fall
          has given warning, and everything movable has been made fast, and
          every spare yard has been sent below, and all tightened up and
          ship-shape -- then she can ride out the storm. Forewarned is
          forearmed. Savages think, when an eclipse comes, that a wolf has
          swallowed the sun, and it will never come out again. We know that it
          has all been calculated beforehand, and since we know that it is
          coming to-morrow, when it does come, it is only a passing darkness.
          Sorrow anticipated is sorrow half overcome; and when it falls on us,
          the bewilderment, as if 'some strange thing had happened,' will be
          escaped when we can remember that the Master has told us it all
          beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, sorrow foretold gives us confidence in our Guide. We have
          the chart, and as we look upon it we see marked 'waterless country,'
          'pathless rocks,' 'desert and sand,' 'wells and palm-trees.' Well,
          when we come to the first of these, and find ourselves, as the map
          says, in the waterless country; and when, as we go on step by step,
          and mile after mile, we find it is all down there, we say to
          ourselves, 'The remainder will be accurate, too,' and if we are in
          'Marah' to-day, where 'the water is bitter,' and nothing but the wood
          of the tree that grows there can ever sweeten it, we shall be at
          'Elim' to-morrow, where there are 'the twelve wells and the seventy
          palm trees.' The chart is right, and the chart says that the end of it
          all is 'the land that flows with milk and honey.' He <i>has</i> told
          us <i>this</i>; if there had been anything worse than this, He would
          have told us <i>that</i>. 'If it were not so I would have told you.'
          The sorrow foretold deepens our confidence in our Guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorrow that comes punctually in accordance with His word plainly comes
          in obedience to His will. Our Lord uses a little word in this context
          which is very significant. He says, 'When <i>their hour</i> is come.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Their hour' -- the time allotted to them. Allotted by whom? Allotted
          by Him. He could tell that they would come, because it was as His
          instruments that they came. 'Their time' was His appointment. It was
          only an 'hour,' a definite, appointed, and brief period in accordance
          with His loving purpose. It takes all sorts of weathers to make a
          year; and after all the sorts of weathers are run out, the year's
          results are realised and the calm comes. And so the good old hymn,
          with its rhythm that speaks at once of fear and triumph, has caught
          the true meaning of these words of our Lord's --
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why should I complain<br />Of want or distress,<br />Temptation or
          pain?<br />He told me no less.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'These things have I spoken unto you that ye might not be offended.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Still further, note our Lord's loving reasons for past silence.
          'These things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was
          with you.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course there had been in His early ministry hints, and very plain
          references, to persecutions and trials, but we must not restrict the
          'these things' of my text to that only, but rather include the whole
          of the previous chapter, in which He sets the sorrow and the hostility
          which His servants have to endure in their true light, as being the
          consequences of their union with Him and of the closeness and the
          identity of life and fate between the Vine and the branches. In so
          systematic and detailed fashion, and with such an exhibition of the
          grounds of its necessity, our Lord had not spoken of the world's
          hostility in His earlier ministry, but had reserved it to these last
          moments, and the reason why He had given but passing hints before was
          because He was there. What a superb confidence that expresses in His
          ability to shield His poor followers from all that might hurt and harm
          them! He spreads the ample robe of His protection over them, or
          rather, to go back to His own metaphor, 'as a hen gathereth her
          chickens under her wings' so He gathers them to His own breast, and
          stretches over them that which is at once protection and warmth, and
          keeps them safe. As long as He is there, no harm can come to them. But
          He is going away, and so it is time to speak, and to speak more
          plainly.
        </p>
        <p>
          That, too, yields for us, dear brethren, truths that apply to us quite
          as much as to that little group of silent listeners. For us, too,
          difficulties and sorrows, though foretold in general terms, are
          largely hidden till they are near. It would have been of little use
          for Christ to have spoken more plainly in those early days of His
          ministry. The disciples managed to forget and to misunderstand His
          plain utterances, for instance, about His own death and resurrection.
          There needs to be an adaptation between the hearing ear and the spoken
          word, in order that the word spoken should be of use, and there are
          great tracts of Scripture dealing with the sorrows of life, which lie
          perfectly dark and dead to us, until experience vitalises them. The
          old Greeks used to send messages from one army to another by means of
          a roll of parchment twisted spirally round a baton, and then written
          on. It was perfectly unintelligible when it fell into a man's hands
          that had not a corresponding baton to twist it upon. Many of Christ's
          messages to us are like that. You can only understand the utterances
          when life gives you the frame round which to wrap them, and then they
          flash up into meaning, and we say at once, 'He told us it all before,
          and I scarcely knew that He had told me, until this moment when I need
          it.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, it is merciful that there should be a gradual unveiling of what is
          to come to us, that the road should wind, and that we should see so
          short a way before us. Did you never say to yourselves, 'If I had
          known all this before, I do not think I could have lived to face it'?
          And did you not feel how good and kind and loving it was, that in the
          revelation there had been concealment, and that while Jesus Christ had
          told us in general terms that we must expect sorrows and trials, this
          specific form of sorrow and trial had not been foreseen by us until we
          came close to it? Thank God for the loving reticence, and for the as
          loving eloquence of His speech and of His silence, with regard to
          sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          And take this further lesson, that there ought to be in all our lives
          times of close and blessed communion with that Master, when the sense
          of His presence with us makes all thought of sorrows and trials in the
          future out of place and needlessly disturbing. If these disciples had
          drunk in the spirit of Jesus Christ when they were with Him, then they
          would not have been so bewildered when He left them. When He was near
          them there was something better for them to do than to be 'over
          exquisite to cast the fashion of uncertain evils' in the future --
          namely, to grow into His life, to drink in the sweetness of His
          presence, to be moulded into the likeness of His character, to
          understand Him better, and to realise His nearness more fully. And,
          dear brethren, for us all there are times -- and it is our own fault
          if these are not very frequent and blessed -- when thus, in such an
          hour of sweet communion with the present Christ, the future will be
          all radiant and calm, if we look into it, or, better, the present will
          be so blessed that there will be no need to think of the future. These
          men in the upper chamber, if they had learnt all the lessons that He
          was teaching them then, would not have gone out, to sleep in
          Gethsemane, and to tell lies in the high priest's hall, and to fly
          like frightened sheep from the Cross, and to despair at the tomb. And
          you and I, if we sit at His table, and keep our hearts near Him,
          eating and drinking of that heavenly manna, shall 'go in the strength
          of that meat forty days into the wilderness,' and say --
        </p>
        <p>'E'en let the unknown to-morrow<br />Bring with it what it may.'</p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, I must touch, for the sake of completeness, upon the
          final thought in these pregnant verses, and that is, the imperfect
          apprehension of our Lord's words, which leads to sorrow instead of
          joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Now I go My way to Him that sent Me; and none of you asketh Me,
          Whither goest Thou? But because I have said these things unto you,
          sorrow hath filled your heart.' He had been telling them -- and it was
          the one definite idea that they gathered from His words -- that He was
          going. And what did they say? They said, 'Going! What is to become of
          <i>us</i>?' If there had been a little less selfishness and a little
          more love, and if they had put their question, 'Going! What is to
          become of <i>Him</i>?' then it would not have been sorrow that would
          have filled their hearts, but a joy that would have flooded out all
          the sorrow, 'and the winter of their discontent' would have been
          changed into 'glorious summer,' because He was going to Him that sent
          Him; that is to say, He was going with His work done and His message
          accomplished. And therefore, if they could only have overlooked their
          own selves, and the bearing of His departure, as it seemed to them, on
          themselves, and have thought of it a little as it affected Him, they
          would have found that all the oppressive and the dark in it would have
          disappeared, and they would have been glad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, dear brethren, that gives us a thought on which I can but touch
          now, that the steadfast contemplation of the ascended Christ, who has
          gone to the Father, having finished His work, is the sovereign
          antidote against all sense of separation and solitude, the sovereign
          power by which we may face a hostile world, the sovereign cure for
          every sorrow. If we could live in the light of the great triumphant,
          ascended Lord, then, Oh, how small would the babble of the world be.
          If the great White Throne, and He that sits upon it, were more
          distinctly before us, then we could face anything, and sorrow would
          'become a solemn scorn of ills,' and all the transitory would be
          reduced to its proper insignificance, and we should be emancipated
          from fear and every temptation to unfaithfulness and apostasy. Look up
          to the Master who has gone, and as the dying martyr outside the city
          wall 'saw the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing' -- having
          sprung to His feet to help His poor servant -- 'at the right hand of
          God,' so with that vision in our eyes and the light of that Face
          flashing upon our faces, and making them like the angels', we shall be
          masters of grief and care, and pain and trial, and enmity and
          disappointment, and sorrow and sin, and feel that the absent Christ is
          the present Christ, and that the present Christ is the conquering
          power in us.

          Dear brethren, there is nothing else that will make us victors over
          the world and ourselves. If we can grasp Him by our faith and keep
          ourselves near Him, then union with Him as of the Vine and the
          branches, which will result inevitably in suffering here, will result
          as inevitably in joy hereafter. For He will never relax the adamantine
          grasp of His strong hand until He raises us to Himself, and 'if so be
          that we suffer with Him we shall also be glorified together.'
