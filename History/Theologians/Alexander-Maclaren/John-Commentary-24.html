          'I have declared onto them Thy name, and will declare it: that the
          love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them.' --
          JOHN xvii.26.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the solemn and calm close of Christ's great High-priestly
          prayer; the very last words that He spoke before Gethsemane and His
          passion. In it He sums up both the purpose of His life and the
          petitions of His prayer, and presents the perfect fulfilment of the
          former as the ground on which He asks the fulfilment of the latter.
          There is a singular correspondence and contrast between these last
          words to God and the last words to the disciples, which immediately
          preceded them. These were, 'In the world ye shall have tribulation,
          but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' In both He sums up
          His life, in both He is unconscious of flaw, imperfection, or
          limitation; in both He shares His own possessions among His followers.
          But His words to men carry a trace of His own conflict and a
          foreboding of theirs. For Him life had been, and for them it was to
          be, tribulation and a battle, and the highest thing that He could
          promise them was victory won by conflict. But from the serene
          elevation of the prayer all such thoughts disappear. Unbroken calm
          lies over it. His life has been one continual manifestation of the
          name of God; and the portion that He promises to His followers is not
          victory won by strife, but the participation with Himself in the love
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both views are true -- true to His experience, true to ours. The
          difference between them lies in the elevation of the beholder's eye.
          Looked at on the outward side, His life and ours must be always a
          battle and often a sorrow. Looked at from within, His life was an
          unbroken abiding in the love of God, and a continual impartation of
          the name of God, and our lives may be an ever growing knowledge of
          God, leading to and being a fuller and fuller possession of His love,
          and of a present Christ. So let us ponder these deep words: our Lord's
          own summing up of His work and aims; His statement of what we may hope
          to attain; and the path by which we may attain it. I shall best bring
          out the whole fullness of their meaning if I simply follow them word
          by word.
        </p>
        <p>I. Note, first, the backward look of the revealing Son.</p>
        <p>'I have declared Thy name.'</p>
        <p>
          The first thing that strikes one about these words is their boldness.
          Remember that they are spoken to God, at the close of a life the
          heights and depths of which they sum up. They are an appeal to God's
          righteous judgment of the whole character of the career. Do they
          breathe the tone that we might expect? Surely the prophet or teacher
          who has most earnestly tried to make himself a mirror, without spot to
          darken and without dint to distort the divine ray, will be the first
          to feel, as he looks back, the imperfections of his repetition of his
          message. But Jesus Christ, when He looks back over His life, has no
          flaw, limitation, incompleteness, to record or to confess. As always
          so here, He is absolutely unconscious of anything in the nature of
          weakness, error, or sin. As when He looked back upon His life as a
          conflict, He had no defeats to remember with shame, so here, when He
          looks upon it as the revelation of God He feels that everything which
          He has received of the Father He has made known unto men.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the strange thing is that we admit the claim, and have become so
          accustomed to regard it as being perfectly legitimate that we forget
          how enormous it is. He takes an attitude here which in any other man
          would be repulsive, but in Him is supremely natural. We criticise
          other people, we outgrow their teachings, we see where their doctrines
          have deviated from truth by excess or defect, or disproportion; but
          when He says 'I have declared Thy name,' we feel that He says nothing
          more than the simple facts of His life vindicate and confirm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not less remarkable is the implication in these words, not only of the
          completeness of His message, but of the fullness of His knowledge of
          God, and its entirely underived nature. So He claims for Himself an
          altogether special and unique position here: He has learned God from
          none; He teaches God to all. 'That was the true Light which lighteth
          every man that cometh into the world.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking a little more closely at these words before us, we have here
          Christ's own account of His whole life. The meaning of it all is the
          revelation of the heart of God. Not by words, of course; not by words
          only, but far more by deeds. And I would have you ask yourselves this
          question -- If the deeds of a man are a declaration of the name of
          God, what sort of a man is He who thus declares Him? Must we not feel
          that if these words, or anything like them, really came from the lips
          of Jesus Christ, we are here in the presence of something other than a
          holy life of a simple humanity, which might help men to climb to the
          apprehension of a God who was perfect love; and that when He says 'He
          that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,' we stand before 'God manifest
          in the flesh.'
        </p>
        <p>
          What is that name of God which the revealing Son declares? Not the
          mere syllables by which we call Him, but the manifested character of
          the Father. That one name, in the narrower sense of the word, carries
          the whole revelation that Jesus Christ has to make; for it speaks of
          tenderness, of kindred, of paternal care, of the transmission of a
          nature, of the embrace of a divine love. And it delivers men from all
          their creeping dreads, from all their dark peradventures, from all
          their stinging fears, from all the paralysing uncertainties which,
          like clouds, always misty and often thunder-bearing, have shut out the
          sight of the divine face. If this Christ, in His weakness and
          humanity, with pity welling from His eyes, and making music of His
          voice, with the swift help streaming from His fingers-tips to every
          pain and weariness, and the gracious righteousness that drew little
          children and did not repel publicans and harlots, is our best image of
          God, then love is the centre of divinity, and all the rest that we
          call God is but circumference and fringe of that central brightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          'So through the thunder comes a human voice<br />Saying, |O heart I
          made! a heart beats here.|'
        </p>
        <p>He has declared God's name, His last best name of Love.</p>
        <p>
          Need I dwell for one moment on the fact that that name is only
          declared by this Son? There is no need to deny the presence of
          manifold other precious sources in men's experience and lives from
          which something may be inferred of what God truly is. But all these,
          rich and manifold as they are, fall into nothingness before the life
          of Jesus Christ, considered as the making visible of God. For all the
          rest are partial and incomplete. 'At sundry times and in divers
          manners' God flung forth syllables of the name, and 'fragments of that
          mighty voice came rolling down the wind.' But in Jesus Christ the
          whole name, in all its syllables, is spoken. Other sources of
          knowledge are ambiguous, and need the interpretation of Christ's life
          and Cross ere they can be construed into a harmonious whole. Life,
          nature, our inmost being, history, all these sources speak with two
          voices; and it is only when we hear the deep note that underlies them
          in the word of Christ that their discord becomes a harmony. Other
          sources lack authority. They come at the most with a 'may be.' He
          comes with a 'Verily, verily.' Other sources speak to the
          understanding, or the conscience, or to fear. Christ speaks to the
          heart. Other sources leave the man who accepts them unaffected.
          Christ's message penetrates to the transforming and assimilation of
          the whole being.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dear brethren! for all generations, and for this generation most
          of all, the plain alternative lies between the declaration of the name
          of God in Jesus Christ and a godless and orphan world. Modern thought
          will make short work of all other sources of certitude about the
          character of God, and will leave men alone in the dark. Christ, the
          historical fact of the life and death of Jesus Christ, is the sole
          surviving source of certitude, which is blessedness, as to whether
          there is a God, and what sort of a God He is.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, note here that strange forward look of the dying Man: 'I
          have declared Thy name and <i>will declare it</i>.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And that was said within eight and forty hours of the Cross, which, if
          He had been a simple human teacher and martyr, would have ended all
          His activity in the world. But here He is not merely summing up His
          life, and laying it aside, writing the last sentence, as it were,
          which gathers up the whole of the completed book, but He is closing
          the first volume, and in the act of doing so He stretches out His hand
          to open the second. 'I will declare it.' When? How? Did not earthly
          life, then, put a stop to this Teacher's activity? Was there still
          prophetic function to be done after death had sealed His lips?
          Certainly.
        </p>
        <p>
          That anticipation, which at once differentiates Him from all the brood
          of merely human teachers and prophets, even the highest, does indeed
          include as future, at the moment when He speaks, the swiftly coming
          and close Cross; but it goes beyond it. How much of Christendom's
          knowledge of God depended upon the Passion, on the threshold of which
          Christ was standing? He, hanging on the Cross in weakness, and dying
          there amidst the darkness that overspread the land, is a strange
          Revealer of the omnipotent, infinite, ever-blessed God. But Oh! if we
          strike Gethsemane and Calvary out of Christ's manifestation of the
          Father, how infinitely poorer are we and the world! 'God commendeth,'
          (rather 'establisheth,') 'His love toward us in that whilst we were
          yet sinners Christ died for us.' And so as we turn ourselves to the
          little knoll outside the gate, where the Nazarene carpenter hangs
          faint and dying, we -- wonder of Wonders, and yet certainty of
          certainties! -- have to say, 'Lo! this is our God; we have waited for
          Him.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But that future revelation extends beyond the Cross, and includes
          resurrection, ascension, Pentecost, and the whole history of the
          Church right onwards through the ages. The difference between the two
          volumes of revelation -- that which includes the work of Christ upon
          earth, and that which includes His revelation from the heavens -- is
          this, that the first volume contains all the facts, and the second
          volume contains His interpretation and application of the facts in the
          understandings and hearts of His people. We have no more facts from
          which to construe God than these which belong to the earthly life of
          Jesus Christ, and we never shall have, here at all events. But whilst
          the first volume to the bottom of the last page is finished and
          tolerates and needs no additions, day by day, moment by moment, epoch
          by epoch Christ is bringing His people to a fuller understanding of
          the significance of the first volume, and writing the second more and
          more upon their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have an ever-living Christ, still the active Teacher of His
          Church. Times of unsettlement and revolutionary change and the
          'shaking of the things that are made,' like the times in which we
          live, are but times in which the great Teacher is setting some new
          lesson from the old Book to His slow scholars. There is always a
          little confusion in the schoolroom when the classes are being
          rearranged and new books are being put into old hands. The tributary
          stream, as it rushes in, makes broken water for a moment. Do not let
          us be afraid when 'the things that can be shaken' shake, but let us
          see in the shaking the attendant of a new curriculum on which the
          great Teacher is launching His scholars, and let us learn the new
          lessons of the old Gospel which He is then teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, note the participation in the Father's love which is the
          issue of the knowledge of the Father's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ says that His end, an end which is surely attained in the
          declaration of the divine name, is that 'the love wherewith Thou hast
          loved Me may be in them.' We are here touching upon heights too dizzy
          for free and safe walking, on glories too bright for close and steady
          gaze. But where Christ has spoken we may reverently follow. Mark,
          then, that marvellous thought of the identity between the love which
          was His and the love which is ours. 'From everlasting' that divine
          love lay on the Eternal Word which in the hoary beginning, before the
          beginning of creatures, 'was with God, and was God.' The deepest
          conception that we can form of the divine nature is of a Being who in
          Himself carries the Subject and the Object of an eternal love, which
          we speak of in the deep emblem of 'the Word,' and the God with whom He
          eternally 'was.' That love lay upon Christ, without limitation,
          without reservation, without interruption, finding nothing there from
          which it recoiled, and nothing there which did not respond to it. No
          mist, no thunderstorm, ever broke that sunshine, no tempest ever swept
          across that calm. Continuous, full, perfect was the love that knit the
          Father to the Son, and continuous, full, and perfect was the
          consciousness of abiding in that love, which lay like light upon the
          spirit of Him that said 'I delight to do Thy will.' 'The Father hath
          not left Me alone.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And all that love Christ gives to us as deep, as continuous, as
          unreserved. Our consciousness of God's love is meant by Christ to be
          like His own. Alas! alas! is that our experience, Christian people?
          The sun always shines on the rainless land of Egypt, except for a
          month or two in the year. The contrast between the unclouded blue and
          continuous light and heat there, and our murky skies and humid
          atmosphere, is like the contrast between our broken and feeble
          consciousness of the shining of the divine love and the uninterrupted
          glory of light and joy of communion which poured on Christ's heart.
          But it is possible for us indefinitely to approximate to such an
          experience; and the way by which we reach it is that plain and simple
          one of accepting Christ's declaration of the Father's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And so, lastly, notice the indwelling Christ who makes our
          participation in the divine love possible: 'And I in them.'
        </p>
        <p>
          One may well say, 'How can it be that love should be transferred? How
          can it be that the love of God to me shall be identical with the love
          of God to Christ?' There is only one answer. If Christ dwells in me,
          then God's love to Him falls upon me by no transference, but by my
          incorporation into Him. And I would urge that this great truth of the
          actual indwelling of Christ in the soul is no mere piece of rhetorical
          exaggeration, nor a wild and enthusiastic way of putting the fact that
          the influence of His teaching and the beauty of His example can sway
          us; but it is a plain and absolute truth that the divine Christ can
          come into and abide in the narrow room of our poor hearts. And if He
          does this, then 'he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit'; and the
          Christ in me receives the sunshine of the divine love. That does not
          destroy, but heightens, my individuality. I am more and not less
          myself because 'I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.'
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dear brethren! it all comes to this -- we may each of us, if we
          will, have Jesus Christ for Guest and Inhabitant in our hearts. If we
          have, then, since God loves Him, He must love me who have Him within
          me, and as long as God loves Christ He cannot cease to love me, nor
          can I cease to be conscious of His love to me, and whatsoever gifts
          His love bestows upon Jesus, pass over in measure, and partially, to
          myself. Thus immortality, heaven, glory, all blessedness in heaven and
          earth, are the fruit and crystallisation, so to speak, of that oneness
          with Christ which is possible for us. And the conditions are simply
          that we shall with joyful trust accept His declaration of the Father's
          name, and see God manifest in Him; and welcome in our inmost hearts
          that great Gospel. Then His prayer, and the travail of His soul, will
          reach their end even in me, and 'the love wherewith the Father loved
          the Son shall be in me,' and the Son Himself shall dwell in my heart.
