          'These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh,
          when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you
          plainly of the Father. At that day ye shall ask in My Name: and I say
          not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: For the Father
          Himself loveth you, because ye have loved Me, and have believed that I
          came out from God.' -- JOHN xvi.25-27.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stream which we have been tracking for so long in these discourses
          has now nearly reached its close. Our Lord, in these all but final
          words, sums up the great salient features which He has already more
          than once specified, of the time when His followers shall live with an
          absent and yet present Christ. He reiterates here substantially just
          what He has been saying before, but in somewhat different connection,
          and with some slight expansion. And this reiteration of the glad
          features of the day which was about to dawn suggests how much the
          disciples needed, and how much we need, to have repeated over and over
          again the blessed and profound lessons of these words.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a sublime self-repression there was in the Master! Not one word
          escapes from His lips of the personal pain and agony into which He had
          to plunge and be baptized, before that day could dawn. All that was
          crushed down and kept back, and He only speaks to the disciples and to
          us of the joy that comes to them, and not at all of the bitter sorrow
          by which it is bought. There are set forth in these words, as it seems
          to me, especially three characteristics which belong to the whole
          period between the ascension of Jesus Christ and His coming again for
          judgment. It is a day of continual and clearer teaching by Him. It is
          a day of desires in His name. It is a day of filial experience of a
          Father's love. These are the characteristics of the Christian period,
          and they ought to be the characteristics of our individual Christian
          life. My brother! are they the characteristics of yours?
        </p>
        <p>Let us note them in order.</p>
        <p>
          I. First, our Lord tells us that the whole period of the Christian
          life upon earth is to be a period of continuous and clearer teaching
          by Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Hitherto I have spoken to you in proverbs,' or parables. The word
          means, not only a comparison or parable, but also, and perhaps
          primarily, a mysterious and enigmatical saying. The reference is, of
          course, directly to the immediately preceding thoughts, in which His
          departure and the sorrow that accompanied it and was to merge into
          joy, were described under that touching figure of the woman in
          travail. But the reference must be extended very much farther than
          that. It includes not only this discourse, but the whole of His
          teaching by word whilst He was here upon earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the first thing that strikes me here is this strange fact. Here is
          a man who knew Himself to be within four-and-twenty hours of His
          death, and knew that scarcely another word of instruction was to come
          from His lips upon earth, calmly asserting that, for all the
          subsequent ages of the world's history, He is to continue its Teacher.
          We know how the wisest and profoundest of earthly teachers have their
          lips sealed by death, so as that no counsel can come from them any
          more, and their disciples long in vain for responses from the silenced
          oracle, which is dumb whatever new problems may arise. But Jesus
          Christ calmly poses before the world as not having His teaching
          activity in the slightest degree suspended by that fact which puts a
          conclusive and complete close to all other teachers' words. Rather He
          says that after death He will, more clearly than in life, be the
          Teacher of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does He mean by that? Well, remember first of all the facts which
          followed this saying -- the Cross, the Grave, Olivet, the Heavens, the
          Throne. These were still in the future when He spoke. And have not
          these -- the bitter passion, the supernatural resurrection, the
          triumphant ascension, and the everlasting session of the Son at the
          right hand of God -- taught the whole world the meaning of the
          Father's name, and the love of the Father's heart, and the power of
          the Father's Son, as nothing else, not even the sweetest and tenderest
          of His utterances, could have taught them? When, then, He declares the
          continuance of His teaching functions unbroken through death and
          beyond it, He refers partly to the future facts of His earthly
          manifestation, and still more does He refer to that continuous
          teaching which, by that divine Spirit whom He sends, is granted to
          every believing soul all through the ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          This great truth, which recurs over and over again in these discourses
          of our Lord, is far too much dropped out of the consciousness and
          creeds of the modern Christian Church. We call ourselves Christ's
          disciples. If there be disciples, there must be a Master. His teaching
          is by no means merely the effect of the recorded facts and utterances
          of the Lord, preserved here in the Book for us, and to be pondered
          upon by ourselves, but it is also the hourly communication, to waiting
          hearts and souls that keep themselves near the Lord, of deeper insight
          into His will, of larger views of His purposes, of a firmer grasp of
          the contents of Scripture, and a more complete subjection of the whole
          nature to the truth as it is in Jesus. Christian men and women! do you
          know anything about what it is to learn of Christ in the sense that He
          Himself, and no poor human voice like mine, nor even merely the
          records of His past words and deeds as garnered in these Gospels and
          expounded by His Apostles, is the source of your growing knowledge of
          Him? If we would keep our hearts and minds clearer than we do of the
          babble of earthly voices, and be more loyal and humble and constant
          and patient in our sitting on the benches in Christ's school till the
          Master Himself came to give us His lessons, these great words of my
          text would not, as they so often do in the mass of professing
          Christians, lack the verification of experience and the assurance that
          it is so with us. Have you sat in Christ's school, and do you know the
          secret and illuminative whispers of His teaching? If not, there is
          something wrong in your Christian character, and something insincere
          in your Christian profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, still further, that our Lord here ranks that subsequent
          teaching before all that He said upon earth, great and precious as it
          was. Now I do not mean for one moment to allege that fresh
          communications of truth, uncontained in Scripture, are given to us in
          the age-long and continuous teaching of Jesus Christ. That I do not
          suppose to be the meaning of the great promises before us, for the
          facts of revelation were finished when He ascended, and the inspired
          commentary upon the facts of revelation was completed with these
          writings which follow the Gospels in our New Testament. But Christ's
          teaching brings us up to the understanding of the facts and of the
          commentary upon them which Scripture contains, so that what was
          parable or proverb, dimly apprehended, mysterious and enigmatical when
          it was spoken, and what remains mysterious and enigmatical to us until
          we grow up to it, gradually becomes full of significance and weighty
          with a plain and certain meaning. This is the teaching which goes on
          through the ages -- the lifting of His children to the level of
          apprehending more and more of the inexhaustible and manifold wisdom
          which is stored for us in this Book. The mine has been worked on the
          surface, but the deeper it goes the richer is the lode; and no ages
          will exhaust the treasures that are hid in Christ Jesus our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          He uses the new problems, the new difficulties, the new circumstances
          of each successive age, and of each individual Christian, in order to
          evolve from His word larger lessons, and to make the earlier lessons
          more fully and deeply understood. And this generation, with all its
          new problems, with all its uneasiness about social questions, with all
          its new attitude to many ancient truths, will find that Jesus Christ
          is, as He has been to all past generations, -- the answer to all its
          doubts, using even these doubts as a means of evolving the deeper
          harmonies of His Word, and of unveiling in the ancient truth more than
          former generations have seen in it. 'Brethren, I write unto you no new
          commandment. Again, a new commandment I write unto you.' The
          inexhaustible freshness of the old word taught us anew, with deeper
          significance and larger applications, by the everlasting Teacher of
          the Church, is the hope that shines through these words. I commend to
          you, dear brethren, the one simple, personal question, Have I
          submitted myself to that Teacher, and said to men and systems and
          preachers and books and magazines, and all the rest of the noisy and
          clamorous tongues that bewilder under pretence of enlightening this
          generation -- have I said to them all, 'Hold your peace! and let me,
          in the silence of my waiting soul, hear the Teacher Himself speak to
          me. Speak, Lord! for Thy servant heareth. Teach me Thy way and lead
          me, for Thou art my Master, and I the humblest of Thy scholars'?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In the next place, another of the glad features of this dawning
          day is that it is to be a day of desires based upon Christ, and
          Christlike.
        </p>
        <p>
          'In that day ye shall ask in My name.' Our translators have wisely put
          a colon at the end of that clause, in order that we may not hurry over
          it too quickly in haste to get to the next one. For there is a
          substantial blessing and privilege wrapped up in it. Our Lord has just
          been saying the same thing in the previous verses, but He repeats it
          here in order to emphasise it, and to set it by the subsequent words
          in a somewhat different light. But I dwell upon it for a very simple,
          practical purpose. I have already explained in former sermons the
          full, deep meaning of that phrase, 'asking in Christ's name,' and have
          suggested to you that it implies two things -- the one, that our
          desires should all be based upon His great work as the only ground of
          our acceptance with God; and the other, that our desires should all be
          such as represent His heart and His mind. When we 'ask in His name' we
          ask, first, for His sake, and, second, as in His person. And such
          desires, resting their hopes of answer solely upon His mighty
          sacrifice and all-sufficient merit, and shaped accurately and fully
          after the pattern of the wishes that are dear to His heart, are to be
          the prerogative and the joy of His servants, in the new 'day' that is
          about to dawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note how beautifully this thought, of wishes moulded into conformity
          with Jesus Christ, and offered in reliance upon His great sacrifice,
          follows upon that other thought, 'I will tell you plainly of the
          Father.' The Master's voice speaks, revealing the paternal heart, the
          scholar's voice answers with desires kindled by the revelation.
          Longings and aspirations humbly offered for His sake, and after the
          pattern of His own, are our true response to His teaching voice. As
          the astronomer, the more powerful his telescope, though it may resolve
          some of the nebulae that resisted feebler instruments, only has his
          bounds of vision enlarged as he looks through it, and sees yet other
          and mightier star-clouds lying mysterious beyond its ken -- so each
          new influx and tidal wave of knowledge of the Father, which Christ
          gives to His waiting child, leads on to enlarged desires, to longings
          to press still further into the unexplored mysteries of that
          magnificent and boundless land, and to nestle still closer into the
          infinite heart of God. He declares to us the Father, and the answer of
          the child to the declaration of the Father is the cry, 'Abba! Father!
          show me yet more of Thy heart.' Thus aspiration and fruition, longing
          and satisfaction in unsatiated and inexhaustible and unwearying
          alternation, are the two blessed poles between which the life of a
          Christian may revolve in smoothness and music.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friend! is that anything like the transcript of our experience,
          that the more we know of God, the more we long to know of, and to
          possess, Him? and the more we long to know of, and to possess, Him,
          the more full, gracious, confidential, tender, and continuous are the
          teachings of our Master? Is not this a far higher level of Christian
          life than that we live upon? And why so? Is Christ's word faithless?
          Hath He forgotten to be gracious? Was this promise of His idle wind?
          Or is it that you and I have never grasped the fulness of privileges
          that He bestows upon us?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Note, lastly, that that day is to be a day of filial experience
          of a Father's love.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you, for the
          Father Himself loveth you because ye have loved Me, and have believed
          that I came out from God.' Jesus Christ does not deny His
          intercession. He simply does not bring it into evidence here. To deny
          it would have been impossible, for soon afterwards we find Him saying,
          'I pray for them which Thou hast given Me, for they are Thine.' But He
          does not emphasise it here, in order that He may emphasise another
          blessed source of solace -- viz., that to those who listen to the
          Master's teaching, and have their desires moulded into harmony with
          His, and their wishes and hopes all based upon His sacrifice and work,
          the divine Father's love directly flows. There is no need of any
          intercession to turn Him to be merciful. Men sometimes caricature the
          thought of the intercession of Christ, as if it meant that He, by His
          prayer, bent the reluctant will of the Father in heaven. All such
          horrible misconceptions Christ sweeps out of the field here, even
          whilst there remains, in the fact that the prayers of which He is
          speaking are offered in His name, the substance and reality of all
          that we mean by the intercession of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now note that God loves the men who love Jesus Christ. So
          completely does the Father identify Himself with the Son, that love to
          Christ is love to Him, and brings the blessed answer of His love to
          us. Whosoever loves Christ loves God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whosoever loves Christ must do so, believing that He 'came forth from
          God.' There are the two characteristics of a Christian disciple, --
          faith in the divine mission of the Son, and love that flows from
          faith. Now, of course, it does not follow from the words before us,
          that this divine love which comes down upon the heart which loves
          Christ is the original and first flow of that love towards that heart.
          'We love Him because He first loved us.' Christ is not here tracking
          the stream to its source, but is pointing to it midway in its flow. If
          you want to go up to the fountain-head you have to go up to the divine
          Father's heart, who loved when there was no love in us; and, because
          He loved, sent the Son. First comes the unmotived, spontaneous,
          self-originated, undeserved, infinite love of God to sinners and
          aliens and enemies; then the Cross and the mission of Jesus Christ;
          then the faith in His divine mission; then the love which is the child
          of faith, as it grasps the Cross and recognises the love that lies
          behind it; and then, after that, the special, tender, and paternal
          love of God falling upon the hearts that love Him in His Son. There is
          nothing here in the slightest degree to conflict with the grand
          universal truth that God loves enemies and sinners and aliens. But
          there is the truth, as precious as the other, that they who have
          'known and believed the love that God hath to us' live under the
          selectest influences of His loving heart, and have a place in its
          tenderness which it is impossible that any should have who do not so
          love. And that sweet commerce of a divine love answering a human,
          which itself is the answer to a prior divine love, brings with it the
          firm confidence that prayers in His name shall not be prayers in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dear friends, growing knowledge, an ever-present Teacher, the
          peace of calm desires built upon Christ's Cross and fashioned after
          Christ's Spirit, and the assurance in my quiet and filial heart that
          my Father in the heavens loves me, and will neither give me 'serpents'
          when I ask for them, thinking them to be 'fishes,' nor refuse 'bread'
          when I ask for it -- these things ought to mark the lives of all
          professing Christians. Are they our experience? If not, why are they
          not, but because we do not believe that 'Thou art come forth from
          God,' nor love Thee as we ought?
