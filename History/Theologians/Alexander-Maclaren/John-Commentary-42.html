          'Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the
          Lord. -- JOHN xxi.7.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems a very strange thing that these disciples had not, at an
          earlier period of this incident, discovered the presence of Christ,
          inasmuch as the whole was so manifestly a repetition of that former
          event by which the commencement of their ministry had been signalised,
          when He called them to become 'fishers of men.' We are apt to suppose
          that when once again they embarked on the lake, and went back to their
          old trade, it must have been with many a thought of Him busy at their
          hearts. Yonder -- perhaps we fancy them thinking -- is the very point
          where we saw Him coming out of the shadows of the mountains, that
          night when He walked on the water; yonder is the little patch of grass
          where He made them all sit down whilst we bore the bread to them:
          there is the very spot where we were mending our nets when He came up
          to us and called us to Himself; and now it is all over. We have loved
          and lost Him; He has been with us, and has left us. 'We trusted that
          it had been He who should have redeemed Israel,' and the Cross has
          ended it all! So, we are apt to think, they must have spoken; but
          there does not seem to have been about them any such sentimental
          remembrance. John takes pains in this narrative, I think, to show them
          to us as plain, rough men, busy about their night's work, and thinking
          a great deal more of their want of success in fishing, than about the
          old associations which we are apt to put into their minds. Then
          through the darkness He comes, as they had seen Him come once before,
          when they know Him not; and He speaks to them as He had spoken before,
          and they do not detect His voice yet; and He repeats the old miracle,
          and their eyes are all holden, excepting the eyes of him who loved,
          and <i>he</i> first says, 'It is the Lord!' Now, besides all the other
          features of this incident by which it becomes the revelation of the
          Lord's presence with His Church, and the exhibition of the work of the
          Church during all the course of the world's history, it contains
          valuable lessons on other points, such as these which I shall try to
          bring before you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now and always, as in that morning twilight on the Galilean lake,
          Christ comes to men. Everywhere He is present, everywhere revealing
          Himself. Now, as then, our eyes are 'holden' by our own fault, so that
          we recognise not the merciful Presence which is all around us. Now, as
          then, it is they who are nearest to Christ by love who see Him first.
          Now, as then, they who are nearest to Him by love, are so because He
          loves them, and because they know and believe the love which He has to
          them. I find, then, in this part of the story three thoughts, --
          First, they only see aright who see Christ in everything. Secondly,
          they only see Christ who love Him. Lastly, they only love Him who know
          that He loves them,
        </p>
        <p>I. First then, they only see aright who see Christ in everything.</p>
        <p>
          This word of John's, 'It is the Lord!' -- ought to be the conviction
          with the light of which we go out to the examination of all events,
          and to the consideration of all the circumstances of our daily life.
          We believe that unto Christ is given 'all power in heaven and upon
          earth.' We believe that to Him belongs creative power -- that 'without
          Him was not anything made which was made.' We believe that from Him
          came all life at first. In Him life was, as in its deep source. He is
          the Fountain of life. We believe that as no being comes into existence
          without His creative power, so none continues to exist without His
          sustaining energy. We believe that He allots to all men their natural
          characters and their circumstances. We believe that the history of the
          world is but the history of His influence, and that the centre of the
          whole universe is the cross of Calvary. In the light of such
          convictions, I take it, every man that calls himself a Christian ought
          to go out to meet life and to study all events. Let me try, then, to
          put before you, very briefly, one or two of the provinces in which we
          are to take this conviction as the keynote to all our knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          No man will understand the world aright, to begin with, who cannot say
          about all creation, 'It is the Lord!' Nature is but the veil of the
          invisible and ascended Lord: and if we would pierce to the deepest
          foundations of all being, we cannot stop until we get down to the
          living power of Christ our Saviour and the Creator of the world, by
          whom all things were made, and whose will pouring out into this great
          universe, is the sustaining principle and the true force which keeps
          it from nothingness and from quick decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, what did Christ work all His miracles upon earth for? Not solely
          to give us a testimony that the Father had sent Him; not solely to
          make us listen to His words as a Teacher sent from God; not solely as
          proof of His Messiahship, -- but besides all these purposes there was
          surely this other, that for once He would unveil to us the true Author
          of all things, and the true Foundation of all being. Christ's miracles
          interrupted the order of the world, because they made visible to men
          for once the true and constant Orderer of the order. They interrupted
          the order in so far as they struck out the intervening links by which
          the creative and sustaining word of God acts in nature, and suspended
          each event directly from the firm staple of His will. They revealed
          the eternal Orderer of that order in that they showed the Incarnate
          Word wielding the forces of nature, which He has done from of old and
          still does. We are then to take all these signs and wonders that He
          wrought, as a perennial revelation of the real state of things with
          regard to this natural world, and to see in them all, signs and tokens
          that into every corner and far-off region of the universe His loving
          hand reaches, and His sustaining power goes forth. Into what province
          of nature did He not go? He claimed to be the Lord of life by the side
          of the boy's bier at the gate of Nain, in the chamber of the daughter
          of Jairus, by the grave of Lazarus. He asserted for Himself authority
          over all the powers and functions of our bodily life, when He gave
          eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, feet to the lame. He showed
          that He was Lord over the fowl of the air, the beasts of the earth,
          the fish of the sea. And He asserted His dominion over inanimate
          nature, when the fig-tree, cursed by Him, withered away to its roots,
          and the winds and waves sunk into silence at His gentle voice. He let
          us get a glimpse into the dark regions of His rule over the unseen,
          when 'with authority He commanded the unclean spirits, and they came
          out.' And all these things He did, in order that we, walking in this
          fair world, encompassed by the glories of this wonderful universe,
          should be delivered from the temptation of thinking that it is
          separated from Him, or independent of His creative and sustaining
          power; and in order that we should feel that the continuance of all
          which surrounds us, the glories of heaven and the loveliness of earth,
          are as truly owing to the constant intervention of His present will,
          and the interposition beneath them of His sustaining hand, as when
          first, by the 'Word of God' who 'was with God and who was God,'
          speaking forth His fiat, there came light and beauty out of darkness
          and chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          O Christian men! we shall never understand the Christian thought about
          God's universe, until we are able to say, Preservation is a continual
          creation; and beneath all the ordinary workings of Nature, as we
          faithlessly call it, and the apparently dead play of secondary causes,
          there are welling forth, and energising, the living love and the
          blessed power of Christ, the Maker, and Monarch, and Sustainer of all.
          'It is the Lord!' is the highest teaching of all science. The mystery
          of the universe, and the meaning of God's world, are shrouded in
          hopeless obscurity, until we learn to feel that all laws suppose a
          Lawgiver, and that all working involves a divine energy; and that
          beneath all which appears there lies for ever rising up through it and
          giving it its life and power, the one true living Being, the Father in
          heaven, the Son by whom He works, and the Holy Ghost the Spirit.
          Darkness lies on Nature, except to those who in
        </p>
        <p>
          'the light of setting suns,<br />And the round ocean, and the living
          air,<br />And the blue sky,'
        </p>
        <p>
          see that Form which these disciples saw in the morning twilight. Let
          'It is the Lord!' be the word on our lips as we gaze on them all, and
          nature will then be indeed to us the open secret, the secret of the
          Lord which 'He will show to them that fear Him.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, the same conviction is the only one that is adequate
          either to explain or to make tolerable the circumstances of our
          earthly condition. To most men -- ah! to all of us in our faithless
          times -- the events that befall ourselves, seem to be one of two
          things equally horrible, the play of a blind Chance, or the work of an
          iron Fate. I know not which of these two ghastly thoughts about the
          circumstances of life is the more depressing, ruining all our energy,
          depriving us of all our joy, and dragging us down with its weight. But
          brethren, and friends, there are but these three ways for it -- either
          our life is the subject of a mere chaotic chance; or else it is put
          into the mill of an iron destiny, which goes grinding on and crushing
          with its remorseless wheels, regardless of what it grinds up; or else,
          through it all, in it all, beneath it and above it all, there is the
          Will which is Love, and the Love which is Christ! Which of these
          thoughts is the one that commends itself to your own hearts and
          consciences, and which is the one under which you would fain live if
          you could? I understand not how a man can front the awful
          possibilities of a future on earth, knowing all the points at which he
          is vulnerable, and all the ways by which disaster may come down upon
          him, and retain his sanity, unless he believes that all is ruled, not
          merely by a God far above him, who may be as unsympathising as He is
          omnipotent, but by his Elder Brother, the Son of God, who showed His
          heart by all His dealings with us here below, and who loves as
          tenderly, and sympathises as closely with us as ever He did when on
          earth He gathered the weary and the sick around Him. Is it not a
          thing, men and women, worth having, to have this for the settled
          conviction of your hearts, that Christ is moving all the pulses of
          your life, and that nothing falls out without the intervention of His
          presence and the power of His will working through it? Do you not
          think such a belief would nerve you for difficulty, would lift you
          buoyantly over trials and depressions, and would set you upon a
          vantage ground high above all the petty annoyances of life? Tell me,
          is there any other place where a man can plant his foot and say, 'Now
          I am on a rock and I care not what comes'? The riddle of Providence is
          solved, and the discipline of Providence is being accomplished when we
          have grasped this conviction -- All events do serve me, for all
          circumstances come from His will and pleasure, which is love; and
          everywhere I go -- be it in the darkness of disaster or in the
          sunshine of prosperity -- I shall see standing before me that familiar
          and beloved Shape, and shall be able to say, 'It is the Lord!' Friends
          and brethren, that is the faith to live by, that is the faith to die
          by; and without it life is a mockery and a misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more this same conviction, 'It is the Lord! should guide us in
          all our thoughts about the history and destinies of mankind and of
          Christ's Church. The Cross is the centre of the world's history, the
          incarnation and the crucifixion of our Lord are the pivot round which
          all the events of the ages revolve. 'The testimony of Jesus was the
          spirit of prophecy,' and the growing power of Jesus is the spirit of
          history, and in every book that calls itself the history of a nation,
          unless there be written, whether literally or in spirit, this for its
          motto, 'It is the Lord!' all will be shallow and incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          'They that went before and they that came after,' when He entered into
          the holy city in His brief moment of acceptance and pomp, surrounded
          Him with hosannas and jubilant gladness. It is a deep and true symbol
          of the whole history of the world. All the generations that went
          before Him, though they knew it not, were preparing the way of the
          Lord, and heralding the advent of Him who was 'the desire of all
          nations' and 'the light of men'; and all the generations that come
          after, though they know it not, are swelling the pomp of His triumph
          and hastening the time of His crowning and dominion. 'It is the Lord!'
          is the secret of all national existence. It is the secret of all the
          events of the world. The tangled web of human history is only then
          intelligible when that is taken as its clue, 'From Him are all things,
          and to Him are all things.' The ocean from which the stream of history
          flows, and that into which it empties itself, are one. He began it, He
          sustains it. 'The help that is done upon earth He doeth it Himself,'
          and when all is finished, it will be found that all things have indeed
          come from Christ, been sustained and directed by Christ, and have
          tended to the glory and exaltation of that Redeemer, who is King of
          kings and Lord of lords, Maker of the worlds, and before whose throne
          are for ever gathered for service, whether they know it or not, the
          forces of the Gentiles, the riches of the nations, the events of
          history, the fates and destinies of every man.
        </p>
        <p>
          I need not dwell upon the way in which such a conviction as this, my
          friends, living and working in our hearts, would change for us the
          whole aspect of life, and make everything bright and beautiful,
          blessed and calm, strengthening us for all which we might have to do,
          nerving us for duty, and sustaining us against every trial, leading us
          on, triumphant and glad, through regions all sparkling with tokens of
          His presence and signs of His love, unto His throne at last, to lay
          down our praises and our crowns before Him. Only let me leave with you
          this one word of earnest entreaty, that you will lay to heart the
          solemn alternative -- either see Christ in everything, and be blessed;
          or miss Him, and be miserable. Oh! it is a waste, weary world, unless
          it is filled with signs of His presence. It is a dreary seventy years,
          brother, of pilgrimage and strife, unless, as you travel along the
          road, you see the marks that He who went before you has left by the
          wayside for your guidance and your sustenance. If you want your days
          to be true, noble, holy, happy, manly, and Godlike, believe us, it is
          only when they all have flowing through them this conviction, 'It is
          the Lord!' that they all become so.
        </p>
        <p>II. Then, secondly, only they who love, see Christ.</p>
        <p>
          John, the Apostle of Love, knew Him first. In religious matters, love
          is the foundation of knowledge. There is no way of knowing a Person
          except love. The knowledge of God and the knowledge of Christ are not
          to be won by the exercise of the understanding. A man cannot argue his
          way into knowing Christ. No skill in drawing inferences will avail him
          there. The treasures of wisdom -- earthly wisdom -- are all powerless
          in that region. Man's understanding and natural capacity -- let it
          keep itself within its own limits and region, and it is strong and
          good; but in the region of acquaintance with God and Christ, the
          wisdom of this world is foolishness, and man's understanding is not
          the organ by which he can know Christ. Oh no! there is a better way
          than that: 'He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.' As
          it is, in feebler measure, with regard to our personal acquaintance
          with one another, where it is not so much the power of the
          understanding, or the quickness of the perception, or the talent and
          genius of a man, that make the foundation of his knowledge of his
          friend, as the force of his sympathy and the depth of his affection;
          so -- with the necessary modification arising from the transference
          from earthly acquaintances to the great Friend and Lover of our souls
          in heaven -- so is it with regard to our knowledge of Christ. Love
          will trace Him everywhere, as dear friends can detect each other in
          little marks which are meaningless to others. Love's quick eye pierces
          through disguises impenetrable to a colder scrutiny. Love has in it a
          longing for His presence which makes us eager and quick to mark the
          lightest sign that He for whom it longs is near, as the footstep of
          some dear one is heard by the sharp ear of affection long before any
          sound breaks the silence to those around. Love leads to likeness to
          the Lord, and that likeness makes the clearer vision of the Lord
          possible. Love to Him strips from our eyes the film that self and sin,
          sense and custom, have drawn over them. It is these which hide Him
          from us. It is because men are so indifferent to, so forgetful of,
          their best Friend that they fail to behold Him, 'It is the Lord!' is
          written large and plain on all things, but like the great letters on a
          map, they are so obvious and fill so wide a space, that they are not
          seen. They who love Him know Him, and they who know Him love Him. The
          true eye-salve for our blinded eyes is applied when we have turned
          with our hearts to Christ. The simple might of faithful love opens
          them to behold a more glorious vision than the mountain 'full of
          chariots of fire,' which once flamed before the prophet's servant of
          old -- even the august and ever-present form of the Lord of life, the
          Lord of history, the Lord of providence. When they who love Jesus turn
          to see 'the Voice that speaks with them,' they ever behold the Son of
          Man in His glory; and where others see but the dim beach and a
          mysterious stranger, it is to their lips that the glad cry first
          comes, 'It is the Lord!'
        </p>
        <p>
          And is it not a blessed thing, brethren! that thus this high and
          glorious prerogative of recognising the marks of Christ's presence
          everywhere, of going through life gladdened by the assurance of His
          nearness, does not depend on what belongs to few men only, but on what
          may belong to all? When we say that 'not many wise men after the
          flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called' -- when we say
          that love is the means of knowledge -- we are but in other words
          saying that the way is open to all, and that no characteristics
          belonging to classes, no powers that must obviously always belong to
          but a handful, are necessary for the full apprehension of the power
          and blessedness of Christ's Gospel. The freeness and the fullness of
          that divine message, the glorious truth that it is for all men, and is
          offered to all, are couched in that grand principle, Love that thou
          mayest know; love, and thou art filled with the fullness of God, Not
          for the handful, not for the <i>elite</i> of the world; not for the
          few, but for the many; not for the wise, but for all; not for classes,
          but for humanity -- for all that are weak, and sinful, and needy, and
          foolish, and darkened He comes, who only needs that the heart that
          looks should love, and then it shall behold!
        </p>
        <p>
          But if that were the whole that I have to say, I should have said but
          little to the purpose. It very little avails to tell men to love. We
          cannot love to order, or because we think it duty. There is but one
          way of loving, and that is to see the lovely. The disciple who loved
          Jesus was 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.' Generalise that, and it
          teaches us this, that

          III. They love who know that Christ loves them. His divine and eternal
          mercy is the foundation of the whole. Our love, brethren, can never be
          any thing else than our echo to His voice of tenderness than the
          reflected light upon our hearts of the full glory of His affection. No
          man loveth God except the man who has first learned that God loves
          him. 'We love Him, because He first loved us.' And when we say, 'Love
          Christ,' if we could not go on to say, 'Nay, rather let Christ's love
          come down upon you' -- we had said worse than nothing. The fountain
          that rises in my heart can only spring up heavenward, because the
          water of it has flowed down into my heart from the higher level. All
          love must descend first, before it can ascend. We have, then, no
          Gospel to preach, if we have only this to preach, 'Love, and thou art
          saved.' But we have a Gospel that is worth the preaching, when we can
          come to men who have no love in their hearts, and say, 'Brethren!
          listen to this -- you have to bring nothing, you are called upon to
          originate no affection; you have nothing to do but simply to receive
          the everlasting love of God in Christ His Son, which was without us,
          which began before us, which flows forth independent of us, which is
          unchecked by all our sins, which triumphs over all our transgressions,
          and which will make us -- loveless, selfish, hardened, sinful men --
          soft, and tender, and full of divine affection, by the communication
          of its own self.

          Oh, then, look to Christ, that you may love Him! Think, brethren, of
          that full, and free, and boundless mercy which, from eternity, has
          been pouring itself out in floods of grace and loving-kindness over
          all creatures. Think of that everlasting love which presided at the
          foundation of the earth, and has sustained it ever since. Think of
          that Saviour who has died for us, and lives for us. Think of Christ,
          the heart of God, and the fullness of the Father's mercy; and do not
          think of yourselves at all. Do not ask yourselves, to begin with, the
          question, Do I love Him or do I not? You will never love by that
          means. If a man is cold, let him go to the fire and warm himself. If
          he is dark, let him stand in the sunshine, and he will be light. If
          his heart is all clogged and clotted with sin and selfishness, let him
          get under the influence of the love of Christ, and look away from
          himself and his own feelings, towards that Saviour whose love shed
          abroad is the sole means of kindling ours. You have to go down deeper
          than <i>your</i> feelings, <i>your</i> affections,
          <i>your</i> desires, <i>your</i> character. There you will find no
          resting-place, no consolation, no power. Dig down to the living Rock,
          Christ and His infinite love to you, and let <i>it</i> be the strong
          foundation, built into which you and your love may become living
          stones, a holy temple, partaking of the firmness and nature of that on
          which it rests. They that love do so because they know that Christ
          loves them; and they that love see Him everywhere; and they that see
          Him everywhere are blessed for evermore. And let no man here torture
          himself, or limit the fullness of this message that we preach, by
          questionings whether Christ loves Him or not. Are you a man? are you
          sinful? have you broken God's law? do you need a Saviour? Then put
          away all these questions, and believe that Christ's personal love is
          streaming out for the whole world, and that there is a share for you
          if you like to take it and be blessed!

          There is one last thought arising from the whole subject before us,
          that may be worth mention before I close. Did you ever notice how this
          whole incident might be turned, by a symbolical application, to the
          hour of death, and the vision which may meet us when we come thither?
          It admits of the application, and perhaps was intended to receive the
          application, of such a symbolic reference. The morning is dawning, the
          grey of night going away, the lake is still; and yonder, standing on
          the shore, in the uncertain light, there is one dim Figure, and one
          disciple catches a sight of Him, and another casts himself into the
          water, and they find 'a fire of coals, and fish laid thereon, and
          bread,' and Christ gathers them around His table, and they all know
          that 'It is the Lord!' It is what the death of the Christian man, who
          has gone through life recognising Christ everywhere, may well become:
          -- the morning breaking, and the finished work, and the Figure
          standing on the quiet beach, so that the last plunge into the cold
          flood that yet separates us, will not be taken with trembling
          reluctance; but, drawn to Him by the love beaming out of His face, and
          upheld by the power of His beckoning presence, we shall struggle
          through the latest wave that parts us, and scarcely feel its chill,
          nor know that we <i>have</i> crossed it; till falling blessed at His
          feet, we see, by the nearer and clearer vision of His face, that this
          is indeed heaven. And looking back upon 'the sea that brought us
          thither,' we shall behold its waters flashing in the light of that
          everlasting morning, and hear them breaking in music upon the eternal
          shore. And then, brethren, when all the weary night-watchers on the
          stormy ocean of life are gathered together around Him who watched with
          them from His throne on the bordering mountains of eternity, where the
          day shines for ever -- then He will seat them at His table in His
          kingdom, and none will need to ask, 'Who art Thou?' or 'Where am I?'
          for all shall know that 'It is the Lord!' and the full, perfect,
          unchangeable vision of His blessed face will be heaven!
