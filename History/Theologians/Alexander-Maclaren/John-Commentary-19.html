          'These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace.
          In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have
          overcome the world.' -- JOHN xvi.33.
        </p>
        <p>
          So end these wonderful discourses, and so ends our Lord's teaching
          before His passion. He gathers up in one mighty word the total
          intention of these sweet and deep sayings which we have so long been
          pondering together. He sketches in broad outline the continual
          characteristics of the disciples' life, and closes all with the
          strangest shout of victory, even at the moment when He seems most
          utterly defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall, I think, best lay on our hearts and minds the spirit and
          purpose of these words if we simply follow their course, and look at
          the three things which Christ emphasises here: the inward peace which
          is His purpose for us; the outward tribulation which is our certain
          fate; and the courageous confidence which Christ's victory for us
          gives.
        </p>
        <p>I. Note, then, first, the inward peace.</p>
        <p>
          'These things have I spoken unto you that in Me ye might have peace.'
          Peace is not lethargy; and it is very remarkable to notice how, in
          immediate connection with this great promise, there occur words which
          suggest its opposite -- tribulation and battle. 'In the world ye have
          tribulation.' 'I have overcome' -- that means a fight. These are to go
          side by side with the peace that He promises. The two conditions
          belong to two different spheres. The Christian life bifurcates, as it
          were, into a double root, and moves in two realms -- 'in Me' and 'in
          the world' And the predicates and characteristics of these two lives
          are, in a large measure, diametrically opposite. So here, without any
          contradiction, our Lord brackets together these two opposite
          conditions as both pertaining to the life of a devout soul. He
          promises a peace which co-exists with tribulation and disturbance, a
          peace which is realised in and through conflict and struggle. The tree
          will stand, with its deep roots and its firm bole, unmoved, though
          wildest winds may toss its branches and scatter its leaves. In the
          fortress, beleaguered by the sternest foes, there may be, right in the
          very centre of the citadel, a quiet oratory through whose thick walls
          the noise of battle and the shout of victory or defeat can never
          penetrate. So we may live in a centre of rest, however wild may be the
          uproar in the circumference. 'In Me... peace,' that is the innermost
          life. 'In the world... tribulation,' that is only the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, then, note that this peace, which exists with, and is realised
          through, tribulation and strife, depends upon certain conditions. Our
          Lord does not say, 'Ye have peace,' but 'These things I have spoken
          that you <i>may</i> have it.' It is a possibility; and He lays down
          distinctly and plainly here the twofold set of conditions, in
          fulfilment of which a Christian disciple may dwell secure and still,
          in the midst of all confusion. Note, then, these two.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is peace, if we have it at all, <i>in Him</i>. Now you remember how
          emphatically and loftily, as one of the very key-notes of these
          discourses, our Lord has spoken to us, in them, of 'dwelling in Him'
          as the prerogative and the duty of every Christian. We are in Him as
          in an atmosphere. In Him our true lives are rooted as a tree in the
          soil. We are in Him as a branch in the vine, in Him as the members in
          a body, in Him as the residents in a house. We are in Him by simple
          faith, by the trust that rests all upon Him, by the love that finds
          all in Him, by the obedience that does all for Him. And it is only
          when we are 'in Christ' that we rest, and realise peace. All else
          brings distraction. Even delights trouble. The world may give
          excitement, the world may give vulgar and fleeting joys, the world may
          give stimulus to much that is good and true in us, but there is only
          one thing that gives peace, and that is that our hearts should dwell
          in the Fortress, and should ever be surrounded by Jesus Christ.
          Brother! let nothing tempt us down from the heights, and out from the
          citadel where alone we are at rest; but in the midst of all the
          pressing duties, the absorbing cares, the carking anxieties, the
          seducing temptations of the world, and in the presence of all the
          necessity for noble conflict which the world brings to every man that
          is not its slave, let us try to keep the roots of our lives in contact
          with that soil from which they draw all their nourishment, and to wrap
          ourselves round with the life of Jesus Christ, which shall make an
          impenetrable shield between us and 'the fiery darts of the wicked.'
          Keep on the lee side of the breakwater and your little cock-boat will
          ride out the gale. Keep Christ between you and the hurtling storm, and
          there will be a quiet place below the wall where you may rest, hearing
          not the loud winds when they call. 'These things have I spoken that in
          Me ye might have peace.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another condition. Christ speaks the great words which
          have been occupying us so long, that they may bring to us peace. I
          need not do more than remind you, in a sentence, of the contents of
          these wonderful discourses. Think of how they have spoken to us of our
          Brother's ascension to Heaven to prepare a place for us; of His coming
          again to receive us to Himself; of His presence with us in His
          absence; of His indwelling in us and ours in Him; of His gift to us of
          a divine Spirit. If we believed all these things; if we realised them
          and lived in the faith of them; if we meditated upon them in the midst
          of our daily duties; and if they were real to us, and not mere words
          written down in a Book, how should anything be able to disturb us, or
          to shake our settled confidence? Cleave to the words of the Master,
          and let them pour into your hearts the quietness and confidence which
          nothing else can give. And then, whatsoever storms may be around, the
          heart will be at rest. We find peace nowhere else but where Mary found
          her repose, and could shake off care and 'trouble about many things,'
          sitting at the feet of Jesus, wrapt in His love and listening to His
          word.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Then note, secondly, the outward tribulation which is the certain
          fate of His followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course there is a very sad and true sense in which the warning, 'In
          the world ye shall have tribulation,' applies to all men. Pain and
          sickness, loss and death, the monotony of hard, continuous, unwelcome
          toil, hopes blighted or disappointed even in their fruition, and all
          the other 'ills that flesh is heir to,' afflict us all. But our Lord
          is not speaking here about the troubles that befall men as men, nor
          about the chastisement that befalls them as sinners, nor about the
          evils which dog them because they are mortal or because they are bad,
          but of the yet more mysterious sorrows which fall upon them because
          they are good, 'In the world ye have tribulation,' is the proper
          rendering and reading. It had already begun, and it was to be the
          standing condition and certain fate of all that followed Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already said that the Christian life moves in two spheres, and
          hence there must necessarily be antagonism and conflict. Whoever
          realises the inward life in Christ will more or less, and sooner or
          later, find himself coming into hostile collision with lives which
          only move on the surface and belong to the world. If you and I are
          Christians after the pattern of Jesus Christ, then we dwell in the
          midst of an order of things which is not constituted on or for the
          principles that regulate our lives and the objects at which we aim.
          And hence, in that fundamental discordance between the Christian life
          and society as it is constituted, there must always be, if there be
          honesty and consistency on the side of the Christian man, more or less
          of collision between him and it. All that you regard as axiomatic the
          world regards as folly, if you take Christ for your Teacher. All that
          you labour to secure the world does not care to possess, if you have
          Him for your aim. All that you live to seek it has abandoned; all that
          you desire to obey it will not even consult, if you are taking Christ
          and His law for your rule. And therefore there must come, sooner or
          later, and more or less intensely in all Christian lives, opposition
          and tribulation. You cannot get away from the necessity, so it is as
          well to face it.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt the form of antagonism varies. No doubt the more the world is
          penetrated by Christian principles divorced from their root and
          source, the less vehement and painful will the collision be. But
          <i>there</i> is the gulf, and there it will remain, until the world is
          a Church. No doubt some portion of the battlements of organised
          Christianity has tumbled into the ditch, and made it a little less
          deep. Christians have dropped their standard far too much, and so the
          antagonism is not so plain as it ought to be, and as it used to be,
          and as, some day, it will be. But there it is, and if you are going to
          live out and out like a Christian man, you will get the old sneers
          flung at you. You will be 'crotchety,' 'impracticable,' 'spoiling
          sport,' 'not to be dealt with,' 'a wet blanket,' 'pharisaical,'
          'bigoted,' and all the rest of the pretty words which have been so
          frequently used about the men that try to live like Jesus Christ.
          Never mind! 'In the world ye have tribulation.' 'I bear in my body the
          marks of the Lord Jesus,' the branding-iron which tells to whom the
          slave belongs. And if it is His initials that I carry I may be proud
          of the marks.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at any rate there will be antagonism. You young men in your
          warehouses, you men that go on 'Change', we people that live by our
          pens or our tongues, and find ourselves in opposition to much of the
          tendencies of the present day -- we have all, in our several ways, to
          bear the cross. Do not let us be ashamed of it, and, above all, do not
          let us, for the sake of easing our shoulders, be unfaithful to our
          Master. 'In the world ye have tribulation'; and the Christian man's
          peace has to be like the rainbow that lives above the cataract --
          still and radiant, whilst it shines above the hell of white waters
          that are tortured below.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, notice the courageous confidence which comes from the
          Lord's victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Be of good cheer!' It is the old commandment that rang out to Joshua
          when, on the departure of Moses, the conduct of the war fell into his
          less experienced hands: 'Be strong, and of a good courage; only be
          thou strong and very courageous.' So says the Captain of salvation,
          leaving His soldiers to face the current of the heady fight in the
          field. Like some leader who has climbed the ramparts, or hewed his way
          through the broken ranks of the enemies, and rings out the voice of
          encouragement and call to his followers, our Captain sets before us
          His own example: 'I have overcome the world,' He said that the day
          before Calvary. If that was victory, what would defeat have been?
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, then, how our Lord's life was a true battle. The world tried
          to draw Him away from God by appealing to things desirable to sense,
          as in the wilderness; or to things dreadful to sense, as on the cross;
          and both the one and the other form of temptation He faced and
          conquered. It was no shadow fight which evoked this paean of victory
          from His lips. The reality of His conflict is somewhat concealed from
          us by reason of its calm and the completeness of His conquest. We do
          not appreciate the force that drives a planet upon its path because it
          is calm and continuous and silent, but the power that kept Jesus
          Christ continually faithful to His Father, continually sure of that
          Father's presence, continually averse to all self-will and selfish
          living, was a power mightier then all others that have been manifested
          in the history of humanity. The Captain of our salvation has really
          fought the fight before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mark, again, that our Lord's life is the type of all victorious
          life. The world conquers me when it draws me away from God, when it
          makes me its slave, when it coaxes me to trust it, and urges to
          despair if I lose it. The world conquers me when it comes between me
          and God, when it fills my desires, when it absorbs my energies, when
          it blinds my eyes to the things unseen and eternal. I conquer the
          world when I put my foot upon its temptations, when I crush it down,
          when I shake off its bonds, and when nothing that time and sense, with
          their delights or their dreadfulnesses, can bring, prevents me from
          cleaving to my Father with all my heart, and from living as His child
          here. Whoso thus coerces Time and Sense to be the servants of his
          filial love has conquered them both, and whoso lets them draw him away
          from God is beaten, however successful he may dream himself to be and
          men may call him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends! there is a lesson for Manchester people. Jesus Christ was
          not a very successful man according to the standard of Market Street
          and the Exchange. He made but a poor thing of the world, and He was
          going to be martyred on the cross the day after He said these words.
          And yet that was victory. Ay! Many a man beaten down in the struggle
          of daily life, and making very little of it, according to our vulgar
          estimate, is the true conqueror. Success means making the world a
          stepping-stone to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still further, note our share in the Master's victory -- '<i>I</i>
          have overcome the world. Be <i>ye</i> of good cheer.' That seems an
          irrelevant way of arguing. What does it matter to me though He has
          overcome? So much the better for Him; but what good is it to me?
        </p>
        <p>
          It may aid us somewhat to more strenuous fighting, if we know that a
          brother has fought and conquered, and I do not under-estimate the
          blessing and the benefit of the life of Jesus Christ, as recorded in
          these Scriptures, even from that, as I conceive it, miserably
          inadequate and imperfect point of view. But the victory of Jesus
          Christ is of extremely little practical use to me, if all the use of
          it is to show me how to fight. Ah! you must go a deal deeper than
          that. 'I have overcome the world, and I will come and put My
          overcoming Spirit into your weakness, and fill you with My own
          victorious life, and make your hands strong to war and your fingers to
          fight; and be in you the conquering and omnipotent Power.'
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends! Jesus Christ's victory is ours, and we are victors in it,
          because He is more than the pattern of brave warfare, He is even the
          Son of God, who gave Himself for us, and gives Himself to us, and
          dwells in us our Strength and our Righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, remember that the condition of that victory's being ours is
          the simple act of reliance upon Him and upon it. The man who goes into
          the battle as that little army of the Hebrews did against the
          wide-stretching hosts of the enemy, saying, 'O Lord! we know not what
          to do, but our eyes are up unto Thee,' will come out 'more than
          conqueror through Him that loved him.' For 'this is the victory that
          overcometh the world, even our faith.'
