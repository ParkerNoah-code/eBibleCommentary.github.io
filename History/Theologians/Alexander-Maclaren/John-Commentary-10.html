          'Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go
          away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
          if I depart, I will send Him unto you. And when He is come, He will
          <i>convince</i> the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of
          judgment.' -- JOHN xvi.7, 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read these words in the light of all that has gone after, and to us
          they are familiar and almost thread-bare. But if we would appreciate
          their sublimity, we must think away nineteen centuries, and all
          Christendom, and recall these eleven poor men and their peasant Leader
          in the upper room. They were not very wise, nor very strong, and
          outside these four walls there was scarcely a creature in the whole
          world that had the least belief either in Him or in them. They had
          everything against them, and most of all their own hearts. They had
          nothing for them but their Master's promise. Their eyes had been
          dimmed by their sorrowful hearts, so that they could not see the truth
          which He had been trying to reveal to them; and His departure had
          presented itself to them only as it affected themselves, and therefore
          had brought a sense of loss and desolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now He bids them think of that departure, as it affects
          themselves, as pure gain. 'It is for your profit that I go away.' He
          explains that staggering statement by the thought which He has already
          presented to them, in varying aspects, of His departure as the
          occasion for the coming of that Great Comforter, who, when He is come,
          will through them work upon the world, which knows neither them nor
          Him. They are to go forth 'as sheep in the midst of wolves,' but in
          this promise He tells them that they will become the judges and
          accusers of the world, which, by the Spirit dwelling in them, they
          will be able to overcome, and convict of error and of fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must remember that the whole purpose of the words which we are
          considering now is the strengthening of the disciples in their
          conflict with the world, and that, therefore, the operations of that
          divine Spirit which are here spoken of are operations carried on by
          their instrumentality and through the word which they spake. With that
          explanation we can consider the great words before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first thing that strikes me about them is that wonderful
          thought of the gain to Christ's servants from Christ's departure. 'It
          is expedient for you that I go away.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I need not enlarge here upon what we have had frequent occasion to
          remark, the manner in which our Lord here represents the complex whole
          of His death and ascension as being His own voluntary act. He 'goes.'
          He is neither taken away by death nor rapt up to heaven in a
          whirlwind, but of His own exuberant power and by His own will He goes
          into the region of the grave and thence to the throne. Contrast the
          story of His ascension with that Old Testament story of the ascension
          of Elijah. One needed the chariot of fire and the horses of fire to
          bear him up into the sphere, all foreign to his mortal and earthly
          manhood; the Other needed no outward power to lift Him, nor any
          vehicle to carry Him from this dim spot which men call earth, but
          slowly, serenely, upborne by His own indwelling energy, and rising as
          to His native home, He ascended up on high, and went where the very
          manner of His going proclaimed that He had been before. 'If
          <i>I go</i> away, I will send Him.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But that is a digression. What we are concerned with now is the
          thought of Christ's departure as being a step in advance, and a
          positive gain, even to those poor, bewildered men who were clustering
          round Him, depending absolutely upon Himself, and feeling themselves
          orphaned and helpless without Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if we would feel the full force and singularity of this saying of
          our Lord's, let us put side by side with it that other one, 'I have a
          desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.
          Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.' Why is
          it that the Apostle says, 'Though I want to go I am bound to stay?'
          and why is it that the Master says, 'It is for your good that I am
          going,' but because of the essential difference in the relation of the
          two to the people who are to be left, and in the continuance of the
          work of the two after they had departed? Paul knew that when he went,
          whatever befell those whom he loved and would fain help, he could not
          stretch a hand to do anything for them. He knew that death dropped the
          portcullis between him and them, and, whatever their sore need on the
          one side of the iron gate, he on the other could not succour or save.
          Jesus Christ said, 'It is better for you that I should go,' because He
          knew that all His influences would flow through the grated door
          unchecked, and that, departed, He would still be the life of them that
          trusted in Him; and, having left them, would come near them, by the
          very act of leaving them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so there is here indicated for us -- as we shall have occasion to
          see more fully, presently, -- in that one singular and anomalous fact
          of Christ's departure being a positive gain to those that trust in
          Him, the singularity and uniqueness of His work for them and His
          relation to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words mean a great deal more than the analogies of our relation to
          dear ones or great ones, loves or teachers, who have departed, might
          suggest. Of course we all know that it is quite true that death
          reveals to the heart the sweetness and the preciousness of the
          departed ones, and that its refining touch manifests to our blind eyes
          what we did not see so clearly when they were beside us. We all know
          that it needs distance to measure men, and the dropping away of the
          commonplace and the familiar ere we can see 'the likeness' of our
          contemporaries 'to the great of old.' We have to travel across the
          plains before we can measure the relative height of the clustered
          mountains, and discern which is manifestly the loftiest. And all
          <i>this</i> is true in reference to Jesus Christ and His relation to
          us. But that does not go half-way towards the understanding of such
          words as these of my text, which tell us that so singular and solitary
          is His relation to us that the thing which ends the work of all other
          men, and begins the decay of their influence, begins for Him a higher
          form of work and a wider sweep of sway. He is nearer us when He leaves
          us, and works with us and in us more mightily from the throne than He
          did upon the earth. Who is He of whom this is true? And what kind of
          work is it of which it is true that death continues and perfects it?
        </p>
        <p>
          So let me note, before I pass on, that there is a great truth here for
          us. We are accustomed to look back to our Lord's earthly ministry, and
          to fancy that those who gathered round Him, and heard Him speak, and
          saw His deeds, were in a better position for loving Him and trusting
          Him than you and I are. It is all a mistake. We have lost nothing that
          they had which was worth the keeping; and we have gained a great deal
          which they had not. We have not to compare our relation to Christ with
          theirs, as we might do our relation to some great thinker or poet,
          with that of his contemporaries, but we have Christ in a better form,
          if I may so speak; and we, on whom the ends of the world are come, may
          have a deeper and a fuller and a closer intimacy with Him than was
          possible for men whose perceptions were disturbed by sense, and who
          had to pierce through 'the veil, that is to say, His flesh,' before
          they reached the Holy of Holies of His spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Note, secondly, the coming for which Christ's going was needful,
          and which makes that going a gain.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I
          depart I will send Him unto you.' Now we have already, in former
          sermons, touched upon many of the themes which would naturally be
          suggested by these words, and therefore I do not propose to dwell upon
          them at any length. There is only one point to which I desire to refer
          briefly here, and that is the necessity which here seems to be laid
          down by our Lord for His departure, in order that that divine Spirit
          may come and dwell with men. That necessity goes down deeper into the
          mysteries of the divinity and of the processes and order of divine
          revelation than it is given to us to follow. But though we can only
          speak superficially and fragmentarily about such a matter, let me just
          remind you, in the briefest possible words, of what Scripture plainly
          declares to us with regard to this high and, in its fullness,
          ineffable matter. It tells us that the complete work of Jesus Christ
          -- not merely His coming upon earth, or His life amongst men, but also
          His sacrificial death upon the Cross -- was the necessary preliminary,
          and in some sense procuring cause, of the gift of that divine Spirit.
          It tells us -- and there we are upon ground on which we can more fully
          verify the statement -- that His work must be completed ere that
          Spirit can be sent, because the word is the Spirit's weapon for the
          world, and the revelation of God in Jesus must be ended, ere the
          application of that revelation, which is the Spirit's work, can be
          begun in its full energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It tells us, further, (and there our eyesight fails, and we have to
          accept what we are told), that Jesus Christ must ascend on high and be
          at the right hand of God, ere He can pour down upon men the fullness
          of the Spirit which dwelt uncommunicated in Him in the time of His
          earthly humiliation. 'Thou hast ascended up on high,' and therefore
          'Thou hast given gifts to men.' We accept the declaration, not knowing
          all the deep necessity in the divine Nature on which it rests, but
          believing it, because He in whom we have confidence has declared it to
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we are further told -- and there our experience may, in some
          degree, verify the statement, -- that only those, in whose hearts
          there is union to Jesus Christ by faith in His completed work and
          ascended glory, are capable of receiving that divine gift. So every
          way, both as regards the depths of Deity and the processes of
          revelation, and as regards the power of the humanity of Christ to
          impart His Spirit, and as regards the capacity of us poor recipients
          to receive it, the words of my text seem to be confirmed, and we can,
          though not with full insight, at any rate with full faith, accept the
          statement, 'If I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you.'
        </p>
        <p>
          That coming is gain. It teaches a deeper knowledge of Him. It teaches
          and gives a fuller possession of the life of righteousness which is
          like His own. It draws us into the fellowship of the Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, note here the threefold conflict of the Spirit through
          the Church with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          'When He is come He will convict the world' in respect 'of sin and of
          righteousness and of judgment.' By the 'reproof,' or rather
          'conviction,' which is spoken about here, is meant the process by
          which certain facts are borne in upon men's understanding and
          consciences, and, along with these facts, the conviction of error and
          fault in reference to them. It is no mere process of demonstration of
          an intellectual truth, but it is a process of conviction of error in
          respect to great moral and religious truth, and of manifestation of
          the truths in regard to which the error and the sin have been
          committed. So we have here the triple division of the great work which
          the divine Spirit does, through Christian men and women, in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He shall convict the world of sin.' The outstanding first
          characteristic of the whole Gospel message is the new gravity which it
          attaches to the fact of sin, the deeper meaning which it gives to the
          word, and the larger scope which it shows its blighting influences to
          have had in humanity. Apart from the conviction of sin by the Spirit
          using the word proclaimed by disciples, the world has scarcely a
          notion of what sin is, its inwardness, its universality, the awfulness
          of it as a fact affecting man's whole being and all his relations to
          God. All these conceptions are especially the product of Christian
          truth. Without it, what does the world know about the poison of sin?
          And what does it care about the poison until the conviction has been
          driven home to the reluctant consciousness of mankind by the Spirit
          wielding the word? This conviction comes first in the divine order. I
          do not say that the process of turning a man of the world into a
          member of Christ's Church always begins, as a matter of fact, with the
          conviction of sin. I believe it most generally does so; but without
          insisting upon a pedantic adherence to a sequence, and without saying
          a word about the depth and intensity of such a conviction, I am here
          to assert that a Christianity which is not based upon the conviction
          of sin is an impotent Christianity, and will be of very little use to
          the men who profess it, and will have no power to propagate itself in
          the world. Everything in our conception of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
          and of His work for us depends upon what we think about this primary
          fact of man's condition, that he is a sinful man. The root of all
          heresy lies there. Every error that has led away men from Jesus Christ
          and His Cross may be traced up to defective notions of sin and a
          defective realisation of it. If I do not feel as the Bible would have
          me feel, that I am a sinful man, I shall think differently of Jesus
          Christ and of my need of Him, and of what He is to me. Christianity
          may be to me a system of beautiful ethics, a guide for life, a
          revelation of much precious truth, but it will not be the redemptive
          power without which I am lost. And Jesus Christ will be shorn of His
          brightest beams, unless I see Him as the Redeemer of my soul from sin,
          which else would destroy and is destroying it. Is Christianity merely
          a better morality? Is it merely a higher revelation of the divine
          Nature? Or does it <i>do</i> something as well as
          <i>say</i> something, and what does it do? Is Jesus Christ only a
          Teacher, a Wise Man, an Example, a Prophet, or is He the Sacrifice for
          the sins of the world? Oh, brethren, we must begin where this text
          begins; and our whole conception of Him and of His work for us must be
          based upon this fact, that we are sinful and lost, and that Jesus
          Christ, by His sweet and infinite love and all-powerful sacrifice, is
          our soul's Redeemer and our only Hope. The world has to be convicted
          and convinced of sin as the first step to its becoming a Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step of this divine Spirit's conviction is that which
          corresponds to the consciousness of sin, the dawning upon the darkened
          soul of the blessed sunrise of righteousness. The triple subjects of
          conviction must necessarily belong to the world of which our Lord is
          speaking. It must be the world that is convinced, and it must be the
          world's sin and the world's righteousness and the world's judgment of
          which my text speaks. How, then, can there follow on the conviction of
          sin as mine a conviction of righteousness as mine? I know but one way,
          'Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that
          which is of God through faith.' When a man is convinced of sin, there
          will dawn upon the heart the wondrous thought that a righteousness may
          be his, given to him from above, which will sweep away all his sin and
          make him righteous as Christ is righteous. That conviction will never
          awake in its blessed and hope-giving power unless it be preceded by
          the other. It is of no use to exhibit medicine to a man who does not
          know himself diseased. It is of no use to talk about righteousness to
          a man who has not found himself to be a sinner. And it is of as little
          use to talk to a man of sin unless you are ready to tell him of a
          righteousness that will cover all his sin. The one conviction without
          the other is misery, the second without the first is irrelevant and
          far away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world as a world has but dim and inadequate conceptions of what
          righteousness is. A Pharisee is its type, or a man that keeps a clean
          life in regard to great transgressions; a whited sepulchre of some
          sort or other. The world apart from Christ has but languid desires
          after even the poor righteousness that it understands, and the world
          apart from Christ is afflicted by a despairing scepticism as to the
          possibility of ever being righteous at all. And there are men
          listening to me now in every one of these three conditions -- not
          caring to be righteous, not understanding what it is to be righteous,
          and cynically disbelieving that it is possible to be so. My brother,
          here comes the message to you -- first, Thou art sinful; second, God's
          righteousness lies at thy side to take and wear if thou wilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last of these triple convictions is 'judgment.' If there be in the
          world these two things both operating, sin and righteousness, and if
          the two come together, what then? If there is to be a collision, as
          there must be, which will go down? Christ tells us that this divine
          Spirit will teach us that righteousness will triumph over sin, and
          that there will be a judgment which will destroy that which is the
          weaker, though it seems the stronger. Now I take it that the judgment
          which is spoken about here is not merely a future retribution beyond
          the grave, but that, whilst that is included, and is the principal
          part of the idea, we are always to regard the judgment of the
          hereafter as being prepared for by the continual judgment here.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so there are two thoughts, a blessed one and a terrible one,
          wrapped up in that word -- a blessed thought for us sinful men,
          inasmuch as we may be sure that the divine righteousness, which is
          given to us, will judge us and separate us day by day from our sins;
          and a terrible thought, inasmuch as if I, a sinful man, do not make
          friends with and ally myself to the divine righteousness which is
          proffered to me, I shall one day have to front it on the other side of
          the flood, when the contact must necessarily be to me destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time does not allow me to dwell upon these solemn matters as I fain
          would, but let me gather all I have been feebly trying to say to you
          now into one sentence. This threefold conviction, in conscience,
          understanding, and heart, of sin which is mine, of righteousness which
          may be mine, and of judgment which must be mine -- this threefold
          conviction is that which makes the world into a Church. It is the
          message of Christianity to each of us. How do you stand to it? Do you
          hearken to the Spirit who is striving to convince you of these? Or do
          you gather yourselves together into an obstinate, close-knit unbelief,
          or a loose-knit indifference which is as impenetrable? Beware that you
          resist not the Spirit of God!
