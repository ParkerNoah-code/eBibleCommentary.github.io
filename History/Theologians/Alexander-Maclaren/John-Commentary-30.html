          'Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross.' -- JOHN xix.19.
        </p>
        <p>
          This title is recorded by all four Evangelists, in words varying in
          form but alike in substance. It strikes them all as significant that,
          meaning only to fling a jeer at his unruly subjects, Pilate should
          have written it, and proclaimed this Nazarene visionary to be He for
          whom Israel had longed through weary ages. John's account is the
          fullest, as indeed his narrative of all Pilate's shufflings is the
          most complete. He alone records that the title was tri-lingual (for
          the similar statement in the Authorised Version of Luke is not part of
          the original text). He alone gives the Jews' request for an alteration
          of the title, and Pilate's bitter answer. That angry reply betrays his
          motive in setting up such words over a crucified prisoner's head. They
          were meant as a savage taunt of the Jews, not as an insult to Jesus,
          which would have been welcome to them. He seems to have regarded our
          Lord as a harmless enthusiast, to have had a certain liking for Him,
          and a languid curiosity as to Him, which came by degrees to be just
          tinged with awe as he felt that he could not quite make Him out.
          Throughout, he was convinced that His claim to be a king contained no
          menace for Caesar, and he would have let Jesus go but for fear of
          being misrepresented at Rome. He felt that the sacrifice of one more
          Jew was a small price to pay to avert his accusation to Caesar; he
          would have sacrificed a dozen such to keep his place. But he felt that
          he was being coerced to do injustice, and his anger and sense of
          humiliation find vent in that written taunt. It was a spurt of bad
          temper and a measure of his reluctance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the interest attaching to it as Pilate's work, it seems to
          John significant of much that it should have been fastened on the
          Cross, and that it should have been in the three languages, Hebrew
          (Aramaic), Greek, and Latin.
        </p>
        <p>Let us deal with three points in succession.</p>
        <p>I. The title as throwing light on the actors in the tragedy.</p>
        <p>
          We may consider it, first, in its bearing on Jesus' claims. He was
          condemned by the priests on the theocratic charge of blasphemy,
          because He made Himself the Son of God. He was sentenced by Pilate on
          the civil charge of rebellion, which the priests brought against Him
          as an inference necessarily resulting from His claim to be the Son of
          God. They drew the same conclusion as Nathanael did long before:
          'Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God,' and therefore 'Thou art the King of
          Israel.' And they were so far right that if the former designation is
          correct, the latter inevitably follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both charges, then, turned on His personal claims. To Pilate He
          explained the nature of His kingdom, so as to remove any suspicion
          that it would bring Him and His subjects into collision with Rome, but
          He asserted His kingship, and it was His own claim that gave Pilate
          the material for His gibe. It is worth notice, then, that these two
          claims from His own lips, made to the authorities who respectively
          took cognisance of the theocratic and of the civic life of the nation,
          and at the time when His life hung on the decision of the two, were
          the causes of His judicial sentence. The people who allege that Jesus
          never made the preposterous claims for Himself which Christians have
          made for Him, but was a simple Teacher of morality and lofty religion,
          have never fairly faced the simple question: 'For what, then, was He
          crucified?' It is easy for them to dilate on the hatred of the Jewish
          officials and the gross earthliness of the masses, as explaining the
          attitude of both, but it is not so easy to explain how material was
          found for judicial process. One can understand how Jesus was detested
          by rulers, and how they succeeded in stirring up popular feeling
          against Him, but not how an indictment that would hold water was
          framed against Him. Nor would even Pilate's complaisance have gone so
          far as to have condemned a prisoner against whom all that could be
          said was that he was disliked because he taught wisely and well and
          was too good for his critics. The question is, not what made Jesus
          disliked, but what set the Law in motion against Him? And no plausible
          answer has ever been given except the one that was nailed above His
          head on the Cross. It was not His virtues or the sublimity of His
          teaching, but His twofold claim to be Son of God and King of Israel
          that haled Him to His death.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may further ask why Jesus did not clear up the mistakes, if they
          were mistakes, that led to His condemnation. Surely He owed it to the
          two tribunals before which He stood, no less than to Himself and His
          followers, to disown the erroneous interpretations on which the
          charges against Him were based. Even a Caiaphas was entitled to be
          told, if it were so, that He meant no blasphemy and was not claiming
          anything too high for a reverent Israelite, when He claimed to be the
          Son of God. If Jesus let the Sanhedrim sentence Him under a mistake of
          what His words meant, He was guilty of His own death.
        </p>
        <p>
          We note, further, the light thrown by the Title on Pilate's action. It
          shows his sense of the unreality of the charge which he basely allowed
          himself to be forced into entertaining as a ground of condemning
          Jesus. If this enigmatical prisoner had had a sword, there would have
          been some substance in the charge against Him, but He was plainly an
          idea-monger, and therefore quite harmless, and His kingship only fit
          to be made a jest of and a means of girding at the rulers. 'Practical
          men' always under-estimate the power of ideas. The Title shows the
          same contempt for 'mere theorisers' as animated his question, 'What is
          truth?' How little he knew that this 'King,' at whom he thought that
          he could launch clumsy jests, had lodged in the heart of the Empire a
          power which would shatter and remould it!
        </p>
        <p>
          In his blindness to the radiant truth that stood before him, in the
          tragedy of his condemnation of that to which he should have yielded
          himself, Pilate stands out as a beacon for all time, warning the world
          against looking for the forces that move the world among the powers
          that the world recognises and honours. If we would not commit Pilate's
          fault over again, we must turn to 'the base things of this world' and
          the 'things that are not' and find in them the transforming powers
          destined to 'bring to nought things that are.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilate's gibe was an unconscious prophecy. He thought it an exquisite
          jest, for it hurt. He was an instance of that strange irony that runs
          through history, and makes, at some crisis, men utter fateful words
          that seem put into their lips by some higher power. Caiaphas and he,
          the Jewish chief of the Sanhedrim and the Roman procurator, were
          foremost in Christ's condemnation, and each of them spoke such words,
          profoundly true and far beyond the speaker's thoughts. Was the
          Evangelist wrong in saying: 'This spake he not of himself?'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Title on the Cross as unveiling the ground of Christ's
          dominion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed a ludicrous travesty of royalty that a criminal dying there,
          with a crowd of his 'subjects' gloating on his agonies and shooting
          arrowy words of scorn at him, should be a King. But His cross
          <i>is</i> His throne. It is so because His death is His great work for
          the world. It is so because in it we see, with melted hearts, the
          sublimest revelation of His love. Absolute authority belongs to utter
          self-sacrifice. He, and only He, who gives Himself wholly to and for
          me, thereby acquires the right of absolute command over me. He is the
          'Prince of all the kings of the earth,' because He has died and become
          the 'First-begotten from the dead.' From the hour when He said, 'I, if
          I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me,' down to the hour when the
          seer heard the storm of praise from 'ten thousand times ten thousand,
          and thousands of thousands' breaking round the throne, every New
          Testament reference to Christ's dominion is accompanied with a
          reference to His cross, and every reference to His cross merges in a
          reference to His throne. The crown of thorns was a revelation of the
          inmost nature of Christ's rule. The famous Iron Crown of Milan is a
          hard, cold circlet within a golden covering blazing with jewels.
          Christ's right to sway men, like His power to do so, rests on His
          sacrifice for men. A Christianity without a Cross is a Christianity
          without authority, as has been seen over and over again in the history
          of the Church, and as is being seen again today, if men would only
          look. A Christ without a Cross is a Christ without a Kingdom. The
          dominion of the world belongs to Him who can sway men's inmost
          motives. Hearts are His who has bought them with His own.
        </p>
        <p>III. The Title as prophesying Christ's universal dominion.</p>
        <p>
          The three tongues in which it was written were chosen simply to make
          it easy to read by the crowd from every part of the Empire assembled
          at the Passover. There were Palestinian Jews there who probably read
          Aramaic only, and representatives from the widely diffused Jewish
          emigration in Greek-speaking lands, as well as Roman officials and
          Jews from Italy who would be most familiar with Latin. Pilate wanted
          his shaft to reach them all. It was, in its tri-lingual character, a
          sign of Israel's degradation and a flourishing of the whip in their
          faces, as a government order in English placarded in a Bengalee
          village might be, or a Russian ukase in Warsaw. Its very wording
          betrayed a foreign hand, for a Jew would have written 'King of
          Israel,' not 'of the Jews.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But John divined a deeper meaning in this Title, just as he found a
          similar prophecy of the universality of Christ's death in the
          analogous word of Caiaphas. As in that saying he heard a faint
          prediction that Jesus should die 'not for that people only, but that
          He might also gather into one the scattered children of God,' so he
          feels that Pilate was wiser than he knew, and that his written words
          in their threefold garb symbolised the relation of Christ and His work
          to the three great types of civilisation which it found possessed of
          the field. It bent them all to its own purposes, absorbed them into
          itself, used their witness and was propagated by means of them, and
          finally sucked the life out of them and disintegrated them. The Jew
          contributed the morality and monotheism of the Old Testament; the
          Greek, culture and the perfected language that should contain the
          treasure, the fresh wine-skin for the new wine; the Roman made the
          diffusion of the kingdom possible by the <i>pax Romana</i>, and at
          first sheltered the young plant. All three, no doubt, marred as well
          as helped the development of Christianity, and infused into it
          deleterious elements, which cling to it to-day, but the prophecy of
          the Title was fulfilled and these three tongues became heralds of the
          Cross and with 'loud, uplifted trumpets blew' glad tidings to the ends
          of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          That Title thus became an unconscious prophecy of Christ's universal
          dominion. The Psalmist that sang of Messiah's world-wide rule was sure
          that 'all nations shall serve Him,' and the reason why he was certain
          of it was '<i>for</i> He shall deliver the needy when he crieth.' We
          may be certain of it for the same reason. He who can deal with man's
          primal needs, and is ready and able to meet every cry of the heart,
          will never want suppliants and subjects. He who can respond to our
          consciousness of sin and weakness, and can satisfy hungry hearts, will
          build His sway over the hearts whom He satisfies on foundations deep
          as life itself. The history of the past becomes a prophecy of the
          future. Jesus has drawn men of all sorts, of every stage of culture
          and layer of civilisation, and of every type of character to Him, and
          the power which has carried a peasant of Nazareth to be the
          acknowledged King of the civilised world is not exhausted, and will
          not be till He is throned as Saviour and Ruler of the whole earth.
          There is only one religion in the world that is obviously growing. The
          gods of Greece and Rome are only subjects for studies in Comparative
          Mythology, the labyrinthine pantheon of India makes no conquests,
          Buddhism is moribund. All other religions than Christianity are shut
          up within definite and comparatively narrow geographical and
          chronological limits. But in spite of premature jubilations of enemies
          and much hasty talk about the need for a re- statement (which
          generally means a negation) of Christian truth, we have a clear right
          to look forward with quiet confidence. Often in the past has the
          religion of Jesus seemed to be wearing or worn out, but it has a
          strange recuperative power, and is wont to startle its enemies' paeans
          over its grave by rising again and winning renewed victories. The
          Title on the Cross is for ever true, and is written again in nobler
          fashion 'on the vesture and on the thigh' of Him who rides forth at
          last to rule the nations, 'KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.'
