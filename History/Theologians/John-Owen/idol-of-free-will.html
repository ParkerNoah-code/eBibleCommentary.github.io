            Our next task is to take a view of the idol himself, of this great
            deity of FREE-WI LL, whose original being not well known. He is
            pretended, like the Ephesian image of Diana[1], to have fallen down
            from heaven and to have his endowments from above. But yet
            considering what a nothing he was a this first discovery in
            comparison of that vast giant-like hugeness to which now he is
            grown, we may say of him as the painter said of his monstrous
            picture, which he had mended or rather marred according to every
            one’s fancy, “It is the issue[2] of the people’s brain.” Origen[3]
            is supposed to have brought him first into the church; but among
            those many sincere worshippers of divine grace, this setter forth of
            new demons found but little entertainment. It was looked upon but
            like the stump of Dagon with his head and hands laid down before the
            ark of God without whose help he could neither know nor do that
            which is good in any kind, still accounted but “a fig – tree log, an
            unprofitable piece of wood.” The fathers of the succeeding ages had
            much debate to what use they should put it, and though some exalted
            it a degree or two above its merits, yet the most concluded to keep
            it a block still until at length there arose a stout champion,[4]
            challenging on his behalf the whole church of God, and like a
            knight-errant,[5] wandered from the west to the east to grapple with
            any that should oppose his idol; who, though he met with divers
            adversaries, one especially,[6] who in the behalf of the grace of
            God continually foiled him and cast him to the ground, and that in
            the judgment of all the lawful judges assembled in councils and in
            the opinion of most of the Christian bystanders. Yet by his cunning
            insinuation,[7] he planted such an opinion of his idol’s deity and
            self-sufficiency in the hearts of divers[8] that to this day it
            could never be rooted out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now after the decease of his Pelagian worshippers, some of the
            corrupter schoolmen,[9] seeing him thus from his birth exposed
            without shelter to wind and weather, to all assaults, out of mere
            charity and self-love built him a temple and adorned it with natural
            lights, merits, uncontrolled independent operations, [and] many
            other gay attendances. But in the beginning of the Reformation—that
            fatal time for idolatry and superstition together with abbeys and
            monasteries—the zeal and learning of our forefathers with the help
            of God’s Word demolished this temple and brake this building down to
            the ground. In the rubbish whereof we well hoped the idol himself
            had been so deeply buried as that his head should never more have
            been exalted to the trouble of the church of God, until not long
            since some curious wits, whose weak stomachs were clogged with manna
            and loathed the sincere milk of the word, raking all dunghills for
            novelties, lighted unhappily upon this idol, and presently with no
            less joy than did the mathematician at the discovery of a new
            geometrical proportion exclaim, “We have found it! We have found
            it!” And without more ado, up they erected a shrine, and until this
            day continue offering of praise and thanks for all the good they do
            to this work of their own hands.[10]
          </p>
          <p>
            And that the idol may be free from ruin, to which in himself they
            have found by experience that he is subject, they have matched him
            to contingency,[11] a new goddess of their own creation, who having
            proved very fruitful in monstrous births upon their
            conjunctions,[12] they nothing doubt they shall never [lack] one to
            set on the throne and make president of all human actions. So that
            after he hath, with various success at least twelve hundred years,
            contended with the providence and grace of God, he boasteth now as
            if he had obtained a total victory. But yet all his prevailing is to
            be attributed to the diligence and varnish of his new abettors[13]
            with—to our shame be it spoken!—the negligence of his adversaries.
            In him and his cause there is no more real worth than was when by
            the ancient fathers he was exploded and cursed out of the church. So
            that they, who can attain, through the many winding labyrinths of
            curious distinctions to look upon the thing itself, shall find that
            they have been like Egyptian novices, brought, through many stately
            frontispieces[14] and goodly fabrics with much show of zeal and
            devotion, to the image of an ugly ape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet here observe, that we do not absolutely oppose free-will, as if
            it were a mere figment [or as if] there is no such thing in the
            world, but only in that sense the Pelagians and Arminians[15] do
            assert it. About words we will not contend. We grant man in the
            substance of all his actions as much power, liberty, and freedom as
            a mere created nature is capable of. We grant him to be free in his
            choice from all outward coaction[16] or inward natural necessity to
            work according to [choice] and deliberation, spontaneously embracing
            what seemeth good unto him. Now call this power free-will or what
            you please, [as long as] you make it not supreme, independent, and
            boundless, we are not at all troubled. The imposition of names
            depends upon the discretion of their inventers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, even in spiritual things, we deny that our wills are at all
            debarred[17] or deprived of their proper liberty. But here we say,
            indeed, that we are not properly free until the Son makes us free .
            . .we do not claim such a liberty as should make us despise the
            grace of God, whereby we may attain true liberty indeed, which
            addeth to, but taketh nothing from our original freedom. But of
            this, after I have showed what an idol the Arminians make of
            free-will. Only take notice in the entrance that we speak of it now,
            not as it was at first by God created, but as it is now by sin
            corrupted; yet being considered in that estate also, they ascribe
            more unto it than it was ever capable of.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Herein,” saith Arminius, “consisteth the liberty of the will, that
            all things required to enable it to will anything being
            accomplished, it still remains indifferent[18] to will or not.” And
            all of them at the Synod:[19] “There is,” say they, “accompanying
            the will of man an inseparable property, which we call liberty, from
            whence the will is termed a power, which when all things prerequired
            as necessary to operation are fulfilled, may will anything or not
            will it.” That is, our free-wills have such an absolute and
            uncontrollable power in the territory of all human actions, that no
            influence of God’s providence, no certainty of His decree, no
            unchangeableness of His purpose can sway it at all in its free
            determinations or have any power with His highness to cause him to
            will or resolve on any such act as God by him intendeth to produce!
            Take an instance in the great work of our conversion. “All
            unregenerate men” saith Arminius, “have by virtue of their free-will
            a power of resisting the Holy Spirit, of rejecting the offered grace
            of God, of contemning[20] the counsel of God concerning themselves,
            of refusing the gospel of grace, of not opening the heart to him
            that knocketh.” What a stout idol is this, whom neither the Holy
            Spirit, the grace and counsel of God, the calling of the gospel, the
            knocking at the door of the heart, can move at all, or in the least
            measure prevail against him! Woe be unto us then, if when God calls
            us, our free-will be not in good temper and well disposed to hearken
            unto Him! For it seems there is no dealing with it by any other
            ways, though powerful and almighty. “For grant” saith Corvinus,[21]
            “all the operations of grace which God can use in our conversion,
            yet conversion remaineth so in our own free power that we can be not
            converted; that is, we can either turn or not turn ourselves,” where
            the idol plainly challengeth the Lord to work His utmost and tells
            Him that after He hath so done, he will do what he please. His
            infallible prescience,[22] His powerful predetermination, the moral
            efficacy of the gospel, the infusion of grace, the effectual
            operation of the Holy Spirit, all are nothing, not at all available
            in helping or furthering our independent wills in their proceedings.
            Well, then in what estate will you have the idol placed?
          </p>
          <p>
            “In such a one wherein he may be suffered to sin or to do well at
            his pleasure” as the same author intimates. It seems then as to sin,
            so nothing is required for him to be able to do good but God’s
            permission? No! For the Remonstrants[23] “do always suppose a free
            power of obeying or not obeying, as well in those who do obey as in
            those who do not obey”—where all the praise of our obedience,
            whereby we are made to differ from others, is ascribed to ourselves
            alone, and that free power that is in us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, this they mean not of any one act of obedience, but of faith
            itself, and the whole consummation thereof. “For if a man should
            say, that every man in the world hath a power of believing if he
            will, and of attaining salvation, and that this power is settled in
            his nature, what argument have you to confute[24] him?” saith
            Arminius triumphantly to Perkins,[25] where the sophistical
            innovator[26] as plainly confounds grace and nature as ever did
            Pelagius. That, then, which the Arminians claim here in behalf of
            their free-will is, an absolute independence of God’s providence in
            doing anything, and of His grace in doing that which is good—a
            self-sufficiency in all its operations, a plenary indifferency[27]
            of doing what we will, this or that, as being neither determined to
            the one nor inclined to the other by any overruling influence from
            heaven. So that the good acts of our wills have no dependence on
            God’s providence as they are acts or on His grace as they are good,
            but in both regards proceed from such a principle within us as is no
            way moved by any superior agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the first of these we deny unto our wills because they are
            created; and the second because they are corrupted. Their creation
            hinders them from doing anything of themselves without the
            assistance of God’s providence; and their corruption from doing
            anything that is good without His grace. A selfsufficiency for
            operation without the effectual motion of Almighty God, the first
            cause of all things, we can allow neither to men nor angels unless
            we intend to make them gods. And a power of doing good equal unto
            that they have of doing evil, we must not grant to man by nature
            unless we will deny the fall of Adam and fancy ourselves still in
            Paradise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Endued we are with such a liberty of will as is free from all
            outward compulsion and inward necessity, having an elective faculty
            of applying itself unto that which seems good unto it, in which it
            is a free choice. Notwithstanding, it is subservient to the decree
            of God, as I showed before. Most free it is in all its acts, both in
            regard of the object it chooseth and in regard of that vital power
            and faculty whereby it worketh, infallibly complying with God’s
            providence and working by virtue of the motion thereof. But surely
            to assert such a supreme independency and every way unbounded
            indifferency as the Arminians claim, whereby, all other things
            requisite being presupposed, it should remain absolutely in our own
            power to will or not to will, to do anything or not to do it, is
            plainly to deny that our wills are subject to the rule of the Most
            High…against its exaltation to this height of independency, I oppose
            —
          </p>
          <p>
            First, Everything that is independent of any else in operation is
            purely active, and so consequently a god; for nothing but a divine
            will can be a pure act, possessing such a liberty by virtue of its
            own essence. Every created will must have a liberty by
            participation, which includeth such an imperfect potentiality as
            cannot be brought into act without some pre-motion[28] of a superior
            agent. Neither doth this motion being extrinsical[29] at all
            prejudice the true liberty of the will, which requireth indeed that
            the internal principle of operation be active and free, but not that
            that principle be not moved to that operation by an outward superior
            agent. Nothing in this sense can have an independent principle of
            operation which hath not an independent being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, if the free acts of our wills are so subservient to the
            providence of God as that He useth them to what end He will and by
            them effecteth many of His purposes, then they cannot of themselves
            be so absolutely independent as to have in their own power every
            necessary circumstance and condition, that they may use or not use
            at their pleasure. Now the former is proved by all those reasons and
            texts of Scripture I before produced to show that the providence of
            God overruleth the actions and determineth the wills of men freely
            to do that which He hath appointed. And, truly, were it otherwise,
            God’s dominion over the most things that are in the world [would be]
            quite excluded: He had not power to determine that any one thing
            should ever come to pass which hath any reference to the wills of
            men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly, all the acts of the will being positive entities, were it
            not previously moved by God Himself, “in whom we live, move, and
            have our being,” must needs have their essence and existence solely
            from the will itself; which is thereby made a first and supreme
            cause, endued with an underived30] being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us now, in the second place, look upon the power of our freewill
            in doing that which is morally good, where we shall find not only an
            essential imperfection, inasmuch as it is created, but also a
            contracted effect, inasmuch as it is corrupted. The ability which
            the Arminians ascribe unto it in this kind—of doing that which is
            morally and spiritually good—is as large as themselves will confess
            to be competent unto it in the state of innocency, even a power of
            believing and a power of resisting the gospel, of obeying and not
            obeying, of turning or of not being converted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scripture, as I observed before, hath no such term at all or
            anything equivalent unto it. But the expressions it useth concerning
            our nature and all the faculties thereof in this state of sin and
            unregeneration seem to imply the quite contrary: as that we are in
            “bondage” (Heb 2:15); “dead in sins” (Eph 2:1); and so “free from
            righteousness” (Rom 6:20); “servants of sin” (v. 17); under the
            “reign” and “dominion” thereof, (vv. 12, 14); all “our members being
            instruments of unrighteousness” (v. 13); not “free indeed” until
            “the Son make us free” (Joh 8:36); so that this idol of FREE-WILL,
            in respect of spiritual things, is not one whit better than the
            other idols of the heathen.
