        <h2>The Canonicity of the Old Testament</h2>
        <p>EIGTH QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Are the books of the Old Testament still part of the canon of
            faith, and the rule of conduct in the church of the New Testament?
            Affirmative, against the Anabaptists.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This question divides us from the Anabaptists, who exclude the Old
          Testament books from the canon of faith, as if they were of little
          consequence for Christians, or as if dogmas of faith and precepts for
          life ought not to be drawn from them. The Mennonites teach in their
          confession that all Christians, according as they have acquired faith,
          must of necessity conform solely to the gospel of Christ (article 11),
          and this was confirmed at the colloquy of Frankenthal. The Reformed
          (orthodoxi), on the other hand, hold that the Old Testament is no less
          the concern of Christians than the New, and that dogmas of faith and
          the regulation of life are to be based on both (French Confession,
          articles 4 and 5; Swiss Confession, article 1).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is not a question of the Old Testament in the sense of the
          Mosaic economy; indeed we believe that this has been so abrogated by
          Christ that it no longer deserves a place in the economy of grace. But
          there is a question about it as to teaching, whether there is still
          use for it under the New Testament as canon of faith and conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is not here a question whether Christ has reformed the law
          given in the Old Testament by correcting and completing it (this will
          be discussed later against the Socinians but whether the Old Testament
          so applies to Christians that the canon of faith and rule of life
          should be sought and proved from it no less than from the New
          Testament, and that the religion of Christ is contained in Moses and
          the prophets no less than in the books of the New Testament, and can
          be demonstrated from them, which the adversaries deny, and we affirm).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The difference between the Old and New Testaments is not in
          question, nor that of the teachings which proceed from both; we do not
          deny that the teaching of the New Testament is much clearer than that
          of the Old, both because of the types in which that of the Old is
          given, and because of the predictions and promises which are given in
          it. The question concerns the principle of the Christian faith
          (religio)-- whether this is found only in the New Testament books, or
          also, which we affirm, in the Old.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The reasons are (1) Christ approved the Old Testament and wanted
          Moses and the prophets to be heard by believers (Luke 16:29). This was
          not said to Jews to the exclusion of others, for here a general
          precept is given to all who want to avoid eternal punishment, and what
          is here given as a precept is recommended to Christians as practice by
          Peter: "We have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do
          well to attend, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day
          breaks and the morning star rises in your hearts" (II Peter 1:19). Nor
          can exception be taken on the ground that a qualification is added by
          Peter, that this attending to the prophets holds only until the time
          of the New Testament, when the day had broken, for [even] if he refers
          to the New Testament, the value of the prophetic word is not
          restricted, according to this text, to the time previous to the New
          Testament, because "until" is not always used of an action that is
          completed so as to exclude any future action, as is shown by a number
          of passages (Gen. 28:15; Matt. 28:30 [20]; I Cor. 15:25). If it refers
          to the day of eternal life, and the rising of the morning star in the
          region of glory, which is in truth the day par excellence, and which
          seems more probable because he writes to believers who had already
          received faith in equal measure, and so in whose hearts the day of
          grace and the morning star of the gospel had already arisen, then our
          argument gains strength; that is to say, the prophetic words must be
          heeded to the end of the age, until that blessed day dawns which is
          true day, everlasting and not ended by night.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. (2) The church of the New Testament is built on the foundation of
          the prophets and the apostles (Eph. 2:20); that is, of the teaching of
          prophets and apostles. The New Testament prophets mentioned in
          Ephesians 3:5 and I Corinthians 12:28 cannot be understood here,
          because the passage deals with the permanent foundation of the
          universal church, while the New Testament prophetic gift was
          temporary; nor does the order of the words (ordo collectionis) imply
          priority in time or duration, as in Ephesians 4:12 the New Testament
          prophets are listed before the evangelists, although they did not come
          before them in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (3) "Whatever was written in former days was written for our
          instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the
          scriptures we might have hope" (Rom.15:4). Although all things in
          Scripture are not of the same nature and use, yet all are of the same
          origin and authority, equally given for the welfare and edification of
          the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. (4) The canon of the Old Testament is sufficient for faith and
          conduct, and those sacred writings in which Timothy was instructed
          from his youth, when the canon of the New Testament had not yet been
          written, could make him wise unto salvation (II Tim. 3:14 -15). And if
          the man of God, that is, the minister of the gospel, can be equipped
          for every good work by them, they are much more useful and necessary
          for the faith of the private person, and for the direction of his
          life. Nor does Paul here refer only to the time before the writing of
          the New Testament, because he speaks in general of all inspired
          Scripture (v. 16).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. (5) Christ dismisses the Jews that they may study the Scriptures
          (John 5:39), since they are the source of life. This is not spoken to
          the Jews merely as a description of what they were doing, but as a
          commandment, because (1) Christ's purpose was to lead the Jews to the
          reading of Scripture as a means of bringing them to a knowledge of
          himself, and a witness [to him] greater than any objection, and (2)
          granting that Christ spoke in the indicative, the substance [of our
          argument] is the same, because he approved their practice [of reading
          the Old Testament] and did not rebuke it.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. (6) The Old Testament Scripture contains the same substance of
          doctrine as the New, both with regard to things to be believed, and to
          be done, nor is any other gospel proclaimed today to us than which was
          formerly promised in the prophetic writings (Rom. 1:3 [2]; 16:25 -
          26). So Paul, who proclaimed the whole plan of God for salvation to
          Christians (Acts 20:26 [27]) declared that he had taught nothing
          except what was spoken by Moses and the prophets (Acts 26:22). Nor is
          any other law prescribed for us besides that which was formerly
          brought by Moses, which required love of God and neighbor (Matt. 22:37
          - 39).
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. (7) If the Old Testament does not apply to Christians, it cannot
          be convincingly proved to Jews that Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the
          true Messiah, because only by comparing the Scriptures, and by the
          correspondence of the predictions of the Messiah in the Old Testament
          to their fulfillment in our Jesus under the New, which was more than
          once shown by Christ and the apostles (Luke 24:27, 44; Acts 10:43;
          17:11; 26:22; Rom. 3:21), can this be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. By the law and the prophets which were to remain until John
          (Matt. 11:12 [13]), the books of the Old Testament and their
          permanence are not to be understood, compared to that of the New. The
          first was prophetic, the second evangelical; the first is of shadows
          and types which promise a Messiah who is to be given, the second is
          clear and plain, which proclaims a Messiah who has been given. Christ
          says that these two modes of revelation are to be brought together:
          the first, [revelation] through prophecy, to last only until John,
          because after the Messiah had been given he no longer wanted to be
          proclaimed as to come; the other, [revelation] through the
          evangelizing that declares that Christ has come, began with John.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. When the apostles are called ministers of the Spirit, not of the
          letter (II Cor. 3:5 - 6), by "letter" the books of the Old Testament
          are not to be understood, as if they should no longer be used, since
          on the contrary they used them constantly, but the legal economy, as
          contrasted to the evangelical [should be understood]. It is in many
          ways superior, not only because of its clarity and completeness, but
          also because of its efficacy, because it not only requires and
          commands duty as does the law, but also performs it through the law
          written in hearts by the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. It is one thing for the old covenant to be out of date with
          regard to mode of administration and the incidental aspects
          (accidentia) of the covenant, or the external accompaniments of
          matters therewith, which is what Paul affirms (Heb. 8:13), but it is
          another for it to be so with regard to what is administered and its
          substance, or the internal form of the covenant itself, which is what
          we deny.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. It is one thing to speak of the obligation of the ceremonies of
          the Old Testament, or the law concerning them, and another of the
          permanence of both the knowledge of and meditation upon the books of
          the Law and the Prophets. Because the law has only the shadow of
          blessings to come it does not apply to Christians, who have the
          express image of these [blessings], as a matter of practice and
          observance; it can, however, apply as a matter of teaching and
          knowledge, and as illustration of that image (quoad relationem ad thn
          eikona). Indeed the content (corpus) shows forth more clearly from the
          correspondence between the revealed shadows and forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Christ, in Matthew 5, does not dispute against Moses and the
          precepts of the law itself, but rather acts as interpreter and
          vindicator of the law, by rejecting corruptions and glosses which
          Jewish teachers had attached to it, and restoring its splendor and
          true meaning, as will be seen specifically in the locus about the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Although the New Testament Scripture is complete in an intensive
          sense, with regard to the substance of saving doctrine, it is not
          complete in the extensive sense, with regard to the full breadth of
          divine revelation, because it speaks only of Christ as having been
          revealed, not of him as to be revealed, a form of witness that is most
          useful for the confirmation of faith. So the perfection of the books
          of the New Testament does not exclude the use of the books of the Old,
          both because the New Testament itself witnesses that it rests upon the
          Old, and because the repetition of many testimonies to the same fact
          is a valid witness for us, and increases assurance of our faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Anything that does not come, either directly or indirectly,
          from Christ does not have authority for Christians. But the law that
          was given by Moses was also given by Christ; by Moses as servant
          (servus), by Christ as Lord. So in Acts 7:38 the same angel who
          appeared to Moses in the desert (v. 30), and who was Jehovah himself
          (Exod. 3:2), is said to have spoken to Moses on Mount Sinai, because
          the Son of God, who is called the angel of the covenant and of the
          presence, was the primary author and promulgator of the law, of which
          Moses was only a servant (minister). This does not destroy the
          distinction between the promulgation of the law and of the gospel,
          because in the law the Son of God worked only indirectly and as
          disincarnate, but is called the first author of the gospel directly
          and as incarnate (Heb. 2:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Christ is called the end of the law (Rom. 10:4), both because he
          was the purpose (scopus) toward which the entire law looked, and
          because he was its realization and completion, not by doing away with
          its value, but by fulfilling its oracles, and carrying them out, both
          in his own person, by action and by suffering, and in his people, by
          inscribing the law on the hearts of believers, whence he is said to
          have come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17).
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. Servants are not to be listened to, if they say anything contrary
          to, or injurious to, the master when he is absent, but they can and
          should be heard if they speak about him in accordance with his
          commandment. Moses and the prophets did this no less than the apostles
          (John 5:46; Acts 10:43), and Christ expressly enjoins the hearing of
          Moses and the prophets (Luke 16:29). This is not going back from
          Christ to Moses, but a going forward from Moses, who is tutor (Gal.
          3:24), to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. The beginning of John's preaching is properly called the
          beginning of the gospel (Mark 1:1) with regard to fulfillment and with
          respect to the revelation of Christ as sent, but not with regard to
          the promise and with respect to [the revelation of] Christ as one to
          be sent, which had been given previously under the Old Testament (Rom.
          1:2; Gal. 3:8; Isa. 52:7; 61:1).
