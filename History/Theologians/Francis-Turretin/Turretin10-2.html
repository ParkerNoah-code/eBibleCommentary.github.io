          SECOND QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Whether every necessity is repugnant to freedom of will. We deny
            against the papists and Remonstrants</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Before speaking of the nature and formal relation of free will, we
          must first discuss the proposed question on account of our opponents
          (of whom this is the capital error [proton pseudos] upon which they
          erect their erroneous doctrine about the essence of liberty being
          placed in indifference) —that undoubtedly “necessity of every kind is
          opposed to the freedom of the will and necessity and freedom are
          diametrically (antidiérémenos) opposed; nor can a free will be
          conceived or understood with a determination to one thing or with a
          necessity determining it antecedently.” Their design is no other than
          to take away the will of man from the necessity of divine
          determination and government and to make it uncontrolled (adespoton)
          and the master of its own acts.
        </p>
        <h2>Not every necessity repugnant to liberty, only a certain.</h2>
        <p>
          II. To this assertion of Pelagians is opposed the orthodox truth which
          maintains that not every necessity is at variance with liberty, nor
          that every necessity agrees with it; but that one is incompatible
          (asystaton) with it, while another cordially unites with it (which has
          been noticed before in passing, Topic VIII, Question 1). It must now
          be explained a little more distinctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Liberty is variously distinguished. Some (as Bernard, Tractatus
          de Gratia et Libero Arbitrio 3.7 [PL 182.1005] and after him Lombard,
          Sententiarum 2, Dist. 25 [PL 192/2.708]) make liberty threefold: first
          from necessity; second from sin; third from misery. He calls the first
          of nature (which he bestows upon us in the condition of nature); the
          second of grace (because we are restored to it in grace); the last of
          glory (because it is reserved for us in glory). By the first, we excel
          other animals; by the second, we subject the flesh; by the third,
          death. The first is so natural to man that it cannot in any way be
          wrested from him. The other two were lost by sin. This distinction we
          readily receive, provided that under the word necessity we understand
          a physical necessity as well as a coactive (which are incompatable
          [asystatoi] with the nature of liberty).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But to make the whole subject clearer, we distribute liberty and
          necessity into six heads: that the will can certainly be considered
          either with respect to the external agent; or with respect to material
          and internal sense; or with respect to God, or the practical
          intellect, or the goodness or wickedness of the object proposed, or
          the event and existence. Hence a sixfold necessity arises. First, the
          necessity of coaction arising from an external agent (he who is
          compelled, contributing nothing). Second, physical and brute necessity
          occurring in inanimates and brutes who act from a blind impulse of
          nature or a brute instinct and innate appetite, without, however, any
          light of reason (as the necessity in fire to burn, a combustible
          object being supplied; the necessity in a horse to eat the straw or
          grass put before him) and without any choice (proairesei). The third
          is the necessity of the creature’s dependence on God, as much as to
          right and the law established by him as in reference to fact (to wit,
          the government of providence: [1] in the antecedent decree; [2] in the
          subsequent execution). This necessity is called hypothetical both of
          infallibility (with respect to prescience) and of immutability (with
          respect to the decree and actual concourse). Fourth, rational
          necessity of the determination to one thing by a judgment of the
          practical intellect (which the will cannot resist). Fifth, moral
          necessity or of slavery arising from good or bad habits and the
          presentation of objects to their faculties. For such is the nature of
          moral habits that although the acquisition of them be in our power,
          still when our will is imbued with them, they can neither be
          unexercised nor be laid aside (as the philosopher rightly teaches,
          Nichomachean Ethics 3.5 [Loeb, 143— 53]). Hence it happens that the
          will (free in itself) is so determined either to good or to evil that
          it cannot but act either well or badly. Hence flows the slavery of sin
          or of righteousness. Sixth, the necessity of the existence of the
          thing or of the event, in virtue of which, when a thing is, it cannot
          but be.
        </p>
        <h2>Coactive and physical necessity repugnant to liberty.</h2>
        <p>
          V. There are two principal characteristics of free will in which its
          formal nature consists: (1) the choice (hé proairesis), so that what
          is done is done by a previous judgment of reason; (2) the willingness
          (to hekousion), so that what is done is done voluntarily and without
          compulsion. The former belongs to the intellect; the latter belongs to
          the will. Two species of necessity also contend with it. The first is
          physical and brute necessity; the other the necessity of coaction. The
          former takes away the choice (proairesin); the latter, however, the
          willingness (hekousion). For the things done from a physical necessity
          by natural agents determined to one thing by nature and without
          reason, cannot be done freely, i.e., with the previous light of
          reason. And the things done by force and compulsion cannot be done
          voluntarily. There is no controversy about these between us and our
          opponents. We will say only this in passing; Bellarmine and other
          papists slander our men when they charge them with holding that
          freedom from coaction is sufficient to constitute free will (because
          besides this they require also immunity from physical necessity) (cf.
          Bellarmine, “De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio,” 3.4 in Opera [1858],
          4:332—37). When they say that man is free from coaction and not from
          necessity, they do not mean physical necessity (about which there is
          no controversy and which is sufficiently excluded of itself, both by
          the condition of the subject [which is rational] and by the acts of
          judging and willing [which are incompatible with it]); but a
          dependent, slavish and rational necessity.
        </p>
        <h2>But the necessity of dependence upon God agrees with it.</h2>
        <p>
          VI. But if these two species of necessity mentioned by us contend
          against free will, it is not so with the others which can exist with
          it and by which it is not so much destroyed as preserved and perfected
          (which can be shown singly as to the four kinds of necessity before
          indicated). First, as the necessity of dependence upon God, free will
          does not exclude, but supposes it (whether we understand the moral
          dependence of right in reference to the divine law from which the
          rational creature can never be exempted; or the physical dependence of
          deed as to the concourse of providence, by which things so depend upon
          God, as the highest ruler and first cause in being, becoming and
          operating that they can neither be, nor do anything except in
          dependence upon him; or a dependence of futurition as to foreknowledge
          and the decree, from which arises the necessity of infallibility and
          of immutability). For however great may be the liberty of the creature
          in its operations, still they are necessary in these respects,
          otherwise the foreknowledge of God could be deceived and his decree
          changed.
        </p>
        <h2>(2) Rational necessity.</h2>
        <p>
          VII. Second, as to rational necessity of determination to one thing by
          the practical intellect. For since the will is a rational appetite,
          such is its nature that it must follow the last judgment of the
          practical intellect; otherwise it could seek evil as evil and be
          turned away from good as good (which is absurd [asystaton]). For if
          the last judgment of the practical intellect is brought to the point
          of judging that this object, here and now (all the circumstances being
          weighed) is the best, and the will should be opposed to this judgment,
          then it would be turned away from good as good. Nor ought it to be
          objected that the will frequently seeks evil. It does not seek evil as
          evil, but as an apparent, useful or pleasant good.
        </p>
        <h2>(3) Moral necessity.</h2>
        <p>
          VII. Third, as to moral necessity arising from habits. For as the will
          can be called “free” if it is devoid of habit, so it can rightly be
          called “slavish” if by habit it has been determined to a certain
          manner of acting. Still this servitude by no means overthrows the true
          and essential nature of liberty. Otherwise it would follow that habits
          destroy the will (which they rather perfect and facilitate to
          operation). Hence moral habits are twofold: good and evil. A twofold
          servitude also is thence born: the one of righteousness in good; the
          other of sin in evil and misery. This belongs to man in a state of
          sin, of which John says, “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of
          sin” (8:34); and “Ye were the servants of sin” (Rom. 6:17). That
          characterizes him in a state of grace, of which Rom. 6:18 treats:
          “Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
          righteousness.” This servitude is true liberty, as there is no more
          real and miserable servitude than that of sin. For he who serves sin
          by no means does what he wills. He does it by a particular inclination
          which he least wills by a universal. For all, by a universal and
          natural appetite, always seek good and happiness for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Hence it is evident that the adversaries (and especially
          Bellarmine, ibid., 4.6, pp. 363-64) falsely charge our men with saying
          the will is a slave in the state of sin, as if its liberty were
          destroyed by that very thing. Scripture beforehand so calls it and
          indeed with a twofold limitation: (1) that “servant” should be
          understood not absolutely and physically, but relatively, after the
          fall in a state of sin; (2) not simply about every natural, civil or
          externally moral object, but especially about a spiritual object good
          per se (in which manner inability [adynamia] to good is more strongly
          asserted, but the essence of liberty is not destroyed). Although the
          sinner is so enslaved by evil that he cannot but sin, still he does
          not cease to sin most freely and with the highest liberty. Hence
          Jansen acknowledges that Luther did not first introduce the term “free
          will” (“De statu naturae lapsae,” 3.5 in Augustinus [1640/1964], pp.
          441-46), but followed Augustine who had so spoken of it long before
          (Enchiridion 9 [30] [FC 3:395] and Against Two Letters of the
          Pelagians 3.24 [8] [NPNF1, 5:414]). He is angry with those of his own
          party who maintained that the term “slavish will” was unknown before
          Luther. “Free will but not freed; free of righteousness, yet a slave
          of sin, by which some more, others less, but all evil, are involved by
          different hurtful desires” (Augustine, Admonition and Grace 13 [42]
          [FC 2:297; PL 44.942]). “Man using free will badly, lost both himself
          and it” (Augustine, Enchiridion 9 [30] [FC 3:395; PL 40.246]).
        </p>
        <h2>(4) Necessity of event.</h2>
        <p>
          X. Fourth, as to necessity of the event. For although whatever is,
          when it is, is necessarily (so that it can no more but be); still not
          the less freely or contingently is it said to be done as depending
          upon free or contingent causes. The certainty and truth of the
          existence of a thing cannot change its essence.
        </p>
        <h2>Sources of solution.</h2>
        <p>
          XI. Although the will is free, this does not prevent its being
          determined by God and being always under subjection to him. This is so
          because liberty is not absolute, independent and uncontrolled
          (adespotos) (the characteristics of God alone), but limited and
          dependent. Otherwise if no faculty is free except it is in subjection
          to no one, either a free will does not exist in creatures or every
          second cause will be the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. The will is said to be the mistress of its own actions, not
          absolutely and simply (as if it depended upon it always to elicit or
          not elicit them—for in this way it cannot but be in subjection both to
          God and to the intellect); but relatively with regard to imperate acts
          which it governs with inferior powers; not with regard to elicit acts
          which cannot properly be said to be under the control of the will,
          since they are the very command of the will by which it governs the
          acts of other faculties subjected to itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. The will can be viewed either in relation to the decree and
          concourse of God or in contradistinction to the intellect. In the
          former sense, it is rightly said to be so determined by God as also to
          determine itself (because, as was seen before, God so moves creatures
          as to leave their own motions to them). But in the latter sense, it
          cannot be said to determine itself (because it is determined by the
          intellect whose last judgment of practical intellect it must follow).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. If the will is always determined by God, it can be called his
          instrument in a popular sense. In this way, the relation of instrument
          is attributed in Scripture to wicked men when they are called “the
          axe,” “the hammer,” “the rod of God.” But not in a philosophical and
          proper sense in which that is called an agent which has within itself
          no principal causality and has such a nature as to produce an effect
          more noble than itself (as the heat of the sun, which is inanimate,
          produces living animals). For the will does not produce an entity
          nobler than itself and does not cease to be the principal cause; if
          not absolutely, still in its own genus (to wit, of second cause).
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Although the will can oppose the theoretical judgment of the
          intellect or the absolute judgment and of simple practical intellect;
          whither pertain those words of Medea in the poet—“I see the right and
          approve it too, and still the worse pursue” (Ovid, Metamorpheses
          7.20—21 [Loeb, 1:342—43])—yet it can never oppose the decided and last
          judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. In the first sin, the will of Adam did not follow the first and
          absolute judgment of the intellect (by which it judged that the fruit
          must not be eaten) because God had prohibited its use under penalty of
          death (Gen. 3:3). Rather it followed the decided and last judgment by
          which it is said that the woman saw the fruit of the tree to be good
          to her for food (v. 6) and judged it to be desirable to the eyes
          (viz., according to the deceitful promise of Satan that they would be
          like God).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. In the sin against the Holy Spirit, the will indeed opposes the
          judgment of the practical intellect, even the first decided. Otherwise
          it could not be said to be committed against conscience and the
          knowledge of the truth. Still it is not repugnant to the last decided
          judgment in which the flesh (all things being considered) judges here
          and now that the gospel should be denied and Christ forsaken.
