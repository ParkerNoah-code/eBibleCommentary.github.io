          FIRST QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Whether the term “free will” or self-determining (autexousiou)
            power should be retained in the Christian schools. And to what
            faculty of the soul does it properly belong—the intellect or
            will?</em
          >

          I. The greatness of the corruption brought upon the human race by sin
          we have already shown. We have seen the source of evil in original sin
          and the muddy streams thence flowing into actual sins. Now more
          properly the miserable state of man and the most degrading servitude
          of free will under sin must be considered. I confess it is a sad
          spectacle, but still most useful and highly necessary, in order that
          we may fully know the greatness of our misery and the more certainly
          understand and the more earnestly seek the necessity of medicinal
          grace. For this reason, the argument is the more diligently to be
          pursued because the weightiest controversies have been set on foot
          about it by various adversaries almost from the very beginning and are
          even now in our day urged (in the discussion of which great talents
          have been and are now employed). And not to mention here the most
          futile errors of heathen philosophers who (ignorant of the corruption
          of nature) contended that man could be the builder and architect of
          his own fortune and by making men free made them sacrilegious. Who is
          ignorant of the gigantic attempts of the Pelagians and semi-Pelagians
          on this subject! They deny either wholly the impurity of nature or
          extenuate it most astonishingly to extol the strength of free will.
          Neither the authority of various councils, nor the labor and industry
          of the brightest lights of the church (Jerome, Augustine, Prosper,
          Hilary, Fulgentius and others) broke so much as to prevent their
          renewing and causing to sprout again the very same things in
          succeeding ages; so that you would say these enemies had been
          triumphed over rather than entirely conquered by the fathers. Nor do
          the Jesuits, the Socinians and Remonstrants of our day labor for
          anything else than on this subject (as also in various others) to
          bring back (either openly or secretly and by burrowing) Pelagianism
          and semi-Pelagianism and to place the idol of free will in the
          citadel. This is the Helen whom they so ardently love and for whom
          they do not hesitate to fight as for their altars and firesides. It is
          of great importance, therefore, that the disciples of true and genuine
          grace should oppose themselves strenuously to these deadly errors and
          so build up the misery of man and the necessity of grace that the
          entire cause of destruction should be ascribed to man and the whole
          glory of salvation to God alone. Here belongs the doctrine of free
          will, concerning which we now dispute.
        </p>
        <h2>The term “free will”—whence derived.</h2>
        <p>
          II. However, because a controversy is usually plied with us here by
          the papists (as if we could not bear the term “free will” any more
          than the thing itself), a few remarks must be premised concerning the
          term. The word “free will” (as also “self-determining power”
          [autexousiou] used by the Greek fathers) does not occur in Scripture.
          It was received by the Christian schools as more suited to designate
          that faculty of the rational soul by which it spontaneously does what
          it pleases, a judgment of the reason going before. For they are
          mistaken who think they have found it in what Paul calls “the power of
          his own will” (exousian peri tou idiou thelématos, 1 Cor. 7:37). With
          him, exousia does not mean freedom of will, but facility of executing;
          nor does to theléma signify an act of the will, but an object (as
          often elsewhere). Therefore the origin of this word seems rather to be
          drawn from the Platonic school, the followers of which many of the
          fathers were before they turned to Christ. What the Peripatetics
          called eleutheran proairesin and the Stoics to eph’ hémin, the
          Platonists called autexousion.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. However although this name seems too proud, if considered
          precisely in itself (as if man was in his own power who belongs
          properly to God alone, who moreover is truly perfectly independent
          [autexousios] and irresponsible [anypeuthynos], so of his own right
          that he does not depend nor can depend absolutely upon anyone).
          However man is always responsible (hypeuthynos) and under authority
          (hypexousios). For this reason, some have desired it to be removed
          from the use of the church to take away the abuse of the Pelagians who
          have spread their poison under it. Still because it has now been
          received in the church by a long usage, we do not think it should be
          dismissed to the philosophers from whom it seems to have been derived,
          but should be usefully retained, if its right sense is taught and its
          abuse avoided. Hence it cannot without calumny be charged upon us that
          we can bear neither the name nor the thing (free will). For we are
          about to demonstrate (afterwards in reference to the thing) that we
          establish free will far more truly than our opponents; so the writings
          of our men abundantly teach that we by no means repudiate this term
          when properly understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The subject of free will is neither the intellect, nor the will
          separately, but both faculties conjointly. As it belongs to the
          intellect with regard to the decision of choice (proaireseds); so it
          belongs to the will with regard to freedom. Hence you may rightly call
          it a mixed faculty or a wedlock and meeting (synkyrian) of both—the
          intellect as well as the will. Nevertheless you would not properly say
          it consists rather in each faculty; for as the decision of the
          intellect is terminated in the will, so the liberty of the will has
          its roots in the intellect. Hence the philosopher, leaving this
          undetermined, says that it is either the “appetitive intellect” (noun
          orektikon) or the “intelligent appetite” (orexin dianoetikén)
          (Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics 1*.13.18, 20 [Loeb, 66—67)).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Nor ought this to seem unusual since the intellect and will are
          mutually connected by so strict a necessity that they can never be
          separated from each other. Nor does there seem to be a real and
          intrinsic distinction here, but only an extrinsic with regard to the
          objects (as one and the same faculty of the soul both judges by
          understanding and by willing embraces what it judges to be good; and
          it is called “intellect” when it is occupied in the knowledge and
          judgment of things, but “will” when it is carried to the love or
          hatred of the same). Thus what is in the intellect affirmation and
          negation, that in the will is desire and avoidance, as the philosopher
          says (hoper en dianoia kataphasis kai apophasis tout’ en orexei didxis
          kai phyge, ibid., 6.2.2 [Loeb, 328—29]).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. In the soul, besides the essence, there are only three things:
          faculty, habit, act. In the common opinion, the “decisions” denotes an
          act of the mind; but here it signifies properly neither an act nor a
          habit because both singly can be separated from man and determine him
          to only one of contraries—a faculty, not vegetative and sensitive
          (common to us with brute things in which there is no place for virtue
          or vice), but rational, from which we are not indeed good or evil, but
          can be by its act and habit.
