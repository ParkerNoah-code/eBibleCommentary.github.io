          SEVENTH QUESTION: THE JUSTIFICATION OF FAITH
          <br />

          <em
            >Does faith justify us properly and by itself or only relatively and
            instrumentally? The former we deny; the latter we affirm against the
            Socinians, Remonstrants and Romanists</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Justification—active and passive.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Since justification can be viewed either actively (on the part of
          God who justifies) or passively (on the part of man who is justified),
          a twofold handling of it can also be adopted: either with respect to
          the benefit itself conferred upon us by God and of the righteousness
          imputed to us; or with respect to its reception and application made
          by faith (of which we now treat).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. However, it is not controverted whether faith justifies—for
          Scripture so clearly asserts this that no one dares to deny it. Rather
          we inquire regarding the manner in which it justifies, in describing
          which there is an amazing discrepancy of opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The opinion of the Socinians.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. All our opponents agree in this—that faith justifies properly and
          by itself and so is our very righteousness—but with some differences.
          For the Socinians maintain that faith or the act of believing is the
          cause of our justification so that there is no other immediate and
          formal righteousness by which we are just before God than our faith;
          also justification is a universal affection of faith—‘“Not because it
          is considered such by the gracious acceptation of God; by which it
          pleased him to reckon faith for perfect righteousness, or for a
          perfect fulfillment of the law, no otherwise than formally under the
          legal covenant, the perfect obedience of the law was that universal
          righteousness upon which life depended” (as Socinus, De lesu Christo
          Servatore [1594] frequently expresses it; Smalcius, Refutatio Thesium
          D. Wolfgang Frantzii [1614]; Volkelius, De vera Religione 4.3 [1630],
          pp. 175-84). The Remonstrants agree with them on this point in their
          Confession, c. 21+ (cf. The Confession or Declaration of the ...
          Remonstrants 18* [1676], p. 211).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>And of the Romanists.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Romanists hold that faith is the disposing and cause sine qua
          non, which not only disposes to righteousness, but also begins and
          merits righteousness itself. “If anyone says that the wicked are
          justified by faith alone, so that he understands nothing else to be
          required to cooperate for obtaining the grace of justification and is
          necessary from no part, to be prepared and disposed with the motion of
          his own will, let him be accursed” (Council of Trent, Session 6, Canon
          9*, Schroeder, p. 43). Bellarmine says, “Faith justifies as the
          beginning and root of justification because it is the first motion
          towards God, for it behooves one approaching God to believe that God
          is” (“De Justificatione,” 1.13 Opera [1858], 4:479). This opinion is
          founded upon a false hypothesis—as if justification consists in an
          infusion of righteousness and is a certain physical motion which
          demands previous dispositions in the subject before the introduction
          of the form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The opinion of the orthodox.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. However the orthodox differ wholly from them. They teach that faith
          is the organic and instrumental cause of our justification and that
          justification is ascribed to it, not properly and by itself (inasmuch
          as it is a work or as if it was the righteousness itself by which we
          are justified before God; or as if by its own worth or by the
          indulgence of God it deserves justification in whole or in part), but
          improperly and metonymically (inasmuch as Christ’s righteousness,
          which faith apprehends, is the foundation and meritorious cause on
          account of which we are justified). So that it is said to justify
          relatively and organically: relatively because the object of faith is
          our true righteousness before God; organically because faith is the
          instrument for receiving on our part and for applying to ourselves,
          that righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Proof that the act of believing is not our righteousness. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Two things therefore must be done by us here. First, negatively
          (kat’ arsin), the false mode of the justification of faith (introduced
          by the Socinians and Romanists) must be removed. Second, affirmatively
          (kata thesin) the true and genuine sense must be established. As to
          the former, faith or the act of believing is not considered as our
          righteousness with God by a gracious acceptation: (a) because what is
          only the instrument for receiving righteousness cannot be our
          righteousness itself formally. Now faith holds here only the relation
          (schesin) of an instrument, as is evident both from its proper act
          (which is instrumental and consists in the reception of Christ [Jn.
          1:12] and the acceptance of righteousness [Rom. 5:17] and of the
          remission of sins [Acts 26:18]); and from the subordination of the
          causes of justification to the same effect (to wit, the grace of God,
          the redemption of Christ and faith). This is alluded to by Paul in
          Rom. 3:24 where faith cannot sustain any other meaning than that of an
          instrument, since the grace of God holds the relation of an efficient
          principle and the redemption of Christ that of the meritorious cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (b) Because faith is distinguished from the righteousness itself
          which is imputed to us, both because it is said to be “of faith” and
          “by faith” (Rom. 1:17; 3:22; Phil. 3:9) and because Christ with his
          obedience and satisfaction is that righteousness which is imputed to
          us (Is. 53:11; Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13, 14),
          which faith indeed apprehends as its object, but with which it cannot
          be identified. Hence Scripture nowhere says that God willed to count
          our faith for righteousness, but that he made Christ unto us
          righteousness; that he is Jehovah our righteousness and that we are
          the righteousness of God in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. (c) Because we are not justified except by a perfect
          righteousness. For we have to deal with the strict justice of God,
          which cannot be deceived. Now no faith here is perfect. Nor can it be
          said that it is not indeed a perfect righteousness of itself, but is
          admitted as such by God and considered such by a gratuitous lowering
          of the law’s demands. For in the court of divine justice (which
          demands an adequate and absolutely perfect payment), there cannot be
          room for a gracious acceptation which is an imaginary payment. Again,
          since our justification is a forensic and judicial act (where God
          shows himself just, Rom. 3:25), it does not admit of a gracious
          acceptation (which never proceeds from the authority and sentence of
          the Judge, but from the voluntary and private stipulation of the
          parties).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. (d) If faith is counted for righteousness, we will be justified by
          works because thus faith cannot but have the relation of a work which
          justifies. And yet it is clear that in this business Paul always
          opposes faith to works as incompatible (asystata) and two antagonistic
          (antidiéremena) means by which man is justified either by his own
          obedience and in himself, by the law, or by another’s obedience by the
          gospel. Nor does the difference between these modes of justification
          consist in this—that in the former a perfect obedience and in the
          latter an imperfect is accepted of God as perfect, since the mode of
          justification would be always the same—by works. Rather the difference
          consists in this—that since in both cases a perfect righteousness is
          required, in the former from the strictness (akribodikaio) of the law
          God demands a personal righteousness, here from the forbearance
          (epieikeia) of the gospel he admits another’s (to wit, the
          righteousness of Christ). Thus faith cannot be said to justify
          properly and by itself unless we slide back to the old covenant and
          returm to legal justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. “The faith of Abraham,” it is said, “was imputed to him for
          righteousness” (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). Not properly because in this way
          he would have been justified by works (which the apostle denies in the
          same place). But (1) relatively and metonymically, so that faith is
          taken for its object (Gal. 3:25), i.e., for that which faith believes
          (to wit, that the promise concerning the seed [from Gal. 3:16], not so
          much bodily as spiritual, which he received by faith, was the
          foundation of his justification). This is confirmed by the
          circumstance that what does not inhere and what is contradistinguished
          from works is here said to be imputed. Thus in this sense faith is
          said to be imputed for righteousness by a hypallage because
          righteousness is imputed by faith, as the apostle declares in
          equivalent terms (Gal. 3:5, 6; Rom. 3:22). Nor is this to wrest the
          Scriptures and to express coldly the power and efficacy of faith, as
          Forbes falsely charges upon our theologians (A Treatise Tending to
          Clear the Doctrine of Justification 4 [1616], p. 10). Nay, no more
          clearly and truly can the genuine sense of that imputation be set
          forth. For since that thing which is imputed to us for righteousness
          ought to be our righteousness before God (i.e., that on account of
          which God justifies us); nor can faith be that (as we have already
          said and as he himself does not deny when he recognizes it to be the
          instrumental cause); it is clear that this phrase cannot be taken
          properly, but only metonymically with regard to the object. Nor is
          anything more usual in Scripture than for a faculty to be taken for
          its object. This does not prevent (2) faith from being said to be
          imputed for righteousness organically because it is the instrumental
          cause which apprehends the righteousness of Christ by a metonymy of
          the effect for the efficient, as it is elsewhere called eternal life
          (Jn. 17:3; 12:50), i.e., the instrumental cause of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. In vain, however, does Arminius contend that the righteousness of
          Christ is not imputed for righteousness, since it is that very
          righteousness itself (to wit, supposing that is not properly
          righteousness which is imputed to us for righteousness). He falsely
          confounds to impute for righteousness by gracious acceptation that
          which is not a righteousness and to impute to a person for
          righteousness that which he did not have. The first sense has no place
          here, only the latter. Accordingly what Abraham had not is said to be
          imputed to him for righteousness and the righteousness of Christ is
          imputed to us (i.e., reckoned ours), which was not ours. Thus
          imputation does not deny the truth of the thing or the perfection of
          the righteousness, but only the truth of the possession by ascribing
          to a person what was not properly his.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. What is said concerning anyone in Scripture ought to be
          altogether in him, but according to the manner which it teaches
          itself. Now the manner in which justification and salvation are
          ascribed to faith, does not consist in its own proper efficiency (as
          if our faith wrought or effected them), but they are placed only in
          its fiducial apprehension and application. Nor otherwise are we said
          to please God by faith (Heb. 11:6) and to be purged of sin (Acts
          15:9), than because it applies to us the righteousness and blood of
          Christ, who purges us from sins and makes us acceptable to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. It is one thing for blessings to be conferred according to faith
          (i.e., under the condition of faith) under which they are promised in
          the word and which we acknowledge with the Scriptures; another for
          faith to justify properly and by itself or to count faith itself for
          righteousness and thus to impute it for righteousness to the believer.
          There faith holds the relation of an instrument. Here, however, it
          holds that of a principal cause and foundation (which we deny).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Faith does not justify dispositively. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Second, against the Romanists we prove that faith does not
          justify dispositively or meritoriously, as the beginning and root of
          righteousness. (1) The Holy Spirit nowhere ascribes to faith the
          beginning or only a part or disposition to justification, but the
          whole and entire justification. (2) Thus the antithesis of the apostle
          between works and faith would not hold good, since faith would always
          justify like a work. (3) Justification, as being a forensic act, takes
          place at once and in a moment (en atom0); nor can it admit of a
          beginning and progress. (4) Thus we could be said to be justified “on
          account of faith” (dia tén pistin). The Scripture never says this, but
          always either “by faith” (pistei) or “through faith” (dia tés pisteds,
          ek pisteos) as by an instrument. If in various passages these
          prepositions —“by” and “through’—have a causality properly so called
          (as when they are connected with the death and blood of Christ), it
          does not follow that they have the same force when used concerning the
          justification of faith. Nay, since it is evident that a man cannot be
          justified by two righteousnesses (one in himself, the other in
          Christ), if the righteousness and blood of Christ is the proper cause
          of his justification, this cannot be ascribed to faith, but only the
          instrumental cause. (5) This opinion falsely supposes that
          justification is a physical motion inhering in the subject, which
          needs previous dispositions by which it may be acquired so as to be
          introduced into the subject. But this is false since it is a forensic
          act (as was proved before) to which man holds himself objectively, not
          subjectively. And although faith is required on the part of man for
          receiving this benefit, it does not follow that it has the relation of
          a disposition by which the sinner is disposed to the infusion of
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Sources of explanation. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Faith is viewed in different lights: either in the act itself of
          justification or in the person of the justified or in the effect of
          justification. In the person of the justified, it is well called “the
          beginning of righteousness”; not imputed but inherent because it is
          the root of all virtues. Thus in the effect of justification, it is
          the principle and cause of new obedience; but in the act of
          justification, it can be nothing else than an instrument apprehending
          and applying to man that which justifies. Thus he is justified not by
          the merit of faith, but only by it as a means.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Although justification is drawn away from works as to merit and a
          properly so-called efficiency, it does not follow that the same is
          ascribed to faith in the same manner. Nay, because it is taken away
          from works, it cannot for the same reason be ascribed to faith because
          it would thus justify as a work; nor could we be said to be justified
          without works. It therefore suffices (in order to save the opposition
          of the apostle) that faith should be substituted by him in the place
          of works because by faith we most surely obtain what the Jews in vain
          sought in works (although it acts here not meritoriously, but only
          instrumentally).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Faith is said to save us (Lk. 7:50), not by meriting something
          in order to justification, but only receptively and organically
          because it was the instrument receptive of that benefit. Nothing is
          more frequent than by a metalepsis to ascribe to an instrument the
          effect of the principal cause (as when “the gospel” is said “to be the
          power of God unto salvation,” Rom. 1:16; the diligent hand is said to
          increase the house; the plough to enrich the farmer; the hand of the
          giver to relieve the poor; and the like). If elsewhere the greatness
          of the faith of the Canaanite woman to whom Christ granted the
          sought-for blessing is extolled (Mt. 15:28), its merit and efficiency
          is not on that account denoted. Believing, she was certainly healed
          because, faith being the medium, God bestowed this blessing upon her;
          but believing, he healed her, not on account of the fact that faith
          properly speaking effected or merited the healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Therefore the true mode of the justification of faith is no
          other than instrumental. (1) Its proper act consists in the reception
          of Christ and his righteousness, as was said before. (2) It justifies
          in no other manner than by its being directed to the death and
          obedience of Christ (to wit, by apprehending and applying Christ to
          itself as a ransom [antilytron] given for us and a propitiation
          [hilasmon] for sin, 1 Jn. 2:2). (3) Faith in the Scriptures is
          described by “eating,” “looking” and “touching,” which have only an
          instrumental causality, not a proper efficiency (as the looking at a
          serpent did not cure per se, but relatively to the brazen serpent; nor
          does eating nourish except by food thrown into the mouth). (4)
          Justifying faith stands related in no other way to justification than
          as the faith of miracles stands related to the working of miracles;
          not effectively, but organically by apprehending the special promise
          given concerning them.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Not without reason, however, is this ascribed above all other
          things to the believer because it alone of all the virtues can subsist
          with grace as consisting in the mere reception and apprehension of an
          object placed beyond itself. Hence it is said to be “of faith, that it
          might be by grace” (Rom. 4:16), to wit, as man owes this entire
          blessing to God, he has no reason for glorying in himself. For if he
          were justified by works or inherent righteousness, he would seem to
          have something in which to glory; but when he is justified by faith
          (which gives nothing to God, but only receives) all glorying is
          excluded. This Toletus well explains when he gives the reason why the
          Scripture ascribes justification to faith alone: “Namely, because in
          faith it is more manifested that man is justified not by his own
          virtue, but by the merit of Christ. For as in beholding the serpent
          God placed healing in the desert, because the looking indicated more
          that the men were healed by the virtue of the serpent, not of any
          personal work or medicine; so faith shows that sinners are justified
          by the virtue and merit of Christ, in whom believing they are saved,
          not by any virtue and merit of their own. And it is the reason why
          justification is ascribed to faith especially by Paul, who strives to
          exclude from justification the works of the law, and human merit or
          efficacy, and to place it in the virtue and merit of Christ alone.
          Therefore he makes mention of faith in Christ. This neither
          repentance, nor love, nor hope have, for faith is carried more
          immediately and distinctly to it, by whose virtue we are justified”
          (Commentarii et annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos, Annot. 17
          [1602], p. 177 on Rom. 3:22).

          XX. Although the sacraments are external means and instruments
          applying (on the part of God) the promise of grace and justification,
          this does not hinder faith from being called the internal instrument
          and means on the part of man for receiving this benefit offered in the
          word and sealed by the sacraments.

          XXI. What justifies as an instrument does not forthwith justify as a
          work, although that instrument is a work. It is one thing for it to be
          a work and another to justify as a work. What justifies as a work
          ought to be the meritorious cause of justification, but what justifies
          as an instrument does not justify meritoriously, but only
          apprehensively and receptively; not by giving, but by receiving.
          Therefore the action of faith justifies us, but not as an action
          simply (as if it were our righteousness with God), but in relation to
          its object inasmuch as it receives Christ. As the extension of the
          beggar’s hand is indeed the act of the beggar prescribed by the rich
          man, still as an act it does not enrich the beggar, but insofar as in
          this way he applies the gift of the rich man to himself and makes it
          his own.

          XXII. Although faith is called “the work of God” (Jn. 6:29), it does
          not follow that it justifies as a work. Although it is enjoined by God
          (and in this sense is called the work of God and is due from man that
          he may obtain life), it is not on this account due as the meritorious
          cause of that life, but only as a means and instrument receptive of
          the righteousness of Christ, which is the true cause of life. And thus
          it is so called by Christ imitatively (mimétikos) and by allusion to
          the Jewish sense, who sought life by the works of the law: “What must
          we do,” said they, “that we may work the works of God?” To this legal
          question Jesus answers, not legally, but evangelically (yet in a legal
          style, taking the legal phrase from the expression of the Jews and
          applying it to his discourse): “This is the work of God that ye
          believe”—intimating that no further work was necessary to acquire
          salvation, but that faith was substituted in the place of all works
          for the reception of it (as if he said, work earnestly, only
          believe—this is work, this is labor). Evidently as to a sick man
          seeking by what medicine he is about to be healed, if the physician
          answers, this is the medicine which I prescribe to you; keep quiet and
          confide in me—he does not wish to intimate that that rest and
          confidence are any remedies to cure him, but he means only this—there
          is no need of medicine. Thus the Scripture often ascribes the names of
          things (to which men attribute falsely a great efficacy and value) to
          those things which are truly efficacious and valuable; as the gospel
          is called law because what the law sought, the gospel gives; what the
          Jews vainly sought in the law is obtained by the gospel. Thus
          regeneration is called circumcision (Phil. 3:3); believers are called
          sons of Abraham; love and piety are called fasting (Is. 58:6, 7); and
          faith is called a work.

          XXIII. But we think it ought not to be anxiously inquired whether
          faith stands here in the relation of an instrument or also of a
          condition, as some think. Both may be ascribed to it, provided the
          condition is not understood as that in view of which God justifies man
          in the legal covenant. For in this sense, it cannot be called a
          condition, unless we agree with the Socinians and Remonstrants, who
          hold that faith or the act of believing is admitted by God by a
          gracious acceptation for a perfect righteousness (which we have just
          now refuted). Rather it is taken broadly for all that is required on
          our part to obtain this benefit—whether it has the relation of a cause
          properly so called or only instrumental. For thus as that condition
          has the relation (schesin) of an instrument, so the instrument has the
          relation of a condition on our part without which justification cannot
          be granted. Moreover concerning the manner in which faith concurs to
          justification and concerning its threefold act—dispository,
          justificatory and consolatory—see what was said in Topic XV, Question
          12, Section 4.
