          NINTH QUESTION: THE TIME OF JUSTIFICATION

          <br />
          <em
            >Was justification made from eternity or is it made in time? Is it
            an undivided act taking place at one and the same time?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The opinions of theologians about this question vary. Some maintain
          that it is an immanent act in God which was performed from eternity;
          others that it is transient, terminating in us and which takes place
          only in time and in this life. And there are some who hold that it is
          postponed to the last and decretory day, in which all must stand
          before the solemn and public tribunal of Christ to hear the sentence
          of absolution or of condemnation from his lips. Now although there is
          an agreement on both sides in the substance of the thing and a
          disagreement only in the mode of the thing, still it is of no little
          importance to the accurate knowledge of the subject to know what is
          the true opinion to be held here.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The first opinion is that of those who hold that justification
          preceded our birth and was made in eternity because they conceive it
          to be an immanent and internal act in God. However, as nothing new can
          happen to God in time, they think it was made in him from eternity and
          is ascribed to faith only as to cognizance and sense because it leads
          us into the knowledge of him and makes us certain of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Our justification is not made from eternity.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But although we do not deny that our justification was decreed
          even from eternity (as nothing takes place in time which was not
          constituted by him from eternity), still we do not think (speaking
          accurately) justification itself can be called eternal. The decree of
          justification is one thing; justification itself another—as the will
          to save and sanctify is one thing; salvation and sanctification itself
          another. The will or decree to justify certain persons is indeed
          eternal and precedes faith itself, but actual justification takes
          place in time and follows faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Second, Paul expressly confirms this in the chain of salvation,
          enumerating in order the benefits flowing to the elect from the
          eternal love of God where he puts calling before justification as
          something antecedent: “Whom he called, them he justified” (Rom. 8:30).
          Nor have those various passages a different meaning in which we are
          said to be justified through and by faith, than that faith is a
          something prerequisite to justification. This could not be said if
          justification was done from eternity. For it is weak and foreign to
          the meaning of Paul to refer these things to the sense of
          justification only.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Third, the nature of the thing itself proves this. For since
          justification or remission of sins necessarily involves a deliverance
          from the obligation to punishment which sins deserved and no one can
          obtain it without faith and repentance, it is evident that such a
          justification could not have been made from eternity, but only in
          time—when the man actually believes and repents. Otherwise it would
          follow that he who is justified and consequently has passed from death
          unto life and become a child of God and an heir of eternal life, still
          remains in death and is a child of wrath. He who is not yet converted
          and lies in sin, remains in death (1 Jn. 3:14) and is of the Devil (1
          Jn. 3:8) and in a state of condemnation (Gal. 5:21).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Finally, since justification is a blessing of God, while a
          blessing cannot pass to us and be actually bestowed upon us, except in
          time, it is clear that it is not to be conceived of after the manner
          of an immanent and internal act in God, but after the manner of a
          transient act arising from God and passing over and terminating upon
          the creature (not that it may subjectively inhere in him, as the
          Romanists falsely hold because this pertains to sanctification; but
          that it may adhere to him and the creature has an objective relation
          to it, while the absolving sentence is intimated to him by the Holy
          Spirit). If grace is said to have been given to us in Christ before
          the world began by reason of “destination” (2 Tim. 1:9) because from
          eternity God decreed to give it to us in time, it does not follow that
          it can be said to have been really bestowed because the decree indeed
          causes us to obtain in time a right to life certainly and infallibly,
          but not that we can say we already obtained it actually. It causes
          that we should be justified, but not to be already justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>It does not take place only at the last day.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. But as justification cannot be conceived to have taken place from
          eternity before the ages, so neither ought it to be thrown forward to
          the consummation of the world as others hold—as if God only then
          exercises properly the act of a Judge, both in the pardon of believers
          and in the condemnation of the wicked. For thus the declaration of
          justification is falsely confounded with justification itself. For
          although we are told the heavenly Judge will then sit on his throne of
          glory to exercise the last solemn act of judgment (as much in grace as
          in justice, in the sight of heaven and earth), this does not prevent
          that judgment from commencing in the present life. Nay, this must
          necessarily be supposed, since that final judgment is nothing else
          than a public and solemn manifestation of preceding judgments. And as
          Scripture everywhere sets before us the examples of God’s judgments,
          public as well as private over the wicked and rebellious (such as the
          flood, the destruction of Sodom, the overthrow of the Egyptians and
          the like), to refer these to mere chastisements of God, tending
          towards the improvement and salvation of those upon whom they were
          sent, is to contradict the whole tenor of Scripture and rashly to
          confound the medicinal chastisements of believers (which are sent upon
          them for instruction [paideian] by God as a merciful Father) with the
          punishments of the wicked (which are inflicted by God as an angry
          Judge, to punish [timorian] and avenge himself of their sins)—which
          has thus far been unheard-of in theological schools. So that he is
          evidently a stranger to the Scriptures who does not know that God is
          often set forth as justifying believers in this life; as is evident
          from the examples of Abraham (Gen. 15:6), of David (Ps. 32:1, 2, 5;
          Rom. 4:6, 7), of the sinful woman (Lk. 7:48), of the publican (Lk.
          18:14) and of all believers (Rom. 5:1). Not to say now that that
          opinion is hurtful to the consolation of believers, which springs from
          no other source more certainly than from a sense of the grace of God
          and his justification. For how else could they have the confidence in
          which they glory and exult on account of their justification and enjoy
          unspeakable (aneklaléto) peace and joy?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>But it takes place in this life in effectual calling.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. This opinion then being dismissed, we embrace the middle one,
          which makes justification to take place in this life in the moment of
          effectual calling, by which the sinner is transferred from a state of
          sin to a state of grace and is united to Christ, his head, by faith.
          For hence it is that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to him by
          God, by whose merit apprehended by faith he is absolved from his sins
          and obtains a right to life. This absolving sentence, the Spirit
          pronounces in his heart when he says, “Be of good courage, son, thy
          sins are pardoned.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Further, this justification can be regarded in different ways: (1)
          actively on the part of God intimating by the Spirit the absolving
          sentence in the heart of the believer and judicially from the throne
          of grace (Heb. 4:16), pronouncing it upon us; and passively on our
          part, inasmuch as we admit and receive that absolving sentence
          delivered in the court of conscience by the Holy Spirit with faith,
          joy and the protestation of gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Second, universally as to state, when we are first received into
          union with Christ and his righteousness is imputed to us by God and
          received by faith. For then in passing from a state of sin into a
          state of grace, the guilt of all preceding sins is actually taken away
          and a remedy given to us in the righteousness of Christ against future
          sins. And specially as to particular acts of sin into which we
          afterwards fall, which also need a particular absolution. As often as
          it is intimated to us in the court of conscience, so often the
          believer is by repentance turned again to God and by faith applies to
          himself Christ’s righteousness. In this sense, we are commanded to
          seek remission of sins every day; not only with regard to the sense,
          but also with regard to the thing itself because sins cannot be
          forgiven unless committed (as we remarked before).
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Third, justification can be viewed in a twofold aspect (schesei):
          either as to the “eternal destination” in the decree, in which sense
          grace is said “to have been given to us in Christ before the world
          began” (2 Tim. 1:9) and God is said to have “predestinated us unto the
          adoption” (Eph. 1:5); or as to its execution in time which again can
          be regarded on the one hand as to obtainment, which was made by the
          death of Christ on the cross (referred to in Rom. 5:9, 10: “We were
          justified and reconciled to God by the blood of Christ”; and “Christ
          reconciled all things to God through the blood of the cross,” Col.
          1:20). Elsewhere Christ is said to “have been raised again for our
          justification” (Rom. 4:25) because as in him dead, we are dead, so in
          him raised and justified, we are justified (i.e., we have a sure and
          indubitable pledge and foundation of our justification because for no
          other cause was he justified by the Spirit [1 Tim. 3:16] except that
          we might be justified in him). Nor in a different sense does Paul say,
          “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
          their trespasses unto them” (2 Cor. 5:19); to wit, inasmuch as in
          Christ dying, the Father had the foundation of reconciliation by which
          he was made more propitious to the world of the elect, collected as
          well from the Jews as from the Gentiles, so that he does not impute to
          them their sins (which he imputed to Christ), but by absolving them
          from their sins, he may justify them also in him. On the other hand it
          may be viewed as to application, which is made in the heart by an
          intimation of the absolving sentence (referred to in Mt. 9:2). Or it
          may be viewed in general as to the state of the believer when he is
          first called; or in particular as to the act when he obtains the
          pardon of particular sins; or as to the sense and certainty of it,
          arising in us from a reflex act of faith (called consolatory); or
          finally, as to its declaration, which should be made immediately after
          death (Heb. 9:27) and publicly on the last day (which is not so much
          justification, as a solemn declaration of the justification once made
          and an adjudication of the reward, in accordance with the preceding
          justification).
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Hence it is evident in what sense justification can be called an
          undivided act; not on our part and with respect to the sense of it
          (which is produced by various and repeated acts according as this
          sense can be interrupted; or increased or diminished, by reason of
          interfering sins); but on the part of God, not only by reason of his
          decree (by which our justification was decreed) and by reason of his
          merit (by which he obtained it), but also by reason of the application
          when the absolving sentence is intimated to us. This is done by a
          unique act, not by many successive acts, just as inherent
          righteousness is wont to be infused into us (although this act is
          often applied to particular everyday sins).
