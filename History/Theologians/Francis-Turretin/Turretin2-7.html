        <h2>The Preservation of the Canon</h2>
        <p>SEVENTH QUESTION</p>
        <p><em>Will any canonical book ever have disappeared? Negative.</em></p>
        <p>
          I. In order more readily to discuss the various questions that are
          raised concerning the canon, a distinction must first be established.
          This word is used both broadly and narrowly. In the first sense it was
          applied by the patristic writers to the ecclesiastical decrees and
          constitutions, by which the councils and the rulers of the churches
          were accustomed to specify whatever seemed pertinent to faith,
          conduct, or discipline. In this are included the various "canons" both
          of the universal church and of the African, and the collections of
          canons by Burchard, Ivo, and Gratian, and the canon law itself which
          was contained in the codex of canons, in distinction to the divine law
          which was contained in the codex of Holy Scripture. In the latter
          sense, "canon" is attributed par excellence to Scripture, because God
          gave it to us as a rule of faith and conduct, in which sense Irenaeus
          calls it the "unchangeable norm of truth" and Chrysostom the
          "excellent measure, norm, and rule of all things."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Just as the word of God can be seen under two aspects, either as
          divinely revealed doctrine, or as the sacred books in which it is
          contained, so also "canon" can be understood in two senses, either of
          the dogmas, meaning all fundamental teachings, or of the books,
          meaning all the inspired books. "Canonical Scripture" can be
          understood in either sense: either as the content of dogmas, because
          it is the canon and norm of faith and conduct, originally described by
          the Hebrew word quoneh, which means measuring rod, and is so employed
          in Galatians 6:16 and Philippians 3:16; or with regard to the books,
          because it contains all the canonical books, in which sense Athanasius
          at the beginning of his synopsis says that the books of the Christians
          are not infinite in number, but finite, and comprise a limited canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The first question regarding the canon is its wholeness, whether
          any canonical book may have disappeared, or, whether the collection of
          Scripture as it now is lacks any book which God placed in the canon.
          On this matter both the Roman Catholics and the Reformed (orthodoxi)
          divide into different groups. Many Roman Catholics maintain that a
          number of canonical books have disappeared, so that they may show the
          imperfection of Scripture and the necessity of the tradition by which
          the gaps may be filled. Some of our theologians, such as Musculus and
          Whittaker, teach the same thing, following Chrysostom, but with two
          reservations; first, they affirm this only with regard to some books
          of the Old Testament, not any of the New, as do Roman Catholics;
          second, they maintain that nothing is taken away from the perfection
          of Scripture, which the Roman Catholics attack, by this, because the
          wholeness of the canon is not measured by the number of the sacred
          books, or their quantitative perfection, but by the completeness of
          the dogmas and the essential perfection of all things necessary for
          salvation, which is amply found in the existing books. But the more
          common and wiser opinion is that of others, who hold that no genuinely
          canonical books have disappeared, and that if any books have, they
          were not endowed with this quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The reasons are to be sought (1) from the witness of Christ, who
          said that it was easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one
          jot of the law to perish (Matt. 5:18; Luke 16:17). But if not even a
          jot, or the smallest mark, can perish, how could several books vanish?
          Although Christ is speaking of the teaching of the law, not the books,
          yet this can be applied to the sacred books by analogy, and their
          immunity from destruction can be affirmed, the more so because not
          only is reference made to the letters and marks by which Scripture is
          written, but also God willed that this teaching be preserved in
          written books. (2) From the statements of Luke and Paul. For neither
          could Luke have spoken of all the prophets and all the Scripture (Luke
          24:27) if any part of them had disappeared, nor could Paul have said,
          "Whatever . . . was written was for our instruction" (Rom. 15:4),
          unless he assumed that the whole written Old Testament was in
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. (3) From the providence of God, who always keeps watch for the
          continuing safety of the church. It cannot be conceived that
          providence would will that such a destructive loss occur; what would
          become of the wisdom, goodness, and power of God if he willed that
          such a precious treasure be shown to his church and then withdrawn,
          and that the body of Scripture exist now in a tom and wounded state?
          (4) From the duty of the church, which is commissioned to preserve
          zealously the oracles of God for herself. That this commission was not
          neglected is evident from the fact that neither Christ nor the
          apostles ever accuse the Jews of this, a sacrilege which those who do
          not overlook lesser ones would by no means have hidden, if [the Jews]
          had been guilty of it; indeed, Paul emphasizes this privilege of the
          Jews--that the oracles of God were entrusted to them (Rom. 3:2; 9:4).
          (5) From the destiny (fines) of Scripture which is sealed in the canon
          of faith and life even to the consummation of the age. This could not
          be so if only a mutilated and truncated canon were left for the church
          of this age, because of the loss of some canonical books; that is, it
          would be impossible without the canon. (6) From the custom of the
          Jews, because books of the canon of the Old Testament other than those
          which appear in our canon were never recognized, or interpreted in the
          Targum, or translated in the Septuagint.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Not everything which men of God ever wrote was of divine quality
          and inspired. They were able, as human beings, to reflect upon some
          events and interpret them I with care, and [to record] others, as
          prophets, by divine inspiration as authoritative for faith; matters
          which fall into the first category can be freely investigated, but
          those of the second must be believed, as Augustine well says (City of
          God 18.38). Just as not everything they said was canonical, so was not
          everything they wrote. If Solomon wrote a number of books of parables
          and songs, and about plants and animals (I Kings 4:22 - 23), it does
          not follow that they were canonical. They could have been prepared as
          a result of human study, to make public the manifold knowledge of
          nature which he possessed, without being of divine wisdom and
          supernatural inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The books which are said to have disappeared either were not
          sacred and canonical, like the Book of the Wars of Jehovah (Num.
          21:14; Josh. 10:15 [13]) or the Book of the Upright (II Sam. 1:14
          [18]), and the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah and Israel (I Kings.
          14:19 - 20; 15:7), which are not concerned with the teachings of
          religion, but are either secular annals, in which the actions of the
          Israelites are recorded, or lists of official acts and civil laws, as
          is plain from I Kings 11:41. Or, the books which are said to have
          disappeared are extant under other names, like the books of Gad and
          Nathan (II Chron. 29:29 [25]), of Iddo (II Chron. 9:29), and of
          Shemaiah and Iddo (II Chron. 12:15). The Jews teach, and some of the
          patristic writers observe, that these make up parts of the Books of
          Samuel and Kings, and some Roman Catholics of good standing
          agree-Sixtus Senensis, Paul Burgensis, Lewis de Tena, Sanctius, and
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The book of the Lord mentioned in Isaiah 34:16 is nothing other
          than the prophecy which he was writing in the name of the Lord, and
          which therefore he called the book of the Lord. Jeremiah's book
          mourning the death of King Josiah (II Chron. 35:25) can still be read
          in Lamentations.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. It is not said in Colossians 4:16 that there was any letter of
          Paul to the Laodiceans, for it speaks of a letter from, not to, the
          Laodiceans, which could have been by the Laodiceans to Paul, who
          wanted it to be read by the Colossians along with his because he knew
          that there were in it matters of concern to them. Whence it is evident
          how unreasonable was Faber Stapulensis's desire to give the epistle to
          the Laodiceans to the Christian world, as the more prudent Roman
          Catholics admit.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. In Jude 14 there is no mention of a book of Enoch, but only of his
          prophecy, for he is said to have prophesied, not written; if he did
          write a book it is evident that it was never included in the canon,
          both from the silence of Josephus and Jerome, and from the fact that
          Moses is recorded as the first canonical writer (Luke 24:27). It does
          appear from Augustine (City of God 15.13 [24]) that in his day there
          was an apocryphal book of which Enoch was considered the author, a
          fragment of which Scaliger has given us in his commentary on Eusebius.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. If some of the apostles mention passages of the Old Testament
          which cannot now be found explicitly in any canonical book, it does
          not follow that some canonical book, in which these words were
          written, has disappeared. At times the words are present implicitly
          and by intention. What is said of Christ in Matthew 2:23--that he will
          be called a Nazarene--is based either, as Jerome supposed, on Isaiah
          11:7 [1], where Christ is called a branch, or on Judges 13:5, which
          says that Samson, a type of Christ, will be a Nazarene of God from his
          mother's womb. In what is said in I Corinthians 5:9 about a letter
          that [Paul] had written them, there is no reason why we should not
          understand the letter which he was writing, in which, somewhat
          earlier, he had told them that those who polluted themselves by incest
          should be excommunicated, as in Colossians 4:16, "when the letter has
          been read," namely, the letter that he was writing. Or [references]
          are merely historical, like that of Jude 9, concerning the devil's
          struggle with Michael over the body of Moses, which could rest either
          on tradition, as some scholars hold, or on some noncanonical
          ecclesiastical book which has disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Although the autographs of the Law and the Prophets which were
          kept in the ark could have been burned along with it when the city was
          destroyed and the temple burned at the time of the Babylonian
          captivity, it does not follow from this that all the sacred books, to
          be rewritten afresh by Ezra, as by a second Moses, in forty days, were
          destroyed at that time. A number of copies could have remained among
          the pious, on the basis of which the worship of God was later set up
          (Ezra 6:18; Neh. 8:2). Nor is it likely that Ezekiel and the pious
          priests, and also Jeremiah, Gedeliah, and Baruch, who received
          permission to remain in Judea, would have been without them,
          especially since the care and reading of the sacred books was their
          duty; in the case of Daniel this is plainly seen (Dan. 9:2). IV Esdras
          4:23 and 14:21, on the basis of which a universal destruction has been
          claimed, prove nothing because they are apocryphal even to the Roman
          Catholics, and are refuted by another apocryphal book that is
          canonical to them--I Maccabees 2:4 [II Maccabees 2:4 - 5], which says
          that the ark in which the book of the law was kept (Deut. 31:26) was
          preserved by Jeremiah in a cave on Mount Nebo. Above all, the great
          silence of Scripture, which since it bewails with such agony the
          pollution of the sanctuary, the fall of Jerusalem, the removal of the
          sacred vessels, the destruction of the temple, and other events, could
          not have omitted such a great loss without open lamentation, refutes
          this falsehood [of the destruction of Scripture]. Ezra therefore could
          engage in collating, correcting, and restoring the copies which had
          been damaged during the captivity, which he could most appropriately
          do as an inspired person, but it was not his task to give [Scripture]
          anew to the church.
