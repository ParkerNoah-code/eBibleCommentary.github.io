          SECOND QUESTION
          <br />
          <em
            >Is the impulsive and meritorious cause (on account of which man is
            justified in the judgment of God) inherent righteousness infused
            into us or good works ? We deny against the Romanists.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Since it is evident from the preceding question that the word
          “justification” is forensic and is taken judicially here because it
          relates to the manner in which sinful man can stand before the bar of
          God and obtain the pardon of sin with a right to life, we must inquire
          before all things what is the foundation of this justification or what
          is the true and proper meritorious cause in view of which he is
          absolved by God from sin and adjudged to life. Concerning this we must
          first treat negatively (kat’ arsin) according to the Pauline method in
          order that we may see in what it does not consist; second, we must
          treat affirmatively (kata thesin) to see in what it does consist.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. However, we must premise here that God, the just Judge
          (dikaiokritén), cannot pronounce anyone just and give him a right to
          life except on the ground of some perfect righteousness which has a
          necessary connection with life; but that righteousness is not of one
          kind. For as there are two covenants which God willed to make with
          men—the one legal and the other of grace—so also there is a twofold
          righteousness—legal and evangelical. Accordingly there is also a
          double justification or a double method of standing before God in
          judgment—legal and evangelical. The former consists in one’s own
          obedience or a perfect conformity with the law, which is in him who is
          to be justified; the latter in another’s obedience or a perfect
          observance of the law, which is rendered by a surety in the place of
          him who is to be justified—the former in us, the latter in Christ.
          Concerning the first, Paul says, “Not the hearers, but the doers of
          the law shall be justified” (Rom. 2:13); and “Moses describeth the
          righteousness which is of the law. That the man which doeth those
          things shall live by them” (Rom. 10:5). Concerning the other, he says,
          “The gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
          believeth, for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith
          to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith” (Rom. 1:16,
          17); and “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
          that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 3:24). Concerning both, he says, “That
          I may be found in Christ, not having my own righteousness, which is of
          the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ” (Phil. 3:9;
          cf. also Rom. 9:30, 31). Hence a twofold justification flows: one in
          the legal covenant by one’s own righteousness according to the clause,
          “Do this and live”; the other in the covenant of grace, by another’s
          righteousness (Christ’s) imputed to us and apprehended by faith
          according to the clause, “Believe and thou shalt be saved.” Each
          demands a perfect righteousness. The former requires it in the man to
          be justified, but the latter admits the vicarious righteousness of a
          surety. The former could have place in a state of innocence, if Adam
          had remained in innocence. But because after sin it became impossible
          to man, we must fly to the other (i.e, the gospel), which is founded
          upon the righteousness of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ill. This being established, the question does not concern legal
          justification. For we confess that in it inherent righteousness is _
          its meritorious cause, nor can it be obtained except by the perfect
          obedience of man. But because the law has now become weak by sin, this
          method of justification is impossible (ek ton adynaton). Thus we treat
          of the evangelical justification proposed to us in the covenant of
          grace, which we deny to be founded in inherent righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The question is not whether inherent righteousness is infused into
          us through the grace of Christ, by whose intervention we are made
          partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and obtain a true and real
          holiness pleasing and acceptable to God, by which we are properly
          denominated just and holy. For whatever the opponents may calumniously
          charge upon the orthodox (to wit, that “we allow of no inherent
          righteousness,” as Bellarmine, “De Justificatione,” 2.1 Opera [1858],
          4:502, and others after him), it is surely a most foul calumny. Its
          falsity is proved from the writings of our divines whether public or
          private, in which everywhere and with common consent they teach that
          the benefits of justification and sanctification are so indissolubly
          connected with each other that God justifies no one without equally
          sanctifying him and giving inherent righteousness by the creating of a
          new man in true righteousness and holiness. But the question is
          whether that inherent righteousness (such as exists in believers on
          earth) enters into our justification, either as its cause or as a
          part, so that it constitutes some part of our justification and is the
          meritorious cause and foundation of our absolving sentence in the
          judgment of God. Romanists, as they pretend that justification
          consists of two parts— remission of sin and internal renovation of
          mind—so they assert that the cause on account of which God justifies
          us is the righteousness of God, which (infused into us) constitutes us
          internally righteous. For although they do not appear to exclude
          entirely the righteousness of Christ, inasmuch as they hold that by it
          he merited that God should communicate to us by the Holy Spirit
          internal righteousness and thus it is a condition of the formal cause
          (i.e., of inherent righteousness that it may be given to man), still
          they maintain that the right to seek life depends upon inherent
          righteousness and that on account of it God justifies us.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. This is evident from the Council of Trent where “the justification
          of the wicked is said to be the translation from that state in which
          man is born a son of the first Adam, into a state of grace and the
          adoption of the sons of God by the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our
          Savior. This translation indeed, after the promulgation of the gospel,
          cannot be made without the washing of regeneration or a desire for it”
          (Session 6.4, Schroeder, p. 31). And: “Justification itself follows
          this disposition or preparation which is not only the remission of
          sin, but also sanctification and the renovation of the inward man by a
          voluntary reception of grace and gifts, by which a person who was
          unjust is made just and instead of an enemy becomes a friend, so that
          he is an heir according to the hope of eternal life” (Session 6.7,
          Schroeder, p. 33). And afterwards: “The formal cause of it is the
          righteousness of God, not that by which he is himself righteous, but
          that by which he makes us righteous; and by which, bestowed upon us as
          his gift, we are renewed in the spirit of our mind and are not only
          accounted, but are truly called and are righteous, receiving each of
          us righteousness in ourselves, according to our measure, which the
          Spirit distributes to everyone as he wills and according to the
          peculiar disposition and cooperation of everyone” (ibid.). And Canon
          11: “If any man shall say that men are justified solely by the
          remission of sins to the exclusion of grace and charity which is shed
          abroad in our hearts by the Spirit and is inherent in them, or even
          that the grace by which we are justified is only the favor of God, let
          him be accursed” (Session 6, Canon 11, Schroeder, p. 43). From these
          declarations, it is evident that the Council held that inherent
          righteousness is the cause on account of which we are justified. Nor
          ought we to be deceived by their seeming distinction between the
          formal and meritorious cause: the one indeed being Christ’s, but the
          other infused righteousness. Since they speak of justification before
          God, the formal cause cannot be distinguished from the meritorious
          cause because in this respect the formal cause is nothing other than
          that in view of which God frees us from condemnation and receives us
          to eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. On the other hand, the orthodox think far differently. For
          although they do not deny that inherent righteousness was purchased
          for us by the merit of Christ and by his grace conferred upon us so
          that by it we are and can be denominated truly just and holy, still
          they deny that it enters into justification in any way, either as a
          cause or as a part, so that justification may be said to be placed in
          it and by and on account of it man may be justified before God. For
          the righteousness of Christ alone imputed to us is the foundation and
          meritorious cause upon which our absolutary sentence rests, so that
          for no other reason does God bestow the pardon of sin and the right to
          life than on account of the most perfect righteousness of Christ
          imputed to us and apprehended by faith. Hence it is readily gathered
          that we have not here a mere dispute about words (as some falsely
          imagine), but a controversy most real and indeed of the highest
          moment. In it we treat of the principal foundation of our salvation,
          which being overthrown or weakened, all our confidence and consolation
          both in life and in death must necessarily perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. This appears more clearly when we come to the thing itself and
          the controversy is not carried on coldly and unfeelingly in scholastic
          cloud and dust (as if from a distance), but in wrestling and
          agony—when the conscience is placed before God and terrified by a
          sense of sin and of the divine justice, it seeks a way to stand in the
          judgment and to flee from the wrath to come. It is indeed easy in the
          shades of the schools to prattle much concerning the worth of inherent
          righteousness and of works to the justification of men; but when we
          come into the sight of God, it is necessary to leave such trifles
          because there the matter is conducted seriously and no ludicrous
          disputes about words (logomachia) are indulged. Hither our eyes must
          be altogether raised if we wish to inquire profitably concerning true
          righteousness; in what way we may answer the heavenly Judge, when he
          shall have called us to account. Truly while among men the comparison
          holds good; each one supposes he has what is of some worth and value.
          But when we rise to the heavenly tribunal and place before our eyes
          that supreme Judge (not such as our intellects of their own accord
          imagine, but as he is described to us in Scripture [namely, by whose
          brightness the stars are darkened; at whose strength the mountains
          melt; by whose anger the earth is shaken; whose justice not even the
          angels are equal to bear; who does not make the guilty innocent; whose
          vengeance when once kindled penetrates even to the lowest depths of
          hell]), then in an instant the vain confidence of men perishes and
          falls and conscience is compelled (whatever it may have proudly
          boasted before men concerning its own righteousness) to deprecate the
          judgment and to confess that it has nothing upon which it can rely
          before God. And so it cries out with David, “Lord, if thou marked
          iniquity, who can stand?”; and elsewhere, “Enter not into judgment
          with thy servant, because no flesh will be justified in thy sight.”
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Here then is the true state of the controversy. When the mind is
          thoroughly terrified with the consciousness of sin and a sense of
          God’s wrath, what is that thing on account of which he may be
          acquitted before God and be reckoned a righteous person? What is that
          righteousness which he ought to oppose to the judgment of God that he
          may not be condemned according to the strict demands of the law
          (akribodikaion), but may obtain remission of sins and a right to
          eternal life? Is it righteousness inhering in us and inchoate holiness
          or the righteousness and obedience of Christ alone imputed to us? Our
          opponents hold the former; we the latter. We are about to demonstrate
          this distinctly: (1) as to inherent righteousness; (2) as to imputed
          righteousness. Of the latter we will treat in the next question; of
          the former we speak now.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Proof that inherent righteousness cannot be the cause of
            justification: (1) because it is imperfect.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. That inherent righteousness cannot be the meritorious cause of our
          justification, we prove: (1) because no one is justified by an
          imperfect righteousness, since the judgment of God is according to
          truth and in it there is no room for a gracious acceptation; nor can
          deception consist with his law and justice. But inherent righteousness
          is not perfect, nor actual, nor habitual. Not actual because in many
          things we all offend (Jam. 3:2) and there is no one that sinneth not
          (1 K. 8:46), which Bellarmine himself does not deny (“De
          Justificatione,” 2.16 Opera [1858], 4:530—32). Not habitual because
          the perfection and imperfection of an act depend upon the perfection
          or imperfection of the habit and our regeneration is always imperfect
          here (1 Cor. 13:12; Gal. 5:17). Nor ought it to be objected “that this
          absolute perfection was required under the law, but is not required
          under the gospel.” The relaxation made under the gospel does not
          extend so far that an imperfect righteousness can be accepted for a_
          perfect righteousness; for God cannot be satisfied except by a perfect
          righteousness. Rather it consists in this—that the vicarious and the
          alien righteousness of a surety is admitted for our own. Nor ought it
          to be objected “that righteousness is properly said to be perfect
          because it belongs to the works of God, which must be perfect because
          the work of the Rock is perfect” (Dt. 32:4). For the works which God
          does immediately by himself (which are rightly called perfect
          absolutely and simply) and the mediate works (which are performed by
          the intervention of creatures—such as the work of regeneration—which
          are not at once perfect because God operating according to our
          capacity promotes and perfects them little by little) differ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Because works are excluded.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Second, our justification takes place without works; therefore also
          without inherent righteousness, which consists wholly in works or in
          habits from which works spring. The passages are obvious. Scarcely
          anything has been said more often and asserted more constantly;
          nothing certainly more fully argued: “By the deeds of the law, there
          shall no flesh be justified” (Rom. 3:20); “We conclude, that a man is
          justified by faith without the deeds of the law” (v. 28). This the
          apostle confirms in Rom. 4:6 and Gal. 2:16 and in many other places.
          Nor should it be replied here that all works are not absolutely
          excluded, but certain ones only (to wit, ceremonial); or if moral
          works are excluded, those only are meant which precede faith and grace
          and which are done by the strength of free will, not those which are
          done from faith and grace. Since the apostle absolutely and simply
          excludes all works without any exception, it does not become us to
          limit what he does not limit. The thing itself proves this also for he
          antithetically opposes faith to works in this matter. Hence it appears
          that all works entirely of
        </p>
        <p>
          whatsoever kind and not some particular ones are excluded. Otherwise
          he could not have simply opposed “one working” and “one believing,”
          “to do” and “to believe,” but a certain kind of working to other
          kinds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Both ceremonial.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. This is demonstrated in particular (1) as to ceremonial works. For
          that law with its works is understood to be excluded by the apostle by
          which is the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20) and the whole world has
          become exposed to condemnation (v. 19). Concerning this it is said,
          “The man that doeth them shall live in them” (Gal. 3:12) and from the
          curse of which Christ redeemed us (v. 13). This must be understood of
          the whole law, especially the moral, not the ceremonial. (2) If the
          ceremonial law only would be excluded, not the moral (since it is the
          less principal part of the law), justification would have to be
          ascribed rather than denied to the law by reason of the moral law
          (which is much prior). (3) This objection is rejected by many
          Romanists—Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Toletus, Pererius, Justiniani,
          Salmeron and others, as their commentaries clearly show. Lombard says,
          “Without any works of the law, even the moral” (In Epistolam ad
          Romanos [PL 191/1.1364] on Rom. 3:27). Thomas Aquinas says on this
          passage: “Without the works of the law, not only ceremonial, which do
          not bestow grace, but signify it, but also without the works of the
          moral precepts according to this, not by works of righteousness which
          we have done (Tit. 3:5)” (“Lectio [TV Ad Romanos,” In Omnes Sancta
          Pauli Epistolas Commentaria [ed. P. Marietti, 1917], 1:55-56 on Rom.
          3:27-31). Augustine teaches expressly that Paul speaks of the whole
          law (On the Spirit and the Letter 13 [8] [NPNF1, 5:87—88]). Nor if the
          controversy between Paul and the false apostles arose from the use of
          circumcision and the observance of the ceremonial law (which they
          urged as necessary to justification), does it follow that the apostle
          speaks of it alone when he excludes the works of the law from it. He
          passes from a part to the whole, this hypothesis of the false apostles
          drawing with it a necessity of observing the whole law (as we see in
          Acts 15:5) and Paul himself testifies when he says that he who presses
          circumcision as necessary “is a debtor to do the whole law” (Gal. 5:3)
          because the law demands not a partial, but a perfect obedience in all.
          Hence because he saw that believers would thus slide back to the old
          covenant and depart from the new, he inveighs with so much warmth
          against this error as most pestilential.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>And moral after grace.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. No better do others answer that it treats of works of the moral
          law done before faith and grace. (1) Paul excludes all works which are
          opposed to faith; yet all works without distinction are here opposed
          to faith, as working and believing are opposed (Rom. 4:5). (2) There
          was no necessity to exclude the works of the unregenerate, since it
          was acknowledged that they were sins, being done without faith (Rom.
          14:23). (3) The examples of Abraham and David adduced by Paul (Rom.
          4), inasmuch as they had been already converted and were believers,
          prove that works performed even after faith are excluded; as the
          apostle speaking of himself (now a believer) says, “I know nothing by
          myself; yet am I not hereby justifed” (1 Cor. 4:4). (4) All those
          works are excluded which could leave any reason for boasting to man
          (Rom. 3:27). And yet such are works done by faith which they hold to
          be meritorious. (5) The works of believers are effects which follow
          justification, not the causes which precede it. (6) The design of the
          apostle in the epistle to the Galatians was to dispute against the
          false apostles who joined together in justification, faith and works,
          the grace of Christ and their own merits. (7) If he had wished to
          exclude only the works of nature and not the works of grace, why does
          he so often and so carefully oppose works to faith absolutely? Why
          does he never oppose the works of nature to the works of grace, which
          would have greatly assisted in refuting the calumny of his adversaries
          by which they assailed his doctrine, as if by excluding works from
          justification he would open the door to sin: “Shall we continue in
          sin, that grace may abound?” (Rom. 6:1). And yet that inference would
          be founded upon no foundation at all, if Paul had wished to exclude
          only works done before faith. For who otherwise would gather that sin
          must not be indulged in after faith on this account because works
          antecedent to faith do not justify in the least? Now both kinds of
          works being excluded, it was easy to object this very thing, which the
          Romanists of the present day object to us (to wit, that it is useless
          to do good works if there is no merit in works; nay, we should rather
          sin that grace may abound). This objection of the profane, the apostle
          did not refute by a distinction between antecedent and subsequent
          works (which assuredly he ought to have done according to the
          hypothesis of our opponents); but by an explanation of sanctification
          and its indissoluble connection with justification.

          <b>3. Because justification is free.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Third, “our justification is free by the grace of God, through
          the redemption of Christ” (Rom. 3:24). Here the grace of God cannot
          denote the infused habit of love (as Bellarmine holds), but the favor
          and benevolence of God because we are said to be justified by his
          grace (té autou chariti) (i.e., as the leading [proegoumené] and
          meritorious cause is placed in the redemption of Christ, the false is
          rejected by the particle “freely” [dorean], which excludes all merit
          in us). (2) This grace is opposed to works and boasting (Rom. 11:6;
          Eph. 2:9). (3) We cannot be justified by the redemption of Christ
          otherwise than by the imputation of his righteousness. This is
          incompatible (asystatos) with inherent righteousness in the matter of
          justification; for if we are justified in another, we cannot be
          justified in ourselves. (4) Pererius confesses that charin here
          denotes rather the gratuitous goodness and kindness of God towards men
          (which is elsewhere called “kindness” [chréstotés] and “love”
          [philanthropia] toward man, Tit. 3:4). If the benevolence of God works
          good-pleasure (eudokias) in men (i.e., the good which he wills for
          them), it does not follow that he gives inherent righteousness that we
          may be justified by it. God does that good by distinct acts—the good
          indeed of imputed righteousness by the act of justification or
          inherent righteousness by the act of sanctification (as he has made
          Christ unto us both righteousness and sanctification, 1 Cor. 1:30).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4. Because justification consists in the remission of sins.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Fourth, according to Paul justification consists in the remission
          of sins (Rom. 4:8). Nor can it be done otherwise, since a sinner is
          concerned. And yet he whose sin is freely pardoned cannot be justified
          by inherent righteousness; nor is inherent righteousness remission of
          sins. Nor does he escape who says that it is not indeed remission of
          sins, but still it is connected with it in justification. It involves
          a contradiction to say that man is justified at the same time by
          inherent righteousness and by remission of sins, as it is most absurd
          (asystaton) for one to be justified in himself and in another (by a
          personal and by another’s obedience).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5. Because justification is not by the law.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Fifth, if justification were by inherent righteousness,
          justification will be of the law, not of the gospel, and the two
          covenants will be confounded which are nevertheless constantly opposed
          as diametrically opposite to each other. Legal justification takes
          place in no other way than by inherent righteousness, whether actual
          or habitual; gospel justification is to be sought not in us, but in
          another. This the apostle clearly teaches when he wishes “to be found
          in Christ” (to wit, in the judgment of God) “not having his own
          righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
          faith of Christ” (Phil. 3:9) (i.e., not an inherent righteousness,
          arising from an observance of the law and which is called ours because
          it is in us and is perfected by our actions, but the righteousness of
          God and Christ, imputed to us and apprehended by faith).

            boasting.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Sixth, this derogates from the merit of Christ and is an argument
          for glorying and pride. For if the righteousness and merit of Christ
          most fully suffice for our justification, why are human merits sewed
          on? Is not injury thus done to Christ and material given to man for
          glorying in himself with God? Nor is this absurdity removed by saying
          that all this righteousness depends on Christ, who obtained that also
          for us and gave to it the power of meriting. Besides the gratuitous
          assumption that Christ merited for us the power of meriting (as will
          be seen in the proper place), whatever good man receives from God by
          grace (according to their hypothesis) does not exclude the concourse
          of free will (by whose intervention man may have some material for
          glorying in himself, while we ought to glory in the Lord alone). The
          Pharisee is no less condemned, although giving thanks to God he
          professes that he has all that he has from him, not from himself (Lk.
          18:11, 12, 14).

          <b>7. Because it does not take away guilt.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Seventh, remission of sin requires the removal of guilt by the
          payment of the ransom (lytrou) due. And yet inherent righteousness can
          neither remove the offense to God or the guilt springing from it, nor
          compensate for the injury to the divine majesty. For besides the fact
          that it looks to the future (that man may perform his duty), not to
          the past (that he may compensate for the defect of duty by giving a
          satisfaction), it is impossible by a quality of finite virtue and
          worth for an offense of infinite indignity to be blotted out and
          compensated for.

          <b>8. From the testimony of Contarini and Bellarmine.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Eight, we cannot omit here the remarkable testimonies of two
          cardinals, who, overcome by the power of the truth, agree with us. The
          first is Cardinal Contarini, who thus expresses himself: “Since we
          reach a twofold righteousness by faith, a righteousness inherent in
          us, and the love and grace by which we are made partakers of the
          divine nature; and the righteousness of Christ given and imputed to
          us, since we are planted in Christ and put on Christ: it remains to
          inquire, on which of these we ought to rest, and to think ourselves
          justified before God (i.e., reckoned holy and righteous). I truly
          think it to be said piously and religiously that we ought to rest, I
          say rest as upon a stable thing, which can certainly sustain us, upon
          the righteousness of Christ bestowed upon us, and not upon the
          holiness and grace inherent in us. For this our righteousness is
          inchoate and imperfect which cannot keep us from offending and from
          constantly sinning in many things. Therefore we cannot in the sight of
          God on account of this our righteousness be esteemed righteous and
          good, as it becomes the sons of God to be good and holy. But the
          righteousness of Christ given to us is a true and perfect
          righteousness. It is altogether pleasing in the sight of God. In it
          there is nothing that offends him; that does not in the highest degree
          please him. We must therefore rest upon this alone (sure and stable)
          and on account of it alone we must believe that we are justified
          before God, that is, considered righteous and called righteous” (“De
          Justificatione,” Casparis Contareni Cardinalis Opera [1571], p. 592).
          From him Bellarmine does not differ much, who, after exerting all his
          strength in a defense of human merit, pressed by the consciousness of
          the truth, at length is brought to say “that on account of the
          uncertainty of personal righteousness, and the danger of vain glory,
          it is the safest to place our entire confidence in the mercy and
          kindness of God alone” (“De Justificatione,” 5.7 Opera [1858], 4:615).
          To this proposition answers this clause of his will: “And I pray him
          to admit me among his saints and elect, not as an estimator of merit,
          but as a bestower of pardon.”

        <p>
          <b>Sources of explanation.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Christ by his obedience is rightly said “to constitute” us
          “righteous,” not by an inherent but by an imputed righteousness as is
          taught in Rom. 4:6 and gathered from the opposition of the antecedent
          condemnation (Rom. 5:19). For they are no less constituted righteous
          before God who, on account of the obedience of Christ imputed to them,
          are absolved from deserved punishment, than they who on account of the
          disobedience of Adam are constituted unrighteous (i.e., are exposed to
          death and condemnation). If Adam constituted us unrighteous
          effectively by a propagation of inherent depravity (on account of
          which we are also exposed to death in the sight of God), it does not
          follow equally that Christ constitutes us righteous by a forensic
          justification at the bar of God by inherent righteousness given to us
          by him. The design of the apostle (which alone is to be regarded) does
          not have this direction. He only wishes to disclose the foundation of
          the connection between being exposed to death and the right to life,
          from our union with the first and second Adam, as to the thing
          (although the mode is different on account of the difference in the
          subject). The “abundance of grace and of righteousness” (perisseia tés
          charitos kai dikaiosynés, Rom. 5:17) does not denote habitual grace or
          inherent righteousness, but the abundance of divine mercy and the
          infinite treasury of righteousness, which believers obtain in the
          obedience of the Mediator. And this gift is said to be greater than
          the sin of Adam because the grace of God giving us the righteousness
          of Christ, not only took away the guilt of one transgression, but of
          all actual sins (as Thomas Aquinas well remarks on this passage). Nor
          does it press us more that we are said “to receive abundance of grace”
          (Rom. 5:17) because we receive it by the hand of faith, not that it
          becomes ours by way of infusion or of inhesion, but by way of
          imputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. “Justification” is not set forth as a genus, embracing under
          itself “ablution” and “sanctification” (1 Cor. 6:11), but on the
          contrary “ablution,” which is adumbrated in baptism; as the more
          general word is set forth in the first place, containing under it
          justification and sanctification as two species, as frequently both
          these benefits are wont to be described by the one word—ablution, as
          much as justification (Ps. 51:2; 1 Jn. 1:7) and as much as
          sanctification (Heb. 9:14). What is added, however, concerning “the
          name of Christ” does not properly denote an invocation, which is made
          by it, but the power and efficacy of it—that “to be justified in the
          name of Christ” is nothing else than to be justified by and on account
          of Christ. For there is no other name by which we can obtain
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. Paul does not say that we are justified by regeneration (Tit.
          3:5—7); nay, since he ascribes justification to the grace of God and
          takes it away from works, he shows that he is unwilling to ascribe it
          to righteousness inhering by regeneration, which is rather the fruit
          than the cause of justification. But his intention is to point out how
          God will have us saved by two benefits which he bestows upon
          us—regeneration, of which the Holy Spirit is the author in us; and
          justification, which we obtain by Christ, by which we are made heirs
          of eternal life. That denotes the way of salvation, this its cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. The conformity to the image of Christ to which we are
          predestinated (Rom. 8:29) means indeed that we are made partakers of
          inherent holiness and righteousness like his; but it does not mean
          that we are justified by that inherent righteousness, as he was. For
          both our preceding sin and the imperfection of this righteousness in
          us renders such a justification impossible. For it cannot happen that
          they, who are the children of wrath by nature and who are never
          without sin, can be justified in the Same manner in which he was
          justified, who knew no sin and in whose mouth no guile was found.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Although Abel and Noah were righteous and did good works, still
          they were not on that account justified by their own inherent
          righteousness and good works. Nay, Paul testifies that they were
          righteous by the righteousness of faith (Heb. 11): Abel in that by
          faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice, by which he also obtained
          witness that he was righteous (v. 4). Noah became heir of the
          righteousness which is by faith (v. 7), which is no other than the
          righteousness which God imputes through faith (Rom. 4:5, 6). From this
          flowed the good works which they performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Since justification is described in the Scriptures by remission
          of sins and the imputation of righteousness, it cannot be called a
          motion from sin to righteousness, such as occurs in illumination and
          calefaction. And this is the fundamental error (proton pseudos) of our
          opponents, who convert a forensic and judicial action (which takes
          place before God) into a physical or moral action (which takes place
          in us).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. When believers seek to be justified by God according to their
          righteousness (Pss. 7:8; 17:1; 18:20), we must not understand it of a
          personal righteousness (of which they elsewhere confess they are
          destitute, Pss. 130:3; 143:2), but of a righteousness of the cause
          (which they maintained and on account of which they suffered
          persecution from the wicked); or if personal righteousness is
          understood by it, it is not universal and absolute (which is found in
          no mortal), but particular as to certain acts in which they can
          conduct themselves well by the grace of God (such as was the action of
          Phineas which was imputed to him for righteousness) and comparative,
          not relative to God, but to the wicked (who undeservedly slandered
          them).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. The proportion of man to the highest good is either from the
          prescription of the law (“Do this and live”) or from the assistance of
          grace. In the former sense, man in innocence would have had a
          proportion to the highest good. But by sin, that way having been shut
          up, another was to be sought in Christ, who by fulfilling the law for
          us, acquired for us a right to the highest good or eternal life. When
          therefore life is said to be given to the pious and righteous, the
          quality or disposition of the subject is denoted (which ought to
          possess life), not, however, the cause of such a good (i.e, how happy
          they ought to be, not why and on account of what).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVII. Although in those to whom the satisfaction of Christ is
          imputed, the habit of righteousness is also infused (which we reach
          only in the other life and by this habit we begin to be righteous
          morally and inherently), still we cannot be called righteous relative
          to the divine judgment. For we are constitued righteous in the divine
          court only insofar as we can remove the accusation with which we are
          charged—of sin past as well as present. Now such an inchoate habit of
          righteousness cannot remove such an accusation, whether by making it
          false (because it is evident that we always have sinned and so are
          guilty) or by expunging it through a suffering of the punishment due
          (because it cannot have the relation of a satisfaction for sins
          committed by which their guilt may be taken away). For it tends to
          this—that we may not sin hereafter; but it cannot make us not to have
          sinned so that we do not need another’s righteousness imputed to us
          for our justification.
