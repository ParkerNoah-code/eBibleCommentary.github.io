          FIFTH QUESTION: THE VIRTUES OF THE HEATHEN<br />
          <em
            >Whether the virtues of the heathen were good works from which the
            power of free will to good can be inferred. We deny against the
            papists</em
          >
        </p>
        <h2>Occasion of the question.</h2>
        <p>
          I. This question arises from the preceding. In order to show that
          strength for good survives to the free will in a state of sin, the
          papists use the common example of the heathen who strove after virtue
          above others or were distinguished for illustrious deeds (whose
          virtues they deny to have been sins, deserving the disapprobation of
          God, but rather consider good works, meriting favor). Thus the Council
          of Trent: “Whoever says that all works done before justification, in
          whatever way done, are truly sins, or deserve the hatred of God, or
          that the more earnestly one strives to dispose himself to grace, so
          much the more seriously he sins, let him be anathema” (Session 6,
          Canon 7, Schroeder, p. 43). Bellamine endeavors to prove “that man can
          without faith, with special help and even without it, perform some
          moral good, if no temptation presses” (“De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio,”
          5.9, 10 in Opera [1858], 4:391—98).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. However we say two things. First, although we confess that some
          good can be found in these actions (as to the external honesty of the
          act commanded by God and which therefore cannot but be good), still we
          deny that they can be called properly and univocally good works as to
          the truth of the thing and mode of operation (to wit, internal
          rectitude of heart and intention of the end). We assert with Augustine
          that they were nothing but “splendid sins.” Second, whatever good or
          less evil they performed, was not owing to their own strength, but to
          God’s special help.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The former may easily be gathered from what has been already
          said. Since it has been shown that the inability (adynamian) of the
          sinner to good is total and Scripture ascribes it to all without
          exception, it is evident that no works truly good can be performed by
          the unrenewed man.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This is still further strengthened by the conditions of a good
          work. Three things are altogether required for a good work. First, on
          the part of the principle, that it proceed from a heart purified by
          faith (Acts 15:9), because whatever is not of faith is sin (Rom.
          14:23) and is displeasing to God (Heb. 11:6); for “unto them that are
          defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and
          conscience is defiled” (Tit. 1:15). Second, on the part of the form or
          mode, that it be done according to the law of God, not only in the
          external work, but especially with the internal obedience of the heart
          which the spiritual law of God requires from sinners (Rom. 7:14). (3)
          On the part of the end, that it be done to the glory of God (1 Cor.
          10:31). It is certain that the virtues of the heathen are defective in
          these three particulars. For in reference to the principle, they could
          not proceed from faith or a clean heart (of which they were
          destitute); so as to the mode, they had no internal and spiritual
          obedience; and as to the end, no direction to the glory of God (since
          they struggled for their own advancement and glory). Now a good work
          is from an entire cause, but an evil work from even a single defect.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The Athenians are said to “worship (eusebein) the unknown God”
          (Acts 17:23). Not as if with a true and saving worship they adored the
          true God, but according to opinion (kata doxan) because they supposed
          they offered a true worship to the true God although unknown. Thus by
          an admirable accommodation (synkatabasin), the apostle strove to gain
          them over to Christ by tempering his rebuke with praise. He did not
          simply call them “too superstitious” (deisidaimonesterous), but “as
          too superstitious” (hos deisidaimonesterous) that he might not seem
          too harsh. Thus he does not say simply “ye worship” (eusebeite), but
          “ye ignorantly worship” (agnoountes eusebeite) to prove the vanity of
          their worship, that no one might accuse him of flattery.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. As the moral actions of the heathen are not sins per se (and as to
          substance of the work), but by accident (and as to the mode of
          operation) in the essential conditions (on account of the various
          defects mentioned before); not on that account is it better to omit
          than to perform them, lest we sin (but the defects should rather be
          corrected and supplied). What are of themselves sins forbidden of God
          should be omitted; but what are only accidentally such from some
          defect of circumstances should not be omitted, but corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Earthly reward does not prove true virtue and a good work because
          it is only of perishable things which God bestows promiscuously upon
          the reprobate and the elect. This is a remarkable proof of the divine
          justice, to teach how much true piety pleases him when he not only
          remunerates true virtues by eternal rewards, but also the images of
          virtues by temporal blessings not on account of the adhering
          depravity, but on account of the apparent external good (in order that
          even unbelievers may have nothing to complain of concerning the
          justice of God).
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Since the humiliation of Ahab (1 K. 21:27, 28) was dissembled
          and hypocritical (from fear of punishment rather than from love of
          virtue), it could not per se be pleasing to God. Nor did God grant to
          him an absolute remission of the punishment before threatened, but
          only some delay; not in order to testify that the external humiliation
          of the wicked king was accepted by him, but to show to others what is
          to be expected by one seriously and heartily repenting. The repentance
          of the Ninevites cannot be reckoned among the works of the heathen,
          since they are said to have repented at the word of God and from the
          operation of faith in God (which is expressly ascribed to them, Jn.
          3:5; Mt. 12:41).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Whatever, moreover, was done by the Gentiles in reference to this
          subject (by which they were made no better than others, but at least
          less evil) does not prove remaining strength for good in their free
          will because not even this could be done without God’s special help.
          If some were more observant than others of justice and goodness; if
          some excelled in learning, genius, fortitude, justice and temperance
          and other virtues (as among them Aristides was celebrated for justice;
          Scipio for continence; Socrates for wisdom; Alexander for bravery;
          others for other virtues), these are not to be ascribed to their
          better nature, but are to be recognized as the gifts of God who gives
          some over to their own lusts, but restrains the depravity of others
          from breaking forth. Nor were the heathen themselves ignorant of this,
          who acknowledged that “virtues are inspired only by the divine
          breath,” and “there never was a great man without divine inspiration”
          as Plato frequently says and Cicero after him (cf. Cicero, ?De
          Republica 3.3 and 6.8 [Loeb, 16:186—87, 260-61; De Natura Deorum 2.167
          [Loeb, 19:282—83]). Reason itself also persuades us. For why should
          the sons of heroes be so degenerate? Why should twins be so unlike?
          Why should those enjoying the best education become savage beasts? The
          cause, therefore, of this difference is to be sought only in the
          providence of God. While it permits some to sink with impunity into
          every enormity, it restrains and represses others as with a bit that
          they may not rush into the same unbridled license with others. Hence
          they are not common gifts of nature, but special graces of God
          dispensed variously to men (inasmuch as he knows that it conduces to
          the preservation of the universe).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Whatever knowledge of God is found in the heathen cannot be
          considered a good work because if they confess with the mouth, they
          deny him in their works. They had a knowledge of God, but held the
          truth in unrighteousness, neither glorified him as God (i.e., they did
          not truly know him). This was the height of their crime—being
          unwilling to acknowledge him of whom they could not be ignorant, and
          forming for themselves innumerable gods in place of the one God (whom
          they could know from his works). Well, therefore, are they called
          atheists by the apostle (Eph. 2:12) with their own crowd of gods
          because they were ignorant of the existence of the true God and of his
          will towards us. So the Lord gave them indeed a slight taste of his
          divinity that they might not offer ignorance as an excuse. He has
          driven them at times to say some things by the confession of which
          they themselves might be convicted; but they so saw what they saw as
          by no means to be directed by the sight to the truth, much less to
          attain it. It is like the flashing of lightning at night, surrounded
          by which the traveller sees far and wide for a moment, but so
          evanescent that he is again involved in the darkness of night before
          he can move a step—so far is he from being prospered in his journey by
          such a help.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. This was the constant opinion of Augustine which he often
          established against the Pelagians: “True virtue exists in no one who
          is not righteous; and no one is truly righteous who does not live by
          faith. Moreover, who of those who wish to be considered Christians,
          except the Pelagians alone, or even thou alone perhaps among them,
          would say that the just man is enslaved by the devil?” (Against Julian
          4.3 [17] [FC 35:181; PL 44.745]). And elsewhere: “However highly the
          works of unbelievers may be extolled, everything which is not of
          faith, is sin” (On the Proceedings of Pelagius 34 [NPNF1, 5:198—99; PL
          44.341]). So Prosper, a disciple of Augustine: “Without the worship of
          the true God, even what seems virtue is sin, nor can anyone please God
          without God; and he who does not please God, whom does he please
          except himself and Satan” (The Call of All Nations 1.7* [ACW 14:34; PL
          51.653-54]). And in his precious little book Carmen de Ingratis:
          “Every virtuous deed is a sin, unless it rises from the seed of true
          faith; it becomes a source of guilt, and its barren glory heaps up
          punishment for itself” (16.407—409 [trans. C.T. Huegelmeyer, 1962],
          pp. 66-67; PL 51.117). Whoever wishes more on this question should
          consult Jansen Augustinus where this entire argument is fully and
          satisfactorily discussed (“De statu naturae lapsae,” 3, 4 [1640/1964],
          pp. 429-678).
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Now this is the nature of free will in a state of sin. But how it
          is constituted in the moment of calling and in the progress of
          sanctification will be treated of in the proper place (with the favor
          of God). May the Father of mercies grant that, seriously acknowledging
          our nothingness (oudeneian) and inability (adynamian), we may learn to
          depend entirely upon him and to ascribe all our salvation to his
          grace, saying with the psalmist, “Not unto us, O Lord, but unto thy
          name be all the glory” (Ps. 115:1). Amen.
