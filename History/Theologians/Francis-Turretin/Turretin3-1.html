          FIRST QUESTION
          <br />
          <em
            >Can the existence of God be irrefutably demonstrated against
            atheists? We affirm</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Although the “Deity is unbounded and incomprehensible” (apeiron kai
          akatalépton ... to theion) as Damascene well remarks (Exposition of
          the Orthodox Faith 1.4 [NPNF2, 9:4; PG 94.797]); and to speak the
          truth concerning God is even dangerous on account of his exalted
          “preeminence (hyperochén),” as Cyprian says; yet because God has
          condescended to reveal himself to us both in nature and in the
          Scriptures (and it is incumbent upon the one who approaches God to
          believe that he is and is a rewarder of those who seek him, Heb.
          11:6), the discussion conceming God holds the first place in theology
          and embraces the sum of all saving knowledge. We are to learn so that
          with fear and trembling (searching into what the Lord has revealed) we
          may not rashly pry into the secrets which he has reserved to himself
          alone—“lest being unlawfully curious in the latter, we may be found
          worthy of just condemnation in the former,” as Prosper says (Call of
          the Nations 1.21* [ACW 14:68; PL 51.674]).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The subject admits of a threefold division. First, that we may
          know that he is (with respect to existence) against the atheist.
          Second, that we may know what he is (with respect to his nature and
          attributes) against the heathen. Third, that we may know who he is
          (with respect to the persons) against the Jews and heretics. The
          former two relate to God considered essentially (ousiddds); the latter
          relate to him regarded hypostatically (hypostatikOs) and personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Although that there is a God is an indubitable first principle of
          religion (rather to be taken for granted than proved, so that they who
          doubt it are to be punished and not disputed with, as Aristotle says),
          yet the execrable madness of modern atheists (of whom this most
          corrupt age is far too fruitful, who do not blush impiously to deny
          this clearest truth) renders this question necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The question is not whether the true and saving knowledge of God
          obtains everywhere among men. For no one can deny that the true God
          was and is even now unknown by many nations, who are therefore called
          atheists (atheoi) by the apostle (Eph. 2:12). Rather the question is
          whether such a knowledge of the deity is implanted in men by nature,
          that no one can be wholly ignorant of him; or whether the existence of
          God can be demonstrated by unanswerable arguments, not only from the
          Scriptures, but also from nature herself. Profane men and atheists
          unscrupulously deny this; we assert it.
        </p>
        <p><b>The being of God is proved.</b></p>
        <p>
          V. The demonstration of deity rests upon four foundations principally:
          (1) the voice of universal nature; (2) the contemplation of man
          himself; (3) the testimony of conscience; (4) the consent of all
          mankind. For God, the wonderful artificer of the universe, has so
          deeply stamped upon all its parts the impression of his majesty that
          what was commonly said of the shield of Minerva (into which Phidias
          had so skillfully introduced his likeness that it could not be taken
          out without loosening the whole work) has a far juster application
          here. God cannot be wrested from nature without totally confusing and
          destroying it.
        </p>
        <p><b>From the subordination of causes.</b></p>
        <p>
          VI. Nature proves the being of God since she proclaims that she not
          only is, but is from another and could not be without another. For if
          it is certain and indubitable that out of nothing, nothing is made and
          that nothing can be the cause of itself (for then it would be before
          and after itself), it is also certain that we must grant some first
          and unproduced being from whom all things are, but who is himself from
          no one. For if every being is produced, it is produced either by
          itself or by some other; not by itself because (as was just said)
          nothing can be the cause of itself; not by another because then it
          would follow that there could be an infinite series in producing
          causes or that a circle would be made, both of which are untenable.
          For as to the circle, it evidently cannot be granted since in those
          things which are made there is always a last thing which has not made
          anything else. Besides such a circle is impossible; for suppose it
          were true, it would follow that the same thing was made by itself and
          was the cause (mediately at least) of itself. Nothing would be more
          absurd. Neither can an infinite series of producing causes be allowed
          because in causes there must necessarily be some order as to prior and
          posterior. But an infinite series of producing causes rejects all
          order, for then no cause would be first; rather all would be middle,
          having some preceding cause. Indeed there would be no cause which
          ought not to have infinite superior causes before itself (which is
          impossible [asystaton]). If there were infinite causes before each and
          every cause, before the whole multitude and collection of causes there
          would be infinite causes and thus that collection would not be total.
          Again, if the first cause can never be reached by ascending from the
          effects to the cause, so the ultimate effect can never be arrived at
          by descending from the causes to the effects. For the infinite can be
          gone through no more by ascending than by descending. Therefore we
          must necessarily stop in some cause which is so the first as to
          recognize no superior. Thus that series of causes ought not to be in
          infinitum, but ad infinitum in which it will be terminated.
        </p>
        <p><b>From the newness of the world.</b></p>
        <p>
          VII. (2) The newness of the world with the commencement of motion and
          of time proves the necessary existence of God. For if the world began,
          it must necessarily have received its beginning from someone. Inasmuch
          as it could not be from itself, it could be from no other than God.
          Now there are many proofs that the world had a beginning and is not
          eternal. Time could not be from eternity. If so, then from eternity
          there must have been the vicissitude of day and night which is
          impossible (asystaton). It is inconsistent that day and night have
          been from eternity since they would either have been at the same time
          (which implies a contradiction) or successively (which destroys the
          eternity). Again, if time is eternal, there could not have been a
          first day, for if there were, time had a beginning. If there were no
          first day, a day preceded every day (i.e., there was a day before
          there was a day). Third, if time is eternal, there were infinite
          years, infinite months, days and hours. But the number of months,
          years and days will either be equal or not. If equal, it would follow
          that a part is equal to the whole, and the whole is not greater than
          its part. If unequal, there will be made a greater and lesser in an
          infinity. Fourth, either no day was from eternity, or every day, or
          only some one. If the former, time is not eternal; experience teaches
          the falsity of the second; the third cannot be said because if some
          one day was from eternity, its duration ought to be infinite and
          without a beginning (which implies a contradiction) since its duration
          would be terminated in twenty-four hours. Fifth, all motion is with
          succession (including priority and posteriority) which is repugnant to
          eternity. Sixth, if the sun revolved and illuminated the world from
          eternity that was done either with respect to our hemisphere, or
          exactly the opposite, or with respect to both at the same time. The
          former cannot be said because what is successive cannot be called
          eternal; not the latter because it is impossible for the sun to
          illuminate both hemispheres at the same time. For it would have to be
          in many places at the same time and everywhere would be day and there
          would be no such thing as night.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. If men were from eternity, there would be granted infinite
          generations succeeding each other, and the number of men who have
          lived thus far would be infinite. But there can be no such thing as an
          infinite series in generations (as we said before), nor can the number
          of men who have thus far lived be infinite, since it is increased
          every day. Nothing can be added to that which is infinite! Again
          either some one man was from eternity or no one. If no man, then men
          are not from eternity and were not created by God. If some man was, he
          could not have been created by another, since what is produced by
          another is after it and what is eternal recognizes nothing before
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. To no purpose do atheists (in order to prove the possibility of an
          infinite series) bring forward the consideration of posterior
          eternity. For by descending into the eternity without end, there is
          granted a first, though not a last, and the last can never be arrived
          at; so by ascending into anterior eternity, there is granted a last,
          though not a first. Two things entirely dissimilar are here brought
          together: that which was and has really passed and that which never
          will be nor come to pass. For the duration of past time, and the
          succession of men who have lived thus far, was and no more is; but the
          duration of futurity and of the men who will live in it is such that
          it can never be said to have passed by. Finally, there may be the
          beginning of a thing without end (as in the duration of angels and of
          souls), but there cannot be an end without a beginning because an end
          necessarily supposes some beginning from which the thing had its
          origin. Hence the consequence does not follow. If in posterior
          eternity there can be granted a duration which had a beginning and
          will not have an end, then in anterior eternity there can be granted a
          duration which may have an end and yet never had a beginning.
        </p>
        <p><b>From the beauty of the universe.</b></p>
        <p>
          X. (3) The wonderful beauty and order of the universe is another
          proof. For if order requires wisdom and intelligence, the most perfect
          supposes the most perfectly necessary and infinite wisdom which we
          call God. Now he is blind who does not see the most beautiful order
          everywhere and most wicked who does not acknowledge it. There is so
          suitable a disposition of parts, so constant a concord of things so
          discordant, so harmonious an agreement and consent of creatures the
          most diverse, so swift and at the same time equable motion of the
          heavenly bodies and so immutable a stability and constancy of the
          order once established. So not only do the heavens declare the glory
          of God, but every blade of grass and flower in the field, every pebble
          on the shore and every shell in the ocean proclaim not only his power
          and goodness, but also his manifold (polypoikilon) wisdom, so near
          each one that even by feeling, God can be found. Augustine says, “The
          prophetic voices excepted, the world itself by its own most regular
          mutability and mobility and the exquisitely beautiful appearance of
          all visible things, silently as it were proclaims both that it was
          made and could be made only by a God unspeakably and invisibly great,
          and unspeakably and invisibly beautiful” (CG 11.4 [FC 14:191; PL
          41.319]).
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. You may say perhaps that these things were so arranged by chance
          and by a fortuitous concourse of atoms. But I know not whether such an
          impious and absurd opinion is worthy of refutation, since these things
          denote not chance (tychén), but the highest art (technen). For things
          which come by chance are uncertain and ill-arranged and have nothing
          constant and similar; but nothing can be conceived more regular and
          composed than this universal frame. To say, then, that this most
          beautiful and highly decorated universe was produced by a fortuitous
          concourse of atoms is the same as to say that “if innumerable forms of
          the one and twenty letters were thrown together, the annals of Ennius
          could be produced from them when shaken upon the earth and could
          afterwards be read” (as Cicero remarks, De Natura Deorum 2.37.93
          [Loeb, 19:212—13]). In the same place, he quotes from Aristotle: “If
          there were persons who had always lived under the earth in good and
          splendid habitation and yet had never come out upon its surface, but
          had heard that there was a deity and a power of the gods; then upon
          some occasion the jaws of the earth being opened they could come out
          and walk abroad in these places where we now live; when suddenly they
          would see the earth, and sea and the heavens, and behold the sun, and
          know both its admirable magnitude and virtue, and contemplate the
          whole sky bespangled with stars, their rising and setting, their
          regulated and immutable eternal motion; when they saw these things
          they would assuredly think both that there were gods, and that these
          so magnificent works were theirs” (ibid., 2.37.95, pp. 214-15).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>From the tendency of all things to an end.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. (4) The tendency of all things toward an end confirms this. For
          since all natural beings act for the sake of some end (which they
          always certainly and infallibly pursue), they must necessarily be
          directed by the design of some ruler. Inasmuch as nature does nothing
          vain, if it acts for the sake of some end, it must either itself know
          and seek that end or if it does not know or seek it, be directed to it
          by another. Now since among natural things there are many incapable of
          forming plans (because they are either inanimate or devoid of reason
          [alogoi]), they need some external counsel to direct them. Now that
          external counsel can be attributed to no other than the author and
          ruler of nature. Nor can it be said that nature herself is in single
          things by whose counsel they are directed to their ends, for nature
          will be the natural property and particular single nature of each
          thing. But how can that be capable of counsel if the things themselves
          are brutes (or certain common nature collected from the nature of
          single things)? But a common nature is not beyond the single natures
          or some intelligent and subsisting substance by whose counsel all
          things are directed. But this is to make a god of nature and with the
          denial of God, to recognize him under the name of nature, according to
          the Philosopher who says a “work of nature is the work of an unerring
          intelligence.”
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. (5) Man himself has in his own breast a familiar teacher of this
          very truth. If he would withdraw his attention from all things and
          reflect upon himself, he would recognize no less wisdom in the little
          world than in the great, and admire in his body a visible (and in his
          mind a scintillating) divinity. For whence is the body constructed
          with such wonderful and truly stupendous skill? Whence so many
          different members created together by a mutual interweaving and so
          fitly disposed to their peculiar offices, unless from an immense
          spirit? Whence the mind, a particle of the divine breath, possessed of
          so many faculties, furnished with so many gifts, unless from a supreme
          intelligence? This image clearly bespeaks its prototype, and everyone
          who pays attention will not only hear and see God present in himself,
          but also in a manner touch and feel him.
        </p>
        <p><b>From conscience.</b></p>
        <p>
          XIV. (6) This is especially taught by this power and stimulus of
          conscience (the inseparable attendant of crime either begun or
          finished) whose sense can neither be blunted, nor accusation escaped,
          nor testimony corrupted; nor can it fail to appear on the appointed
          day, nor its tribunal be shunned. For how comes it that the conscience
          is tormented after a crime committed (even in secret and with remote
          judges), where no danger threatened from men (even in those who held
          supreme power) unless because it is affected by a most intimate sense
          of deity (as appears from the case of Nero, Caligula and others)?
        </p>
        <p>
          But why should you suppose that a man escapes punishment whose mind is
          ever kept in terror by the consciousness of an evil deed which lashes
          him with unheard blows, his own soul ever shaking over him the unseen
          whip of torture?<br />

          —Juvenal, The Satires of Juvenal 13.192—95 (Loeb, 260-61)
        </p>
        <p>
          As each man’s conscience is, so doth it, for his deeds, conceive
          within his breast or hope or fear. <br />
          —Ovid, Fasti 1.485—86 (Loeb, 5:36—37)
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence those terrors of conscience, trembling at more atrocious
          wickedness, unless from the sense of some avenger and judge whom, not
          seeing, it everywhere feels? For these terrors cannot arise from any
          fear of civil laws or any temporal punishment or disgrace—both because
          these are only feared in the case of open crimes (which alone the
          civil laws and in accordance with them the judges can punish), and
          because they affect those also who recognize no superior on earth and
          who therefore can be judged by no one. Otherwise how does it come
          about that when an unforeseen danger assails or a sudden fear arises,
          they who appeared to have wholly divested their minds of the sense of
          deity, tremble at an angry God and implore his aid with ejaculatory
          prayers and groans? But what makes them so terribly afraid, who are
          either profane in secret and in their mind only deny that there is a
          God? You may say perhaps it is a vain fear; but if vain, whence is it?
          Why is it so tenacious and inexpugnable even when there is no cause
          for fear? Who or what is feared by him who alone is conscious of his
          own thoughts, who is confident that there is no arbiter or witness or
          judge of them? Himself? But he is his own best friend. Others? But
          they do not know his thoughts or intentions. Then if they wish to be
          safe, they prove by their mouth what they deny in their heart. Why
          then are they not secure? Therefore, willing or unwilling, they must
          believe that there is a God whom right reason itself teaches them to
          fear and orders them to recognize as the Lord and Judge of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Nor can it be objected that Paul says that men sometimes arrive at
          such a height of wickedness as to render themselves without feeling
          (apélgékotes, Eph. 4:19), i.e., free from all the pain which
          conscience otherwise usually produces; yea to such a pitch as to have
          their consciences cauterized (kekautériasmenén) and therefore
          destitute of all sense and remorse (as the same apostle says, 1 Tim.
          4:2). For this indeed indicates the attempt and desire of such wicked
          men (and the effect of that attempt which may appear externally) when
          they show to others a bold confidence and a mind confirmed in
          wickedness, as if they were pressed by no sense of guilt or torture of
          conscience; but it does not show what their minds are internally. For
          this does not appear, this they can dissimulate in public. If they are
          regarded externally, they are without sense, without pain, indeed they
          openly declare the absence of it. But if we could look within, we
          would find their minds restless and pierced with the sharpest thorns.
          Yet I do not mean to deny that by a habit of sinning their consciences
          may be made so callous that occasionally and for a time they may seem
          to have lost all sense of sin and may not feel or care for the goads
          of conscience (especially in prosperity, when their powers are
          unimpaired, health is strong and public approbation is present). But
          it cannot be said that they have lost all sense entirely. Conscience
          slumbers, but is not dead; it is intoxicated from the flesh, but not
          extinct. Otherwise, how could Paul say, “Men having not the law, are a
          law unto themselves, and show the work of the law written in their
          hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
          meanwhile [thereupon and at intervals] accusing, or else excusing one
          another” (Rom. 2:14, 15) in good or bad action.

        <p><b>From the consent of mankind.</b></p>
        <p>
          XVI. (7) Another argument is the constant and perpetual sense and
          consent of all men. For although they may have entertained different
          notions concerning the nature and number of the deity and the reason
          and method of worshipping him, they erred for the most part most
          wickedly. Still in so great a variety there was this uniform agreement
          in the belief that there is some deity who ought to be religiously
          worshipped. “There is no nation,” says Cicero, “so intractable and
          fierce, although it may be ignorant what a God it should have, yet is
          not ignorant that one should be had” (Laws 1.8.24 [Loeb, 16:324—25]).
          Indeed so deeply has this notion struck its roots in the minds of men
          that men would rather believe there is a god than that there is none
          and preferred to have a false god than no god. Hence it happened that
          they would rather worship stones and stocks and even the vilest things
          than be without some deity (which never could have been done by man
          naturally proud unless he possessed the strongest impression of a
          divinity). If some monsters have existed, who by gigantic efforts have
          proclaimed war against their own nature in denying a God (as the
          psalmist testifies, “the fool says in his heart there is no god,”
          14:1), besides the fact that this is to be understood rather of
          practical than theoretical atheists (as will be hereafter proved),
          they ought not to be opposed to the common and general consent of all.
          Nor should the furious attempts of those who strive to stifle this
          knowledge and even die in their obstinacy prejudice the universal
          judgment of all the rest which (diffused everywhere throughout all
          parts of the world) has most constantly continued through so many
          ages. No more than the monsters and prodigies which are sometimes seen
          contrary to nature can overturn the regular laws established by God;
          or the instances of insanity overturn the definition of man as a
          rational animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Since then this constant and universal agreement of all men
          concerning this primary truth can either have arisen not from a simple
          desire (which in many would tend to a removal of a deity to be feared
          on account of their crimes than to an acknowledgment of one), nor be
          founded on state policy or ancestral tradition (which could never be
          so efficacious as to produce a general consent in the minds of all),
          it follows necessarily that it took its rise from the evidence of the
          thing itself. It is so great that no one possessed of a sound mind can
          be ignorant of it. It is evident from the most intimate sense of
          deity, impressed by God upon each one, so as to deprive them of the
          pretext of ignorance. Since all to a man may understand that there is
          a God and that he is his maker, they are condemned by their own
          testimony for not worshipping him. Here pertain those words of
          Iamblicus, “Before all use of reason a notion of the gods is naturally
          implanted in men, yea a certain tact of divinity better than
          knowledge” (De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum [1972], p. 1). This is the
          knowledge of God (to gnoston tou Theou) which he wished to manifest in
          the Gentiles (Rom. 1:19). Damascene explains this: “The knowledge of
          the existence of God is naturally impressed upon all men by himself”
          (pasi hé gnosis tou einai theon hyp’ autou physikos enkatsepartai,
          Exposition of the Orthodox Faith 1.1 [NPNF2, 9:1; PG 94.789]).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. It makes little difference whether we explain this sense by a
          natural knowledge of God implanted, or a common notion, or a
          conception of the mind, or (as more recently) by the idea of God as
          the most perfect being impressed upon our minds. These all come to the
          same thing, viz., that there is implanted in each one from his birth a
          sense of deity which does not allow itself to be concealed and which
          spontaneously exerts itself in all adults of sound mind. Only let us
          observe that the idea of God can with less propriety be said to be
          impressed upon us, if by it is meant a certain intelligible species
          and image of God in our minds representing to us clearly and
          distinctly the whatness (quidditatem) and essence of God (which both
          his infinite majesty rejects and our finite and weak intelligence
          cannot take in). For how could either an (in any way) adequate or a
          clear and distinct image of an infinite being exist in a finite mind?
          Nor (if it may be held as certain from the common notion and instinct
          of conscience that there is a God) does it follow that by a clear and
          distinct conception (such as the idea of which we speak is supposed to
          be) we can ascertain immediately who and what he is. Besides it is
          certain that a clear and distinct idea of God (if there is any such in
          us) comes not from nature (darkened and blinded as it is by sin), but
          from the supernatural revelation of the word, in which he has clearly
          manifested himself to us (although this very knowledge in relation to
          that of glory is only specular and enigmatical, i.e., as yet imperfect
          and very obscure).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Many other arguments might be adduced to confirm this truth: from
          the prophecies of contingent future events (which could not be
          foretold long before their accomplishment unless by an omniscient
          mind); from the heroic actions of illustrious men (which could not be
          thought to be done without a divine influence); from the changes and
          overthrow of empires (which the thing itself declares happened by the
          finger of God); from the public judgments and punishment of crimes
          inflicted by an avenging nemesis; and from the miracles surpassing the
          power of all nature. For as it can do nothing beyond its power (and
          not only the Scriptures record, but both Jews and Gentiles confess
          that many miracles have often been wrought in the world), we must
          necessarily suppose a most perfect being, greater and more excellent
          than all nature, to whose power they must be ascribed (who can be no
          other than God).
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. Now these and the like arguments (drawn from the contemplation of
          the divine works and the inmost recesses of nature), which are
          sufficient to cover with confusion these impious fighters against God
          (theomachoi), are more clearly confirmed by the testimony of the
          irrefragable word which (since it bears on its front the conspicuous
          marks of its own divinity, as we have seen before, and everywhere
          declares its author to be God) has inscribed this persuasion upon the
          minds of believers in indelible character.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. To these arguments ad hominem might also be added those of
          sufficient force to move even the atheist to believe in deity, if not
          for the sake of vindicating God himself and religion, at least for his
          own sake and profit. For if there were no God, no republic, no society
          in the world would be safe. Without virtue, without religion, nothing
          can be safe. If there were no God, there would be neither virtue nor
          religion. What would the world be but a mere den of robbers in which
          license would be each one’s law, no such thing as right or wrong, no
          right of government, no necessity of obedience—the most abandoned, the
          superior and the most powerful, the master? No check would be placed
          upon the oppression of rulers and the rebellion of subjects. Each one
          would follow the bent of his own inclination. Again, if there were no
          God, no mortals would even for a moment be safe or secure from
          violence, fraud, perjury, slaughter of blood. Every hour everything
          would have to be feared. Take away the barriers of divinity and what
          would become of confidence and innocence? What license or violence
          would not be witnessed? As to human edicts (besides the fact that they
          cannot change the mind for the better, but on the contrary make it
          artful and intent upon all the arts of deception), what place would
          there be for human laws, if (the sense of deity being removed) the
          conscience would shake off all relations of justice and injustice?
        </p>
        <p><b>Sources of explanation.</b></p>
        <p>
          XXII. Although God is not manifest to the senses comprehensively as he
          is in himself, yet he can be perceived apprehensively as shining in
          his works, appearing in signs, heard in the word and manifested in the
          fabric of the whole universe. (2) It is a false assumption that there
          is nothing in the intellect which was not before in some sense. For
          universals are in the intellect and never were in any sense. A mind is
          known as also an angel, yet they are never perceived or seen except
          from their effects. Why therefore may not God be most certainly known
          in the mind from his works and a posteriori, although we cannot
          perceive him with our eyes or any of the other bodily senses?
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. It is one thing to acknowledge that there is an apparent
          confusion and disorder (ataxian) in the universe as to us (which we
          do); another, that there is a true and real confusion and disorder on
          the part of God (which we deny). For what to us may appear disordered,
          with God may be perfectly arranged.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Although various things in the world seem to be useless, many
          indeed hurtful and dangerous, tending to its own destruction and the
          extreme misery of the human race (such as dreadful and volcanic
          mountains overwhelming by a perpetual eruption of flames and ashes
          fields, villages, cities and entire regions with men and other animals
          indiscriminately; whirlpools, ship-wrecking rocks, poisonous herbs,
          noxious animals and other things of the kind), it does not follow that
          the world was not created and is not now directed by some perfectly
          good and wise being. Besides the fact that the glory of the Creator is
          most strikingly exhibited by all these, yet there is nothing so
          useless and apparently hurtful as not to be conducive in various ways
          both to man and other creatures. Nor (if we cannot ascertain the
          various uses of these things) does it follow that they have none.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. The prosperity of the wicked and the adversity of the pious
          exhibit a most wise dispensation which converts all these to its own
          glory and the salvation of the pious. But this ought not to weaken our
          faith in deity. Indeed they confirm the truth of a final judgment
          after this life where each one will receive a reward according to his
          faith and works.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. Infinite goodness does not immediately take away all evils if it
          is a perfectly free and not a necessary agent. It judges that the
          permission of evil for the purpose of extracting good from it pertains
          more to its wisdom and omnipotence than the not permitting the
          existence of evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVII. When God is said to be from himself, this must be understood
          negatively (because he is from no one, since he is self-living
          [autozoé] and self-existent [autoon]), rather than positively, as if
          he were the cause of himself (implying a contradiction) because he
          would then be before and after himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVIII. It is one thing to use religion and the sense of deity to
          coerce people to obedience and preserve them in duty; another to
          impose upon them such a persuasion of deity, although false. I confess
          indeed that legislators have done the former and cunning men have
          contrived many things in religion for the purpose of inspiring the
          common people with reverence and striking them with terror, so that
          they might keep their minds under greater subjection. But they never
          could have succeeded in that unless the minds of men had been imbued
          before with such a constant persuasion of deity that the propensity to
          religion burst forth from it as from a seed. Finally, who can believe
          that by the power or cunning of a few that constant opinion could be
          diffused through all parts of the world and through all ages, bringing
          so much terror to conscience even in the most secret crimes? Who does
          not see that if the persuasion of a divinity is due to the authority
          of laws and the fear of punishment, it would last no longer than the
          continuance of the yoke of slavery? On the contrary, we know in fact
          that it has pervaded all men, even the most free and those not bound
          by the chains of the law.
