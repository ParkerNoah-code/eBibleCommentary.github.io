          SECOND QUESTION
          <br />
          <em>Are there any atheists properly so called? We deny</em>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Statement of the question.</b></p>
        <p>
          I. As there is so large a number of atheists now in the world, it
          might at first sight seem amazing that anyone should either question
          or deny that there could be any. After laying down certain
          distinctions, it will be apparent in what sense it may be true that
          there can be many atheists, and yet that there are none.
        </p>
        <p><b>Speculative or practical atheism.</b></p>
        <p>
          II. First, an atheist may be either speculative or practical: the
          former as to faith, not acknowledging a God; the latter as to manners
          and life, recognizing but not worshipping him (who live just as if
          there were no God or wish in their hearts there was none). For
          although there is no practice which does not imply some knowledge (nor
          any knowledge at least concerning the worship of God which does not
          tend in some way to practice); so there is no practical atheism which
          does not arise from a depraved knowledge and corrupt judgment of mind
          and no speculative atheism which does not also draw after corrupt
          practice. Yet this does not hinder the denomination being made from
          the prevailing quality, so that the atheism which consists rather in
          ostentatious words and blasphemies should be called speculative, but
          that which is rather occupied with impious deeds should be termed
          practical. Now while we admit there are many practical atheists, we
          deny that there are any speculative.
        </p>
        <p><b>Speculative atheism.</b></p>
        <p>
          III. Second, a speculative atheist is either direct and express or
          indirect and interpretative. The direct is one who shakes off all
          knowledge, sense and belief of deity. The indirect is one who
          attributes to or denies to God such things that by necessary
          consequence God is denied. For example, he who denies the providence
          and justice of God (although he may profess to acknowledge a God) by
          that very thing denies him because God cannot be without providence.
          We do not here treat of the latter, but of the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Third, the direct atheist is either one externally disputing (yea
          even maliciously denying against his sense); or internally doubting
          (for a time vexed with doubts of the existence of God and appearing to
          yield to them for a moment in paroxysms of temptation); or studiously
          affecting a total want of perception of deity (anaisthésian); or
          plainly and certainly persuaded in his heart that there is no God.
          Concerning the former we do not treat (who, moreover, we do not deny
          can be found), but concerning the latter (whom we do). The question
          then is whether atheists are supposable not practically, but
          speculatively; not indirectly and interpretatively, but directly; not
          those who externally dispute, or deny, or internally doubt and
          endeavor to persuade themselves that there is no God; but who
          expressly believe it in their hearts and profess with their mouth.
          This we deny.
        </p>
        <p><b>Proof that atheism cannot be granted.</b></p>
        <p>
          V. The reasons are: (1) There is implanted in man a knowledge of God
          and sense of divinity, of which man can no more be destitute than of a
          rational intellect. Hence he cannot divest himself of it without
          putting off himself (as was proved before, Topic I, Question 3). If in
          Scripture the saving and practical knowledge by which they may be
          converted is denied to sinners (1 Jn. 2:4), it is not as if a
          theoretical and inefficacious knowledge is therefore denied. And if
          the ignorance of a depraved disposition is attributed to them (1
          Thess. 4:5; Eph. 4:17, 18), the ignorance of pure negation cannot be
          attributed to them equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. (2) The atheist has the work of the law written in him (Rom.
          2:14), and a natural observation and conscience in which God has
          erected his throne to be extinguished only with the light of reason.
          For although men of desperate impiety often endeavor to shake it off,
          yet they cannot. And as for a time they may seem to have rendered
          themselves insensible and conscience may slumber, at length it starts
          up and pierces their hearts with severer pangs, so that involuntarily
          they are held captive and then feel deeply him whom they desire to be
          ignorant of (as was the case with Caligula, Nero and many others). Nor
          can it be properly objected that this conscience is not always joined
          with any knowledge or fear of God. The scourge of conscience might be
          occasioned by the fear of men; for although this might be the case in
          known crimes, in those secret sins which men are ignorant of and
          perpetrated by those recognizing no superior on earth, whence could
          such terror arise except from a sense of God’s justice, smiting their
          consciences the more as they endeavored to escape it? Hence here truly
          there must be present something divine (theion ti).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (3) God has so clearly manifested himself in his works that men
          even by feeling may find him (Acts 17:26, 27), and cannot open their
          eyes without being immediately struck with the majesty and splendor of
          so great a deity. Nor does the particle (ei ara) used by the apostle
          throw doubt upon the evidence and certainty of the divine revelation,
          but refers to the senselessness and negligence of the seekers (as in
          Acts 8:22). Thus what is added concerning the presence of God (“he is
          not far from every one of us”) does not denote the special promise of
          grace to his faithful worshippers, but indicates the blessing of
          providence common to all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The acquired knowledge of God is usually obtained in the
          threefold way of causality, eminence and negation. By way of
          causality, when from the effects we infer the cause and from second
          causes we ascend to the first: “He that planted the ear, shall he not
          hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?” (Ps. 94:9). By way of
          eminence, we eminently ascribe (kat’ exochén) to God whatever of
          perfection there is in creatures. By way of negation, we remove from
          him whatever is imperfect in creatures, as when he is said to be
          invisible, immortal, immutable. By way of negation we arrive at the
          knowledge of negative attributes. By way of eminence, we know the
          positive attributes. And by way of causality we ascend to the
          knowledge of relative attributes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Sources of explanation.</b></p>
        <p>
          IX. When it is said, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no
          God” (Ps. 14:1), the certain and firm persuasion of an atheist denying
          God is not so much described, as the doubt and endeavor of the impious
          man striving to extinguish this knowledge. Therefore he does not say
          he believes and maintains, but he “says” (i.e., silently says to
          himself and endeavors to persuade himself of it). (2) A direct
          speculative atheism cannot be meant here because it treats of the
          wicked and sinners in general, as is evident from a comparison with
          Rom. 3. Now it is certain that all sinners cannot in this sense be
          called atheists. (3) Here is denoted not so much a denial of the
          existence as of the providence of God (as is evident from Ps. 10:4
          where what is said of the wicked man “who through the pride of his
          countenance, will not seek: God is not in all his thoughts”). Verse 11
          refers to the denial of providence: “He hath said in his heart, God
          hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.” Hence Owen
          rightly says:
        </p>
        <p>
          The fool says in his heart, there is no God, <br />
          He spoke, and no one believed this fool; <br />
          The fool denies God to be if no one, who therefore <br />
          Is an atheist? No one who wants God to be. <br />
          —“De Atheo,” Epigrammatum 3.16 (1622)
        </p>
        <p>
          X. An external negation of God (or only an erratic thought and doubt
          concerning him) differs from a fixed and constant denial in the heart.
          We allow that the former may exist in man, but not the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Whatever authors say of the stifling and obliteration of the light
          of nature for a time in a paroxysm of fury and of the cauterization of
          conscience (its lethargy and senselessness [anaisthésia]), ought not
          to be referred to the total extinction of that natural knowledge, nor
          to the certainty of a contrary assent and persuasion. Rather it ought
          to be referred to a certain suppression and darkening of that light
          and knowledge by which impious men cast off (as much as they can) the
          actual thought of God and endeavor to persuade themselves that there
          is no God; nor believe nor fear the vengeance of God as Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. The Gentiles are called atheists (atheoi, Eph. 2:12) not because
          they recognize no deity at all, but because they are destitute of the
          knowledge of the true deity. He who holds not the true God, must
          necessarily have no God. In fact the polytheist (polytheotés) is an
          atheist (atheotés).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Those who were branded with the infamous name of atheists among
          the ancients were not so much enemies of every deity, as despisers of
          idols and false gods (which Apuleius and Agellius testify concerning
          Socrates, who was declared by the oracle of Apollo to be the wisest
          man in all Greece).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. It is one thing for the actual thought of God to be absent for a
          time from the mind of an atheist, and that through negligence and
          criminality. It is another for the knowledge of God (which is
          primarily impressed after the manner of a permanent disposition or
          habit, and thence by ratiocination receives its form from the book
          both of nature and of the Scriptures) to be absent. The former can
          sometimes occur, but not the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. To the examples of atheists who seem to have abjured all sense of
          deity (as is said of Julius Caesar, Vaninus and others who persisted
          in their obstinacy even to the last gasp of life), we may reply that
          they indeed externally denied and internally zealously strove to
          extirpate this sense. However we cannot tell what their real
          persuasion was. Further, if their morals are considered, we can gather
          not obscurely that they were not free from internal tortures of
          conscience (whatever they might externally simulate for the purpose of
          obtaining glory by a profession of unyielding atheism). Nor does it
          hinder that they continued even to death in that madness because as
          the heart of man is deep and desperate, they could profess it (against
          the interior sense and the dictation of conscience) to merit the
          praise of unconquerable constancy and bravery among their surviving
          associates.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Although no one knows what is in man, save the spirit of man
          which is in him (1 Cor. 2:11), it does not hinder us from certainly
          maintaining that no one can utterly cast out of his heart all sense of
          deity, even as he can never divest himself of conscience. These are
          self-evident principles, depending upon the very consitution of man.
          So although an individual may profess that he neither knows, nor
          understands anything, does not perceive the truth of this principle
          (“nothing can be and not be at the same time”), has no law of nature
          or movement of conscience accusing or excusing; to such an
          insufferably vain sceptic, protesting falsely and contrary to the
          internal sense of his mind, universal experience, reason and the
          Scriptures can rightly be opposed, so that whatever he may say, we may
          charge him with doing violence to his own conscience.
