          10. Acknowledgment of the non-inspiration of Scripture teachers and
          their writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charge rests mainly upon the misinterpretation of two particular
          passages:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Act_23:5 (“I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest”) may
          be explained either as the language of indignant irony: “I would not
          recognize such a man as high priest”; or, more naturally, an actual
          confession of personal ignorance and fallibility, which does not
          affect the inspiration of any of Paul’s final teachings or writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of a more reprehensible sort was Peter’s dissimulation at Antioch, or
          practical disavowal of his convictions by separating or withdrawing
          himself from the Gentile Christians (Gal_2:11-13). Here was no public
          teaching, but the Influence of private example. But neither in this
          case, nor in that mentioned above, did God suffer the error to be a
          final one. Through the agency of Paul, the Holy Spirit set the matter
          right.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) 1Co_7:12; 1Co_7:10 (“I, not the Lord”; “not I, but the Lord”).
          Here the contrast is not between the apostle inspired and the apostle
          uninspired, but between the apostle’s words and an actual saying of
          our Lord, as in Mat_5:32; Mat_19:3-10; Mat_19:3-10; Luk_16:18 (Stanley
          on Corinthians). The expressions may be paraphrased:—“With regard to
          this matter no express command was given by Christ before his
          ascension. As one inspired by Christ, however, I give you my command.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Meyer on 1Co_7:10—“Paul distinguishes, therefore, here and in verses
          1Co_7:12; 1Co_7:25, not between his own and inspired commands, but
          between those which proceeded from his own (God-inspired) subjectivity
          and those which Christ himself supplied by his objective word.” “Paul
          knew from the living voice of tradition what commands Christ had given
          concerning divorce.” Or if it should be maintained that Paul here
          disclaims inspiration,—a supposition contradicted by the following
          δοκῶ—“I think that I also have the Spirit of God” (verse 1Co_7:40),—it
          only proves a single exception to his inspiration, and since it is
          expressly mentioned, and mentioned only once, it implies the
          inspiration of all the rest of his writings. We might illustrate
          Paul’s method, if this were the case, by the course of the New York
          Herald when it was first published. Other journals had stood by their
          own mistakes and had never been willing to acknowledge error. The
          Herald gained the confidence of the public by correcting every mistake
          of its reporters. The result was that, when there was no confession of
          error, the paper was regarded as absolutely trustworthy. So Paul’s one
          acknowledgment of non-inspiration might imply that in all other cases
          his words had divine authority. On Authority in Religion, see Wilfred
          Ward, in Hibbert Journal, July, 1903:677–692.
