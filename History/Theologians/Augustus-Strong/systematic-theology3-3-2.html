        <h2>II. Proof of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          1. Since we have shown that God has made a revelation of himself to
          man, we may reasonably presume that he will not trust this revelation
          wholly to human tradition and misrepresentation, but will also provide
          a record of it essentially trustworthy and sufficient; in other words,
          that the same Spirit who originally communicated the truth will
          preside over its publication, so far as is needed to accomplish its
          religious purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since all natural intelligence, as we have seen, presupposes God’s
          indwelling, and since in Scripture the all-prevailing atmosphere, with
          its constant pressure and effort to enter every cranny and corner of
          the world, is used as an illustration of the impulse of God’s
          omnipotent Spirit to vivify and energize every human soul (Gen_2:7;
          Job_32:8), we may infer that, but for sin, all men would be morally
          and spiritually inspired (Num_11:29—“Would that all Jehovah’s people
          were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!”
          Isa_59:2—“your iniquities have separated between you and your God”).
          We have also seen that God’s method of communicating his truth in
          matters of religion is presumably analogous to his method of
          communicating secular truth, such as that of astronomy or history.
          There is an original delivery to a single nation, and to single
          persons in that nation, that it may through them be given to mankind.
          Sanday, Inspiration, 140—“There is a ‘purpose of God according to
          selection’ (Rom_9:11); there is an ‘election’ or ‘selection of grace’;
          and the object of that selection was Israel and those who take their
          name from Israel’s Messiah. If a tower is built in ascending tiers,
          those who stand upon the lower tiers are yet raised above the ground,
          and some may be raised higher than others, but the full and unimpeded
          view is reserved for those who mount upward to the top. And that is
          the place destined for us if we will take it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If we follow the analogy of God’s working in other communications of
          knowledge, we shall reasonably presume that he will preserve the
          record of his revelations in written and accessible documents, handed
          down from those to whom these revelations were first communicated, and
          we may expect that these documents will be kept sufficiently correct
          and trustworthy to accomplish their religious purpose, namely, that of
          furnishing to the honest inquirer a guide to Christ and to salvation.
          The physician commits his prescriptions to writing; the Clerk of
          Congress records its proceedings; the State Department of our
          government instructs our foreign ambassadors, not orally, but by
          dispatches. There is yet greater need that revelation should be
          recorded, since it is to be transmitted to distant ages; it contains
          long discourses; it embraces mysterious doctrines. Jesus did not write
          himself; for he was the subject, not the mere channel, of revelation.
          His unconcern about the apostles’ immediately committing to writing
          what they saw and heard is inexplicable, if he did not expect that
          inspiration would assist them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We come to the discussion of Inspiration with a presumption quite
          unlike that of Kuenen and Wellhausen, who write in the interest of
          almost avowed naturalism. Kuenen, in the opening sentences of his
          Religion of Israel, does indeed assert the rule of God in the world.
          But Sanday, Inspiration, 117, says well that “Kuenen keeps this idea
          very much in the background. He expended a whole volume of 593 large
          octavo pages (Prophets and Prophecy in Israel, London, 1877) in
          proving that the prophets were not moved to speak by God, but that
          their utterances were all their own.” The following extract, says
          Sanday, indicates the position which Dr. Kuenen really held: “We do
          not allow ourselves to be deprived of God’s presence in history. In
          the fortunes and development of nations, and not least clearly in
          those of Israel, we see Him, the holy and all-wise Instructor of his
          human children. But the old contrasts must be altogether set aside. So
          long as we derive a separate part of Israel’s religious life directly
          from God, and allow the supernatural or immediate revelation to
          intervene in even one single point, so long also our view of the whole
          continues to be incorrect, and we see ourselves here and there
          necessitated to do violence to the well-authenticated contents of the
          historical documents. It is the supposition of a natural development
          alone which accounts for all the phenomena” (Kuenen, Prophets and
          Prophecy in Israel, 585).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Jesus, who has been proved to be not only a credible witness, but a
          messenger from God, vouches for the inspiration of the Old Testament,
          by quoting it with the formula: “It is written”; by declaring that
          “one jot or one tittle” of it “shall in no wise pass away,” and that
          “the Scripture cannot be broken.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus quotes from four out of the five books of Moses, and from the
          Psalms, Isaiah, Malachi, and Zechariah, with the formula, “it is
          written”; see Mat_4:4; Mat_4:6-7; Mat_11:10; Mar_14:27; Luk_4:4-12.
          This formula among the Jews indicated that the quotation was from a
          sacred book and was divinely inspired. Jesus certainly regarded the
          Old Testament with as much reverence as the Jews of his day. He
          declared that “one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from
          the law” (Mat_5:18). He said that “the scripture cannot be broken”
          (Joh_10:35) =“the normative and judicial authority of the Scripture
          cannot be set aside; notice here [in the singular, ἡ γραφή] the idea
          of the unity of Scripture” (Meyer). And yet our Lord’s use of O. T.
          Scripture was wholly free from the superstitious literalism which
          prevailed among the Jews of his day. The phrases “word of God”
          (Joh_10:35; Mar_7:13), “wisdom of God” (Luk_11:49) and “oracles of
          God” (Rom_3:2) probably designate the original revelations of God and
          not the record of these in Scripture; cf. 1Sa_9:27; 1Ch_17:3;
          Isa_40:8; Mat_13:19; Luk_3:2; Act_8:25. Jesus refuses assent to the O.
          T. law respecting the Sabbath (Mar_2:27 sq.), external defilements
          (Mar_7:15), divorce (Mar_10:2 sq.). He “came not to destroy but to
          fulfil” (Mat_5:17); yet he fulfilled the law by bringing out its inner
          spirit in his perfect life, rather than by formal and minute obedience
          to its precepts; see Wendt, Teaching of Jesus, 2:5–35.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostles quote the O. T. as the utterance of God (Eph_4:8—διὸ
          λέγει, sc. θεός). Paul’s insistence upon the form of even a single
          word, as in Gal_3:16, and his use of the O. T. for purposes of
          allegory, as in Gal_4:21-31, show that in his view the O. T. text was
          sacred. Philo, Josephus and the Talmud, in their interpretations of
          the O. T., fall continually into a “narrow and unhappy literalism.”
          “The N. T. does not indeed escape Rabbinical methods, but even where
          these are most prominent they seem to affect the form far more than
          the substance. And through the temporary and local form the writer
          constantly penetrates to the very heart of the O. T. teaching;” see
          Sanday, Bampton Lectures on Inspiration, 87; Henderson, Inspiration,
          254.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Jesus commissioned his apostles as teachers and gave them promises
          of a supernatural aid of the Holy Spirit in their teaching, like the
          promises made to the Old Testament prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mat_28:19-20—“Go ye … teaching … and lo, I am with you.” Compare
          promises to Moses (Exo_3:12), Jeremiah (Jer_1:5-8), Ezekiel
          (Eze_2:1-10; Eze_3:1-27). See also Isa_44:3 and Joe_2:28—“I will pour
          my Spirit upon thy seed”; Mat_10:7—“as ye go, preach”; 19—“be not
          anxious how or What ye shall speak”; Joh_14:26—“the Holy Spirit …
          shall teach you all things”; 15:26, 27—“the Spirit of truth … shall
          bear witness of me: and ye also bear witness” = the Spirit shall
          witness in and through you; 16:13—“he shall guide you into all the
          truth” = (1) limitation—all the truth of Christ, i. e., not of
          philosophy or science, but of religion; (2) comprehension—all the
          truth within this limited range, i. e., sufficiency of Scripture as
          rule of faith and practice (Hovey); 17:8—“the words which thou gavest
          me I have given unto them”; Act_1:4—“he charged them … to wait for the
          promise of the Father”; Joh_20:22—“he breathed on them, and saith unto
          them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit.” Here was both promise and
          communication of the personal Holy Spirit. Compare Mat_10:19-20—“it
          shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye
          that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.” See
          Henderson, Inspiration, 247, 248.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus’ testimony here is the testimony of God. In Deu_18:18, it is
          said that God will put his words into the mouth of the great Prophet.
          In Joh_12:49-50, Jesus says: “I spake not from myself, but the Father
          that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and
          what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life eternal;
          the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto
          me, so I speak.” Joh_17:7-8—“all things whatsoever thou hast given me
          are from thee: for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto
          them.” Joh_8:40—“a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard
          from God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The apostles claim to have received this promised Spirit, and under
          his influence to speak with divine authority, putting their writings
          upon a level with the Old Testament Scriptures. We have not only
          direct statements that both the matter and the form of their teaching
          were supervised by the Holy Spirit, but we have indirect evidence that
          this was the case in the tone of authority which pervades their
          addresses and epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statements:—1Co_2:10; 1Co_2:13—“unto us God revealed them through the
          Spirit..…Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom
          teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth”; 1Co_11:23—“I received of the
          Lord that which also I delivered unto you”; 1Co_12:8; 1Co_12:28—the
          λόγος σοφίας was apparently a gift peculiar to the apostles;
          1Co_14:37-38—“the things which I write unto you … they are the
          commandment of the Lord”; Gal_1:12—“neither did I receive it from man,
          nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus
          Christ”; 1Th_4:2; 1Th_4:8—“ye know what charge we gave you through the
          Lord Jesus.…Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God,
          who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.” The following passages put the
          teaching of the apostles on the same level with O. T. Scripture:
          1Pe_1:11-12—“Spirit of Christ which was in them” [O. T. prophets];—[N.
          T. preachers] “preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit”;
          2Pe_1:21—O. T. prophets “spake from God, being moved by the Holy
          Spirit”; 2Pe_3:2—“remember the words which were spoken before by the
          holy prophets” [O. T.], “and the commandment of the Lord and Savior
          through your apostles” [N. T.]; 16—“wrest [Paul’s Epistles], as they
          do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.” Cf.
          Exo_4:14-16; Exo_7:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implications:—2Ti_3:16—“Every scripture inspired of God is also
          profitable”—a clear implication of inspiration, though not a direct
          statement of it = there is a divinely inspired Scripture. In
          1Co_5:3-5, Paul, commanding the Corinthian church with regard to the
          incestuous person, was arrogant if not inspired. There are more
          imperatives in the Epistles than in any other writings of the same
          extent. Notice the continual asseveration of authority, as in
          Gal_1:1-2, and the declaration that disbelief of the record is sin, as
          in 1Jn_5:10-11. Jud_1:3—“the faith which was once for all (ἅπαξ)
          delivered unto the saints.” See Kahnis, Dogmatik, 3:122; Henderson,
          Inspiration (2nd ed.), 34, 234; Conant, Genesis, Introd., xiii, note;
          Charteris, New Testament Scriptures: They claim truth, unity,
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The passages quoted above show that inspired men distinguished
          inspiration from their own unaided thinking. These inspired men claim
          that their inspiration is the same with that of the prophets.
          Rev_22:6—“the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his
          angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to
          pass” = inspiration gave them supernatural knowledge of the future. As
          inspiration in the O. T. was the work of the preincarnate Christ, so
          inspiration in the N. T. is the work of the ascended and glorified
          Christ by his Holy Spirit. On the Relative Authority of the Gospels,
          see Gerhardt, in Am. Journ. Theol., Apl. 1899:275–294, who shows that
          not the words of Jesus in the gospels are the final revelation, but
          rather the teaching of the risen and glorified Christ in the Acts and
          the Epistles. The Epistles are the posthumous works of Christ.
          Pattison, Making of the Sermon, 23—“The apostles, believing themselves
          to be inspired teachers, often preached without texts; and the fact
          that their successors did not follow their example shows that for
          themselves they made no such claim. Inspiration ceased, and henceforth
          authority was found in the use of the words of the now complete
          Scriptures.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The apostolic writers of the New Testament, unlike professedly
          inspired heathen sages and poets, gave attestation by miracles or
          prophecy that they were inspired by God, and there is reason to
          believe that the productions of those who were not apostles, such as
          Mark, Luke, Hebrews, James, and Jude, were recommended to the churches
          as inspired, by apostolic sanction and authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twelve wrought miracles (Mat_10:1). Paul’s “signs of an apostle”
          (2Co_13:12) = miracles. Internal evidence confirms the tradition that
          Mark was the “interpreter of Peter,” and that Luke’s gospel and the
          Acts had the sanction of Paul. Since the purpose of the Spirit’s
          bestowment was to qualify those who were to be the teachers and
          founders of the new religion, it is only fair to assume that Christ’s
          promise of the Spirit was valid not simply to the twelve but to all
          who stood in their places, and to these not simply as speakers, but,
          since in this respect they had a still greater need of divine
          guidance, to them as writers also.
        </p>
        <p>
          The epistle to the Hebrews, with the letters of James and Jude,
          appeared in the lifetime of some of the twelve, and passed
          unchallenged; and the fact that they all, with the possible exception
          of 2 Peter, were very early accepted by the churches founded and
          watched over by the apostles, is sufficient evidence that the apostles
          regarded them as inspired productions. As evidences that the writers
          regarded their writings as of universal authority, see 1Co_1:2—“unto
          the church of God which is at Corinth … with all that call upon the
          name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place,” etc.; 1Co_7:17—“so
          ordain I in all the churches”; Col_4:16—“And when this epistle hath
          been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the
          Laodiceans”; 2Pe_3:15-16—“our beloved brother Paul also, according to
          the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you.” See Bartlett, in Princeton
          Rev., Jan. 1880:23–57; Bib. Sac., Jan. 1884:204, 205.
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnson, Systematic Theology, 40—“Miraculous gifts were bestowed at
          Pentecost on many besides apostles. Prophecy was not an uncommon gift
          during the apostolic period.” There is no antecedent improbability
          that inspiration should extend to others than to the principal leaders
          of the church, and since we have express instances of such inspiration
          in oral utterances (Act_11:28; Act_21:9-10) it seems natural that
          there should have been instances of inspiration in written utterances
          also. In some cases this appears to have been only an inspiration of
          superintendence. Clement of Alexandria says only that Peter neither
          forbade nor encouraged Mark in his plan of writing the gospel. Irenæus
          tells us that Mark’s gospel was written after the death of Peter.
          Papias says that Mark wrote down what he remembered to have heard from
          Peter. Luke does not seem to have been aware of any miraculous aid in
          his writing, and his methods appear to have been those of the ordinary
          historian.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The chief proof of inspiration, however, must always be found in
          the internal characteristics of the Scriptures themselves, as these
          are disclosed to the sincere inquirer by the Holy Spirit. The
          testimony of the Holy Spirit combines with the teaching of the Bible
          to convince the earnest reader that this teaching is as a whole and in
          all essentials beyond the power of man to communicate, and that it
          must therefore have been put into permanent and written form by
          special inspiration of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foster, Christian Life and Theology, 105—“The testimony of the Spirit
          is an argument from identity of effects—the doctrines of experience
          and the doctrines of the Bible—to identity of cause..…God-wrought
          experience proves a God-wrought Bible..…This covers the Bible as a
          whole, if not the whole of the Bible. It is true so far as I can test
          it. It is to be believed still further if there is no other evidence.”
          Lyman Abbott, in his Theology of an Evolutionist, 105, calls the Bible
          “a record of man’s laboratory work in the spiritual realm, a history
          of the dawning of the consciousness of God and of the divine life in
          the soul of man.” This seems to us unduly subjective. We prefer to say
          that the Bible is also God’s witness to us of his presence and working
          in human hearts and in human history—a witness which proves its divine
          origin by awakening in us experiences similar to those which it
          describes, and which are beyond the power of man to originate.
        </p>
        <p>
          G. P. Fisher, in Mag. of Christ. Lit., Dec. 1892:239—“Is the Bible
          infallible? Not in the sense that all its statements extending even to
          minutiæ in matters of history and science are strictly accurate. Not
          in the sense that every doctrinal and ethical statement in all these
          books is incapable of amendment. The whole must sit in judgment on the
          parts. Revelation is progressive. There is a human factor as well as a
          divine. The treasure is in earthen vessels. But the Bible is
          infallible in the sense that whoever surrenders himself in a docile
          spirit to its teaching will fall into no hurtful error in matters of
          faith and charity. Best of all, he will find in it the secret of a
          new, holy and blessed life, ‘hidden with Christ in God’ (Col_3:3). The
          Scriptures are the witness to Christ..…Through the Scriptures he is
          truly and adequately made known to us.” Denney, Death of Christ,
          314—“The unity of the Bible and its inspiration are correlative terms.
          If we can discern a real unity in it—and I believe we can when we see
          that it converges upon and culminates in a divine love bearing the sin
          of the world—then that unity and its inspiration are one and the same
          thing. And it is not only inspired as a whole, it is the only book
          that is inspired. It is the only book in the world to which God sets
          his seal in our hearts when we read in search of an answer to the
          question, How shall a sinful man be righteous with God?.…The
          conclusion of our study of Inspiration should be the conviction that
          the Bible gives us a body of doctrine—a ‘faith which was once for all
          delivered unto the saints’ (Jud_1:3).”
