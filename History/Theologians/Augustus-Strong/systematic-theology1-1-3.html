        <h2>III. Possibility of Theology.</h2>
        <p>
          The possibility of theology has a threefold ground: 1. In the
          existence of a God who has relations to the universe; 2. In the
          capacity of the human mind for knowing God and certain of these
          relations; and 3. In the provision of means by which God is brought
          into actual contact with the mind, or in other words, in the provision
          of a revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any particular science is possible only when three conditions combine,
          namely, the actual existence of the object with which the science
          deals, the subjective capacity of the human mind to know that object,
          and the provision of definite means by which the object is brought
          into contact with the mind. We may illustrate the conditions of
          theology from selenology—the science, not of “lunar politics,” which
          John Stuart Mill thought so vain a pursuit, but of lunar physics.
          Selenology has three conditions: 1. the objective existence of the
          moon; 2. the subjective capacity of the human mind to know the moon;
          and 3. the provision of some means (e. g., the eye and the telescope)
          by which the gulf between man and the moon is bridged over, and by
          which the mind can come into actual cognizance of the facts with
          regard to the moon.
