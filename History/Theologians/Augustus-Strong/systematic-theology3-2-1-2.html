        <p>2nd. The Tendency-theory of Baur (1792–1860).</p>
        <p>
          This maintains that the gospels originated in the middle of the second
          century, and were written under assumed names as a means of
          reconciling opposing Jewish and Gentile tendencies in the church.
          “These great national tendencies find their satisfaction, not in
          events corresponding to them, but in the elaboration of conscious
          fictions.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur dates the fourth gospel at 160–170 a.d.; Matthew at 130; Luke at
          150; Mark at 150–160. Baur never inquires who Christ was. He turns his
          attention from the facts to the documents. If the documents be proved
          unhistorical, there is no need of examining the facts, for there are
          no facts to examine. He indicates the presupposition of his
          investigations, when he Says: “The principal argument for the later
          origin of the gospels must forever remain this, that separately, and
          still more when taken together, they give an account of the life of
          Jesus which involves impossibilities”—i. e., miracles. He would
          therefore remove their authorship far enough from Jesus’ time to
          permit regarding the miracles as inventions. Baur holds that in Christ
          were united the universalistic spirit of the new religion, and the
          particularistic form of the Jewish Messianic idea; some of his
          disciples laid emphasis on the one, some on the other; hence first
          conflict, but finally reconcilation; see statement of the Tübingen
          theory and of the way in which Baur was led to it, in Bruce.
          Apologetics, 360. E. G. Robinson interprets Baur as follows: “Paul =
          Protestant; Peter = sacramentarian; James = ethical; Paul + Peter +
          James = Christianity. Protestant preaching should dwell more on the
          ethical—cases of conscience—and less on mere doctrine, such as
          regeneration and justification.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur was a stranger to the needs of his own soul, and so to the real
          character of the gospel. One of his friends and advisers wrote, after
          his death, in terms that were meant to be laudatory: “His was a
          completely objective nature. No trace of personal needs or struggles
          is discernible in connection with his investigations of Christianity.”
          The estimate of posterity is probably expressed in the judgment with
          regard to the Tübingen school by Harnack: “The possible picture it
          sketched was not the real, and the key with which it attempted to
          solve all problems did not suffice for the most simple.…The Tübingen
          views have indeed been compelled to undergo very large modifications.
          As regards the development of the church in the second century, it may
          safely be said that the hypotheses of the Tübingen school have proved
          themselves everywhere inadequate, very erroneous, and are to-day held
          by only a very few scholars.” See Baur, Die kanonischen Evangelien;
          Canonical Gospels (Eng. transl.), 530; Supernatural Religion,
          1:213–444 and vol. 2: Pfleiderer, Hibbert Lectures for 1885. For
          accounts of Baur’s position, see Herzog, Encyclopädie, art.: Baur;
          Clarke’s transl. of Hase’s Life of Jesus, 34–36; Farrar, Critical
          History of Free Thought, 227, 228.
        </p>
        <p>We object to the Tendency-theory of Baur, that</p>
        <p>
          (a) The destructive criticism to which it subjects the gospels, if
          applied to secular documents, would deprive us of any certain
          knowledge of the past, and render all history impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assumption of artifice is itself unfavorable to a candid
          examination of the documents. A perverse acuteness can descry
          evidences of a hidden animus in the most simple and ingenuous literary
          productions. Instance the philosophical interpretation of “Jack and
          Jill.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The antagonistic doctrinal tendencies which it professes to find
          in the several gospels are more satisfactorily explained as varied but
          consistent aspects of the one system of truth held by all the
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur exaggerates the doctrinal and official differences between the
          leading apostles. Peter was not simply a Judaizing Christian, but was
          the first preacher to the Gentiles, and his doctrine appears to have
          been subsequently influenced to a considerable extent by Paul’s (see
          Plumptre on 1 Pet., 68–60). Paul was not an exclusively Hellenizing
          Christian, but invariably addressed the gospel to the Jews before he
          turned to the Gentiles, The evangelists give pictures of Jesus from
          different points of view. As the Parisian sculptor constructs his bust
          with the aid of a dozen photographs of his subject, all taken from
          different points of view, so from the four portraits furnished us by
          Matthew, Mark, Luke and John we are to construct the solid and
          symmetrical life of Christ. The deeper reality which makes
          reconciliation of the different views possible is the actual
          historical Christ. Marcus Dods, Expositor’s Greek Testament,
          1:675—“They are not two Christs, but one, which the four Gospels
          depict: diverse as the profile and front face, but one another’s
          complement rather than contradiction.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Godet, Introd. to Gospel Collection, 272—Matthew shows the greatness
          of Jesus—his full-length portrait; Mark his indefatigable activity;
          Luke his beneficent compassion; John his essential divinity. Matthew
          first wrote Aramæan Logia. This was translated into Greek and
          completed by a narrative of the ministry of Jesus for the Greek
          churches founded by Paul. This translation was not made by Matthew and
          did not make use of Mark (217–224). E. D. Burton: Matthew = fulfilment
          of past prophecy; Mark = manifestation of present power. Matthew is
          argument from prophecy; Mark is argument from miracle. Matthew, as
          prophecy, made most impression on Jewish readers; Mark, as power, was
          best adapted to Gentiles. Prof. Burton holds Mark to be based upon
          oral tradition alone; Matthew upon his Logia (his real earlier Gospel)
          and other fragmentary notes; while Luke has a fuller origin in
          manuscripts and in Mark. See Aids to the Study of German Theology,
          148–155; F. W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 61.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It is incredible that productions of such literary power and lofty
          religious teaching as the gospels should have sprung up in the middle
          of the second century, or that, so springing up, they should have been
          published under assumed names and for covert ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general character of the literature of the second century is
          illustrated by Ignatius’s fanatical desire for martyrdom, the value
          ascribed by Hermas to ascetic rigor, the insipid allegories of
          Barnabas, Clement of Rome’s belief in the phoenix, and the absurdities
          of the Apocryphal Gospels. The author of the fourth gospel among the
          writers of the second century would have been a mountain among
          mole-hills. Wynne, Literature of the Second Century, 60—“The apostolic
          and the sub-apostolic writers differ from each other as a nugget of
          pure gold differs from a block of quartz with veins of the precious
          metal gleaming through it.” Dorner, Hist. Doct. Person Christ,
          1:1:92—“Instead of the writers of the second century marking an
          advance on the apostolic age, or developing the germ given them by the
          apostles, the second century shows great retrogression,—its writers
          were not able to retain or comprehend all that had been given them.”
          Martineau, Seat of Authority, 291—“Writers not only barbarous in
          speech and rude in art, but too often puerile in conception,
          passionate in temper, and credulous in belief. The legends of Papias,
          the visions of Hermas, the imbecility of Irenæus, the fury of
          Tertullian, the rancor and indelicacy of Jerome, the stormy
          intolerance of Augustine, cannot fail to startle and repel the
          student; and, if he turns to the milder Hippolytus, he is introduced
          to a brood of thirty heresies which sadly dissipate his dream of the
          unity of the church.” We can apply to the writers of the second
          century the question of R. G. Ingersoll in the Shakespeare-Bacon
          controversy: “Is it possible that Bacon left the best children of his
          brain on Shakespeare’s doorstep, and kept only the deformed ones at
          home?” On the Apocryphal Gospels, see Cowper, in Strivings for the
          Faith, 73–108.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The theory requires us to believe in a moral anomaly, namely, that
          a faithful disciple of Christ in the second century could be guilty of
          fabricating a life of his master, and of claiming authority for it on
          the ground that the author had been a companion of Christ or his
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A genial set of Jesuitical religionists”—with mind and heart enough
          to write the gospel according to John, and who at the same time have
          cold-blooded sagacity enough to keep out of their writings every trace
          of the developments of church authority belonging to the second
          century. The newly discovered “Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,” if
          dating from the early part of that century, shows that such a
          combination is impossible. The critical theories assume that one who
          knew Christ as a man could not possibly also regard him as God.
          Lowrie, Doctrine of St. Joh_12:1-50—“If St. John wrote, it is not
          possible to say that the genius of St. Paul foisted upon the church a
          conception which was strange to the original apostles.” Fairbairn has
          well shown that if Christianity had been simply the ethical teaching
          of the human Jesus, it would have vanished from the earth like the
          sects of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees; if on the other hand, it
          had been simply the Logos-doctrine, the doctrine of a divine Christ,
          it would have passed away like the speculations of Plato or Aristotle;
          because Christianity unites the idea of the eternal Son of God with
          that of the incarnate Son of man, it is fitted to be and it has become
          an universal religion; see Fairbairn, Philosophy of the Christian
          Religion, 4, 15—“Without the personal charm of the historical Jesus,
          the œcumenical creeds would never have been either formulated or
          tolerated, and without the metaphysical conception of Christ the
          Christian religion would long ago have ceased to live.…It is not Jesus
          of Nazareth who has so powerfully entered into history; it is the
          deified Christ who has been believed, loved and obeyed as the Savior
          of the world.…The two parts of Christian doctrine are combined in the
          one name ‘Jesus Christ.’ ”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) This theory cannot account for the universal acceptance of the
          gospels at the end of the second century, among widely separated
          communities where reverence for writings of the apostles was a mark of
          orthodoxy, and where the Gnostic heresies would have made new
          documents instantly liable to suspicion and searching examination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abbot, Genuineness of the Fourth Gospel, 52, 80, 88, 89. The Johannine
          doctrine of the Logos, if first propounded in the middle of the second
          century, would have ensured the instant rejection of that gospel by
          the Gnostics, who ascribed creation, not to the Logos, but to
          successive “Æons.” How did the Gnostics, without “peep or mutter,”
          come to accept as genuine what had only in their own time been first
          sprung upon the churches? While Basilides (130) and Valentinus (150),
          the Gnostics, both quote from the fourth gospel, they do not dispute
          its genuineness or suggest that it was of recent origin. Bruce, in his
          Apologetics, says of Baur “He believed in the all-sufflciency of the
          Hegelian theory of development through antagonism. He saw tendency
          everywhere. Anything additional, putting more contents into the person
          and teaching of Jesus than suits the initial stage of development,
          must be reckoned spurious. If we find Jesus in any of the gospels
          claiming to be a supernatural being, such texts can with the utmost
          confidence be set aside as spurious, for such a thought could not
          belong to the initial stage of Christianity.” But such a conception
          certainly existed in the second century, and it directly antagonized
          the speculations of the Gnostics. F. W. Farrar, on Heb_12:1-29—“The
          word œon was used by the later Gnostics to describe the various
          emanations by which they tried at once to widen and to bridge over the
          gulf between the human and the divine. Over that imaginary chasm John
          threw the arch of the Incarnation, when he wrote: ‘The Word became
          flesh’ (Joh_1:14).” A document which so contradicted the Gnostic
          teachings could not in the second century have been quoted by the
          Gnostics themselves without dispute as to its genuineness, if it had
          not been long recognized in the churches as a work of the apostle
          John.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) The acknowledgment by Baur that the epistles to the Romans,
          Galatians and Corinthians were written by Paul in the first century is
          fatal to his theory, since these epistles testify not only to miracles
          at the period at which they were written, but to the main events of
          Jesus’ life and to the miracle of his resurrection, as facts already
          long acknowledged in the Christian church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baur, Paulus der Apostel, 276—“There never has been the slightest
          suspicion of unauthenticity cast on these epistles (Gal_1:1-24 and 2
          Cor., Rom.), and they bear so incontestably the character of Pauline
          originality, that there is no conceivable ground for the assertion of
          critical doubts in their case.” Baur, in discussing the appearance of
          Christ to Paul on the way to Damascus, explains the outward from the
          inward: Paul translated intense and sudden conviction of the truth of
          the Christian religion into an outward scene. But this cannot explain
          the hearing of the outward sound by Paul’s companions. On the
          evidential value of the epistles here mentioned, see Lorimer, in
          Strivings for the Faith, 109–144; Howson, in Present Day Tracts, 4:
          no. 24; Row, Bampton Lectures for 1877:289–356. On Baur and his theory
