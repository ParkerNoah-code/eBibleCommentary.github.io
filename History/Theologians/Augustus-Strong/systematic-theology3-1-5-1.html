          V. Principles of Historical Evidence applicable to the Proof of a
          Divine Revelation (mainly derived from Greenleaf, Testimony of the
          Evangelists, and from Starkie on Evidence).
        </p>
        <p>1. As to documentary evidence.</p>
        <p>
          (a) Documents apparently ancient, not bearing upon their face the
          marks of forgery, and found in proper custody, are presumed to be
          genuine until sufficient evidence is brought to the contrary. The New
          Testament documents, since they are found in the custody of the
          church, their natural and legitimate depository, must by this rule be
          presumed to be genuine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian documents were not found, like the Book of Mormon, in a
          cave, or in the custody of angels. Martineau, Seat of Authority,
          322—“The Mormon prophet, who cannot tell God from devil close at hand,
          is well up with the history of both worlds, and commissioned to get
          ready the second promised land.” Washington Gladden, Who wrote the
          Bible?—“An angel appeared to Smith and told him where he would find
          this book; he went to the spot designated and found in a stone box a
          volume six inches thick, composed of thin gold plates, eight inches by
          seven, held together by three gold rings; these plates were covered
          with writing, in the ‘Reformed Egyptian tongue’; with this book were
          the ‘Urim and Thummim’, a pair of supernatural spectacles, by means of
          which he was able to read and translate this ‘Reformed Egyptian’
          language.” Sagebeer, The Bible in Court, 113—“If the ledger of a
          business firm has always been received and regarded as a ledger, its
          value is not at all impeached if it is impossible to tell which
          particular clerk kept this ledger.…The epistle to the Hebrews would be
          no less valuable as evidence, if shown not to have been written by
          Paul.” See Starkie on Evidence, 480 sq.; Chalmers, Christian
          Revelation, in Works, 3:147–171.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Copies of ancient documents, made by those most interested in
          their faithfulness, are presumed to correspond with the originals,
          even although those originals no longer exist. Since it was the
          church’s interest to have faithful copies, the burden of proof rests
          upon the objector to the Christian documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the evidence of a copy of its own records, the originals having
          been lost, the House of Lords decided a claim to the peerage; see
          Starkie on Evidence, 51. There is no manuscript of Sophocles earlier
          than the tenth century, while at least two manuscripts of the N. T. go
          back to the fourth century. Frederick George Kenyon, Handbook to
          Textual Criticism of N. T.: “We owe our knowledge of most of the great
          works of Greek and Latin literature—Æschylus, Sophocles, Thucydides,
          Horace, Lucretius, Tacitus, and many more—to manuscripts written from
          900 to 1500 years after their authors’ deaths; while of the N. T. we
          have two excellent and approximately complete copies at an interval of
          only 250 years. Again, of the classical writers we have as a rule only
          a few score of copies (often less), of which one or two stand out as
          decisively superior to all the rest; but of the N. T. we have more
          than 3000 copies (besides a very large number of versions), and many
          of these have distinct and independent value.” The mother of
          Tischendorf named him Lobgott, because her fear that her babe would be
          born blind had not come true. No man ever had keener sight than he. He
          spent his life in deciphering old manuscripts which other eyes could
          not read. The Sinaitic manuscript which he discovered takes us back
          within three centuries of the time of the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) In determining matters of fact, after the lapse of considerable
          time, documentary evidence is to be allowed greater weight than oral
          testimony. Neither memory nor tradition can long be trusted to give
          absolutely correct accounts of particular facts. The New Testament
          documents, therefore, are of greater weight in evidence than tradition
          would be, even if only thirty years had elapsed since the death of the
          actors in the scenes they relate.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Starkie on Evidence, 51, 730. The Roman Catholic Church, in its
          legends of the saints, shows how quickly mere tradition can become
          corrupt. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, yet sermons
          preached to-day on the anniversary of his birth make him out to be
          Unitarian, Universalist, or Orthodox, according as the preacher
          himself believes.
