        <p>5. Evidential force of Miracles.</p>
        <p>
          (a) Miracles are the natural accompaniments and attestations of new
          communications from God. The great epochs of miracles—represented by
          Moses, the prophets, the first and second comings of Christ—are
          coincident with the great epochs of revelation. Miracles serve to draw
          attention to new truth, and cease when this truth has gained currency
          and foothold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles are not scattered evenly over the whole course of history.
          Few miracles are recorded during the 2500 years from Adam to Moses.
          When the N. T. Canon is completed and the internal evidence of
          Scripture has attained its greatest strength, the external
          attestations by miracle are either wholly withdrawn or begin to
          disappear. The spiritual wonders of regeneration remain, and for these
          the way has been prepared by the long progress from the miracles of
          power wrought by Moses to the miracles of grace wrought by Christ.
          Miracles disappeared because newer and higher proofs rendered them
          unnecessary. Better things than these are now in evidence. Thomas
          Fuller: “Miracles are the swaddling-clothes of the infant church.”
          John Foster: “Miracles are the great bell of the universe, which draws
          men to God’s sermon.” Henry Ward Beecher: “Miracles are the midwives
          of great moral truths; candles lit before the dawn but put out after
          the sun has risen.” Illingworth, in Lux Mundi, 210—“When we are told
          that miracles contradict experience, we point to the daily occurrence
          of the spiritual miracle of regeneration and ask: ‘Which is easier to
          say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk?’ (Mat_9:5).”
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles and inspiration go together; if the former remain in the
          church, the latter should remain also; see Marsh, in Bap. Quar. Rev.,
          1887:225–242. On the cessation of miracles in the early church, see
          Henderson, Inspiration, 443–490; Bückmann, in Zeitsch. f. luth. Theol.
          u. Kirche, 1878:216. On miracles in the second century, see Barnard,
          Literature of the Second Century, 139–180. A. J. Gordon, Ministry of
          the Spirit, 167—“The apostles were commissioned to speak for Christ
          till the N. T. Scriptures, his authoritative voice, were completed. In
          the apostolate we have a provisional inspiration; in the N. T. a
          stereotyped inspiration; the first being endowed with authority ad
          interim to forgive sins, and the second having this authority in
          perpetuo.” Dr. Gordon draws an analogy between coal, which is fossil
          sunlight, and the New Testament, which is fossil inspiration.
          Sabatter, Philos. Religion, 74—“The Bible is very free from the
          senseless prodigies of oriental mythology. The great prophets, Isaiah,
          Amos, Micah, Jeremiah, John the Baptist, work no miracles. Jesus’
          temptation in the wilderness is a victory of the moral consciousness
          over the religion of mere physical prodigy.” Trench says that miracles
          cluster about the foundation of the theocratic kingdom under Moses and
          Joshua, and about the restoration of that kingdom under Elijah and
          Elisha. In the O. T., miracles confute the gods of Egypt under Moses,
          the Phœnician Baal under Elijah and Elisha, and the gods of Babylon
          under Daniel. See Diman, Theistic Argument, 376, and art.: Miracle, by
          Bernard, in Hastings’ Bible Dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Miracles generally certify to the truth of doctrine, not directly,
          but indirectly; otherwise a new miracle must needs accompany each new
          doctrine taught. Miracles primarily and directly certify to the divine
          commission and authority of a religious teacher, and therefore warrant
          acceptance of his doctrines and obedience to his commands as the
          doctrines and commands of God, whether these be communicated at
          intervals or all together, orally or in written documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exceptions to the above statement are very few, and are found only
          in cases where the whole commission and authority of Christ, and not
          some fragmentary doctrine, are involved. Jesus appeals to his miracles
          as proof of the truth of his teaching in Mat_9:5-6—“Which is easier to
          say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk? But that ye may
          know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then
          saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go
          unto thy house”; 12:28—“if I by the spirit of God cast out demons,
          then is the kingdom of God come upon you.” So Paul in Rom_1:4, says
          that Jesus “was declared to be the Son of God with power,.…by the
          resurrection from the dead.” Mair, Christian Evidences, 223, quotes
          from Natural Religion, 181—“It is said that the theo-philanthropist
          Larévellière-Lépeaux once confided to Talleyrand his disappointment at
          the ill success of his attempt to bring into vogue a sort of improved
          Christianity, a sort of benevolent rationalism which he had invented
          to meet the wants of a benevolent age. ‘His propaganda made no way,’
          he said. ‘what was he to do?’ he asked. The ex-bishop Talleyrand
          politely condoled with him, feared it was a difficult task to found a
          new religion, more difficult than he had imagined, so difficult that
          he hardly knew what to advise. ‘Still,’—so he went on after a moment’s
          reflection,—‘there is one plan which you might at least try: I should
          recommend you to be crucified, and to rise again the third day.” See
          also Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith, 147–167; Farrar, Life of
          Christ, 1:168–172.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Miracles, therefore, do not stand alone as evidences. Power alone
          cannot prove a divine commission. Purity of life and doctrine must go
          with the miracles to assure us that a religious teacher has come from
          God. The miracles and the doctrine in this manner mutually support
          each other, and form parts of one whole. The internal evidence for the
          Christian system may have greater power over certain minds and over
          certain ages than the external evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pascal’s aphorism that “doctrines must be judged by miracles, miracles
          by doctrine,” needs to be supplemented by Mozley’s statment that “a
          supernatural fact is the proper proof of a supernatural doctrine,
          while a supernatural doctrine is not the proper proof of a
          supernatural fact.” E. G. Robinson, Christian Theology, 107, would
          “defend miracles, but would not buttress up Christianity by them.…No
          amount of miracles could convince a good man of the divine commission
          of a known bad man; nor, on the other hand, could any degree of
          miraculous power suffice to silence the doubts of an evil-minded
          man.…The miracle is a certification only to him who can perceive its
          significance.…The Christian church has the resurrection written all
          over it. Its very existence is proof of the resurrection. Twelve men
          could never have founded the church, if Christ had remained in the
          tomb. The living church is the burning bush that is not consumed.”
          Gore, Incarnation, 57—“Jesus did not appear after his resurrection to
          unbelievers, but to believers only,—which means that this crowning
          miracle was meant to confirm an existing faith, not to create one
          where it did not exist.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian Union, July 11, 1891—“If the anticipated resurrection of
          Joseph Smith were to take place, it would add nothing whatever to the
          authority of the Mormon religion.” Schurman, Agnosticism and Religion,
          57—“Miracles are merely the bells to call primitive peoples to church.
          Sweet as the music they once made, modern ears find them jangling and
          out of tune, and their dissonant notes scare away pious souls who
          would fain enter the temple of worship.” A new definition of miracle
          which recognizes their possible classification as extraordinary
          occurrences in nature, yet sees in all nature the working of the
          living God, may do much to remove this prejudice. Bishop of
          Southampton, Place of Miracle, 53—“Miracles alone could not produce
          conviction. The Pharisees ascribed them to Beelzebub. Though Jesus had
          done so many signs, yet they believed not.…Though miracles were
          frequently wrought, they were rarely appealed to as evidence of the
          truth of the gospel. They are simply signs of God’s presencé in his
          world. By itself a miracle had no evidential force. The only test for
          distinguishing divine from Satanic miracles is that of the moral
          character and purpose of the worker; and therefore miracles depend for
          all their force upon a previous appreciation of the character and
          personality of Christ (79). The earliest apologists make no use of
          miracles. They are of no value except in connection with prophecy.
          Miracles are the revelation of God, not the proof of revelation.”
          Versus Supernatural Religion, 1:23, and Stearns, in New Englander,
          Jan. 1882:80. See Mozley, Miracles, 15; Nicoll, Life of Jesus Christ,
          133; Mill, Logic, 374–382; H. B. Smith. Int. to Christ. Theology,
          167–169; Fisher, in Journ. Christ. Philos., April, 1883:270–283.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Yet the Christian miracles do not lose their value as evidence in
          the process of ages. The loftier the structure of Christian life and
          doctrine the greater need that its foundation be secure. The authority
          of Christ as a teacher of supernatural truth rests upon his miracles,
          and especially upon the miracle of his resurrection. That one miracle
          to which the church looks back as the source of her life carries with
          it irresistibly all the other miracles of the Scripture record; upon
          it alone we may safely rest the proof that the Scriptures are an
          authoritative revelation from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The miracles of Christ are simple correlates of the Incarnation—proper
          insignia of his royalty and divinity. By mere external evidence
          however we can more easily prove the resurrection than the
          incarnation. In our arguments with sceptics, we should not begin with
          the ass that spoke to Balaam, or the fish that swallowed Jonah, but
          with the resurrection of Christ; that conceded, all other Biblical
          miracles win seem only natural preparations, accompaniments, or
          consequences. G. F. Wright, in Bib. Sac, 1889:707—“The difficulties
          created by the miraculous character of Christianity may be compared to
          those assumed by a builder when great permanence is desired in the
          structure erected. It is easier to lay the foundation of a temporary
          structure than of one which is to endure for the ages.” Pressensé:
          “The empty tomb of Christ has been the cradle of the church, and if in
          this foundation of her faith the church has been mistaken, she must
          needs lay herself down by the side of the mortal remains, I say, not
          of a man, but of a religion.”
        </p>
        <p>
          President Schurman believes the resurrection of Christ to be “an
          obsolete picture of an eternal truth—the fact of a continued life with
          God.” Harnack, Wesen des Christenthums, 102, thinks no consistent
          union of the gospel accounts of Christ’s resurrection can be attained;
          apparently doubts a literal and bodily rising; yet traces Christianity
          back to an invincible faith in Christ’s conquering of death and his
          continued life. But why believe the gospels when they speak of the
          sympathy of Christ, yet disbelieve them when they speak of his
          miraculous power? We have no right to trust the narrative when it
          gives us Christ’s words “Weep not” to the widow of Nain, (Luk_7:13),
          and then to distrust it when it tells us of his raising the widow’s
          son. The words “Jesus wept” belong inseparably to a story of which
          “Lasarus, come forth!” forms a part (Joh_11:35; Joh_11:43). It is
          improbable that the disciples should have believed so stupendous a
          miracle as Christ’s resurrection, if they had not previously seen
          other manifestations of miraculous power on the part of Christ. Christ
          himself is the great miracle. The conception of him as the risen and
          glorified Savior can be explained only by the fact that he did so
          rise. E. G. Robinson, Christ. Theology, 109—“The Church attests the
          fact of the resurrection quite as much as the resurrection attests the
          divine origin of the church. Resurrection, as an evidence, depends on
          the existence of the church which proclaims it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) The resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ—by which we mean his
          coming forth from the sepulchre in body as well as in spirit—is
          demonstrated by evidence as varied and as conclusive as that which
          proves to us any single fact of ancient history. Without it
          Christianity itself is inexplicable, as is shown by the failure of all
          modern rationalistic theories to account for its rise and progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          In discussing the evidence of Jesus’ resurrection, we are confronted
          with three main rationalistic theories:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The Swoon-theory of Strauss. This holds that Jesus did not really
          die. The cold and the spices of the sepulchre revived him. We reply
          that the blood and water, and the testimony of the centurion
          (Mar_15:45), proved actual death (see Bib. Sac, April, 1889:228;
          Forrest, Christ of History and Experience, 137–170). The rolling away
          of the stone, and Jesus’ power immediately after, are inconsistent
          with immediately preceding swoon and suspended animation. How was his
          life preserved? where did he go? when did he die? His not dying
          implies deceit on his own part or on that of his disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Spirit-theory of Keim. Jesus really died, but only his spirit
          appeared. The spirit of Jesus grave the disciples a sign of his
          continued life, a telegram from heaven. But we reply that the telegram
          was untrue, for it asserted that his body had risen from the tomb. The
          tomb was empty and the linen cloths showed an orderly departure. Jesus
          himself denied that he was a bodiless spirit: “a spirit hath not flesh
          and bones, as ye see me having” (Luk_24:39). Did “his flesh see
          corruption” (Act_2:31)? Was the penitent thief raised from the dead as
          much as he? Godet, Lectures in Defence of the Christian Faith, lect.
          i: A dilemma for those who deny the fact of Christ’s resurrection:
          Either his body remained in the hands of his disciples, or it was
          given up to the Jews. If the disciples retained it, they were
          impostors: but this is not maintained by modern rationalists. If the
          Jews retained it, why did they not produce it as conclusive evidence
          against the disciples?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The Vision-theory of Renan. Jesus died, and there was no
          objective appearance even of his spirit. Mary Magdalene was the victim
          of subjective hallucination, and her hallucination became contagious.
          This was natural because the Jews expected that the Messiah would work
          miracles and would rise from the dead. We reply that the disciples did
          not expect Jesus’ resurrection. The women went to the sepulchre, not
          to see a risen Redeemer, but to embalm a dead body. Thomas and those
          at Emmaus had given up all hope. Four hundred years had passed since
          the days of miracles; John the Baptist “did no miracle” (Joh_10:41);
          the Sadducees said “there is no resurrection” (Mat_22:23). There were
          thirteen different appearances, to: 1. the Magdalen; 2. other women;
          3. Peter; 4. Emmaus; 5. the Twelve; 6. the Twelve after eight days; 7.
          Galilee seashore; 8. Galilee mountain; 9. Galilee five hundred; 10.
          James; 11. ascension at Bethany; 12. Stephen; 13. Paul on way to
          Damascus. Paul describes Christ’s appearance to him as something
          objective, and he implies that Christ’s previous appearances to others
          were objective also: “last of all [ these bodily appearances],.… he
          appeared to me also” (1Co_15:8). Bruce, Apologetics, 396—“Paul’s
          interest and intention in classing the two together was to level his
          own vision [ of Christ ] up to the objectivity of the early
          Christophanies. He believed that the eleven, that Peter in particular,
          had seen the risen Christ with the eye of the body, and he meant to
          claim for himself a vision of the same kind.” Paul’s was a sane,
          strong nature. Subjective visions do not transform human lives; the
          resurrection moulded the apostles; they did not create the
          resurrection (see Gore, Incarnation, 76). These appearances soon
          ceased, unlike the law of hallucinations, which increase in frequency
          and intensity. It is impossible to explain the ordinances, the Lord’s
          day, or Christianity itself, if Jesus did not rise from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resurrection of our Lord teaches three important lessons: (1) It
          showed that his work of atonement was completed and was stamped with
          the divine approval; (2) It showed him to be Lord of all and gave the
          one sufficient external proof of Christianity; (3) It furnished the
          ground and pledge of our own resurrection, and thus “brought life and
          immortality to light” (2Ti_1:10). It must be remembered that the
          resurrection was the one sign upon which Jesus himself staked his
          claims—“the sign of Jonah” (Luk_11:29); and that the resurrection is
          proof, not simply of God’s power, but of Christ’s own power:
          Joh_10:18—“I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
          again”; Joh_2:19—“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
          it up”.…21—“he spake of the temple of his body.” See Alexander, Christ
          and Christianity, 9, 158–224, 302; Mill, Theism, 216; Auberlen, Div.
