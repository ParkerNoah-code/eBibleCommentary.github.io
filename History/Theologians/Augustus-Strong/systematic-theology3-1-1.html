        <h2>I. Reasons a priori for expecting a Revelation from God</h2>
        <p>
          1. Needs of man’s nature. Man’s intellectual and moral nature
          requires, in order to preserve it from constant deterioration, and to
          ensure its moral growth and progress, an authoritative and helpful
          revelation of religious truth, of a higher and completer sort than any
          to which, in its present state of sin, it can attain by the use of its
          unaided powers. The proof of this proposition is partly psychological,
          and partly historical.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. Psychological proof.—(a) Neither reason nor intuition throws light
          upon certain questions whose solution is of the utmost importance to
          us; for example, Trinity, atonement, pardon, method of worship,
          personal existence after death. (b) Even the truth to which we arrive
          by our natural powers needs divine confirmation and authority when it
          addresses minds and wills perverted by sin. (c) To break this power of
          sin, and to furnish encouragement to moral effort, we need a special
          revelation of the merciful and helpful aspect of the divine nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Bremen Lectures, 72, 73; Plato, Second Alcibiades, 22, 23; Phædo,
          85—λόγου θείου τινός. Iamblicus, περὶ τοῦ Πυθαγορικοῦ βίου, chap. 28.
          Æschylus, in his Agamemnon, shows how completely reason and intuition
          failed to supply the knowledge of God which man needs: “Renown is
          loud,” he says, “and not to lose one’s senses is God’s greatest
          gift.…The being praised outrageously Is grave; for at the eyes of such
          a one Is launched, from Zeus, the thunder-stone. Therefore do I decide
          For so much and no more prosperity Than of his envy passes unespied.”
          Though the gods might have favorites, they did not love men as men,
          but rather, envied and hated them. William James, Is Life Worth
          Living? in Internat. Jour. Ethics, Oct. 1895:10—“All we know of good
          and beauty proceeds from nature, but none the less all we know of
          evil.…To such a harlot we owe no moral allegiance.…If there be a
          divine Spirit of the universe, nature, such as we know her, cannot
          possibly be its ultimate word to man. Either there is no Spirit
          revealed in nature, or else it is inadequately revealed there; and, as
          all the higher religions have assumed, what we call visible nature, or
          this world, must be but a veil and surface-show whose full meaning
          resides in a supplementary unseen or other world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Versus Socrates: Men will do right, if they only know the right.
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Relig., 1:219—“In opposition to the opinion of
          Socrates that badness rests upon ignorance, Aristotle already called
          the fact to mind that the doing of the good is not always combined
          with the knowing of it, seeing that it depends also on the passions.
          If badness consisted only in the want of knowledge, then those who are
          theoretically most cultivated must also be morally the best, which no
          one will venture to assert.” W. S. Lilly, On Shibboleths: “Ignorance
          is often held to be the root of all evil. But mere knowledge cannot
          transform character. It cannot minister to a mind diseased. It cannot
          convert the will from bad to good. It may turn crime into different
          channels, and render it less easy to detect. It does not change man’s
          natural propensities or his disposition to gratify them at the expense
          of others. Knowledge makes the good man more powerful for good, the
          bad man more powerful for evil. And that is all it can do.” Gore,
          Incarnation, 174—“We must not depreciate the method of argument, for
          Jesus and Paul occasionally used it in a Socratic fashion, but we must
          recognize that it is not the basis of the Christian system nor the
          primary method of Christianity.” Martineau, in Nineteenth Century,
          1:331, 531, and Types, 1:112—“Plato dissolved the idea of the right
          into that of the good, and this again was indistinguishably mingled
          with that of the true and the beautiful.” See also Flint, Theism, 306.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Versus Thomas Paine: “Natural religion teaches us, without the
          possibility of being mistaken, all that is necessary or proper to be
          known.” Plato, Laws, 9:854, c, for substance: “Be good; but, if you
          cannot, then kill yourself.” Farrar, Darkness and Dawn, 75—“Plato says
          that man will never know God until God has revealed himself in the
          guise of suffering man, and that, when all is on the verge of
          destruction, God sees the distress of the universe, and, placing
          himself at the rudder, restores it to order.” Prometheus, the type of
          humanity, can never be delivered “until some god descends for him into
          the black depths of Tartarus.” Seneca in like manner teaches that man
          cannot save himself. He says: “Do you wonder that men go to the gods?
          God comes to men, yes, into men.” We are sinful, and God’s thoughts
          are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways. Therefore he must
          make known his thoughts to us, teach us what we are, what true love
          is, and what will please him. Shaler, Interpretation of Nature,
          227—“The inculcation of moral truths can be successfully effected only
          in the personal way; … it demands the influence of personality; … the
          weight of the impression depends upon the voice and the eye of a
          teacher.” In other words, we need not only the exercise of authority,
          but also the manifestation of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Historical proof.—(a) The knowledge of moral and religious truth
          possessed by nations and ages in which special revelation is unknown
          is grossly and increasingly imperfect. (b) Man’s actual condition in
          ante-Christian times, and in modern heathen lands, is that of extreme
          moral depravity. (c) With this depravity is found a general conviction
          of helplessness, and on the part of some nobler natures, a longing
          after, and hope of, aid from above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pythagoras: “It is not easy to know [duties], except men were taught
          them by God himself, or by some person who had received them from God,
          or obtained the knowledge of them through some divine means.”
          Socrates: “Wait with patience, till we know with certainty how we
          ought to behave ourselves toward God and man.” Plato: “We will wait
          for one, be he a God or an inspired man, to instruct us in our duties
          and to take away the darkness from our eyes.” Disciple of Plato: “Make
          probability our raft, while we sail through life, unless we could have
          a more sure and safe conveyance, such as some divine communication
          would be.” Plato thanked God for three things: first, that he was born
          a rational soul; secondly, that he was born a Greek; and, thirdly,
          that he lived in the days of Socrates. Yet, with all these advantages,
          he had only probability for a raft, on which to navigate strange seas
          of thought far beyond his depth, and he longed for “a more sure word
          of prophecy” (2Pe_1:19). See references and quotations in Peabody,
          Christianity the Religion of Nature, 35, and in Luthardt, Fundamental
          Truths, 156–172, 335–338; Farrar, Seekers after God; Garbett, Dogmatic
          Faith, 187.

          2. Presumption of supply. What we know of God, by nature, affords
          ground for hope that these wants of our intellectual and moral being
          will be met by a corresponding supply, in the shape of a special
          divine revelation. We argue this:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) From our necessary conviction of God’s wisdom. Having made man a
          spiritual being, for spiritual ends, it may be hoped that he will
          furnish the means needed to secure these ends. (b) From the actual,
          though incomplete, revelation already given in nature. Since God has
          actually undertaken to make himself known to men, we may hope that he
          will finish the work he has begun. (c) From the general connection of
          want and supply. The higher our needs, the more intricate and
          ingenious are, in general, the contrivances for meeting them. We may
          therefore hope that the highest want will be all the more surely met.
          (d) From analogies of nature and history. Signs of reparative goodness
          in nature and of forbearance in providential dealings lead us to hope
          that, while justice is executed, God may still make known some way of
          restoration for sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) There were two stages in Dr. John Duncan’ escape from pantheism:
          1. when he came first to believe in the existence of God, and “danced
          for joy upon the brig o’ Dee”; and 2. when, under Malan’s influence,
          he came also to believe that “God meant that we should know him.” In
          the story in the old Village Reader, the mother broke completely down
          when she found that her son was likely to grow up stupid, but her
          tears conquered him and made him intelligent. Laura Bridgman was
          blind, deaf and dumb, and had but small sense of taste or smell. When
          her mother, after long separation, went to her in Boston, the mother’s
          heart was in distress lest the daughter should not recognize her. When
          at last, by some peculiar mother’s sign, she pierced the veil of
          insensibility, it was a glad time for both. So God, our Father, tries
          to reveal himself to our blind, deaf and dumb souls. The agony of the
          Cross is the sign of God’s distress over the insensibility of humanity
          which sin has caused. If he is the Maker of man’s being, he will
          surely seek to fit it for that communion with himself for which it was
          designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Gore, Incarnation, 52, 53—“Nature is a first volume, in itself
          incomplete, and demanding a second volume, which is Christ.” (c) R. T.
          Smith, Man’s Knowledge of Man and of God, 228—“Mendicants do not ply
          their calling for years in a desert where there are no givers. Enough
          of supply has been received to keep the sense of want alive.” (d) In
          the natural arrangements for the healing of bruises in plants and for
          the mending of broken bones in the animal creation, in the provision
          of remedial agents for the cure of human diseases, and especially in
          the delay to inflict punishment upon the transgressor and the space
          given him for repentance, we have some indications, which, if
          uncontradicted by other evidence, might lead us to regard the God of
          nature as a God of forbearance and mercy. Plutarch’s treatise “De Sera
          Numinis Vindicta” is proof that this thought had occurred to the
          heathen. It may be doubted, indeed, whether a heathen religion could
          even continue to exist, without embracing in it some element of hope.
          Yet this very delay in the execution of the divine judgments gave its
          own occasion for doubting the existence of a God who was both good and
          just. “Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,” is
          a scandal to the divine government which only the sacrifice of Christ
          can fully remove.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem presents itself also in the Old Testament. In Job_21:1-34,
          and in Psa_17:1-15; Psa_37:1-40; Psa_49:1-20; Psa_73:1-28, there are
          partial answers; see Job_21:7—“Wherefore do the wicked live, Become
          old, yea, wax mighty in power?” Job_24:1—“Why are not judgment times
          determined by the Almighty? And they that know him, why see they not
          his days?” The New Testament intimates the existence of a witness to
          God’s goodness among the heathen, while at the same time it declares
          that the full knowledge of forgiveness and salvation is brought only
          by Christ. Compare Act_14:17—“And yet he left not himself without
          witness, in that he did good, and gave you from heaven rains and
          fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness”;
          Act_17:25-27—“he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all
          things; and he made of one erery nation of men … that they should seek
          God, if haply they might feel after him and find him”; Rom_2:4—“the
          goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance”; Rom_3:25—“the passing
          over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God”;
          Eph_3:9—“to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery
          which for ages hath been hid in God”; 2Ti_1:10—“our Savior Christ
          Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and incorruption to light
          through the gospel.” See Hackett’s edition of the treatise of
          Plutarch, as also Bowen, Metaph. and Ethics, 462–487; Diman, Theistic
          Argument, 371.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude this section upon the reasons a priori for expecting a
          revelation from God with the acknowledgment that the facts warrant
          that degree of expectation which we call hope, rather than that larger
          degree of expectation which we call assurance; and this, for the
          reason that, while conscience gives proof that God is a God of
          holiness, we have not, from the light of nature, equal evidence that
          God is a God of love. Reason teaches man that, as a sinner, he merits
          condemnation; but he cannot, from reason alone, know that God will
          have mercy upon him and provide salvation. His doubts can be removed
          only by God’s own voice, assuring him of “redemption … the forgiveness
          of … trespasses” (Eph_1:7) and revealing to him the way in which that
          forgiveness has been rendered possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conscience knows no pardon, and no Savior. Hovey, Manual of Christian
          Theology, 9, seems to us to go too far when he says “Even natural
          affection and conscience afford some clue to the goodness and holiness
          of God, though much more is needed by one who undertakes the study of
          Christian theology.” We grant that natural affection gives some clue
          to God’s goodness, but we regard conscience as reflecting only God’s
          holiness and his hatred of sin. We agree with Alexander McLaren: “Does
          God’s love need to be proved? Yes, as all paganism shows. Gods
          vicious, gods careless, gods cruel, gods beautiful, there are in
          abundance; but where is there a god who loves?”
