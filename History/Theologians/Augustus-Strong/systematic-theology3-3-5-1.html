        <p>1. Errors in matters of Science.</p>
        <p>Upon this objection we remark:</p>
        <p>
          (a) We do not admit the existence of scientific error in the
          Scripture. What is charged as such is simply truth presented in
          popular and impressive forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common mind receives a more correct idea of unfamiliar facts when
          these are narrated in phenomenal language and in summary form than
          when they are described in the abstract terms and in the exact detail
          of science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture writers unconsciously observe Herbert Spencer’s
          principle of style: Economy of the reader’s or hearer’s attention,—the
          more energy is expended upon the form the less there remains to
          grapple with the substance (Essays, 1–47). Wendt, Teaching of Jesus,
          1:130, brings out the principle of Jesus’ style: “The greatest
          clearness in the smallest compass.” Hence Scripture uses the phrases
          of common life rather than scientific terminology. Thus the language
          of appearance is probably used in Gen_7:19—“all the high mountains
          that were under the whole heaven were covered”—such would be the
          appearance, even if the deluge were local instead of universal; in
          Jos_10:12-13—“and the sun stood still”—such would be the appearance,
          even if the sun’s rays were merely refracted so as preternaturally to
          lengthen the day; in Psa_93:1—“The world also is established, that it
          cannot be moved”—such is the appearance, even though the earth turns
          on its axis and moves round the sun. In narrative, to substitute for
          “sunset” some scientific description would divert attention from the
          main subject. Would it be preferable, in the O. T., if we should read:
          “When the revolution of the earth upon its axis caused the rays of the
          solar luminary to impinge horizontally upon the retina, Isaac went out
          to meditate” (Gen_24:63)? “Le secret d’ennuyer est de tout dire.”
          Charles Dickens, in his American Notes, 72, describes a prairie
          sunset: “The decline of day here was very gorgeous, tinging the
          firmament deeply with red and gold, up to the very keystone of the
          arch above us” (quoted by Hovey, Manual of Christian Theology, 97).
          Did Dickens therefore believe the firmament to be a piece of solid
          masonry?
        </p>
        <p>
          Canon Driver rejects the Bible story of creation because the
          distinctions made by modern science cannot be found in the primitive
          Hebrew. He thinks the fluid state of the earth’s substance should have
          been called “surging chaos,” instead of “waters” (Gen_1:2). “An
          admirable phrase for modern and cultivated minds,” replies Mr.
          Gladstone, “but a phrase that would have left the pupils of the Mosaic
          writer in exactly the condition out of which it was his purpose to
          bring them, namely, a state of utter ignorance and darkness, with
          possibly a little ripple of bewilderment to boot”; see Sunday School
          Times, April 26, 1890. The fallacy of holding that Scripture gives in
          detail all the facts connected with a historical narrative has led to
          many curious arguments. The Gregorian Calendar which makes the year
          begin in January was opposed by representing that Eve was tempted at
          the outset by an apple, which was possible only in case the year began
          in September; see Thayer, Change of Attitude towards the Bible, 46.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It is not necessary to a proper view of inspiration to suppose
          that the human authors of Scripture had in mind the proper scientific
          interpretation of the natural events they recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is enough that this was in the mind of the inspiring Spirit.
          Through the comparatively narrow conceptions and inadequate language
          of the Scripture writers, the Spirit of inspiration may have secured
          the expression of the truth in such germinal form as to be
          intelligible to the times in which it was first published, and yet
          capable of indefinite expansion as science should advance. In the
          miniature picture of creation in the first chapter of Genesis, and in
          its power of adjusting itself to every advance of scientific
          investigation, we have a strong proof of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word “day” in Gen_1:1-31 is an instance of this general mode of
          expression. It would be absurd to teach early races, that deal only in
          small numbers, about the myriads of years of creation. The child’s
          object-lesson, with its graphic summary, conveys to his mind more of
          truth than elaborate and exact statement would convey. Conant
          (Gen_2:10) says of the description of Eden and its rivers: “Of course
          the author’s object is not a minute topographical description, but a
          general and impressive conception as a whole.” Yet the progress of
          science only shows that these accounts are not less but more true than
          was supposed by those who first received them. Neither the Hindu
          Shasters nor any heathen cosmogony can bear such comparison with the
          results of science. Why change our interpretations of Scripture so
          often? Answer: We do not assume to be original teachers of science,
          but only to interpret Scripture with the new lights we have. See Dana,
          Manual of Geology, 741–746; Guyot, in Bib. Sac., 1855:324; Dawson,
          Story of Earth and Man, 32.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conception of early Scripture teaching as elementary and suited
          to the childhood of the race would make it possible, if the facts so
          required, to interpret the early chapters of Genesis as mythical or
          legendary. God might condescend to “Kindergarten formulas.” Goethe
          said that “We should deal with children as God deals with us: we are
          happiest under the influence of innocent delusions.” Longfellow: “How
          beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams, With its illusions,
          aspirations, dreams! Book of beginnings, story without end, Each maid
          a heroine, and each man a friend!” We might hold with Goethe and with
          Longfellow, if we only excluded from God’s teaching all essential
          error. The narratives of Scripture might be addressed to the
          imagination, and so might take mythical or legendary form, while yet
          they conveyed substantial truth that could in no other way be so well
          apprehended by early man; see Robert Browning’s poem, “Development,”
          in Asolando. The Koran, on the other hand, leaves no room for
          imagination, but fixes the number of the stars and declares the
          firmament to be solid. Henry Drummond: “Evolution has given us a new
          Bible.…The Bible is not a book which has been made,—it has grown.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bagehot tells us that “One of the most remarkable of Father Newman’s
          Oxford sermons explains how science teaches that the earth goes round
          the sun, and how Scripture teaches that the sun goes round the earth;
          and it ends by advising the discreet believer to accept both.” This is
          mental bookkeeping by double entry; see Mackintosh, in Am. Jour.
          Theology, Jan. 1899:41. Lenormant, in Contemp. Rev.,
        </p>
        <p>
          Nov. 1879—“While the tradition of the deluge holds so considerable a
          place in the legendary memories of all branches of the Aryan race, the
          monuments and original texts of Egypt, with their many cosmogonic
          speculations, have not afforded any, even distant, allusion to this
          cataclysm.” Lenormant here wrongly assumed that the language of
          Scripture is scientific language. If it is the language of appearance,
          then the deluge may be a local and not a universal catastrophe. G. F.
          Wright, Ice Age in North America, suggests that the numerous
          traditions of the deluge may have had their origin in the enormous
          floods of the receding glacier. In South-western Queensland, the
          standard guage at the Meteorological Office registered 10¾, 20, 35¾,
          10¾ inches of rainfall, in all 77¼ inches, in four successive days.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It may be safely said that science has not yet shown any fairly
          interpreted passage of Scripture to be untrue.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to the antiquity of the race, we may say that owing to the
          differences of reading between the Septuagint and the Hebrew there is
          room for doubt whether either of the received chronologies has the
          sanction of inspiration. Although science has made probable the
          existence of man upon the earth at a period preceding the dates
          assigned in these chronologies, no statement of inspired Scripture is
          thereby proved false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usher’s scheme of chronology, on the basis of the Hebrew, puts the
          creation 4004 years before Christ. Hales’s, on the basis of the
          Septuagint, puts it 5411 b.c. The Fathers followed the LXX. But the
          genealogies before and after the flood may present us only with the
          names of “leading and representative men.” Some of these names seem to
          stand, not for individuals, but for tribes, e. g.; Gen_10:16—where
          Canaan is said to have begotten the Jebusite and the Amorite;
          29—Joktan begot Ophir and Havilah. In Gen_10:6, we read that Mizraim
          belonged to the sons of Ham. But Mizraim is a dual, coined to
          designate the two parts, Upper and Lower Egypt. Hence a son of Ham
          could not bear the name of Mizraim. Gen_10:13 reads: “And Misraim
          begat Ludim.” But Ludim is a plural form. The word signifies a whole
          nation, and “begat” is not employed in a literal sense. So in verses
          Gen_10:15-16 : “Canaan begat … the Jebusite,” a tribe; the ancestors
          of which would have been called Jebus. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
          however, are names, not of tribes or nations, but of individuals; see
          Prof. Edward König, of Bonn, in S. S. Times, Dec. 14, 1901. E.G.
          Robinson: “We may pretty safely go back to the time of Abraham, but no
          further.” Bib. Sac., 1899:403—“The lists in Genesis may relate to
          families and not to individuals.”
        </p>
        <p>
          G. F. Wright, Ant. and Origin of Human Race, lect. II—“When in David’s
          time it is said that ‘Shebuel, the son of Gorshom, the son of Moses,
          was ruler over the treasures’ (1Ch_23:16; 1Ch_26:24), Gershom was the
          immediate son of Moses, but Shebuel was separated by many generations
          from Gershom. So when Seth is said to have begotten Enosh when he was
          105 years old (Gen_5:6), it is, according to Hebrew usage, capable of
          meaning that Enosh was descended from the branch of Seth’s line which
          set off at the 105th year, with any number of intermediate links
          omitted.” The appearance of completeness in the text may be due to
          alteration of the text in the course of centuries; see Bib. Com.,
          1:30. In the phrase “Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of
          Abraham” (Mat_1:1) thirty-eight to forty generations are omitted. It
          may be so in some of the Old Testament genealogies. There is room for
          a hundred thousand years, if necessary (Conant). W. H. Green, in Bib.
          Sac., April, 1890:303, and in Independent, June 18, 1891—“The
          Scriptures furnish us with no data for a chronological computation
          prior to the life of Abraham. The Mosaic records do not fix, and were
          not intended to fix, the precise date of the Flood or of the Creation
          … They give a series of specimen lives, with appropriate numbers
          attached, to show by selected examples what was the original term of
          human life. To make them a complete and continuous record, and to
          deduce from them the antiquity of the race, is to put them to a use
          they were never intended to serve.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparison with secular history also shows that no such length of time
          as 100,000 years for man’s existence upon earth seems necessary.
          Rawlinson, in Jour. Christ. Philosophy, 1883:339–364, dates the
          beginning of the Chaldean monarchy at 2400 b.c. Lenormant puts the
          entrance of the Sanskritic Indians into Hindustan at 2500 b.c. The
          earliest Vedas are between 1200. and 1000 b.c. (Max Mtiller). Call of
          Abraham, probably 1945 b.c. Chinese history possibly began as early as
          2356 b.c. (Legge). The old Empire in Egypt possibly began as early as
          2650 b.c. Rawlinson puts the flood at 3600 b.c., and adds 2000 years
          between the deluge and the creation, making the age of the world 1886
          + 3600 + 2000 = 7486. S. R. Pattison, in Present Day Tracts, 3: no.
          13, concludes that “a term of about 8000 years is warranted by
          deductions from history, geology, and Scripture.” See also Duke of
          Argyll, Primeval Man, 76–128; Cowles on Genesis, 49–80; Dawson, Fossil
          Men, 246; Hicks, in Bap. Rev., July, 1884 (15000 years); Zöckler,
          Urgeschichte der Erde und des Menschen, 137–163. On the critical side,
          see Crooker, The New Bible and its Uses, 80–102.

        <p>
          Evidence of a geological nature seems to be accumulating, which tends
          to prove man’s advent upon earth at least ten thousand years ago. An
          arrowhead of tempered copper and a number of human bones were found in
          the Rocky Point mines, near Gilman, Colorado, 460 feet beneath the
          surface of the earth, embedded in a vein of silverbearing ore. More
          than a hundred dollars worth of ore clung to the bones when they were
          removed from the mine. On the age of the earth and the antiquity of
          man, see G. F. Wright, Man and the Glacial Epoch, lectures iv and x,
          and in McClure’s Magazine, June, 1901, and Bib. Sac., 1903:31—“Charles
          Darwin first talked about 300 million years as a mere trifle of
          geologic time. His son George limits it to 50 or 100 million; Croll
          and Young to 60 or 70 million; Wallace to 28 million; Lord Kelvin to
          24 million; Thompson and Newcomb to only 10 million.” Sir Archibald
          Geikie, at the British Association at Dover in 1899, said that 100
          million years sufficed for that small portion of the earth’s history
          which is registered in the stratified rocks of the crust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaler, Interpretation of Nature, 122, considers vegetable life to
          have existed on the planet for at least 100 million years. Warren
          Upham, in Pop. Science Monthly, Dec. 1893:153—“How old is the earth?
          100 million years.” D. G. Brinton, in Forum, Dec. 1893:454, puts the
          minimum limit of man’s existence on earth at 50,000 years. G. F.
          Wright does not doubt that man’s presence on this continent was
          preglacial, say eleven or twelve thousand years ago. He asserts that
          there has been a subsidence of Central Asia and Southern Russia since
          man’s advent, and that Arctic seals are still found in lake Baikal in
          Siberia. While he grants that Egyptian civilization may go back to
          5000 b.c. he holds that no more than 6000 or 7000 years before this
          are needed as preparation for history. Le Conte, Elements of Geology,
          613—“Men saw the great glaciers of the second glacial epoch, but there
          is no reliable evidence of their existence before the first glacial
          epoch. Deltas, implements, lake shores, waterfalls, indicate only 7000
          to 10,000 years.” Recent calculations of Prof. Prestwich, the most
          eminent living geologist of Great Britain, tend to bring the close of
          the glacial epoch down to within 10,000 or 15,000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Even if error in matters of science were found in Scripture, it
          would not disprove inspiration, since inspiration concerns itself with
          science only so far as correct scientific views are necessary to
          morals and religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great harm results from identifying Christian doctrine with specific
          theories of the universe. The Roman church held that the revolution of
          the sun around the earth was taught in Scripture, and that Christian
          faith required the condemnation of Galileo; John Wesley thought
          Christianity to be inseparable from a belief in witchcraft; opposers
          of the higher criticism regard the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch
          as “articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiæ.” We mistake greatly when
          we link inspiration with scientific doctrine. The purpose of Scripture
          is not to teach science, but to teach religion, and, with the
          exception of God’s creatorship and preserving agency in the universe,
          no scientific truth is essential to the system of Christian doctrine.
          Inspiration might leave the Scripture writers in possession of the
          scientific ideas of their time, while yet they were empowered
          correctly to declare both ethical and religious truth. A right spirit
          indeed gains some insight into the meaning of nature, and so the
          Scripture writers seem to be preserved from incorporating into their
          productions much of the scientific error of their day. But entire
          freedom from such error must not be regarded as a necessary
          accompaniment of inspiration.
