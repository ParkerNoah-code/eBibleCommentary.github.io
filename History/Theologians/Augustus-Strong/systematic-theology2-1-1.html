        <h2>I. First Truths in General.</h2>
        <p>1. Their nature.</p>
        <p>
          A. Negatively.—A first truth is not (a) Truth written prior to
          consciousness upon the substance of the soul—for such passive
          knowledge implies a materialistic view of the soul; (b) Actual
          knowledge of which the soul finds itself in possession at birth—for it
          cannot be proved that the soul has such knowledge; (c) An idea,
          undeveloped at birth, but which has the power of self-development
          apart from observation and experience—for this is contrary to all we
          know of the laws of mental growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cicero, De Natura Deorum, 1:17—“Intelligi necesse est esse deos,
          quoniam insitas eorum vel potius innatas cogitationes habemus.”
          Origen, Adv. Celsum, 1:4—“Men would not be guilty, if they did not
          carry in their minds common notions of morality, innate and written in
          divine letters.” Calvin, Institutes, 1:3:3—“Those who rightly judge
          will always agree that there is an indelible sense of divinity
          engraven upon men&#x27;s minds.” Fleming, Vocab. of Philosophy, art.:
          “Innate Ideas”—“Descartes is supposed to have taught (and Locke
          devoted the first book of his Essays to refuting the doctrine) that
          these ideas are innate or connate with the soul; i. e., the intellect
          finds itself at birth, or as soon as it wakes to conscious activity,
          to be possessed of ideas to which it has only to attach the
          appropriate names, or of judgments which it only needs to express in
          fit propositions—i. e., prior to any experience of individual
          objects.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Royce, Spirit of Modern Philosophy, 77—“In certain families, Descartes
          teaches, good breeding and the gout are innate. Yet, of course, the
          children of such families have to be instructed in deportment, and the
          infants just learning to walk seem happily quite free from gout. Even
          so geometry is innate in us, but it does not come to our consciousness
          without much trouble”; 79—Locke found no innate ideas. He maintained,
          in reply, that “infants, with their rattles, showed no sign of being
          aware that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each
          other.” Schopenhauer said that “Jacobi had the trifling weakness of
          taking all he had learned and approved before his fifteenth year for
          inborn ideas of the human mind.” Bowne, Principles of Ethics, 5—“That
          the rational ideas are conditioned by the sense experience and are
          sequent to it, is unquestioned by any one; and that experience shows a
          successive order of manifestation is equally undoubted. But the
          sensationalist has always shown a curious blindness to the ambiguity
          of such a fact. He will have it that what comes after must be a
          modification of what went before; whereas it might be that, and it
          might be a new, though conditioned, manifestation of an immanent
          nature or law. Chemical affinity is not gravity, although affinity
          cannot manifest itself until gravity has brought the elements into
          certain relations.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philosophy of Religion, 1:103—“This principle was not from
          the beginning in the consciousness of men; for, in order to think
          ideas, reason must be clearly developed, which in the first of mankind
          it could just as little be as in children. This however does not
          exclude the fact that there was from the beginning the unconscious
          rational impulse which lay at the basis of the formation of the belief
          in God, however manifold may have been the direct motives which
          co-operated with it.” Self is implied in the simplest act of
          knowledge. Sensation gives us two things, e. g., black and white; but
          I cannot compare them without asserting difference for me. Different
          sensations make no knowledge, without a self to bring them together.
          Upton, Hibbert Lectures, lecture 2—“You could as easily prove the
          existence of an external world to a man who had no senses to perceive
          it, as you could prove the existence of God to one who had no
          consciousness of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Positively.—A first truth is a knowledge which, though developed
          upon occasion of observation and reflection, is not derived from
          observation and reflection,—a knowledge on the contrary which has such
          logical priority that it must be assumed or supposed, in order to make
          any observation or reflection possible. Such truths are not,
          therefore, recognized first in order of time; some of them are
          assented to somewhat late in the mind&#x27;s growth; by the great
          majority of men they are never consciously formulated at all. Yet they
          constitute the necessary assumptions upon which all other knowledge
          rests, and the mind has not only the inborn capacity to evolve them so
          soon as the proper occasions are presented, but the recognition of
          them is inevitable so soon as the mind begins to give account to
          itself of its own knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mansel, Metaphysics, 52, 279—“To describe experience as the cause of
          the idea of space would be as inaccurate as to speak of the soil in
          which it was planted as the cause of the oak—though the planting in
          the soil is the condition which brings into manifestation the latent
          power of the acorn.” Coleridge: “We see before we know that we have
          eyes; but when once this is known, we perceive that eyes must have
          preëxisted in order to enable us to see.” Coleridge speaks of first
          truths as “those necessities of mind or forms of thinking, which,
          though revealed to us by experience, must yet have preëxisted in order
          to make experience possible.” McCosh, Intuitions, 48, 49—Intuitions
          are “like flower and fruit, which are in the plant from its embryo,
          but may not be actually formed till there have been a stalk and
          branches and leaves.”Porter, Human Intellect, 501, 519—“Such truths
          cannot be acquired or assented to first of all.” Some are reached last
          of all. The moral intuition is often developed late, and sometimes,
          even then, only upon occasion of corporal punishment. “Every man is as
          lazy as circumstances will admit.” Our physical laziness is
          occasional; our mental laziness frequent; our moral laziness
          incessant. We are too lazy to think, and especially to think of
          religion. On account of this depravity of human nature we should
          expect the intuition of God to be developed last of all. Men shrink
          from contact with God and from the thought of God. In fact, their
          dislike for the intuition of God leads them not seldom to deny all
          their other intuitions, even those of freedom and of right. Hence the
          modern “psychology without a soul.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Schurman, Agnosticism and Religion, 105-115—“The idea of God ... is
          latest to develop into clear consciousness ... and must be latest, for
          it is the unity of the difference of the self and the not-self, which
          are therefore presupposed.” But “it has not less validity in itself,
          it gives no less trustworthy assurance of actuality, than the
          consciousness of the self, or the consciousness of the not-self....
          The consciousness of God is the logical prius of the consciousness of
          self and of the world. But not, as already observed, the
          chronological; for, according to the profound observation of
          Aristotle, what in the nature of things is first, is in the order of
          development last. Just because God is the first principle of being and
          knowing, he is the last to be manifested and known.... The finite and
          the infinite are both known together, and it is as impossible to know
          one without the other as it is to apprehend an angle without the sides
          which contain it.” For account of the relation of the intuitions to
          experience, see especially Cousin, True, Beautiful and Good, 39-64,
          and History of Philosophy, 2:199-245. Compare Kant, Critique of Pure
          Reason, Introd., 1. See also Bascom, in Bib. Sac., 23:1-47; 27:68-90.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Their criteria. The criteria by which first truths are to be tested
          are three:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. Their universality. By this we mean, not that all men assent to
          them or understand them when propounded in scientific form, but that
          all men manifest a practical belief in them by their language,
          actions, and expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Their necessity. By this we mean, not that it is impossible to deny
          these truths, but that the mind is compelled by its very constitution
          to recognize them upon the occurrence of the proper conditions, and to
          employ them in its arguments to prove their non-existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. Their logical independence and priority. By this we mean that these
          truths can be resolved into no others, and proved by no others; that
          they are presupposed in the acquisition of all other knowledge, and
          can therefore be derived from no other source than an original
          cognitive power of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instances of the professed and formal denial of first truths:—the
          positivist denies causality; the idealist denies substance; the
          pantheist denies personality; the necessitarian denies freedom; the
          nihilist denies his own existence. A man may in like manner argue that
          there is no necessity for an atmosphere; but even while he argues, he
          breathes it. Instance the knock-down argument to demonstrate the
          freedom of the will. I grant my own existence in the very doubting of
          it; for “cogito, ergo sum,” as Descartes himself insisted, really
          means “cogito, scilicet sum”; H. B. Smith: “The statement is analysis,
          not proof.” Ladd, Philosophy of Knowledge, 59—“The cogito, in
          barbarous Latin = cogitans sum: thinking is self-conscious being.”
          Bentham: “The word ought is an authoritative imposture, and ought to
          be banished from the realm of morals.” Spinoza and Hegel really deny
          self-consciousness when they make man a phenomenon of the infinite.
          Royce likens the denier of personality to the man who goes outside of
          his own house and declares that no one lives there because, when he
          looks in at the window, he sees no one inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professor James, in his Psychology, assumes the reality of a brain,
          but refuses to assume the reality of a soul. This is essentially the
          position of materialism. But this assumption of a brain is
          metaphysics, although the author claims to be writing a psychology
          without metaphysics. Ladd, Philosophy of Mind, 3—“The materialist
          believes in causation proper so long as he is explaining the origin of
          mind from matter, but when he is asked to see in mind the cause of
          physical change he at once becomes a mere phenomenalist.” Royce,
          Spirit of Modern Philosophy, 400—“I know that all beings, if only they
          can count, must find that three and two make five. Perhaps the angels
          cannot count; but, if they can, this axiom is true for them. If I met
          an angel who declared that his experience had occasionally shown him a
          three and two that did not make five, I should know at once what sort
          of an angel he was.” On the criteria of first truths, see Porter,
          Human Intellect, 510, 511. On denial of them, see Shedd, Dogmatic
          Theology, 1:213.
