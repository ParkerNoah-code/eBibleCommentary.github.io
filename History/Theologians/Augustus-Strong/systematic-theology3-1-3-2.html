        <p>2. Possibility of Miracle.</p>
        <p>
          An event in nature may be caused by an agent in nature yet above
          nature. This is evident from the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Lower forces and laws in nature are frequently counteracted and
          transcended by the higher (as mechanical forces and laws by chemical,
          and chemical by vital), while yet the lower forces and laws are not
          suspended or annihilated, but are merged in the higher, and made to
          assist in accomplishing purposes to which they are altogether unequal
          when left to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          By nature we mean nature in the proper sense—not ‘everything that is
          not God,’ but ‘everything that is not God or made in the image of
          God’s; see Hopkins, Outline Study of Man, 258, 259. Man’s will does
          not belong to nature, but is above nature. On the transcending of
          lower forces by higher, see Murphy, Habit and Intelligence, 1:88.
          James Robertson, Early Religion of Israel, 23—“Is it impossible that
          there should be unique things in the world? Is it scientific to assert
          that there are not?” Ladd, Philosophy of Knowledge, 406—“Why does not
          the projecting part of the coping-stone fall, in obedience to the law
          of gravitation, from the top of yonder building? Because, as physics
          declares, the forces of cohesion, acting under quite different laws,
          thwart and oppose for the time being the law of gravitation.…But now,
          after a frosty night, the coping-stone actually breaks off and tumbles
          to the ground; for that unique law which makes water forcibly expand
          at 32° Fahrenheit has contradicted the laws of cohesion and has
          restored to the law of gravitation its temporarily suspended rights
          over this mass of matter.” Gore, Incarnation, 48—“Evolution views
          nature as a progressive order in which there are new departures, fresh
          levels won, phenomena unknown before. When organic life appeared, the
          future did not resemble the past. So when man came. Christ is a new
          nature—the creative Word made flesh. It is to be expected that, as new
          nature, he will exhibit new phenomena. New vital energy will radiate
          from him, controlling the material forces. Miracles are the proper
          accompaniments of his person.” We may add that, as Christ is the
          immanent God, he is present in nature while at the same time he is
          above nature, and he whose steady will is the essence of all natural
          law can transcend all past exertions of that will. The infinite One is
          not a being of endless monotony. William Elder, Ideas from Nature,
          156—“God is not bound hopelessly to his process, like Ixion to his
          wheel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The human will acts upon its physical organism, and so upon
          nature, and produces results which nature left to herself never could
          accomplish, while yet no law of nature is suspended or violated.
          Gravitation still operates upon the axe, even while man holds it at
          the surface of the water—for the axe still has weight (cf. 2Ki_6:5-7).
        </p>
        <p>
          Versus Hume, Philos. Works, 4:130—“A miracle is a violation of the
          laws of nature.” Christian apologists have too often needlessly
          embarrassed their argument by accepting Hume’s definition. The stigma
          is entirely undeserved. If man can support the axe at the surface of
          the water while gravitation still acts upon it, God can certainly, at
          the prophet’s word, make the iron to swim, while gravitation still
          acts upon it. But this last is miracle. See Mansel, Essay on Miracles,
          in Aids to Faith, 26, 27: After the greatest wave of the season has
          landed its pebble high up on the beach, I can move the pebble a foot
          further without altering the force of wind or wave or climate in a
          distant continent. Fisher, Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 471;
          Hamilton, Autology, 685–690; Bowen, Metaph. and Ethics, 445; Row,
          Bampton Lectures on Christian Evidences, 54–74; A. A. Hodge: Pulling
          out a new stop of the organ does not suspend the working or destroy
          the harmony of the other stops. The pump does not suspend the law of
          gravitation, nor does our throwing a ball into the air. If gravitation
          did not act, the upward velocity of the ball would not diminish and
          the ball would never return. “Gravitation draws iron down. But the
          magnet overcomes that attraction and draws the iron up. Yet here is no
          suspension or violation of law, but rather a harmonious working of two
          laws, each in its sphere. Death and not life is the order of nature.
          But men live notwithstanding. Life is supernatural. Only as a force
          additional to mere nature works against nature does life exist. So
          spiritual life uses and transcends the laws of nature” (Sunday School
          Times). Gladden, What Is Left? 60—“Wherever you find thought, choice,
          love, you find something that is not under the dominion of fixed law.
          These are the attributes of a free personality.” William James: “We
          need to substitute the personal view of life for the impersonal and
          mechanical view. Mechanical rationalism is narrowness and partial
          induction of facts,—it is not science.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) In all free causation, there is an acting without means. Man acts
          upon external nature through his physical organism, but, in moving his
          physical organism, he acts directly upon matter. In other words, the
          human will can use means, only because it has the power of acting
          initially without means.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Hopkins, on Prayer-gauge, 10, and in Princeton Review, Sept.
          1882:188. A. J. Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 311—“Not Divinity
          alone intervenes in the world of things. Each living soul, in its
          measure and degree, does the same.” Each soul that acts in any way on
          its surroundings does so on the principle of the miracle. Phillips
          Brooks, Life, 2:350—“The making of all events miraculous is no more an
          abolition of miracle than the flooding of the world with sunshine is
          an extinction of the sun.” George Adam Smith, on Isa_33:14—“derouriug
          fire…everlasting barnings”: “If we look at a conflagration through
          smoked glass, we see buildings collapsing, but we see no fire. So
          science sees results, but not the power which produces them; sees
          cause and effect, but does not see God.” P. S. Henson: “The current in
          an electric wee is invisible so long as it circulates uniformly. But
          cut the wire and insert a piece of carbon between the two broken ends,
          and at once you have an arc-light that drives away the darkness. So
          miracle is only the momentary interruption in the operation of uniform
          laws, which thus gives light to the ages,”—or, let us say rather, the
          momentary change in the method of their operation whereby the will of
          God takes a new form of manifestation. Pfleiderer, Grundriss,
          100—“Spinoza leugnete ihre metaphysische Möglichkeit, Hume ihre
          geschichtliche Erkennbarkeit, Kant ihre practische Brauchbarkeit,
          Schleiermacher ihre religiöse Bedeutsamkeit, Hegel ihre geistige
          Beweiskraft, Fichte ihre wahre Christlichkeit, und die kritische
          Theologie ihre wahre Geschichtlichkeit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) What the human will, considered as a supernatural force, and what
          the chemical and vital forces of nature itself, are demonstrably able
          to accomplish, cannot be regarded as beyond the power of God, so long
          as God dwells in and controls the universe. If man’s will can act
          directly upon matter in his own physical organism, God’s will can work
          immediately upon the system which he has created and which he
          sustains. In other words, if there be a God, and if he be a personal
          being, miracles are possible. The impossibility of miracles can be
          maintained only upon principles of atheism or pantheism.
        </p>
        <p>
          See westcott, Gospel of the Resurrection, 19; Cox, Miracles, an
          Argument and a Challenge: “Anthropomorphism is preferable to
          hylomorphism.” Newman Smyth, Old Faiths in a New Light, ch. 1—“A
          miracle is not a sudden blow struck in the face of nature, but a use
          of nature, according to its inherent capacities, by higher powers.”
          See also Gloatz, Wunder und Naturgesetz, in Studien und Kritiken,
          1886:403–546; Gunsaulus, Transfiguration of Christ, 18, 19, 28;
          Andover Review, on “Robert Elsmere,” 1888:303; W. E. Gladstone, in
          Nineteenth Century, 1888:766–788; Dubois, on Science and Miracle, in
          New Englander, July, 1889:1–32—Three postulates: (1) Every particle
          attracts every other in the universe: (2) Man’s will is free; (2)
          Every volition is accompanied by corresponding brain-action. Hence
          every volition of ours causes changes throughout the whole universe;
          also, in Century Magazine, Dec. 1894:229—Conditions are never twice
          the same in nature; all things are the results of will, since we know
          that the least thought of ours shakes the universe; miracle is simply
          the action of will in unique conditions; the beginning of life, the
          origin of consciousness, these are miracles, yet they are strictly
          natural; prayer and the mind that frames it are conditions which the
          Mind in nature cannot ignore. Cf. Psa_115:3—“our God is in the heaven:
          He hath done whatsoever he pleased” = his almighty power and freedom
          do away with all a priori objections to miracles. If God is not a mere
          force, but a person, then miracles are possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) This possibility of miracles becomes doubly sure to those who see
          in Christ none other than the immanent God manifested to creatures.
          The Logos or divine Reason who is the principle of all growth and
          evolution can make God known only by means of successive new
          impartations of his energy. Since all progress implies increment, and
          Christ is the only source of life, the whole history of creation is a
          witness to the possibility of miracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          See A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 163–166—“This conception of
          evolution is that of Lotze. That great philosopher, whose influence is
          more potent than any other in present thought, does not regard the
          universe as a plenum to which nothing can be added in the way of
          force. He looks upon the universe rather as a plastic organism to
          which new impulses can be imparted from him of whose thought and will
          it is an expression. These impulses, once imparted, abide in the
          organism and are thereafter subject to its law. Though these impulses
          come from within, they come not from the finite mechanism but from the
          immanent God. Robert Browning’s phrase, ‘All’s love, but all’s law,’
          must be interpreted as meaning that the very movements of the planets
          and all the operations of nature are revelations of a personal and
          present God, but it must not be interpreted as meaning that God runs
          in a rut, that he is confined to mechanism, that he is incapable of
          unique and startling manifestations of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The idea that gives to evolution its hold upon thinking minds is the
          idea of continuity. But absolute continuity is inconsistent with
          progress. If the future is not simply a reproduction of the past,
          there must be some new cause of change. In order to progress there
          must be either a new force, or a new combination of forces, and the
          new combination of forces can be explained only by some new force that
          causes the combination. This new force, moreover, must be intelligent
          force, if the evolution is to be toward the better instead of toward
          the worse. The continuity must be continuity not of forces but of
          plan. The forces may increase, nay, they must increase, unless the new
          is to be a mere repetition of the old. There must be additional energy
          imparted, the new combination brought about, and all this implies
          purpose and will. But through all there runs one continuous plan, and
          upon this plan the rationality of evolution depends.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A man builds a house. In laying the foundation he uses stone and
          mortar, but he makes the walls of wood and the roof of tin. In the
          superstructure he brings into play different laws from those which
          apply to the foundation. There is continuity, not of material, but of
          plan. Progress from cellar to garret requires breaks here and there,
          and the bringing in of new forces; in fact, without the bringing in of
          these new forces the evolution of the house would be impossible. Now
          substitute for the foundation and superstructure living things like
          the chrysalis and the butterfly; imagine the power to work from within
          and not from without; and you see that true continuity does not
          exclude but involves new beginnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Evolution, then, depends on increments of force plus continuity of
          plan. New creations are possible because the immanent God has not
          exhausted himself. Miracle is possible because God is not far away,
          but is at hand to do whatever the needs of his moral universe may
          require. Regeneration and answers to prayer are possible for the very
          reason that these are the objects for which the universe was built. If
          we were deists, believing in a distant God and a mechanical universe,
          evolution and Christianity would be irreconcilable. But since we
          believe in a dynamical universe, of which the personal and living God
          is the inner source of energy, evolution is but the basis, foundation
          and background of Christianity, the silent and regular working of him
          who, in the fulness of time, utters his voice in Christ and the
          Cross.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lotze’s own statement of his position may be found in his Microcosmos,
          2:479 sq. Professor James Ten Broeke has interpreted him as follows:
          “He makes the possibility of the miracle depend upon the close and
          intimate action and reaction between the world and the personal
          Absolute, in consequence of which the movements of the natural world
          are carried on only through the Absolute, with the possibility of a
          variation in the general course of things, according to existing facts
          and the purpose of the divine Governor.”
