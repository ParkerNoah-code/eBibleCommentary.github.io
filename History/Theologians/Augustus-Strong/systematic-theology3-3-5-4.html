        <p>4. Errors of Reasoning.</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are generally to be explained as valid
          argument expressed in highly condensed form. The appearance of error
          may be due to the suppression of one or more links in the reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Mat_22:32, Christ’s argument for the resurrection, drawn from the
          fact that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is perfectly
          and obviously valid, the moment we put in the suppressed premise that
          the living relation to God which is here implied cannot properly be
          conceived as something merely spiritual, but necessarily requires a
          new and restored life of the body. If God is the God of the living,
          then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob shall rise from the dead. See more full
          exposition, under Eschatology. Some of the Scripture arguments are
          enthymemes, and an enthymeme, according to Arbuthnot and Pope, is “a
          syllogism in which the major is married to the minor, and the marriage
          is kept secret.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Where we cannot see the propriety of the conclusions drawn from
          given premises, there is greater reason to attribute our failure to
          ignorance of divine logic on our part, than to accommodation or ad
          hominem arguments on the part of the Scripture writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By divine logic we mean simply a logic whose elements and processes
          are correct, though not understood by us. In Heb_7:9-10 (Levi’s paying
          tithes in Abraham), there is probably a recognition of the organic
          unity of the family, which in miniature illustrates the organic unity
          of the race. In Gal_3:20—“a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God
          is one”—the law, with its two contracting parties, is contrasted with
          the promise, which proceeds from the sole flat of God and is therefore
          unchangeable. Paul’s argument here rests on Christ’s divinity as its
          foundation—otherwise Christ would have been a mediator in the same
          sense in which Moses was a mediator (see Lightfoot, in loco). In
          Gal_4:21-31, Hagar and Ishmael on the one hand, and Sarah and Isaac on
          the other, illustrate the exclusion of the bondmen of the law from the
          privileges of the spiritual seed of Abraham. Abraham’s two wives, and
          the two classes of people in the two sons, represent the two covenants
          (so Calvin). In Joh_10:34—“I said, Ye are gods,” the implication is
          that Judaism was not a system of mere monotheism, but of theism
          tending to theanthropism, a real union of God and man (Westcott, Bib.
          Com., in loco). Godet well remarks that he who doubts Paul’s logic
          will do well first to suspect his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The adoption of Jewish methods of reasoning, where it could be
          proved, would not indicate error on the part of the Scripture writers,
          but rather an inspired sanction of the method as applied to that
          particular case.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Gal_3:16—“He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one,
          And to thy seed, which is Christ.” Here it is intimated that the very
          form of the expression in Gen_22:18, which denotes unity, was selected
          by the Holy Spirit as significant of that one person, Christ, who was
          the true seed of Abraham and in whom all nations were to be blessed.
          Argument from the form of a single word is in this case correct,
          although the Rabbins often made more of single words than the Holy
          Spirit ever intended. Watts, New Apologetic, 69—“F. W. Farrar asserts
          that the plural of the Hebrew or Greek terms for ‘seed’ is never used
          by Hebrew or Greek writers as a designation of human offspring. But
          see Sophocles, Œdipus at Colonus, 599, 600—γῆς ἐμῆς ἀπηλάθην πρὸς τῶν
          ἐμαυτοῦ σπερμάτων—‘I was driven away from my own country by my own
          offspring.’ ” In 1Co_10:1-6—“and the rock was Christ”—the Rabbinic
          tradition that the smitten rock followed the Israelites in their
          wanderings is declared to be only the absurd literalizing of a
          spiritual fact—the continual presence of Christ, as preëxistent Logos,
          with his ancient people. Per contra, see Row, Rev. and Mod. Theories,
          98–128.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) If it should appear however upon further investigation that
          Rabbinical methods have been wrongly employed by the apostles in their
          argumentation, we might still distinguish between the truth they are
          seeking to convey and the arguments by which they support it.
          Inspiration may conceivably make known the truth, yet leave the
          expression of the truth to human dialectic as well as to human
          rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnson, Quotations of the N. T. from the O. T., 137, 138—“In the
          utter absence of all evidence to the contrary, we ought to suppose
          that the allegories of the N. T. are like the allegories of literature
          in general, merely luminous embodiments of the truth..…If these
          allegories are not presented by their writers as evidences, they are
          none the less precious, since they illuminate the truth otherwise
          evinced, and thus render it at once clear to the apprehension and
          attractive to the taste.” If however the purpose of the writers was to
          use these allegories for proof, we may still see shining through the
          rifts of their traditional logic the truth which they were striving to
          set forth. Inspiration may have put them in possession of this truth
          without altering their ordinary scholastic methods of demonstration
          and expression. Horton, Inspiration, 108—“Discrepancies and illogical
          reasonings were but inequalities or cracks in the mirrors, which did
          not materially distort or hide the Person” whose glory they sought to
          reflect. Luther went even further than this when he said that a
          certain argument in the epistle was “good enough for the Galatians.”
