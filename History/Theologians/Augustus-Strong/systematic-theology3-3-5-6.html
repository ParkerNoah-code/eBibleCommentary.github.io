        <p>6. Errors in Prophecy.</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such may frequently be explained by
          remembering that much of prophecy is yet unfulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sometimes taken for granted that the book of Revelation, for
          example, refers entirely to events already past. Moses Stuart, in his
          Commentary, and Warren’s Parousia, represent this preterist
          interpretation. Thus judged, however, many of the predictions of the
          book might seem to have failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The personal surmises of the prophets as to the meaning of the
          prophecies they recorded may have been incorrect, while yet the
          prophecies themselves are inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1Pe_1:10-11, the apostle declares that the prophets searched “what
          time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
          point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
          the glories that should follow them.” So Paul, although he does not
          announce it as certain, seems to have had some hope that he might live
          to witness Christ’s second coming. See 2Co_5:4—“not for that we would
          be unclothed, but that we would be olothed upon” (ἐπενδύσασθαι—put on
          the spiritual body, as over the present one, without the intervention
          of death); 1Th_4:15; 1Th_4:17—“we that are alive, that are left unto
          the coming of the Lord.” So Mat_2:15 quotes from Hos_11:1—“Out of
          Egypt did I call my son,” and applies the prophecy to Christ, although
          Hosea was doubtless thinking only of the exodus of the people of
          Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The prophet’s earlier utterances are not to be severed from the
          later utterances which elucidate them, nor from the whole revelation
          of which they form a part. It is unjust to forbid the prophet to
          explain his own meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Thessalonians was written expressly to correct wrong inferences as
          to the apostle’s teaching drawn from his peculiar mode of speaking in
          the first epistle. In 2Th_2:2-5 he removes the impression “that the
          day of the Lord is now present” or “just at hand”; declares that “it
          will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be
          revealed”; reminds the Thessalonians: “when I was yet with you, I told
          you these things.” Yet still, in verse 1, he speaks of “the coming of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These passages, taken together, show: (1) that the two epistles are
          one in their teaching; (2) that in neither epistle is there any
          prediction of the immediate coming of the Lord; (3) that in the second
          epistle great events are foretold as intervening before that coming;
          (4) that while Paul never taught that Christ would come during his own
          lifetime, he hoped at least during the earlier part of his life that
          it might be so—a hope that seems to have been dissipated in his later
          years. (See 2Ti_4:6—“I am already being offered, and the time of my
          departure is come.”) We must remember, however, that there was a
          “coming of the Lord” in the destruction of Jerusalem within three or
          four years of Paul’s death. Henry Van Dyke: “The point of Paul’s
          teaching in 1 and 2 Thess. is not that Christ is coming to-morrow, but
          that he is surely coming.” The absence of perspective in prophecy may
          explain Paul’s not at first defining the precise time of the end, and
          so leaving it to be misunderstood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second Epistle to the Thessalonians, therefore, only makes more
          plain the meaning of the first, and adds new items of prediction. It
          is important to recognize in Paul’s epistles a progress in prophecy,
          in doctrine, in church polity. The full statement of the truth was
          gradually drawn out, under the influence of the Spirit, upon occasion
          of successive outward demands and inward experiences. Much is to be
          learned by studying the chronological order of Paul’s epistles, as
          well as of the other N. T. books. For evidence of similar progress in
          the epistles of Peter, compare 1Pe_4:7 with 2Pe_3:4 sq.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The character of prophecy as a rough general sketch of the future,
          in highly figurative language, and without historical perspective,
          renders it peculiarly probable that what at first sight seem to be
          errors are due to a misinterpretation on our part, which confounds the
          drapery with the substance, or applies its language to events to which
          it had no reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jam_5:9 and Php_4:5 are instances of that large prophetic speech which
          regards the distant future as near at hand, because so certain to the
          faith and hope of the church. Sanday, Inspiration, 376–378—“No doubt
          the Christians of the Apostolic age did live in immediate expectation
          of the Second Coming, and that expectation culminated at the crisis in
          which the Apocalypse was written. In the Apocalypse, as in every
          predictive prophecy, there is a double element, one part derived from
          the circumstances of the present and another pointing forwards to the
          future.…All these things, in an exact and literal sense have fallen
          through with the postponement of that great event in which they
          centre. From the first they were but meant as the imaginative
          pictorial and symbolical clothing of that event. What measure of real
          fulfilment the Apocalypse may yet be destined to receive we cannot
          tell. But in predictive prophecy, even when most closely verified, the
          essence lies less in the prediction than in the eternal laws of moral
          and religious truth which the fact predicted reveals or exemplifies.”
          Thus we recognize both the divinity and the freedom of prophecy, and
          reject the rationalistic theory which would relate the fall of the
          Beaconsfield government in Matthew’s way: “That it might be fulfilled
          which was spoken by Cromwell, saying: ‘Get you gone, and make room for
          honest men!’ ” See the more full statement of the nature of prophecy,
          on pages 132–141. Also Bernard, Progress of Doctrine in the N. T.
