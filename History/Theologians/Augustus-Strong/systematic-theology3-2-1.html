          I. The Genuineness of the Christian Documents,—or proof that the books
          of the Old and New Testaments were written at the age to which they
          are assigned and by the men or class of men to whom they are ascribed.

          Our present discussion comprises the first part, and only the first
          part, of the doctrine of the Canon (κανών a measuring-reed; hence, a
          rule, a standard). It is important to observe that the determination
          of the Canon, or list of the books of sacred Scripture, is not the
          work of the church as an organized body. We do not receive these books
          upon the authority of Fathers or Councils. We receive them, only as
          the Fathers and Councils received them, because we have evidence that
          they are the writings of the men, or class of men, whose names they
          bear, and that they are also credible and inspired. If the previous
          epistle alluded to in 1Co_5:9 should be discovered and be universally
          judged authentic, it could be placed with Paul’s other letters and
          could form part of the Canon, even though it has been lost for 1800
          years. Bruce, Apologetics, 321—“Abstractly the Canon is an open
          question. It can never be anything else on the principles of
          Protestantism which forbid us to accept the decisions of church
          councils, whether ancient or modern, as final. But practically the
          question of the Canon is closed.” The Westminster Confession says that
          the authority of the word of God “does not rest upon historic
          evidence; it does not rest upon the authority of Councils; it does not
          rest upon the consent of the past or the excellence of the matter; but
          it rests upon the Spirit of God bearing witness to our hearts
          concerning its divine authority.” Clarke, Christian Theology, 24—“The
          value of the Scriptures to us does not depend upon our knowing who
          wrote them. In the O. T. half its pages are of uncertain authorship.
          New dates mean new authorship. Criticism is a duty, for dates of
          authorship give means of interpretation. The Scriptures have power
          because God is in them, and because they describe the entrance of God
          into the life of man.”

          Saintine, Picciola, 782—“Has not a feeble reed provided man with his
          first arrow, his first pen, his first instrument of music?” Hugh
          Macmillan: “The idea of stringed instruments was first derived from
          the twang of the well strung bow, as the archer shot his arrows; the
          lyre and the harp which discourse the sweetest music of peace were
          invented by those who first heard this inspiring sound in the
          excitement of battle. And so there is no music so delightful amid the
          jarring discord of the world, turning everything to music and
          harmonizing earth and heaven, as when the heart rises out of the gloom
          of anger and revenge, and converts its bow into a harp, and sings to
          it the Lord’s song of infinite forgiveness.” George Adam Smith, Mod,
          Criticism and Preaching of O. T., 5—“The church has never renounced
          her liberty to revise the Canon. The liberty at the beginning cannot
          be more than the liberty thereafter. The Holy Spirit has not forsaken
          the leaders of the church. Apostolic writers nowhere define the limits
          of the Canon, any more than Jesus did. Indeed, they employed
          extra-canonical writings. Christ and the apostles nowhere bound the
          church to believe all the teachings of the O. T. Christ discriminates,
          and forbids the literal interpretation of its contents. Many of the
          apostolic interpretations challenge our sense of truth. Much of their
          exegesis was temporary and false. Their judgment was that much in the
          O. T. was rudimentary. This opens the question of development in
          revelation, and justifies the attempt to fix the historic order. The
          N. T. criticism of the O. T. gives the liberty of criticism, and the
          need, and the obligation of it. O. T. criticism is not, like Baur’s of
          the N. T., the result of a priori Hegelian reasoning. From the time of
          Samuel we have real history. The prophets do not appeal to miracles.
          There is more gospel in the book of Jonah, when it is treated as a
          parable. The O. T. is a gradual ethical revelation of God. Few realize
          that the church of Christ has a higher warrant for her Canon of the O.
          T. than she has for her Canon of the N. T. The O. T. was the result of
          criticism in the widest sense of that word. But what the church thus
          once achieved, the church may at any time revise.”

          We reserve to a point somewhat later the proof of the credibility and
          the inspiration of the Scriptures. We now show their genuineness, as
          we would show the genuineness of other religious books, like the
          Koran, or of secular documents, like Cicero’s Orations against
          Catiline. Genuineness, in the sense in which we use the term, does not
          necessarily imply authenticity (i. e., truthfulness and authority);
          see Blunt, Diet. Doct. and Hist. Theol., art.: Authenticity. Documents
          may be genuine which are written in whole or in part by persons other
          than they whose names they bear, provided these persons belong to the
          same class. The Epistle to the Hebrews, though not written by Paul, is
          genuine, because it proceeds from one of the apostolic class. The
          addition of Deu_34:1-12, after Moses’ death, does not invalidate the
          genuineness of the Pentateuch; nor would the theory of a later Isaiah,
          even if it were established, disprove the genuineness of that
          prophecy; provided, in both cases, that the additions were made by men
          of the prophetic class. On the general subject of the genuineness of
          the Scripture documents, see Alexander, McDvaine, Chalmers, Dodge, and
          Peabody, on the Evidences of Christianity; also Archibald, The Bible
          Verified.
