        <h2>IV. Prophecy as Attesting a Divine Revelation</h2>
        <p>
          We here consider prophecy in its narrow sense of mere prediction,
          reserving to a subsequent chapter the consideration of prophecy as
          interpretation of the divine will in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Definition. Prophecy is the foretelling of future events by virtue
          of direct communication from God—a foretelling, therefore, which,
          though not contravening any laws of the human mind, those laws, if
          fully known, would not, without this agency of God, be sufficient to
          explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In discussing the subject of prophecy, we are met at the outset by the
          contention that there is not, and never has been, any real foretelling
          of future events beyond that which is possible to natural prescience.
          This is the view of Kuenen, Prophets and Prophecy in Israel.
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Relig., 2:42, denies any direct prediction.
          Prophecy in Israel, he intimates, was simply the consciousness of
          God’s righteousness, proclaiming its ideals of the future, and
          declaring that the will of God is the moral ideal of the good and the
          law of the world’s history, so that the fates of nations are
          conditioned by their bearing toward this moral purpose of God: “The
          fundamental error of the vulgar apologetics is that it confounds
          prophecy with heathen soothsaying—national salvation without
          character.” W. Robertson Smith, in Encyc. Britannica, 19:821, tells us
          that “detailed prediction occupies a very secondary place in the
          writings of the prophets; or rather indeed what seem to be predictions
          in detail are usually only free poetical illustrations of historical
          principles, which neither received nor demanded exact fulfilment.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As in the case of miracles, our faith in an immanent God, who is none
          other than the Logos or larger Christ, gives us a point of view from
          which we may reconcile the contentions of the naturalists and
          supernaturalists. Prophecy is an immediate act of God; but, since all
          natural genius is also due to God’s energizing, we do not need to deny
          the employment of man’s natural gifts in prophecy. The instances of
          telepathy, presentiment, and second sight which the Society for
          Psychical Research has demonstrated to be facts show that prediction,
          in the history of divine revelation, may be only an intensification,
          under the extraordinary impulse of the divine Spirit, of a power that
          is in some degree latent in all men. The author of every great work of
          creative imagination knows that a higher power than his own has
          possessed him. In all human reason there is a natural activity of the
          divine Reason or Logos, and he is “the light which lighteth every man”
          (Joh_1:9). So there is a natural activity of the Holy Spirit, and he
          who completes the circle of the divine consciousness completes also
          the circle of human consciousness, gives self-hood to every soul,
          makes available to man the natural as well as the spiritual gifts of
          Christ; cf. Joh_16:14—“he shall take of mine, and shall declare it
          unto you.” The same Spirit who in the beginning “brooded over the face
          of the waters” (Gen_1:2) also broods over humanity, and it is he who,
          according to Christ’s promise, was to “declare unto you the things
          that are to come” (Joh_16:13). The gift of prophecy may have its
          natural side, like the gift of miracles, yet may be finally explicable
          only as the result of an extraordinary working of that Spirit of
          Christ who to some degree manifests himself in the reason and
          conscience of every man; cf. 1Pe_1:11—“searching what time or what
          manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto,
          when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories
          that should follow them.” See Myers, Human Personality, 2:262–292.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. B. Davidson, in his article on Prophecy and Prophets, in Hastings’
          Bible Dictionary, 4:120, 121, gives little weight to this view that
          prophecy is based on a natural power of the human mind: “The arguments
          by which Giesebrecht, Berufsgabung, 13 ff., supports the theory of a
          ‘faculty of presentiment’ have little cogency. This faculty is
          supposed to reveal itself particularly on the approach of death
          (Gen_28:1-22; Gen_49:1-33). The contemporaries of most great religious
          personages have attributed to them a prophetic gift. The answer of
          John Knox to those who credited him with such a gift is worth reading:
          ‘My assurances are not marvels of Merlin, nor yet the dark sentences
          of profane prophecy. But first, the plain truth of God’s word; second,
          the invincible justice of the everlasting God; and third, the ordinary
          course of his punishments and plagues from the beginning, are my
          assurances and grounds.‘” While Davidson grants the fulfilment of
          certain specific predictions of Scripture, to be hereafter mentioned,
          he holds that “such presentiments as we can observe to be authentic
          are chiefly products of the conscience or moral reason. True prophecy
          is based on moral grounds. Everywhere the menacing future is connected
          with the evil past by ‘therefore’ (Mic_3:12; Isa_5:13; Amo_1:2).” We
          hold with Davidson to the moral element in prophecy, but we also
          recognize a power in normal humanity which he would minimize or deny.
          We claim that the human mind even in its ordinary and secular working
          gives occasional signs of transcending the limitations of the present.
          Believing in the continual activity of the divine Reason in the reason
          of man, we have no need to doubt the possibility of an extraordinary
          insight into the future, and such insight is needed at the great
          epochs of religious history. Expositor’s Gk. Test., 2:34—“Savonarola
          foretold as early as 1496 the capture of Rome, which happened in 1527,
          and he did this not only in general terms but in detail; his words
          were realized to the letter when the sacred churches of St. Peter and
          St. Paul became, as the prophet foretold, stables for the conquerors’
          horses.” On the general subject, see Payne-Smith, Prophecy a
          Preparation for Christ; Alexander, Christ and Christianity; Farrar,
          Science and Theology, 106; Newton on Prophecy; Fairbairn on Prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Relation of Prophecy to Miracles. Miracles are attestations of
          revelation proceeding from divine power; prophecy is an attestation of
          revelation proceeding from divine knowledge. Only God can know the
          contingencies of the future. The possibility and probability of
          prophecy may be argued upon the same grounds upon which we argue the
          possibility and probability of miracles. As an evidence of divine
          revelation, however, prophecy possesses two advantages over miracles,
          namely: (a) The proof, in the case of prophecy, is not derived from
          ancient testimony, but is under our eyes. (b) The evidence of miracles
          cannot become stronger, whereas every new fulfilment adds to the
          argument from prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Requirements in Prophecy, considered as an Evidence of Revelation.
          (a) The utterance must be distant from the event. (b) Nothing must
          exist to suggest the event to merely natural prescience, (c) The
          utterance must be free from ambiguity. (d) Yet it must not be so
          precise as to secure its own fulfilment. (e) It must be followed in
          due time by the event predicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hume: “All prophecies are real miracles, and only as such can be
          admitted as proof of any revelation” See Wardlaw, Syst. Theol., 1:347.
          (a) Hundreds of years intervened between certain of the O. T.
          predictions and their fulfilment, (b) Stanley instances the natural
          sagacity of Burke, which enabled him to predict the French Revolution.
          But Burke also predicted in 1793 that France would be partitioned like
          Poland among a confederacy of hostile powers. Canning predicted that
          South American colonies would grow up as the United States had grown.
          D’Israeli predicted that our Southern Confederacy would become an
          independent nation. Ingersoll predicted that within ten years there
          would be two theatres for one church. (e) Illustrate ambiguous
          prophecies by the Delphic oracle to Croesus: “Crossing the river, thou
          destroyest a great nation”—whether his own or his enemy’s the oracle
          left undetermined. “Ibis et redibis nunquam peribis in bello.” (d)
          Strauss held that O. T. prophecy itself determined either the events
          or the narratives of the gospels. See Greg, Creed of Christendom,
          chap. 4. (e) Cardan, the Italian mathematician, predicted the day and
          hour of his own death, and committed suicide at the proper time to
          prove the prediction true. Jehovah makes the fulfilment of his
          predictions the proof of his deity in the controversy with false gods:
          Isa_41:23—“Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may
          know that ye are gods”; Isa_42:9—“Behold, the former things are come
          to pass and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell
          you of them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. General Features of Prophecy in the Scriptures. (a) Its large
          amount—occupying a great portion of the Bible, and extending over many
          hundred years. (b) Its ethical and religious nature—the events of the
          future being regarded as outgrowths and results of men’s present
          attitude toward God. (c) Its unity in diversity—finding its central
          point in Christ the true servant of God and deliverer of his people.
          (d) Its actual fulfilment as regards many of its predictions—while
          seeming non-fulfilments are explicable from its figurative and
          conditional nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. B. Davidson, in Hastings’ Bible Dictionary, 4:125, has suggested
          reasons for the apparent non-fulfilment of certain predictions.
          Prophecy is poetical and figurative; its details are not to be
          pressed: they are only drapery, needed for the expression of the idea.
          In Isa_13:16—“Their infants shall be dashed in pieces … and their
          wives ravished”—the prophet gives an ideal picture of the sack of a
          city; these things did not actually happen, but Cyrus entered Babylon
          “in peace.” Yet the essential truth remained that the city fell into
          the enemy’s hands. The prediction of Ezekiel with regard to Tyre,
          Eze_26:7-14, is recognized in Eze_29:17-20 as having been fulfilled
          not in its details but in its essence—the actual event having been the
          breaking of the power of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar. Isa_17:1—“Behold,
          Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous
          heap”—must be interpreted as predicting the blotting out of its
          dominion, since Damascus has probably never teased to be a city. The
          conditional nature of prophecy explains other seeming non-fulfilments.
          Predictions were often threats, which migrht be revoked upon
          repentance. Jer_26:13—“amend your ways … and the Lord will repent him
          of the evil which he hath pronounced against you.” Jon_3:4—“Yet forty
          days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown … 10—God saw their works, that
          they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which
          he said he would do onto them; and he did it not”; cf. Jer_18:8;
          Jer_26:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instances of actual fufilment of prophecy are found, according to
          Davidson, in Samuel’s prediction of some things that would happen to
          Saul, which the history declares did happen (1Sa_1:1-28; 1Sa_10:1-27).
          Jeremiah predicted the death of Hananiah within the year, which took
          place (Jer_28:1-17). Micaiah predicted the defeat and death of Ahab at
          RamothGilead (1Ki_22:1-53). Isaiah predicted the failure of the
          northern coalition to subdue Jerusalem (Isa_7:1-25); the overthrow in
          two or three years of Damascus and Northern Israel before the
          Assyrians (Isa_8:1-22; Isa_17:1-14); the failure of Sennacherib to
          capture Jerusalem, and the melting away of his army (Isa_37:34-37).
          “And in general, apart from details, the main predictions of the
          prophets regarding Israel and the nations were verified in history,
          for example, Amo_1:1-15; Amo_2:1-16. The chief predictions of the
          prophets relate to the imminent downfall of the kingdoms of Israel and
          Judah; to what lies beyond this, namely, the restoration of the
          kingdom of God; and to the state of the people in their condition of
          final felicity.” For predictions of the exile and the return of
          Israel, see especially Amo_9:9—“For, lo, I will command, and I will
          sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as grain is
          sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the
          earth.…14—And I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel,
          and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them.” Even if we
          accept the theory of composite authorship of the book of Isaiah, we
          still have a foretelling of the sending back of the Jews from Babylon,
          and a designation of Cyrus as God’s agent, in Isa_44:28—“that saith of
          Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even
          saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and of the temple, Thy
          foundation shall be laid”; see George Adam Smith, in Hastings’ Bible
          Dictionary, 2:493. Frederick the Great said to his chaplain: “Give me
          in one word a proof of the divine origin of the Bible”; and the
          chaplain well replied: “The Jews, your Majesty.” In the case of the
          Jews we have even now the unique phenomena of a people without a land,
          and a land without a people,—yet both these were predicted centuries
          before the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Messianic Prophecy in general. (a) Direct predictions of events—as
          in Old Testament prophecies of Christ’s birth, suffering and
          subsequent glory. (b) General prophecy of the Kingdom in the Old
          Testament, and of its gradual triumph. (c) Historical types in a
          nation and in individuals—as Jonah and David. (d) Prefigurations of
          the future in rites and ordinances—as in sacrifice, circumcision, and
          the passover.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Special Prophencies uttred by Christ. (a) As to his own death and
          resurrection. (b) As to events occurring between his death and the
          destruction of Jerusalem (multitudes of impostors; wars and rumors of
          wars; famine and pestilence). (c) As to the destruction of Jerusalem
          and the Jewish polity (Jerusalem compassed with armies; abomination of
          desolation in the holy place; flight of Christians; misery; massacre;
          dispersion). (d) As to the world-wide diffusion of his gospel (the
          Bible already the most widely circulated book in the world ). The most
          important feature in prophecy is its Messianic element; see
          Luk_24:27—“beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he
          interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning
          himself”; Act_10:43—“to him bear all the prophets witness”;
          Rev_19:10—“the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” Types
          are intended resemblances, designed prefigurations: for example,
          Israel is a type of the Christian church; outside nations are types of
          the hostile world; Jonah and David are types of Christ. The typical
          nature of Israel
        </p>
        <p>
          rests upon the deeper fact of the community of life. As the life of
          God the Logos lies at the basis of universal humanity and
          interpenetrates it in every part, so out of this universal humanity
          grows Israel in general; out of Israel as a nation springs the
          spiritual Israel, and out of spiritual Israel Christ according to the
          flesh,—the upward rising pyramid finds its apex and culmination in
          him. Hence the predictions with regard to “the servant of Jehovah”
          (Isa_42:1-7), and “the Messiah” (Isa_61:1; Joh_1:41), have partial
          fulfilment in Israel, but perfect fulfilment only in Christ; so
          Delitzsch, Oehler, and Cheyne on Isaiah, 2:253. Sabatier, Philos.
          Religion, 59—“If humanity were not potentially and in some degree
          Immanuel, God with us, there would never have issued from its bosom he
          who bore and revealed this blessed name.” Gardiner, O. T. and N. T. in
          their Mutual Relations, 170–194. In the O. T., Jehovah is the Redeemer
          of his people. He works through judges, prophets, kings, but he
          himself remains the Savior; “it is only the Divine in them that
          saves”; “Salvation is of Jehovah” (Jon_2:9). Jehovah is manifested in
          the Davidie King under the monarchy; in Israel, the Servant of the
          Lord, during the exile; and in the Messiah, or Anointed One, in the
          post-exilian period. Because of its conscious identification with
          Jehovah, Israel is always a forward-looking people. Each new judge,
          king, prophet is regarded as heralding the coming reign of
          righteousness and peace. These earthly deliverers are saluted with
          rapturous expectation; the prophets express this expectation in terms
          that transcend the possibilities of the present; and, when this
          expectation fails to be fully realized, the Messianic hope is simply
          transferred to a larger future. Each separate prophecy has its drap
        </p>
        <p>
          ery furnished by the prophet’s immediate surroundings, and finds its
          occasion in some event of contemporaneous history. But by degrees it
          becomes evident that only an ideal and perfect King and Savior can
          fill out the requirements of prophecy. Only when Christ appears, does
          the real meaning of the various Old Testament predictions become
          manifest. Only then are men able to combine the seemingly inconsistent
          prophecies of a priest who is also a king (Psa_110:1-7), and of a
          royal but at the same time a suffering Messiah (Isa_53:1-12). It is
          not enough for us to ask what the prophet himself meant, or what his
          earliest hearers understood, by his prophecy. This is to regard
          prophecy as having only a single, and that a human, author. With the
          spirit of man coöperated the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit
          (1Pe_1:11—“the Spirit of Christ which was in them”; 2Pe_1:21—“no
          prophecy ever came by the will of man; but men spake from God, being
          moved by the Holy Spirit”). All prophecy has a twofold authorship,
          human and divine; the same Christ who spoke through the prophets
          brought about the fulfilment of their words. It is no wonder that he
          who through the prophets uttered predictions with regard to himself
          should, when he became incarnate, be the prophet par excellence
          (Deu_18:15; Act_3:22—“Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God
          raise up from among your brethren, like unto me; to him shall ye
          hearken”). In the predictions of Jesus we find the proper key to the
          interpretation of prophecy in general, and the evidence that while no
          one of the three theories—the preterist, the continuist, the
          futurist—furnishes an exhaustive explanation, each one of these has
          its element of truth. Our Lord made the fulfilment of the prediction
          of his own resurrection a test of his divine commission: it was “the
          sign of Jonah the prophet” (Mat_12:39). He promised that his disciples
          should have prophetic gifts: Joh_15:15—“No longer do I call you
          servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have
          called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have
          made known unto you”; Joh_16:13—“the Spirit of truth … he shall
          declare unto you the things that are to come.” Agabus predicted the
          famine and Paul’s i
        </p>

          mprisonment (Act_11:28; Act_21:10); Paul predicted heresies
          (Act_20:29-30), shipwreck (Act_27:10; Act_27:21-26), “the man of sin”
          (2Th_2:3), Christ’s second coming, and the resurrection of the saints
          (1Th_4:15-17). 7. On the double sense of Prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Certain prophecies apparently contain a fulness of meaning which
          is not exhausted by the event to which they most obviously and
          literally refer. A prophecy which had a partial fulfilment at a time
          not remote from its utterance, may find its chief fulfilment in an
          event far distant. Since the principles of God’s administration find
          ever recurring and ever enlarging illustration in history, prophecies
          which have already had a partial fulfilment may have whole cycles of
          fulfilment yet before them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In prophecy there is an absence of perspective; as in Japanese
          pictures the near and the far appear equally distant; as in dissolving
          views, the immediate future melts into a future immeasurably far away.
          The candle that shines through a narrow aperture sends out its light
          through an ever-increasing area; sections of the triangle correspond
          to each other, but the more distant are far greater than the near. The
          châlet on the mountain-side may turn out to be only a black cat on the
          woodpile, or a speck upon the window pane. “A hill which appears to
          rise close behind another is found on nearer approach to have receded
          a great way from it.” The painter, by foreshortening, brings together
          things or parts that are relatively distant from each other. The
          prophet is a painter whose foreshortenings are supernatural; he seems
          freed from the law of space and time, and, rapt into the timelessness
          of God, he views the events of history “sub specie eternitatis.”
          Prophecy was the sketching of an outline-map. Even the prophet could
          not fill up the outline. The absence of perspective in prophecy may
          account for Paul’s being misunderstood by the Thessalonians, and for
          the necessity of his explanations in 2Th_2:1-2. In Isa_10:1-34;
          Isa_11:1-16, the fall of Lebanon (the Assyrian) is immediately
          connected with the rise of the Branch (Christ); in Jer_51:41, the
          first capture and the complete destruction of Babylon are connected
          with each other, without notice of the interval of a thousand years
          between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instances of the double sense of prophecy may be found in Isa_7:14-16;
          Isa_9:6-7—“a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,… unto us a son is
          given”—compared with Mat_1:22-23, where the prophecy is applied to
          Christ (see Meyer, in loco); Hos_11:1—“I.…called my son out of
          Egypt”—referring originally to the calling of the nation out of
          Egypt—is in Mat_2:15 referred to Christ, who embodied and consummated
          the mission of Israel; Psa_118:22-23—“The stone which the builders
          rejected Is become the head of the corner”—which primarily referred to
          the Jewish nation, conquered, carried away, and flung aside as of no
          use, but divinely destined to a future of importance and grandeur, is
          in Mat_21:42 referred by Jesus to himself, as the true embodiment of
          Israel. William Arnold Stevens, on The Man of Sin, in Bap. Quar. Rev.,
          July, 1889:328–360—As in Dan_11:36, the great enemy of the faith, who
          “shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god,” is the
          Syrian King, Antiochus Epiphanes, so “the man of lawlessness”
          described by Paul in 2Th_2:3 is the corrupt and impious Judaism of the
          apostolic age. This had its seat in the temple of God, but was doomed
          to destruction when the Lord should come at the fall of Jerusalem. But
          even this second fulfilment of the prophecy does not preclude a future
          and final fulfilment. Broadus on Mat., page 480—In Isa_41:8 to chapter
          Isa_53:1-12, the predictions with regard to “the servant of Jehovah”
          make a gradual transition from Israel to the Messiah, the former alone
          being seen in Isa_41:8, the Messiah also appearing in Isa_42:1 sq.,
          and Israel quite sinking out of sight in chapter 53.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most marked illustration of the double sense of prophecy however
          is to be found in Mat_24:1-51; Mat_25:1-46, especially Mat_24:34 and
          Mat_25:31, where Christ’s prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem
          passes into a prophecy of the end of the world. Adamson, The Mind in
          Christ, 183—“To him history was the robe of God, and therefore a
          constant repetition of positions really similar, kaleidoscopic
          combining of a few truths, as the facts varied in which they were to
          be embodied.” A. J. Gordon: “Prophecy has no sooner become history,
          than history in turn becomes prophecy.” Lord Bacon: “Divine prophecies
          have springing and germinant accomplishment through many ages, though
          the height or fulness of them may refer to some one age.” In a similar
          manner there is a manifoldness of meaning in Dante’s Divine Comedy. C.
          E. Norton, Inferno, xvi—“The narrative of the poet’s spiritual journey
          is so vivid and consistent that it has all the reality of an account
          of an actual experience; but within and beneath runs a stream of
          allegory not less consistent and hardly less continuous than the
          narrative itself.” A. H. Strong, The Great Poets and their Theology,
          116—“Dante himself has told us that there are four separate senses
          which he intends his story to convey. There are the literal, the
          allegorical, the moral, and the anagogical. In Psa_114:1 we have the
          words, ‘When Israel went forth out of Egypt.’ This, says the poet, may
          be taken literally, of the actual deliverance of God’s ancient people;
          or allegorically, of the redemption of the world through Christ; or
          morally, of the rescue of the sinner from the bondage of his sin; or
          anagogically, of the passage of both soul and body from the lower life
          of earth to the higher life of heaven. So from Scripture Dante
          illustrates the method of his poem.” See further, our treatment of
          Eschatology. See also Dr. Arnold of Rugby, Sermons on the
          Interpretation of Scripture, Appendix A, pages 441–454; Aids to Faith,
          449–462; Smith’s Bible Dict., 4:2727. Per contra, see Elliott, Horæ
          Apocalypticæ, 4:662. Gardiner, O. T. and N. T., 262–274, denies double
          sense, but affirms manifold applications of a single sense. Broadus,
          on Mat_24:1, denies double sense, but affirms the use of types.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The prophet was not always aware of the meaning of his own
          prophecies (1Pe_1:11). It is enough to constitute his prophecies a
          proof of divine revelation, if it can be shown that the
          correspondences between them and the actual events are such as to
          indicate divine wisdom and purpose in the giving of them—in other
          words, it is enough if the inspiring Spirit knew their meaning, even
          though the inspired prophet did not.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not inconsistent with this view, but rather confirms it, that
          the near event, and not the distant fulfilment, was often chiefly, if
          not exclusively, in the mind of the prophet when he wrote. Scripture
          declares that the prophets did not always understand their own
          predictions: 1Pe_1:11—“searching what time or what manner of time the
          Spirit of Christ which was in them did point onto, when it testified
          beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should
          follow them.” Emerson: “Himself from God he could not free; He builded
          better than he knew.” Keble: “As little children lisp and tell of
          heaven. So thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards were
          given.” Westcott: Preface to Com. on Hebrews, vi—“No one would limit
          the teaching of a poet’s words to that which was definitely present to
          his mind. Still less can we suppose that he who is inspired to give a
          message of God to all ages sees himself the completeness of the truth
          which all life serves to illuminate.” Alexander McLaren: “Peter
          teaches that Jewish prophets foretold the events of Christ’s life and
          especially his sufferings; that they did so as organs of God’s Spirit;
          that they were so completely organs of a higher voice that they did
          not understand the significance of their own words, but were wiser
          than they knew and had to search what were the date and the
          characteristics of the strange things which they foretold; and that by
          further revelation they learned that’ the vision is yet for many days’
          (Isa_24:22; Dan_10:14). If Peter was right in his conception of the
          nature of Messianic prophecy, a good many learned men of to-day are
          wrong.” Matthew Arnold, Literature and Dogma: “Might not the prophetic
          ideals be poetic dreams, and the correspondence between them and the
          life of Jesus, so far as real, only a curious historical phenomenon?”
          Bruce, Apologetics, 359, replies: “Such scepticism is possible only to
          those who have no faith in a living God who works out purposes in
          history.” It is comparable only to the unbelief of the materialist who
          regards the physical constitution of the universe as explicable by the
          fortuitous concourse of atoms.

          8. Purpose of Prophecy—so far as it is yet unfulfilled. (a) Not to
          enable us to map out the details of the future; but rather (b) To give
          general assurance of God’s power and foreseeing wisdom, and of the
          certainty of his triumph; and (c) To furnish, after fulfilment, the
          proof that God saw the end from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dan_12:8-9—“And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, O my Lord,
          what shall be the issue of these things? And he said, Go thy way,
          Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the
          end”; 2Pe_1:19—prophecy is “a lamp shining in a dark place, until the
          day dawn”—not until day dawns can distant objects be seen; 20—“no
          prophency of scripture is of private interpretation”—only God, by the
          event, can interpret it. Sir Isaac Newton: “God gave the prophecies,
          not to gratify men’s curiosity by enabling them to foreknow things,
          but that after they were fulfilled they might be interpreted by the
          event, and his own providence, not the interpreter’s, be thereby
          manifested to the world.” Alexander McLaren: “Great tracts of
          Scripture are dark to us till life explains them, and then they come
          on us with the force of a new revelation, like the messages which of
          old were sent by a strip of parchment coiled upon a bâton and then
          written upon, and which were unintelligible unless the receiver had a
          corresponding bâton to wrap them round.” A. H. Strong, The Great Poets
          and their Theology, 23—“Archilochus, a poet of about 700 b.c., speaks
          of ‘a grievous scytale’—the scytale being the staff on which a strip
          of leather for writing purposes was rolled slantwise, so that the
          message inscribed upon the strip could not be read until the leather
          was rolled again upon another staff of the same size; since only the
          writer and the receiver possessed staves of the proper size, the
          scytale answered all the ends of a message in cypher.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Prophecy is like the German sentence,—it can be understood only when
          we have read its last word. A. J. Gordon, Ministry of the Spirit,
          48—“God’s providence is like the Hebrew Bible; we must begin at the
          end and read backward, in order to understand it.” Yet Dr. Gordon
          seems to assert that such understanding is possible even before
          fulfilment: “Christ did not know the day of the end when here in his
          state of humilation; but he does know now. He has shown his knowledge
          in the Apocalypse, and we have received ‘The Revelation of Jesus
          Christ, which God gave him to show unto his servants, even the things
          which must shortly come to pass’ (Rev_1:1).” A study however of the
          multitudinous and conflicting views of the so-called interpreters of
          prophecy leads us to prefer to Dr. Gordon’s view that of Briggs,
          Messianic Prophecies, 49—“The first advent is the resolver of all Old
          Testament prophecy; … the second advent will give the key to New
          Testament prophecy. It is ‘the Lamb that hath been slain’ (Rev_5:12) …
          who alone opens the sealed book, solves the riddles of time, and
          resolves the symbols of prophecy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nitzsch: “It is the essential condition of prophecy that it should not
          disturb man’s relation to history.” In so far as this is forgotten,
          and it is falsely assumed that the purpose of prophecy is to enable us
          to map out the precise events of the future before they occur, the
          study of prophecy ministers to a diseased imagination and diverts
          attention from practical Christian duty. Calvin: “Aut insanum inveniet
          aut faciet”; or, as Lord Brougham translated it: “The study of
          prophecy either finds a man crazy, or it leaves him so.” Second
          Adventists do not often seek conversions. Dr. Cumming warned the women
          of his flock that they must not study prophecy so much as to neglect
          their household duties. Paul has such in mind in 2Th_2:1-2—“touching
          the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ … that ye be not quickly shaken
          from your mind … as that the day of the Lord is just at hand”;
          2Th_3:11—“For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly.”
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Evidential force of Prophecy—so far as it is fulfilled. Prophecy,
          like miracles, does not stand alone as evidence of the divine
          commission of the Scripture writers and teachers. It is simply a
          corroborative attestation, which unites with miracles to prove that a
          religious teacher has come from God and speaks with divine authority.
          We cannot, however, dispense with this portion of the evidences,—for
          unless the death and resurrection of Christ are events foreknown and
          foretold by himself, as well as by the ancient prophets, we lose one
          main proof of his authority as a teacher sent from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stearns, Evidence of Christian Experience, 338—“The Christian’s own
          life is the progressive fulfilment of the prophecy that whoever
          accepts Christ’s grace shall be born again, sanctified, and saved.
          Hence the Christian can believe in God’s power to predict, and in
          God’s actual predictions.” See Stanley Leathes, O. T. Prophecy,
          xvii—“Unless we have access to the supernatural, we have no access to
          God.” In our discussions of prophecy, we are to remember that before
          making the truth of Christianity stand or fall with any particular
          passage that has been regarded as prediction, we must be certain that
          the passage is meant as prediction, and not as merely figurative
          description. Gladden, Seven Puzzling Bible Books, 195—“The book of
          Daniel is not a prophecy,—it is an apocalypse.…The author [of such
          books] puts his words into the mouth of some historical or traditional
          writer of eminence. Such are the Book of Enoch, the Assumption of
          Moses, Bar_1:1-21 and 2 Esdras, and the Sibylline Oracles. Enigmatic
          form indicates persons without naming them, and historic events as
          animal forms or as operations of nature.…The book of Daniel is not
          intended to teach us history. It does not look forward from the sixth
          century before Christ, but backward from the second century before
          Christ. It is a kind of story which the Jews called Haggada. It is
          aimed at Antiochus Epiphanes, who, from his occasional fits of
          melancholy, was called Epimanes, or Antiochus the Mad.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever may be our conclusion as to the authorship of the book of
          Daniel, we must recognize in it an element of prediction which has
          been actually fulfilled. The most radical interpreters do not place
          its date later than 163 b.c. Our Lord sees in the book clear reference
          to himself (Mat_26:64—“the Son of man, sitting at the right hand of
          Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven”; cf. Dan_7:13); and he
          repeats with emphasis certain predictions of the prophet which were
          yet unfulfilled (Mat_24:15—“When ye see the abomination of desolation,
          which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet”; cf. Dan_9:27;
          Dan_11:31; Dan_12:11). The book of Daniel must therefore be counted
          profitable not only for its moral and spiritual lessons, but also for
          its actual predictions of Christ and of the universal triumph of his
          kingdom (Dan_2:45—“a stone cut out of the mountain without hands”).

          Bible. On the general subject see Annotated Paragraph Bible, Introd.

        <p>
          Having thus removed the presumption originally existing against
          miracles and prophecy, we may now consider the ordinary laws of
          evidence and determine the rules to be followed in estimating the
          weight of the Scripture testimony.
