        <h2>V. Relation of Theology to Religion.</h2>
        <p>
          Theology and religion are related to each other as effects, in
          different spheres, of the same cause. As theology is an effect
          produced in the sphere of systematic thought by the facts respecting
          God and the universe, so religion is an effect which these same facts
          produce in the sphere of individual and collective life. With regard
          to the term “religion”, notice:
        </p>
        <p>1. Derivation.</p>
        <p>
          (a) The derivation from religāre, “to bind back” (man to God), is
          negatived by the authority of Cicero and of the best modern
          etymologists; by the difficulty, on this hypothesis, of explaining
          such forms as religio, religens; and by the necessity, in that case,
          of presupposing a fuller [pg 020]knowledge of sin and redemption than
          was common to the ancient world.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The more correct derivation is from relegĕre, “to go over again,”
          “carefully to ponder.” Its original meaning is therefore “reverent
          observance” (of duties due to the gods).
        </p>
        <p>
          For advocacy of the derivation of religio, as meaning “binding duty,”
          from religāre, see Lange, Dogmatik, 1:185-196. This derivation was
          first proposed by Lactantius, Inst. Div., 4:28, a Christian writer. To
          meet the objection that the form religio seems derived from a verb of
          the third conjugation, Lange cites rebellio, from rebellāre, and
          optio, from optāre. But we reply that these verbs of the first
          conjugation, like many others, are probably derived from obsolete
          verbs of the third conjugation. For the derivation favored in the
          text, see Curtius, Griechische Etymologie, 5te Aufl., 364; Fick,
          Vergl. Wörterb. der indoger. Spr., 2:227; Vanicek, Gr.-Lat. Etym.
          Wörterb., 2:829; Andrews, Latin Lexicon, in voce; Nitzsch, System of
          Christ. Doctrine, 7; Van Oosterzee, Dogmatics, 75-77; Philippi,
          Glaubenslehre, 1:6; Kahnis, Dogmatik, 3:18; Menzies, History of
          Religion, 11; Max Müller, Natural Religion, lect. 2.
        </p>
        <p>2. False Conceptions.</p>
        <p>
          (a) Religion is not, as Hegel declared, a kind of knowing; for it
          would then be only an incomplete form of philosophy, and the measure
          of knowledge in each case would be the measure of piety.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a system of idealistic pantheism, like that of Hegel, God is the
          subject of religion as well as its object. Religion is God&#x27;s
          knowing of himself through the human consciousness. Hegel did not
          utterly ignore other elements in religion. “Feeling, intuition, and
          faith belong to it,” he said, “and mere cognition is one-sided.” Yet
          he was always looking for the movement of thought in all forms of
          life; God and the universe were but developments of the primordial
          idea. “What knowledge is worth knowing,”he asked, “if God is
          unknowable? To know God is eternal life, and thinking is also true
          worship.” Hegel&#x27;s error was in regarding life as a process of
          thought, rather than in regarding thought as a process of life. Here
          was the reason for the bitterness between Hegel and Schleiermacher.
          Hegel rightly considered that feeling must become intelligent before
          it is truly religious, but he did not recognize the supreme importance
          of love in a theological system. He gave even less place to the will
          than he gave to the emotions, and he failed to see that the knowledge
          of God of which Scripture speaks is a knowing, not of the intellect
          alone, but of the whole man, including the affectional and voluntary
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goethe: “How can a man come to know himself? Never by thinking, but by
          doing. Try to do your duty, and you will know at once what you are
          worth. You cannot play the flute by blowing alone,—you must use your
          fingers.” So we can never come to know God by thinking alone. John
          7:17—“If any man willeth to do his will, he will know of the teaching,
          whether it is of God.” The Gnostics, Stapfer, Henry VIII, all show
          that there may be much theological knowledge without true religion.
          Chillingworth&#x27;s maxim, “The Bible only, the religion of
          Protestants,” is inadequate and inaccurate; for the Bible, without
          faith, love, and obedience, may become a fetich and a snare: John
          5:39,40—“Ye search the Scriptures, ... and ye will not come to me,
          that ye may have life.” See Sterrett, Studies in Hegel&#x27;s
          Philosophy of Religion; Porter, Human Intellect, 59, 60, 412, 525-536,
          589, 650; Morell, Hist. Philos., 476, 477; Hamerton, Intel. Life, 214;
          Bib. Sac., 9:374.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Religion is not, as Schleiermacher held, the mere feeling of
          dependence; for such feeling of dependence is not religious, unless
          exercised toward God and accompanied by moral effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          In German theology, Schleiermacher constitutes the transition from the
          old rationalism to the evangelical faith. “Like Lazarus, with the
          grave clothes of a pantheistic philosophy entangling his steps,” yet
          with a Moravian experience of the life of God in the soul, he based
          religion upon the inner certainties of Christian feeling. But, as
          Principal Fairbairn remarks, “Emotion is impotent unless it speaks out
          of conviction; and where conviction is, there will be emotion which is
          potent to persuade.” If Christianity is religious feeling alone, then
          there is no essential difference between it and other religions, for
          all alike are products of the religious sentiment. But Christianity is
          distinguished from other religions by its peculiar religious
          conceptions. Doctrine precedes [pg 021]life, and Christian doctrine,
          not mere religious feeling, is the cause of Christianity as a
          distinctive religion. Though faith begins in feeling, moreover, it
          does not end there. We see the worthlessness of mere feeling in the
          transient emotions of theatre-goers, and in the occasional phenomena
          of revivals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sabatier, Philos. Relig., 27, adds to Schleiermacher&#x27;s passive
          element of dependence, the active element of prayer. Kaftan, Dogmatik,
          10—“Schleiermacher regards God as the Source of our being, but forgets
          that he is also our End.” Fellowship and progress are as important
          elements in religion as is dependence; and fellowship must come before
          progress—such fellowship as presupposes pardon and life.
          Schleiermacher apparently believed in neither a personal God nor his
          own personal immortality; see his Life and Letters, 2:77-90;
          Martineau, Study of Religion, 2:357. Charles Hodge compares him to a
          ladder in a pit—a good thing for those who wish to get out, but not
          for those who wish to get in. Dorner: “The Moravian brotherhood was
          his mother; Greece was his nurse.” On Schleiermacher, see Herzog,
          Realencyclopädie, in voce; Bib. Sac., 1852:375; 1883:534; Liddon,
          Elements of Religion, lect. I; Ebrard, Dogmatik, 1:14; Julius Müller,
          Doctrine of Sin, 1:175; Fisher, Supernat. Origin of Christianity,
          563-570; Caird, Philos. Religion, 160-186.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Religion is not, as Kant maintained, morality or moral action; for
          morality is conformity to an abstract law of right, while religion is
          essentially a relation to a person, from whom the soul receives
          blessing and to whom it surrenders itself in love and obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kant, Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, Beschluss: “I know of but two
          beautiful things, the starry heavens above my head, and the sense of
          duty within my heart.”But the mere sense of duty often distresses. We
          object to the word “obey” as the imperative of religion, because (1)
          it makes religion a matter of the will only; (2) will presupposes
          affection; (3) love is not subject to will; (4) it makes God all law,
          and no grace; (5) it makes the Christian a servant only, not a friend;
          cf. John 15:15—“No longer do I call you servants ... but I have called
          you friends”—a relation not of service but of love (Westcott, Bib.
          Com., in loco). The voice that speaks is the voice of love, rather
          than the voice of law. We object also to Matthew Arnold&#x27;s
          definition: “Religion is ethics heightened, enkindled, lit up by
          feeling; morality touched with emotion.” This leaves out of view the
          receptive element in religion, as well as its relation to a personal
          God. A truer statement would be that religion is morality toward God,
          as morality is religion toward man. Bowne, Philos. of Theism,
          251—“Morality that goes beyond mere conscientiousness must have
          recourse to religion”; see Lotze, Philos. of Religion, 128-142.
          Goethe: “Unqualified activity, of whatever kind, leads at last to
          bankruptcy”; see also Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:65-69; Shedd,
          Sermons to the Natural Man, 244-246; Liddon, Elements of Religion, 19.
        </p>
        <p>3. Essential Idea.</p>
        <p>
          Religion in its essential idea is a life in God, a life lived in
          recognition of God, in communion with God, and under control of the
          indwelling Spirit of God. Since it is a life, it cannot be described
          as consisting solely in the exercise of any one of the powers of
          intellect, affection, or will. As physical life involves the unity and
          coöperation of all the organs of the body, so religion, or spiritual
          life, involves the united working of all the powers of the soul. To
          feeling, however, we must assign the logical priority, since holy
          affection toward God, imparted in regeneration, is the condition of
          truly knowing God and of truly serving him.
        </p>

          See Godet, on the Ultimate Design of Man—“God in man, and man in
          God”—in Princeton Rev., Nov. 1880; Pfleiderer, Die Religion, 5-79, and
          Religionsphilosophie, 255—Religion is “Sache des ganzen
          Geisteslebens”: Crane, Religion of To-morrow, 4—“Religion is the
          personal influence of the immanent God”; Sterrett, Reason and
          Authority in Religion, 31, 32—“Religion is the reciprocal relation or
          communion of God and man, involving (1) revelation, (2) faith”; Dr. J.
          W. A. Stewart: “Religion is fellowship with God”; Pascal: “Piety is
          God sensible to the heart”; Ritschl, Justif. and Reconcil.,
          13—“Christianity is an ellipse with two foci—Christ as Redeemer and
          Christ as King, Christ for us and Christ in us, redemption and
          morality, religion and ethics”; Kaftan, Dogmatik, 8—“The Christian
          religion is (1) the kingdom of God as a goal above the [pg 022]world,
          to be attained by moral development here, and (2) reconciliation with
          God permitting attainment of this goal in spite of our sins. Christian
          theology once grounded itself in man&#x27;s natural knowledge of God;
          we now start with religion, i. e., that Christian knowledge of God
          which we call faith.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Herbert Spencer: “Religion is an a priori theory of the universe”;
          Romanes, Thoughts on Religion, 43, adds: “which assumes intelligent
          personality as the originating cause of the universe, science dealing
          with the How, the phenomenal process, religion dealing with the Who,
          the intelligent Personality who works through the process.” Holland,
          in Lux Mundi, 27—“Natural life is the life in God which has not yet
          arrived at this recognition”—the recognition of the fact that God is
          in all things—“it is not yet, as such, religious; ... Religion is the
          discovery, by the son, of a Father who is in all his works, yet is
          distinct from them all.” Dewey, Psychology, 283—“Feeling finds its
          absolutely universal expression in religious emotion, which is the
          finding or realization of self in a completely realized personality
          which unites in itself truth, or the complete unity of the relations
          of all objects, beauty or the complete unity of all ideal values, and
          rightness or the complete unity of all persons. The emotion which
          accompanies the religious life is that which accompanies the complete
          activity of ourselves; the self is realized and finds its true life in
          God.” Upton, Hibbert Lectures, 262—“Ethics is simply the growing
          insight into, and the effort to actualize in society, the sense of
          fundamental kinship and identity of substance in all men; while
          religion is the emotion and the devotion which attend the realization
          in our self-consciousness of an inmost spiritual relationship arising
          out of that unity of substance which constitutes man the true son of
          the eternal Father.” See Van Oosterzee, Dogmatics, 81-85; Julius
          Müller, Doct. Sin, 2:227; Nitzsch, Syst. of Christ. Doct., 10-28;
          Luthardt, Fund. Truths, 147; Twesten, Dogmatik, 1:12.
        </p>
        <p>4. Inferences.</p>
        <p>From this definition of religion it follows:</p>
        <p>
          (a) That in strictness there is but one religion. Man is a religious
          being, indeed, as having the capacity for this divine life. He is
          actually religious, however, only when he enters into this living
          relation to God. False religions are the caricatures which men given
          to sin, or the imaginations which men groping after light, form of
          this life of the soul in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peabody, Christianity the Religion of Nature, 18—“If Christianity be
          true, it is not areligion, but the religion. If Judaism be also true,
          it is so not as distinct from but as coincident with Christianity, the
          one religion to which it can bear only the relation of a part to the
          whole. If there be portions of truth in other religious systems, they
          are not portions of other religions, but portions of the one religion
          which somehow or other became incorporated with fables and falsities.”
          John Caird, Fund. Ideas of Christianity, 1:25—“You can never get at
          the true idea or essence of religion merely by trying to find out
          something that is common to all religions; and it is not the lower
          religions that explain the higher, but conversely the higher religion
          explains all the lower religions.” George P. Fisher: “The recognition
          of certain elements of truth in the ethnic religions does not mean
          that Christianity has defects which are to be repaired by borrowing
          from them; it only means that the ethnic faiths have in fragments what
          Christianity has as a whole. Comparative religion does not bring to
          Christianity new truth; it provides illustrations of how Christian
          truth meets human needs and aspirations, and gives a full vision of
          that which the most spiritual and gifted among the heathen only dimly
          discerned.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. C. H. Parkhurst, sermon on Proverbs 20:27—“The spirit of man is
          the lamp of Jehovah”—“a lamp, but not necessarily lighted; a lamp that
          can be lit only by the touch of a divine flame”—man has naturally and
          universally a capacity for religion, but is by no means naturally and
          universally religious. All false religions have some element of truth;
          otherwise they could never have gained or kept their hold upon
          mankind. We need to recognize these elements of truth in dealing with
          them. There is some silver in a counterfeit dollar, else it would
          deceive no one; but the thin washing of silver over the lead does not
          prevent it from being bad money. Clarke, Christian Theology, 8—“See
          Paul&#x27;s methods of dealing with heathen religion, in Acts 14 with
          gross paganism and in Acts 17 with its cultured form. He treats it
          with sympathy and justice. Christian theology has the advantage of
          walking in the light of God&#x27;s self-manifestation in Christ, while
          heathen [pg 023]religions grope after God and worship him in
          ignorance”; cf. Acts 14:16—“We ... bring you good tidings, that ye
          should turn from these vain things unto a living God”; 17:22—“I
          perceive that ye are more than usually reverent toward the
          divinities.... What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set
          forth unto you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthew Arnold: “Children of men! the unseen Power whose eye Forever
          doth accompany mankind, Hath looked on no religion scornfully That man
          did ever find. Which has not taught weak wills how much they can?
          Which has not fallen on the dry heart like rain? Which has not cried
          to sunk, self-weary man, Thou must be born again?” Christianity is
          absolutely exclusive, because it is absolutely inclusive. It is not an
          amalgamation of other religions, but it has in it all that is best and
          truest in other religions. It is the white light that contains all the
          colored rays. God may have made disclosures of truth outside of
          Judaism, and did so in Balaam and Melchisedek, in Confucius and
          Socrates. But while other religions have a relative excellence,
          Christianity is the absolute religion that contains all excellencies.
          Matheson, Messages of the Old Religions, 328-342—“Christianity is
          reconciliation. Christianity includes the aspiration of Egypt; it
          sees, in this aspiration, God in the soul (Brahmanism); recognizes the
          evil power of sin with Parseeism; goes back to a pure beginning like
          China; surrenders itself to human brotherhood like Buddha; gets all
          things from within like Judaism; makes the present life beautiful like
          Greece; seeks a universal kingdom like Rome; shows a growth of divine
          life, like the Teuton. Christianity is the manifold wisdom of God.”
          See also Van Oosterzee, Dogmatics, 88-93. Shakespeare: “There is some
          soul of goodness in things evil, Would men observingly distill it out”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) That the content of religion is greater than that of theology. The
          facts of religion come within the range of theology only so far as
          they can be definitely conceived, accurately expressed in language,
          and brought into rational relation to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          This principle enables us to define the proper limits of religious
          fellowship. It should be as wide as is religion itself. But it is
          important to remember what religion is. Religion is not to be
          identified with the capacity for religion. Nor can we regard the
          perversions and caricatures of religion as meriting our fellowship.
          Otherwise we might be required to have fellowship with devil-worship,
          polygamy, thuggery, and the inquisition; for all these have been
          dignified with the name of religion. True religion involves some
          knowledge, however rudimentary, of the true God, the God of
          righteousness; some sense of sin as the contrast between human
          character and the divine standard; some casting of the soul upon
          divine mercy and a divine way of salvation, in place of self-righteous
          earning of merit and reliance upon one&#x27;s works and one&#x27;s
          record; some practical effort to realize ethical principle in a pure
          life and in influence over others. Wherever these marks of true
          religion appear, even in Unitarians, Romanists, Jews or Buddhists,
          there we recognize the demand for fellowship. But we also attribute
          these germs of true religion to the inworking of the omnipresent
          Christ, “the light which lighteth every man” (John 1:9), and we see in
          them incipient repentance and faith, even though the Christ who is
          their object is yet unknown by name. Christian fellowship must have a
          larger basis in accepted Christian truth, and Church fellowship a
          still larger basis in common acknowledgment of N. T. teaching as to
          the church. Religiousfellowship, in the widest sense, rests upon the
          fact that “God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that
          feareth him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to him” (Acts
          10:34, 35).

          (c) That religion is to be distinguished from formal worship, which is
          simply the outward expression of religion. As such expression, worship
          is “formal communion between God and his people.” In it God speaks to
          man, and man to God. It therefore properly includes the reading of
          Scripture and preaching on the side of God, and prayer and song on the
          side of the people.

          Sterrett, Reason and Authority in Religion, 166—“Christian worship is
          the utterance (outerance) of the spirit.” But there is more in true
          love than can be put into a love-letter, and there is more in true
          religion than can be expressed either in theology or in worship.
          Christian worship is communion between God and man. But communion
          cannot be one-sided. Madame de Staël, whom Heine called “a whirlwind
          in petticoats,” [pg 024]ended one of her brilliant soliloquies by
          saying: “What a delightful conversation we have had!” We may find a
          better illustration of the nature of worship in Thomas à Kempis&#x27;s
          dialogues between the saint and his Savior, in the Imitation of
          Christ. Goethe: “Against the great superiority of another there is no
          remedy but love.... To praise a man is to put one&#x27;s self on his
          level.” If this be the effect of loving and praising man, what must be
          the effect of loving and praising God! Inscription in Grasmere Church:
          “Whoever thou art that enterest this church, leave it not without one
          prayer to God for thyself, for those who minister, and for those who
          worship here.”In James 1:27—“Pure religion and undefiled before our
          God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their
          affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world”—“religion,”
          θρησκεία, is cultus exterior; and the meaning is that “the external
          service, the outward garb, the very ritual of Christianity, is a life
          of purity, love and self-devotion. What its true essence, its inmost
          spirit may be, the writer does not say, but leaves this to be
          inferred.” On the relation between religion and worship, see Prof.
          Day, in New Englander, Jan. 1882; Prof. T. Harwood Pattison, Public
          Prayer; Trench, Syn. N. T., 1; sec. 48; Coleridge, Aids to Reflection,
          Introd., Aphorism 23; Lightfoot, Gal., 351, note 2.
