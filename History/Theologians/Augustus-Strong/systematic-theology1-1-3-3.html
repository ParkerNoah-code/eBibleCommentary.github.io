        <h2>3. God&#x27;s revelation of himself to man.</h2>
        <p>
          In God&#x27;s actual revelation of himself and certain of these
          relations.—As we do not in this place attempt a positive proof of
          God&#x27;s existence or of man&#x27;s capacity for the knowledge of
          God, so we do not now attempt to prove that God has brought himself
          into contact with man&#x27;s mind by revelation. We shall consider the
          grounds of this belief hereafter. Our aim at present is simply to show
          that, granting the fact of revelation, a scientific theology is
          possible. This has been denied upon the following grounds:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. That revelation, as a making known, is necessarily internal and
          subjective—either a mode of intelligence, or a quickening of
          man&#x27;s cognitive powers—and hence can furnish no objective facts
          such as constitute the proper material for science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morell, Philos. Religion, 128-131, 143—“The Bible cannot in strict
          accuracy of language be called a revelation, since a revelation always
          implies an actual process of intelligence in a living mind.” F. W.
          Newman, Phases of Faith, 152—“Of our moral and spiritual God we know
          nothing without—everything within.” Theodore Parker: “Verbal
          revelation can never communicate a simple idea like that of God,
          Justice, Love, Religion”; see review of Parker in Bib. Sac., 18:24-27.
          James Martineau, Seat of Authority in Religion: “As many minds as
          there are that know God at first hand, so many revealing acts there
          have been, and as many as know him at second hand are strangers to
          revelation”; so, assuming external revelation to be impossible,
          Martineau subjects all the proofs of such revelation to unfair
          destructive criticism. Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:185—“As all
          revelation is originally an inner living experience, the springing up
          of religious truth in the heart, no external event can belong in
          itself to revelation, no matter whether it be naturally or
          supernaturally brought about.”Professor George M. Forbes: “Nothing can
          be revealed to us which we do not grasp with our reason. It follows
          that, so far as reason acts normally, it is a part of
          revelation.”Ritchie, Darwin and Hegel, 30—“The revelation of God is
          the growth of the idea of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In reply to this objection, urged mainly by idealists in philosophy,
          (a) We grant that revelation, to be effective, must be the means of
          inducing a new mode of intelligence, or in other words, must be
          understood. We grant that this understanding of divine things is
          impossible without a quickening of man&#x27;s cognitive powers. We
          grant, moreover, that revelation, when originally imparted, was often
          internal and subjective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matheson, Moments on the Mount, 51-53, on Gal. 1:16—“to reveal his Son
          in me”: “The revelation on the way to Damascus would not have
          enlightened Paul, had it been merely a vision to his eye. Nothing can
          be revealed to us which has not been revealed in us. The eye does not
          see the beauty of the landscape, nor the ear hear the beauty of music.
          So flesh and blood do not reveal Christ to us. Without the teaching of
          the Spirit, the external facts will be only like the letters of a book
          to a child that cannot read.” We may say with Channing: “I am more
          sure that my rational nature is from God, than that any book is the
          expression of his will.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) But we deny that external revelation is therefore useless or
          impossible. Even if religious ideas sprang wholly from within, an
          external revelation might stir up the dormant powers of the mind.
          Religious ideas, however, do not spring wholly from within. External
          revelation can impart them. Man can reveal himself to man by external
          communications, and, if God has equal power with man, God can reveal
          himself to man in like manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rogers, in his Eclipse of Faith, asks pointedly: “If Messrs. Morell
          and Newman can teach by a book, cannot God do the same?” Lotze,
          Microcosmos, 2:660 (book 9, chap. 4), speaks of revelation as “either
          contained in some divine act of historic occurrence, or continually
          repeated in men&#x27;s hearts.” But in fact there is no alternative
          here; the strength of the Christian creed is that God&#x27;s
          revelation is both external and internal; see Gore, in Lux Mundi, 338.
          Rainy, in Critical Review, 1:1-21, well says that Martineau
          unwarrantably isolates the witness of God to the individual soul. The
          inward needs to be combined with the outward, in order to make sure
          that it is not a vagary of the imagination. We need to distinguish
          God&#x27;s revelations from our own fancies. Hence, before giving the
          internal, God commonly gives us the external, as a standard by which
          to try our impressions. We are finite and sinful, and we need
          authority. The external revelation commends itself as authoritative to
          the heart which recognizes its own spiritual needs. External authority
          evokes the inward witness and gives added clearness to it, but only
          historical revelation furnishes indubitable proof that God is love,
          and gives us assurance that our longings after God are not in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Hence God&#x27;s revelation may be, and, as we shall hereafter
          see, it is, in great part, an external revelation in works and words.
          The universe is a revelation of God; God&#x27;s works in nature
          precede God&#x27;s words in history. We claim, moreover, that, in many
          cases where truth was originally communicated internally, the same
          Spirit who communicated it has brought about an external record of it,
          so that the internal revelation might be handed down to others than
          those who first received it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must not limit revelation to the Scriptures. The eternal Word
          antedated the written word, and through the eternal Word God is made
          known in nature and in history. Internal revelation is preceded by,
          and conditioned upon, external revelation. In point of time earth
          comes before man, and sensation before perception. Action best
          expresses character, and historic revelation is more by deeds than by
          words. Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theol., 1:231-264—“The Word is not in the
          Scriptures alone. The whole creation reveals the Word. In nature God
          shows his power; in incarnation his grace and truth. Scripture
          testifies of these, but Scripture is not the essential Word. The
          Scripture is truly apprehended and appropriated when in it and through
          it we see the living and present Christ. It does not bind men to
          itself alone, but it points them to the Christ of whom it testifies.
          Christ is the authority. In the Scriptures he points us to himself and
          demands our faith in him. This faith, once begotten, leads us to new
          appropriation of Scripture, but also to new criticism of Scripture. We
          find Christ more and more in Scripture, and yet we judge Scripture
          more and more by the standard which we find in Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Newman Smyth, Christian Ethics, 71-82: “There is but one
          authority—Christ. His Spirit works in many ways, but chiefly in two:
          first, the inspiration of the Scriptures, and, secondly, the leading
          of the church into the truth. The latter is not to be isolated or
          separated from the former. Scripture is law to the Christian
          consciousness, and Christian consciousness in time becomes law to the
          Scripture—interpreting, criticizing, verifying it. The word and the
          spirit answer to each other. Scripture and faith are coördinate.
          Protestantism has exaggerated the first; Romanism the second.
          Martineau fails to grasp the coördination of Scripture and faith.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) With this external record we shall also see that there is given
          under proper conditions a special influence of God&#x27;s Spirit, so
          to quicken our cognitive powers that the external record reproduces in
          our minds the ideas with which the minds of the writers were at first
          divinely filled.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may illustrate the need of internal revelation from Egyptology,
          which is impossible so long as the external revelation in the
          hieroglyphics is uninterpreted; from the ticking of the clock in a
          dark room, where only the lit candle enables us to tell the time; from
          the landscape spread out around the Rigi in Switzerland, invisible
          until the first rays of the sun touch the snowy mountain peaks.
          External revelation (φανέρωσις, Rom. 1:19, 20) must be supplemented by
          internal revelation (ἀποκάλυψις, 1 Cor. 2:10, 12). Christ is the organ
          of external, the Holy Spirit the organ of internal, revelation. In
          Christ (2 Cor. 1:20) are “the yea” and “the Amen”—the objective
          certainty and the subjective certitude, the reality and the
          realization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objective certainty must become subjective certitude in order to be a
          scientific theology. Before conversion we have the first, the external
          truth of Christ; only at conversion and after conversion do we have
          the second, “Christ formed in us” (Gal. 4:19). We have objective
          revelation at Sinai (Ex. 20:22); subjective revelation in
          Elisha&#x27;s knowledge of Gehazi (2 K. 5:26). James Russell Lowell,
          Winter Evening Hymn to my Fire: “Therefore with thee I love to read
          Our brave old poets: at thy touch how stirs Life in the withered
          words! how swift recede Time&#x27;s shadows! and how glows again
          Through its dead mass the incandescent verse, As when upon the anvil
          of the brain It glittering lay, cyclopically wrought By the fast
          throbbing hammers of the poet&#x27;s thought!”
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) Internal revelations thus recorded, and external revelations thus
          interpreted, both furnish objective facts which may serve as proper
          material for science. Although revelation in its widest sense may
          include, and as constituting the ground of the possibility of theology
          does include, both insight and illumination, it may also be used to
          denote simply a provision of the external means of knowledge, and
          theology has to do with inward revelations only as they are expressed
          in, or as they agree with, this objective standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have here suggested the vast scope and yet the insuperable
          limitations of theology. So far as God is revealed, whether in nature,
          history, conscience, or Scripture, theology may find material for its
          structure. Since Christ is not simply the incarnate Son of God but
          also the eternal Word, the only Revealer of God, there is no theology
          apart from Christ, and all theology is Christian theology. Nature and
          history are but the dimmer and more general disclosures of the divine
          Being, of which the Cross is the culmination and the key. God does not
          intentionally conceal himself. He wishes to be known. He reveals
          himself at all times just as fully as the capacity of his creatures
          will permit. The infantile intellect cannot understand God&#x27;s
          boundlessness, nor can the perverse disposition understand God&#x27;s
          disinterested affection. Yet all truth is in Christ and is open to
          discovery by the prepared mind and heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Infinite One, so far as he is unrevealed, is certainly unknowable
          to the finite. But the Infinite One, so far as he manifests himself,
          is knowable. This suggests the meaning of the declarations: John
          1:18—“No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is
          in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him”; 14:9—“he that hath
          seen me hath seen the Father”; 1 Tim. 6:16—“whom no man hath seen, nor
          can see.” We therefore approve of the definition of Kaftan, Dogmatik,
          1—“Dogmatics is the science of the Christian truth which is believed
          and acknowledged in the church upon the ground of the divine
          revelation”—in so far as it limits the scope of theology to truth
          revealed by God and apprehended by faith. But theology presupposes
          both God&#x27;s external and God&#x27;s internal revelations, and
          these, as we shall see, include nature, history, conscience and
          Scripture. On the whole subject, see Kahnis, Dogmatik, 3:37-43;
          Nitzsch, System Christ. Doct., 72; Luthardt, Fund. Truths, 193;
          Auberlen, Div. Rev., Introd., 29; Martineau, Essays, 1:171, 280; Bib.
          Sac., 1867:593, and 1872:428; Porter, Human Intellect, 373-375; C. M.
          Mead, in Boston Lectures, 1871:58.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. That many of the truths thus revealed are too indefinite to
          constitute the material for science, because they belong to the region
          of the feelings, because they are beyond our full understanding, or
          because they are destitute of orderly arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>We reply:</p>
        <p>
          (a) Theology has to do with subjective feelings only as they can be
          defined, and shown to be effects of objective truth upon the mind.
          They are not more obscure than are the facts of morals or of
          psychology, and the same objection which would exclude such feelings
          from theology would make these latter sciences impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Jacobi and Schleiermacher, who regard theology as a mere account
          of devout Christian feelings, the grounding of which in objective
          historical facts is a matter of comparative indifference (Hagenbach,
          Hist. Doctrine, 2:401-403). Schleiermacher therefore called his system
          of theology “Der Christliche Glaube,” and many since his time have
          called their systems by the name of “Glaubenslehre.” Ritschl&#x27;s
          “value-judgments,”in like manner, render theology a merely subjective
          science, if any subjective science is possible. Kaftan improves upon
          Ritschl, by granting that we know, not only Christian feelings, but
          also Christian facts. Theology is the science of God, and not simply
          the science of faith. Allied to the view already mentioned is that of
          Feuerbach, to whom religion is a matter of subjective fancy; and that
          of Tyndall, who would remit theology to the region of vague feeling
          and aspiration, but would exclude it from the realm of science; see
          Feuerbach, Essence of Christianity, translated by Marian Evans (George
          Eliot); also Tyndall, Belfast Address.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Those facts of revelation which are beyond our full understanding
          may, like the nebular hypothesis in astronomy, the atomic theory in
          chemistry, or the doctrine of evolution in biology, furnish a
          principle of union between great classes of other facts otherwise
          irreconcilable. We may define our concepts of God, and even of the
          Trinity, at least sufficiently to distinguish them from all other
          concepts; and whatever difficulty may encumber the putting of them
          into language only shows the importance of attempting it and the value
          of even an approximate success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horace Bushnell: “Theology can never be a science, on account of the
          infirmities of language.” But this principle would render void both
          ethical and political science. Fisher, Nat. and Meth. of Revelation,
          145—“Hume and Gibbon refer to faith as something too sacred to rest on
          proof. Thus religious beliefs are made to hang in mid-air, without any
          support. But the foundation of these beliefs is no less solid for the
          reason that empirical tests are not applicable to them. The data on
          which they rest are real, and the inferences from the data are fairly
          drawn.” Hodgson indeed pours contempt on the whole intuitional method
          by saying: “Whatever you are totally ignorant of, assert to be the
          explanation of everything else!” Yet he would probably grant that he
          begins his investigations by assuming his own existence. The doctrine
          of the Trinity is not wholly comprehensible by us, and we accept it at
          the first upon the testimony of Scripture; the full proof of it is
          found in the fact that each successive doctrine of theology is bound
          up with it, and with it stands or falls. The Trinity is rational
          because it explains Christian experience as well as Christian
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Even though there were no orderly arrangement of these facts,
          either in nature or in Scripture, an accurate systematizing of them by
          the human mind would not therefore be proved impossible, unless a
          principle were assumed which would show all physical science to be
          equally impossible. Astronomy and geology are constructed by putting
          together multitudinous facts which at first sight seem to have no
          order. So with theology. And yet, although revelation does not present
          to us a dogmatic system ready-made, a dogmatic system is not only
          implicitly contained therein, but parts of the system are wrought out
          in the epistles of the New Testament, as for example in Rom. 5:12-19;
          1 Cor. 15:3, 4; 8:6; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 6:1, 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may illustrate the construction of theology from the dissected map,
          two pieces of which a father puts together, leaving his child to put
          together the rest. Or we may illustrate from the physical universe,
          which to the unthinking reveals little of its order. “Nature makes no
          fences.” One thing seems to glide into another. It is man&#x27;s
          business to distinguish and classify and combine. Origen: “God gives
          us truth in single threads, which we must weave into a finished
          texture.” Andrew Fuller said of the doctrines of theology that “they
          are united together like chain-shot, so that, whichever one enters the
          heart, the others must certainly follow.” George Herbert: “Oh that I
          knew how all thy lights combine, And the configuration of their glory;
          Seeing not only how each verse doth shine, But all the constellations
          of the story!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture hints at the possibilities of combination, in Rom. 5:12-19,
          with its grouping of the facts of sin and salvation about the two
          persons, Adam and Christ; in Rom. 4:24, 25, with its linking of the
          resurrection of Christ and our justification; in 1 Cor. 3:6, with its
          indication of the relations between the Father and Christ; in 1 Tim.
          3:16, with its poetical summary of the facts of redemption (see
          Commentaries of DeWette, Meyer, Fairbairn); in Heb. 6:1, 2, with its
          statement of the first principles of the Christian faith. God&#x27;s
          furnishing of concrete facts in theology, which we ourselves are left
          to systematize, is in complete accordance with his method of procedure
          with regard to the development of other sciences. See Martineau,
          Essays, 1:29, 40; Am. Theol. Rev., 1859:101-126—art. on the Idea,
          Sources and Uses of Christian Theology.
