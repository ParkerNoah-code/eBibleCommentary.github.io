        <p>3d. The Romance-theory of Renan (1823–1892).</p>
        <p>
          This theory admits a basis of truth in the gospels and holds that they
          all belong to the century following Jesus’ death. “According to”
          Matthew, Mark, etc., however, means only that Matthew, Mark, etc.,
          wrote these gospels in substance. Renan claims that the facts of
          Jesus’ life were so sublimated by enthusiasm, and so overlaid with
          pious fraud, that the gospels in their present form cannot be accepted
          as genuine,—in short, the gospels are to be regarded as historical
          romances which have only a foundation in fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The animus of this theory is plainly shown in Renan’s Life of Jesus,
          preface to 13th ed.—“If miracles and the inspiration of certain books
          are realities, my method is detestable. If miracles and the
          inspiration of books are beliefs without reality, my method is a good
          one. But the question of the supernatural is decided for us with
          perfect certainty by the single consideration that there is no room
          for believing in a thing of which the world offers no experimental
          trace.” “On the whole,” says Reuan, “I admit as authentic the four
          canonical gospels. All, in my opinion, date from the first century,
          and the authors are, generally speaking, those to whom they are
          attributed.” He regards Gal_1:1-24 and 2 Cor., and Rom., as
          “indisputable and undisputed.” He speaks of them as “being texts of an
          absolute authenticity, of complete sincerity, and without legends”
          (Les Apôtres, xxix; Les Évangiles, xi). Yet he denies to Jesus
          “sincerity with himself”; attributes to him “innocent artifice” and
          the toleration of pious fraud, as for example in the case of the
          stories of Lazarus and of his own resurrection. “To conceive the good
          is not sufficient: it must be made to succeed; to accomplish this,
          less pure paths must be followed.…Not by any fault of his own, his
          conscience lost somewhat of its original purity,—his mission
          overwhelmed him.…Did he regret his too lofty nature, and, victim of
          his own greatness, mourn that he had not remained a simple artizan?”
          So Renan “pictures Christ’s later life as a misery and a lie, yet he
          requests us to bow before this sinner and before his superior,
          Sakya-Mouni, as demigods” (see Nicoll, The Church’s One Foundation,
          62, 63). Of the highly wrought imagination of Mary Magdalene, he says:
          “O divine power of love! sacred moments, in which the passion of one
          whose senses were deceived gives us a resuscitated God!” See Renan,
          Life of Jesus, 21.
        </p>
        <p>To this Romance-theory of Renan, we object that</p>
        <p>
          (a) It involves an arbitrary and partial treatment of the Christian
          documents. The claim that one writer not only borrowed from others,
          but interpolated ad libitum, is contradicted by the essential
          agreement of the manuscripts as quoted by the Fathers, and as now
          extant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Renan, according to Mair, Christian Evidences, 153, dates Matthew at
          84 a.d.; Mark at 76; Luke at 94; John at 125. These dates mark a
          considerable retreat from the advanced positions taken by Baur. Mair,
          in his chapter on Recent Reverses in Negative Criticism, attributes
          this result to the late discoveries with regard to the Epistle of
          Barnabas, Hippolytus’s Refutation of all Heresies, the Clementine
          Homilies, and Tatian’s Diatessaron: “According to Baur and bis
          immediate followers, we have less than one quarter of the N. T.
          belonging to the first century. According to Hilgenfeld, the present
          head of the Baur school, we have somewhat less than three quarters
          belonging to the first century, while substantially the same thing may
          be said with regard to Holzmann. According to Renan, we have
          distinctly more than three quarters of the N. T. falling within the
          first century, and therefore within the apostolic age. This surely
          indicates a very decided and extraordinary retreat since the time of
          Baur’s grand assault, that is, within the last fifty years.” We may
          add that the concession of authorship within the apostolic age renders
          nugatory Renan’s hypothesis that the N. T. documents have been so
          enlarged by pious fraud that they cannot be accepted as trustworthy
          accounts of such events as miracles. The oral tradition itself had
          attained so fixed a form that the many manuscripts used by the Fathers
          were in substantial agreement in respect to these very events, and
          oral tradition in the East hands down without serious alteration much
          longer narratives than those of our gospels. The Pundita Ramabai can
          repeat after the lapse of twenty years portions of the Hindu sacred
          books exceeding in amount the whole contents of our Old Testament.
          Many cultivated men in Athens knew by heart all the Iliad and the
          Odyssey of Homer. Memory and reverence alike kept the gospel
          narratives free from the corruption which Renan supposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It attributes to Christ and to the apostles an alternate fervor of
          romantic enthusiasm and a false pretense of miraculous power which are
          utterly irreconcilable with the manifest sobriety and holiness of
          their lives and teachings. If Jesus did not work miracles, he was an
          impostor.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Ernest Renan, His Life and the Life of Jesus, see A. H. Strong,
          Christ in Creation, 332–363, especially 356—“Renan attributes the
          origin of Christianity to the predominance in Palestine of a
          constitutional susceptibility to mystic excitements. Christ is to him
          the incarnation of sympathy and tears, a being of tender impulses and
          passionate ardors, whose native genius it was to play upon the hearts
          of men. Truth or falsehood made little difference to him; anything
          that would comfort the poor, or touch the finer feelings of humanity,
          he availed himself of; ecstasies, visions, melting moods, these were
          the secrets of his power. Religion was a beneficent superstition, a
          sweet delusion—excellent as a balm and solace for the ignorant crowd,
          who never could be philosophers if they tried. And so the gospel
          river, as one has said, is traced back to a fountain of weeping men
          and women whose brains had oozed out at their eyes, and the perfection
          of spirituality is made to be a sort of maudlin monastioism.…How
          different from the strong: and holy love of Christ, which would save
          men only by bringing them to the truth, and which claims men’s
          imitation only because, without love for God and for the soul, a man
          is without truth. How inexplicable from this view the fact that a pure
          Christianity has everywhere quickened the intellect of the nations,
          and that every revival of it, as at the Reformation, has been followed
          by mighty forward leaps of civilization. Was Paul a man carried away
          by mystic dreams and irrational enthusiasms? Let the keen dialectic
          skill of his epistles and his profound grasp of the great matters of
          revelation answer. Has the Christian church been a company of puling
          sentimentalists? Let the heroic deaths for the truth suffered by the
          martyrs witness. Nay, he must have a low idea of his kind, and a yet
          lower idea of the God who made them, who can believe that the noblest
          spirits of the race have risen to greatness by abnegating will and
          reason, and have gained influence over all ages by resigning
          themselves to semi-idiocy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It fails to account for the power and progress of the gospel, as a
          system directly opposed to men’s natural tastes and prepossessions—a
          system which substitutes truth for romance and law for impulse.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 358—“And if the later triumphs of
          Christianity are inexplicable upon the theory of Renan, how can we
          explain its founding? The sweet swain of Galilee, beloved by women for
          his beauty, fascinating the unlettered crowd by his gentle speech and
          his poetic ideals, giving comfort to the sorrowing and hope to the
          poor, credited with supernatural power which at first he thinks it not
          worth while to deny and finally gratifies the multitude by pretending
          to exercise, roused by opposition to polemics and invective until the
          delightful young rabbi becomes a gloomy giant, an intractable fanatic,
          a fierce revolutionist, whose denunciation of the powers that be
          brings him to the Cross,—what is there in him to account for the moral
          wonder which we call Christianity and the beginnings of its empire in
          the world? Neither delicious pastorals like those of Jesus’ first
          period, nor apocalyptic fevers like those of his second period,
          according to Renan’s gospel, furnish any rational explanation of that
          mighty movement which has swept through the earth and has
          revolutionized the faith of mankind.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Berdoe, Browning, 47—“If Christ were not God, his life at that stage
          of the world’s history could by no possibility have had the vitalizing
          force and love-compelling power that Kenan’s pages everywhere
          disclose. Renan has strengthened faith in Christ’s deity while
          laboring to destroy it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Renan, in discussing Christ’s appearance to Paul on the way to
          Damascus, explains the inward from the outward, thus precisely
          reversing the conclusion of Baur. A sudden storm, a flash of
          lightning, a sudden attack of ophthalmic fever, Paul took as an
          appearance from heaven. But we reply that so keen an observer and
          reasoner could not have been thus deceived. Nothing could have made
          him the apostle to the Gentiles but a sight of the glorified Christ
          and the accompanying revelation of the holiness of God, his own sin,
          the sacrifice of the Son of God, its universal efficacy, the
          obligation laid upon him to proclaim it to the ends of the earth. For
          reviews of Renan, see Hutton, Essays, 261–281, and Contemp. Thought
