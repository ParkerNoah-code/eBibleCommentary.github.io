        <p>1. Definition of Miracle.</p>
        <p>
          A. Preliminary Definition.—A miracle is an event palpable to the
          senses, produced for a religious purpose by the immediate agency of
          God; an event therefore which, though not contravening any law of
          nature, the laws of nature, if fully known, would not without this
          agency of God be competent to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This definition corrects several erroneous conceptions of the
          miracle:—(a) A miracle is not a suspension or violation of natural
          law; since natural law is in operation at the time of the miracle just
          as much as before. (b) A miracle is not a sudden product of natural
          agencies—a product merely foreseen, by him who appears to work it; it
          is the effect of a will outside of nature. (c) A miracle is not an
          event without a cause; since it has for its cause a direct volition of
          God. (d) A miracle is not an irrational or capricious act of God; but
          an act of wisdom, performed in accordance with the immutable laws of
          his being, so that in the same circumstances the same course would be
          again pursued. (e) A miracle is not contrary to experience; since it
          is not contrary to experience for a new cause to be followed by a new
          effect. (f) A miracle is not a matter of internal experience, like
          regeneration or illumination; but is an event palpable to the senses,
          which may serve as an objective proof to all that the worker of it is
          divinely commissioned as a religious teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          For various definitions of miracles, see Alexander, Christ and
          Christianity, 302. On the whole subject, see Mozley, Miracles;
          Christlieb, Mod. Doubt and Christ. Belief, 285–339; Fisher, in
          Princeton Rev., Nov. 1880, and Jan. 1881; A. H. Strong, Philosophy and
          Religion, 129–147, and in Baptist Review, April, 1879. The definition
          given above is intended simply as a definition of the miracles of the
          Bible, or, in other words, of the events which profess to attest a
          divine revelation in the Scriptures. The New Testament designates
          these events in a two-fold way, viewing them either subjectively, as
          producing effects upon men, or objectively, as revealing the power and
          wisdom of God. In the former aspect they are called τέρατα, ‘wonders,’
          and σημεῖα ‘signs,’ (Joh_4:48; Act_2:22). In the latter aspect they
          are called δυνάμεις, ‘powers,’ and ἔργα ‘works,’ (Mat_7:22;
          Joh_14:11). See H. B. Smith, Lect. on Apologetics, 90–116, esp.
          94—“σημεῖον, sign, marking the purpose or object, the moral end,
          placing the event in connection with revelation.” The Bible Union
          Version uniformly and properly renders τέρας by ‘wonder,’ δυνάμις by
          ‘miracle,’ ἔργον by ‘work,’ and σημεῖον by ‘sign.’ Goethe, Faust:
          “Alles Vergängliche ist nur ein Gleichniss: Das Unzulängliche wird
          hier Ereigniss”—“Everything transitory is but a parable; The
          unattainable appears as solid fact.” So the miracles of the New
          Testament are acted parables,—Christ opens the eyes of the blind to
          show that he is the Light of the world, multiplies the loaves to show
          that he is the Bread of Life, and raises the dead to show that he
          lifts men up from the death of trespasses and sins. See Broadus on
          Matthew, 175.
        </p>
        <p>
          A modification of this definition of the miracle, however, is demanded
          by a large class of Christian physicists, in the supposed interest of
          natural law. Such a modification is proposed by Babbage, in the Ninth
          Bridgewater Treatise, chap. viii. Babbage illustrates the miracle by
          the action of his calculating machine, which would present to the
          observer in regular succession the series of units from one to ten
          million, but which would then make a leap and show, not ten million
          and one, but a hundred million; Ephraim Peabody illustrates the
          miracle from the cathedral clock which strikes only once in a hundred
          years; yet both these results are due simply to the original
          construction of the respective machines. Bonnet held this view; see
          Dorner, Glaubenslehre, 1:591, 592; Eng. translation, 2:155, 156; so
          Matthew Arnold, quoted in Bruce, Miraculous Element in Gospels, 52;
          see also A. H. Strong, Philosophy and Religion, 129–147. Babbage and
          Peabody would deny that the miracle is due to the direct and immediate
          agency of God, and would regard it as belonging to a higher order of
          nature. God is the author of the miracle only in the sense that he
          instituted the laws of nature at the beginning and provided that at
          the appropriate time miracle should be their outcome. In favor of this
          view it has been claimed that it does not dispense with the divine
          working, but only puts it further back at the origination of the
          system, while it still holds God’s work to be essential, not only to
          the upholding of the system, but also to the inspiring of the
          religious teacher or leader with the knowledge needed to predict the
          unusual working of the system. The wonder is confined to the prophecy,
          which may equally attest a divine revelation. See Matheson, in
          Christianity and Evolution, 1–26.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is plain that a miracle of this sort lacks to a large degree
          the element of ‘signality’ which is needed, if it is to accomplish its
          purpose. It surrenders the great advantage which miracle, as first
          defined, possessed over special providence, as an attestation of
          revelation—the advantage, namely, that while special providence
          affords some warrant that this revelation comes from God, miracle
          gives full warrant that it comes from God. Since man may by natural
          means possess himself of the knowledge of physical laws, the true
          miracle which God works, and the pretended miracle which only man
          works, are upon this theory far less easy to distinguish from each
          other: Cortez, for example, could deceive Montezuma by predicting an
          eclipse of the sun. Certain typical miracles, like the resurrection of
          Lazarus, refuse to be classed as events within the realm of nature, in
          the sense in which the term nature is ordinarily used. Our Lord,
          moreover, seems clearly to exclude such a theory as this, when he
          says: “If I by the finger of God cast out demons” (Luk_11:20);
          Mar_1:41—“I will; be thou made clean.” The view of Babbage is
          inadequate, not only because it fails to recognize any immediate
          exercise of will in the miracle, but because it regards nature as a
          mere machine which can operate apart from God—a purely deistic method
          of conception. On this view, many of the products of mere natural law
          might be called miracles. The miracle would be only the occasional
          manifestation of a higher order of nature, like the comet occasionally
          invading the solar system. William Elder, Ideas from Nature: “The
          century-plant which we have seen growing from our childhood may not
          unfold its blossoms until our old age comes upon us, but the sudden
          wonder is natural notwithstanding.” If, however, we interpret nature
          dynamically, rather than mechanically, and regard it as the regular
          working of the divine will instead of the automatic operation of a
          machine, there is much in this view which we may adopt. Miracle may be
          both natural and supernatural. We may hold, with Babbage, that it has
          natural antecedents, while at the same time we hold that it is
          produced by the immediate agency of God. We proceed therefore to an
          alternative and preferable definition, which in our judgment combines
          the merits of both that have been mentioned. On miracles as already
          defined, see Mozley, Miracles, preface, ix–xxvi, 7, 143–166; Bushnell,
          Nature and Supernatural, 333–336; Smith’s and Hastings’ Dict. of
          Bible, art.: Miracles; Abp. Temple, Bampton Lectures for 1884:193–221;
          Shedd, Dogm. Theology, 1:541, 542.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Alternative and Preferable Definition.—A miracle is an event in
          nature, so extraordinary in itself and so coinciding with the prophecy
          or command of a religious teacher or leader, as fully to warrant the
          conviction, on the part of those who witness it, that God has wrought
          it with the design of certifying that this teacher or leader has been
          commissioned by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This definition has certain marked advantages as compared with the
          preliminary definition given above:—(a) It recognizes the immanence of
          God and his immediate agency in nature, instead of assuming an
          antithesis between the laws of nature and the will of God. (b) It
          regards the miracle as simply an extraordinary act of that same God
          who is already present in all natural operations and who in them is
          revealing his general plan. (c) It holds that natural law, as the
          method of God’s regular activity, in no way precludes unique exertions
          of his power when these will best secure his purpose in creation. (d)
          It leaves it possible that all miracles may have their natural
          explanations and may hereafter be traced to natural causes, while both
          miracles and their natural causes may be only names for the one and
          self-same will of God. (e) It reconciles the claims of both science
          and religion: of science, by permitting any possible or probable
          physical antecedents of the miracle; of religion, by maintaining that
          these very antecedents together with the miracle itself are to be
          interpreted as signs of God’s special commission to him under whose
          teaching or leadership the miracle is wrought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Augustine, who declares that “Dei voluntas rerum natura est,” defines
          the miracle in De Civitate Dei, 21:8—“Portentum ergo fit non contra
          naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura.” He says also that a birth
          is more miraculous than a resurrection, because it is more wonderful
          that something that never was should begin to be, than that something
          that was and ceased to be should begin again. E. G. Robinson, Christ.
          Theology, 104—“The natural is God’s work. He originated it. There is
          no separation between the natural and the supernatural. The natural is
          supernatural. God works in everything. Every end, even though attained
          by mechanical means, is God’s end as truly as if he wrought by
          miracle.” Shaler, Interpretation of Nature, 141, regards miracle as
          something exceptional, yet under the control of natural law; the
          latent in nature suddenly manifesting itself; the revolution resulting
          from the slow accumulation of natural forces. In the Windsor Hotel
          fire, the heated and charred woodwork suddenly burst into flame. Flame
          is very different from mere heat, but it may be the result of a
          regularly rising temperature. Nature may be God’s regular action,
          miracle its unique result. God’s regular action may be entirely free,
          and yet its extraordinary result may be entirely natural. With these
          qualifications and explanations, we may adopt the statement of
          Biedermann, Dogmatik, 581–591—“Everything is miracle,—therefore faith
          sees God everywhere; Nothing is miracle,—therefore science sees God
          nowhere.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracles are never considered by the Scripture writers as infractions
          of law. Bp. Southampton, Place of Miracles, 18—“The Hebrew historian
          or prophet regarded miracles as only the emergence into sensible
          experience of that divine force which was all along, though invisibly,
          controlling the course of nature.” Hastings, Bible Dictionary,
          4:117—“The force of a miracle to us, arising from our notion of law,
          would not be felt by a Hebrew, because he had no notion of natural
          law.” Psa_77:19-20—“Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great
          waters, And thy footsteps were not known”—They knew not, and we know
          not, by what precise means the deliverance was wrought, or by what
          precise track the passage through the Red Sea was effected; all we
          know is that “Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of
          Moses and Aaron.” J. M. Whiton, Miracles and Supernatural Religion:
          “The supernatural is in nature itself, at its very heart, at its very
          life; … not an outside power interfering with the course of nature,
          but an inside power vitalizing nature and operating through it.”
          Griffith-Jones, Ascent through Christ, 35—“Miracle, instead of
          spelling ‘monster’, as Emerson said, simply bears witness to some
          otherwise unknown or unrecognized aspect of the divine character.”
          Shedd, Dogm. Theol., l:533—“To cause the sun to rise and to cause
          Lazarus to rise, both demand omnipotence; but the manner in which
          omnipotence works in one instance is unlike the manner in the other.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Miracle is an immediate operation of God; but, since all natural
          processes are also immediate operations of God, we do not need to deny
          the use of these natural processes, so far as they will go, in
          miracle. Such wonders of the Old Testament as the overthrow of Sodom
          and Gomorrah, the partings of the Red Sea and of the Jordan, the
          calling down of fire from heaven by Elijah and the destruction of the
          army of Sennacherib, are none the less works of God when regarded as
          wrought by the use of natural means. In the New Testament Christ took
          water to make wine, and took the five loaves to make bread, just as in
          ten thousand vineyards to-day he is turning the moisture of the earth
          into the juice of the grape, and in ten thousand fields is turning
          carbon into corn. The virgin-birth of Christ may be an extreme
          instance of parthenogenesis, which Professor Loeb of Chicago has just
          demonstrated to take place in other than the lowest forms of life and
          which he believes to be possible in all. Christ’s resurrection may be
          an illustration of the power of the normal and perfect human spirit to
          take to itself a proper body, and so may be the type and prophecy of
          that great change when we too shall lay down our life and take it
          again. The scientist may yet find that his disbelief is not only
          disbelief in Christ, but also disbelief in science. All miracle may
          have its natural side, though we now are not able to discern it; and,
          if this were true, the Christian argument would not one whit be
          weakened, for still miracle would evidence the extraordinary working
          of the immanent God, and the impartation of his knowledge to the
          prophet or apostle who was his instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          This view of the miracle renders entirely unnecessary and irrational
          the treatment accorded to the Scripture narratives by some modern
          theologians. There is a credulity of scepticism, which minimizes the
          miraculous element in the Bible and treats it as mythical or
          legendary, in spite of clear evidence that it belongs to the realm of
          actual history. Pfleiderer, Philos. Relig., 1:295—“Miraculous legends
          arise in two ways, partly out of the idealizing of the real, and
          partly out of the realizing of the ideal.…Every occurrence may obtain
          for the religious judgment the significance of a sign or proof of the
          world-governing power, wisdom, justice or goodness of God.…Miraculous
          histories are a poetic realizing of religious ideas.” Pfleiderer
          quotes Goethe’s apothegm: “Miracle is faith’s dearest child.” Foster,
          Finality of the Christian Religion, 128–138—“We most honor biblical
          miraculous narratives when we seek to understand them as poesies.”
          Ritschl defines miracles as “those striking natural occurrences with
          which the experience of God’s special help is connected.” He leaves
          doubtful the bodily resurrection of Christ, and many of his school
          deny it; see Meade, Ritschl’s Place in the History of Doctrine, 11. We
          do not need to interpret Christ’s resurrection as a mere appearance of
          his spirit to the disciples. Gladden, Seven Puzzling Books, 202—“In
          the hands of perfect and spiritual man, the forces of nature are
          pliant and tractable as they are not in ours. The resurrection of
          Christ is only a sign of the superiority of the life of the perfect
          spirit over external conditions. It may be perfectly in accordance
          with nature.” Myers, Human Personality, 2:288—“I predict that, in
          consequence of the new evidence, all reasonable men, a century hence,
          will believe the resurrection of Christ.” We may add that Jesus
          himself intimates that the working of miracles is hereafter to be a
          common and natural manifestation of the new life which he imparts:
          Joh_14:12—“He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do
          also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto the
          Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We append a number of opinions, ancient and modern, with regard to
          miracles, all tending to show the need of so defining them as not to
          conflict with the just claims of science. Aristotle: “Nature is not
          full of episodes, like a bad tragedy.” Shakespeare, All’s Well that
          Ends Well, 2:3:1—“They say miracles are past; and we have our
          philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural
          and causeless. Hence it is that we make trifles of terrors, ensconsing
          ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to
          an unknown fear.” Keats, Lamia: “There was an awful rainbow once in
          heaven; We know her woof, her texture: she is given in the dull
          catalogue of common things.” Hill, Genetic Philosophy, 334—“Biological
          and psychological science unite in affirming that every event, organic
          or psychic, is to be explained in the terms of its immediate
          antecedents, and that it can be so explained. There is therefore no
          necessity, there is even no room, for interference. If the existence
          of a Deity depends upon the evidence of intervention and supernatural
          agency, faith in the divine seems to be destroyed in the scientific
          mind.” Theodore Parker: “No whim in God,—therefore no miracle in
          nature.” Armour, Atonement and Law, 15–33—“The miracle of redemption,
          like all miracles, is by intervention of adequate power, not by
          suspension of law. Redemption is not ‘the great exception.’ It is the
          fullest revelation and vindication of law.” Gore, in Lux Mundi,
          320—“Redemption is not natural but supernatural—supernatural, that is,
          in view of the false nature which man made for himself by excluding
          God. Otherwise, the work of redemption is only the reconstitution of
          the nature which God had designed.” Abp. Trench: “The world of nature
          is throughout a witness for the world of spirit, proceeding from the
          same hand, growing out of the same root, and being constituted for
          this very end. The characters of nature which everywhere meet the eye
          are not a common but a sacred writing,—they are the hieroglyphics of
          God.” Pascal: “Nature is the image of grace.” President Mark Hopkins:
          “Christianity and perfect Reason are identical.” See Mead,
          Supernatural Revelation, 97–123; art.: Miracle, by Bernard, in
          Hastings’ Dictionary of the Bible. The modern and unproved view of the
          miracle is perhaps best presented by T. H. Wright, The Finger of God;
          and by W. N. Rice, Christian Faith in an Age of Science, 336.
