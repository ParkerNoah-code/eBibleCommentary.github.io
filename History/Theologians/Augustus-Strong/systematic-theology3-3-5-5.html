        <p>5. Errors in quoting or interpreting the Old Testament.</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are commonly interpretations of the
          meaning of the original Scripture by the same Spirit who first
          inspired it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Eph_5:14, “arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee”
          is an inspired interpretation of Isa_60:1—“Arise, shine; for thy light
          is come.” Psa_68:18—“Thou hast received gifts among men“—is quoted in
          Eph_4:8 as “gave gifts to men.” The words in Hebrew are probably a
          concise expression for “thou hast taken spoil which thou mayest
          distribute as gifts to men.” Eph_4:8 agrees exactly with the sense,
          though not with the words, of the Psalm. In Heb_11:21,
          “Jacob.…worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff” (LXX); Gen_47:31
          has “bowed himself upon the bed’s head.” The meaning is the same, for
          the staff of the chief and the spear of the warrior were set at the
          bed’s head. Jacob, too feeble to rise, prayed in his bed. Here Calvin
          says that “the apostle does not hesitate to accommodate to his own
          purpose what was commonly received,—they were not so scrupulous” as to
          details. Even Gordon, Ministry of the Spirit, 177, speaks of “a
          reshaping of his own words by the Author of them.” We prefer, with
          Calvin, to see in these quotations evidence that the sacred writers
          were insistent upon the substance of the truth rather than upon the
          form, the spirit rather than the letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Where an apparently false translation is quoted from the
          Septuagint, the sanction of inspiration is given to it, as expressing
          a part at least of the fulness of meaning contained in the divine
          original—a fulness of meaning which two varying translations do not in
          some cases exhaust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psa_4:4—Heb.: “Tremble, and sin not” (= no longer); LXX: “Be ye angry,
          and sin not.” Eph_4:26 quotes the LXX. The words may originally have
          been addressed to David’s comrades, exhorting them to keep their anger
          within bounds. Both translations together are needed to bring out the
          meaning of the original. Psa_40:6-8—“Mine ears hast thou opened” is
          translated in Heb_10:5-7—“a body didst thou prepare for me.” Here the
          Epistle quotes from the LXX. But the Hebrew means literally: “Mine
          ears hast thou bored”—an allusion to the custom of pinning a slave to
          the doorpost of his master by an awl driven through his ear, in token
          of his complete subjection. The sense of the verse is therefore given
          in the Epistle: “Thou hast made me thine in body and soul—lo, I come
          to do thy will” A. C. Kendrick: “David, just entering upon his kingdom
          after persecution, is a type of Christ entering on his earthly
          mission. Hence David’s words are put into the mouth of Christ. For
          ‘ears,’ the organs with which we hear and obey and which David
          conceived to be hollowed out for him by God, the author of the Hebrews
          substitutes the word ‘body,’ as the general instrument of doing God’s
          will” (Com. on Heb_10:5-7).
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The freedom of these inspired interpretations, however, does not
          warrant us in like freedom of interpretation in the case of other
          passages whose meaning has not been authoritatively made known.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no reason to believe that the scarlet thread of Rahab
          (Jos_2:18) was a designed prefiguration of the blood of Christ, nor
          that the three measures of meal in which the woman hid her leaven
          (Mat_13:33) symbolized Shem, Ham and Japheth, the three divisions of
          the human race. C. H. M., in his notes on the tabernacle in Exodus,
          tells us that “the loops of blue = heavenly grace; the taches of gold
          = the divine energy of Christ; the rams’ skins dyed red—Christ’s
          consecration and devotedness; the badgers’ skins—his holy vigilance
          against temptation”! The tabernacle was indeed a type of Christ
          (Joh_1:14—ἐσκήνωσεν. Joh_2:19; Joh_2:21—“in three days I will raise it
          up.…but he spake of the temple of his body”); yet it does not follow
          that every detail of the structure was significant. So each parable
          teaches some one main lesson,—the particulars may be mere drapery; and
          while we may use the parables for illustration, we should never
          ascribe divine authority to our private impressions of their meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mat_25:1-13—the parable of the five wise and the five foolish
          virgins—has been made to teach that the number of the saved precisely
          equals the number of the lost. Augustine defended persecution from the
          words in Luk_14:23—“constrain them to come in.” The Inquisition was
          justified by Mat_13:30—“bind them in bundles to burn them.” Innocent
          III denied the Scriptures to the laity, quoting Heb_12:20—“If even a
          beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.” A Plymouth Brother held
          that he would be safe on an evangelizing journey because he read in
          Joh_19:36—“A bone of him shall not be broken.” Mat_17:8—“they saw no
          one, save Jeses only”—has been held to mean that we should trust only
          Jesus. The Epistle of Barnabas discovered in Abraham’s 318 servants a
          prediction of the crucified Jesus, and others have seen in Abraham’s
          three days’ journey to Mount Moriah the three stages in the
          development of the soul. Clement of Alexandria finds the four natural
          elements in the four colors of the Jewish Tabernacle. All this is to
          make a parable “run on all fours.” While we call a hero a lion, we do
          not need to find in the man something’ to correspond to the lion’s
          mane and claws. See Toy, Quotations in the N. T.; Franklin Johnson,
          Quotations of the N. T. from the O. T.; Crooker, The New Bible and its
          New Uses, 126–136.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) While we do not grant that the New Testament writers in any proper
          sense misquoted or misinterpreted the Old Testament, we do not regard
          absolute correctness in these respects as essential to their
          inspiration. The inspiring Spirit may have communicated truth, and may
          have secured in the Scriptures as a whole a record of that truth
          sufficient for men’s moral and religious needs, without imparting
          perfect gifts of scholarship or exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          In answer to Toy, Quotations in the N. T., who takes a generally
          unfavorable view of the correctness of the N. T. writers, Johnson,
          Quotations of the N. T. from the O. T., maintains their correctness.
          On pages x, xi, of his Introduction, Johnson remarks: “I think it just
          to regard the writers of the Bible as the creators of a great
          literature, and to judge and interpret them by the laws of literature.
          They have produced all the chief forms of literature, as history,
          biography, anecdote, proverb, oratory, allegory, poetry, fiction. They
          have needed therefore all the resources of human speech, its sobriety
          and scientific precision on one page, its rainbow hues of fancy and
          imagination on another, its fires of passion on yet another. They
          could not have moved and guided men in the best manner had they denied
          themselves the utmost force and freedom of language; had they refused
          to employ its wide range of expressions, whether exact or poetic; had
          they not borrowed without stint its many forms of reason, of terror,
          of rapture, of hope, of joy, of peace. So also, they have needed the
          usual freedom of literary allusion and citation, in order to commend
          the gospel to the judgment, the tastes, and the feelings of their
          readers.”
