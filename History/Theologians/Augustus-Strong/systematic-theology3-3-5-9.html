        <p>9. Sceptical or fictitious Narratives.</p>
        <p>
          (a) Descriptions of human experience may be embraced in Scripture, not
          as models for imitation, but as illustrations of the doubts,
          struggles, and needs of the soul. In these cases inspiration may
          vouch, not for the correctness of the views expressed by those who
          thus describe their mental history, but only for the correspondence of
          the description with actual fact, and for its usefulness as indirectly
          teaching important moral lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book of Ecclesiastes, for example, is the record of the mental
          struggles of a soul seeking satisfaction without God. If written by
          Solomon during the time of his religious declension, or near the close
          of it, it would constitute a most valuable commentary upon the
          inspired history. Yet it might be equally valuable, though composed by
          some later writer under divine dlirection and inspiration. H. P.
          Smith, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 97—“To suppose Solomon the
          author of Ecclesiastes is like supposing Spenser to have written In
          Memoriam.” Luther, Keil, Delitzsch, Ginsburg, Hengstenberg all declare
          it to be a production of later times (330 b.c.). The book shows
          experience of misgovernment. An earlier writer cannot write in the
          style of a later one, though the later can imitate the earlier. The
          early Latin and Greek Fathers quoted the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon
          as by Solomon; see Plumptre, Introd. to Ecclesiastes, in Cambridge
          Bible. Gore, in Lux Mundi, 355—“Ecclesiastes, though like the book of
          Wisdom purporting to be by Solomon, may be by another author.…‘A pious
          fraud’ cannot be inspired; an idealizing personification, as a normal
          type of literature, can be inspired.” Yet Bernhard Schäfer, Das Buch
          Koheleth, ably maintains the Solomonic authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Moral truth may be put by Scripture writers into parabolic or
          dramatic form, and the sayings of Satan and of perverse men may form
          parts of such production. In such cases, inspiration may vouch, not
          for the historical truth, much less for the moral truth of each
          seperate statement, but only for the correspondence of the whole with
          ideal fact; in other words, inspiration may guarantee that the story
          is true to nature, and is valuable as conveying divine instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not necessary to suppose that the poetical speeches of Job’s
          friends were actually delivered in the words that have come down to
          us. Though Job never had a historical existance, the book would still
          be of the utmost value, and would convey to us a vast amount of true
          teaching with regard to the dealings of God and the problem of evil.
          Fact is local; truth is universal. Some novels contain more truth can
          be found in some histories. Other books of Scripture, however, assure
          us that Job was an actual historical character (Exo_14:14; Jam_5:11).
          Nor is it necessary to suppose that our Lord, in telling the parable
          of the Prodigal Son (Luk_15:11-32) or that of the Unjust Steward
          (Luk_16:1-8), had in mind actual persons of whom each parable was an
          exact description.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fiction is not an unworthy vehicle of spiritual truth. Parable, and
          even fable, may convey valuable lessons. In Jdg_9:14-15, the trees,
          the vine, the bramble, all talk. If truth can be transmitted in myth
          and legend, surely God may make use of these methods of communicating
          it, and even though Gen_1:1-31; Gen_2:1-25; Gen_3:1-24 were mythical
          it might still be inspired. Aristotle said that poetry is truer than
          history. The latter only tells us that certain things happened. Poetry
          presents to us the permanent passions, aspirations and deeds of men
          which are behind all history and which make it what it is; see Dewey,
          Psychology, 197. Though Job were a drama and Jonah an apologue, both
          might be inspired. David Copperfleld, the Apology of Socrates, Fra
          Lippo Lippi, were not the authors of the productions which bear their
          names, but Dickens, Plato and Browning, rather. Impersonation is a
          proper method in literature. The speeches of Herodotus and Thucydides
          might be analogues to those in Deuteronomy and in the Acts, and yet
          these last might be inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book of Job could not have been written in patriarchal times.
          Walled cities, kings, courts, lawsuits, prisons, stocks, mining
          enterprises, are found in it. Judges are bribed by the rich to decide
          against the poor. All this belongs to the latter years of the Jewish
          Kingdom. Is then the book of Job all a lie? No more than Bunyan’s
          Pilgrim’s Progress and the parable of the Good Samaritan are all a
          lie. The book of Job is a dramatic poem. Like Macbeth or the Ring and
          the Book, it is founded in fact. H. P. Smith, Biblical Scholarship and
          Inspiration, 101—“The value of the book of Job lies in the spectacle
          of a human soul in its direst affliction working through its doubts,
          and at last humbly confessing its weakness and sinfulness in the
          presence of its Maker. The inerrancy is not in Job’s words or in those
          of his friends, but in the truth of the picture presented. If
          Jehovah’s words at the end of the book are true, then the first
          thirty-five chapters are not infallible teaching.”

          Gore, in Lux Mundi, 355, suggests in a similar manner that the books
          of Jonah and of Daniel may be dramatic compositions worked up upon a
          basis of history. George Adam Smith, in the Expositors’ Bible, tells
          us that Jonah flourished 780 b.c., in the reign of Jeroboam II.
          Nineveh fell in 606. The book implies that it was written after this
          (3:3—“Nineveh was an exceeding great city”). The book does not claim
          to be written by Jonah, by an eye-witness, or by a contemporary. The
          language has Aramaic forms. The date is probably 300 b.c., There is an
          absence of precise data, such as the sin of Nineveh, the journey of
          the prophet thither, the place where he was cast out on land, the name
          of the Assyrian king. The book illustrates God’s mission of prophecy
          to the Gentiles, his care for them, their susceptibility to his word.
          Israel flies from duty, but is delivered to carry salvation to the
          heathen. Jeremiah had represented Israel as swallowed up and cast out
          (Jer_51:34; Jer_51:44 sq.—“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath
          devoured me..…he hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled
          his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out..…I will bring forth
          out of his month that which he hath swallowed up.” Some tradition of
          Jonah’s proclaiming doom to Nineveh may have furnished the basis of
          the apologue. Our Lord uses the story as a mere illustration, like the
          homiletic use of Shakespeare’s dramas. “As Macbeth did,” “As Hamlet
          said,” do not commit us to the historical reality of Macbeth or of
          Hamlet. Jesus may say as to questions of criticism: “Man, who made me
          a judge or a divider over you?” “I came not to judge the world, but to
          save the world” (Luk_12:14; Joh_12:47). He had no thought of
          confirming, or of not confirming, the historic character of the story.
          It is hard to conceive the compilation of a psalm by a man in Jonah’s
          position. It is not the prayer of one inside the fish, but of one
          already saved. More than forty years ago President Woolsey of Yale
          conceded that the book of Jonah was probably an apologue.

          (c) In none of these cases ought the difficulty of distinguishing
          man’s words from God’s words, or ideal truth from actual truth, to
          prevent our acceptance of the fact of inspiration; for in this very
          variety of the Bible, combined with the stimulus it gives to inquiry
          and the general plainness of its lessons, we have the very
          characteristics we should expect in a book whose authorship was
          divine.

          The Scripture is a stream in which “the lamb may wade and the elephant
          may swim.” There is need both of literary sense and of spiritual
          insight to interpret it. This sense and this insight can be given only
          by the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, who inspired the various
          writings to witness of him in various ways, and who is present in the
          world to take of the things of Christ and show them to us (Mat_28:20;
          Joh_16:13-14). In a subordinate sense the Holy Spirit inspires us to
          recognize inspiration in the Bible. In the sense here suggested we may
          assent to the words of Dr. Charles H. Parkburst at the inauguration of
          William Adams Brown as Professor of Systematic Theology in the Union
          Theological Seminary, November 1,1898—“Unfortunately we have condemned
          the word ‘inspiration’ to a particular and isolated field of divine
          operation, and it is a trespass upon current usage to employ it in the
          full urgency of its Scriptural intent in connection with work like
          your own or mine. But the word voices a reality that lies so close to
          the heart of the entire Christian matter that we can ill afford to
          relegate it to any single or technical function. Just as much to-day
          as back at the first beginnings of Christianity, those who would
          declare the truths of God must be inspired to behold the truths of
          God.…The only irresistible persuasiveness is that which is born of
          vision, and it is not vision to be able merely to describe what some
          seer has seen, though it were Moses or Paul that was the seer.”
