          III. The Anthropological Argument, or Argument from Man&#x27;s Mental
          and Moral Nature.
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is an argument from the mental and moral condition of man to the
          existence of an Author, Lawgiver, and End. It is sometimes called the
          Moral Argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common title “Moral Argument” is much too narrow, for it seems to
          take account only of conscience in man, whereas the argument which
          this title so imperfectly designates really proceeds from man&#x27;s
          intellectual and emotional, as well as from his moral, nature. In
          choosing the designation we have adopted, we desire, moreover, to
          rescue from the mere physicist the term “Anthropology”—a term to which
          he has attached altogether too limited a signification, and which, in
          his use of it, implies that man is a mere animal,—to him Anthropology
          is simply the study of la bête humaine. Anthropology means, not simply
          the science of man&#x27;s physical nature, origin, and relations, but
          also the science which treats of his higher spiritual being. Hence, in
          Theology, the term Anthropology designates that division of the
          subject which treats of man&#x27;s spiritual nature and endowments,
          his original state and his subsequent apostasy. As an argument,
          therefore, from man&#x27;s mental and moral nature, we can with
          perfect propriety call the present argument the Anthropological
          Argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument is a complex one, and may be divided into three parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man&#x27;s intellectual and moral nature must have had for its
          author an intellectual and moral Being. The elements of the proof are
          as follows:—(a) Man, as an intellectual and moral being, has had a
          beginning upon the planet. (b) Material and unconscious forces do not
          afford a sufficient cause for man&#x27;s reason, conscience, and free
          will. (c) Man, as an effect, can be referred only to a cause
          possessing self-consciousness and a moral nature, in other words,
          personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          This argument is is part an application to man of the principles of
          both the Cosmological and the Teleological Arguments. Flint, Theism,
          74—“Although causality does not involve design, nor design goodness,
          yet design involves causality, and goodness both causality and
          design.” Jacobi: “Nature conceals God; man reveals him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Man is an effect. The history of the geologic ages proves that man has
          not always existed, and even if the lower creatures were his
          progenitors, his intellect and freedom are not eternal a parte ante.
          We consider man, not as a physical, but as a spiritual, being.
          Thompson, Christian Theism, 75—“Every true cause must be sufficient to
          account for the effect.” Locke, Essay, book 4, chap. 10—“Cogitable
          existence cannot be produced out of incogitable.” Martineau, Study of
          Religion, 1:258 sq.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if man had always existed, however, we should not need to abandon
          the argument. We might start, not from beginning of existence, but
          from beginning of phenomena. I might see God in the world, just as I
          see thought, feeling, will, in my fellow men. Fullerton, Plain
          Argument for God: I do not infer you, as cause of the existence of
          your body: I recognize you as present and working through your body.
          Its changes of gesture and speech reveal a personality behind them. So
          I do not need to argue back to a Being who once caused nature and
          history; I recognize a present Being, exercising wisdom and power, by
          signs such as reveal personality in man. Nature is itself the
          Watchmaker manifesting himself in the very process of making the
          watch. This is the meaning of the noble Epilogue to Robert
          Browning&#x27;s Dramatis Personæ, 252—“That one Face, far from vanish,
          rather grows, Or decomposes but to recompose, Become my universe that
          feels and knows.” “That Face,” said Mr. Browning to Mrs. Orr, “That
          Face is the face of Christ; that is how I feel him.”Nature is an
          expression of the mind and will of Christ, as my face is an expression
          of my mind and will. But in both cases, behind and above the face is a
          personality, of which the face is but the partial and temporary
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bowne, Philos. Theism, 104, 107—“My fellow beings act as if they had
          thought, feeling, and will. So nature looks as if thought, feeling,
          and will were behind it. If we deny mind in nature, we must deny mind
          in man. If there be no controlling mind in nature, moreover, there can
          be none in man, for if the basal power is blind and necessary, then
          all that depends upon it is necessitated also.” LeConte, in
          Royce&#x27;s Conception of God, 44—“There is only one place in the
          world where we can get behind physical phenomena, behind the veil of
          matter, namely, in our own brain, and we find there a self, a person.
          Is it not reasonable that, if we could get behind the veil of nature,
          we should find the same, that is, a Person? But if so, we must
          conclude, an infinite Person, and therefore the only complete
          Personality that exists. Perfect personality is not only
          self-conscious, but self-existent. They are only imperfect images,
          and, as it were, separated fragments, of the infinite Personality of
          God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Personality = self-consciousness + self-determination in view of moral
          ends. The brute has intelligence and will, but has neither
          self-consciousness, conscience, nor free-will. See Julius Müller,
          Doctrine of Sin, 1:76 sq. Diman, Theistic Argument, 91, 251—“Suppose
          ‘the intuitions of the moral faculty are the slowly organized results
          of experience received from the race’; still, having found that the
          universe affords evidence of a supremely intelligent cause, we may
          believe that man&#x27;s moral nature affords the highest illustration
          of its mode of working”; 358—“Shall we explain the lower forms of will
          by the higher, or the higher by the lower?”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Man&#x27;s moral nature proves the existence of a holy Lawgiver and
          Judge. The elements of the proof are:—(a) Conscience recognizes the
          existence of a moral law which has supreme authority. (b) Known
          violations of this moral law are followed by feelings of ill-desert
          and fears of judgment. (c) This moral law, since it is not
          self-imposed, and these threats of judgment, since they are not
          self-executing, respectively argue the existence of a holy will that
          has imposed the law, and of a punitive power that will execute the
          threats of the moral nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Bishop Butler&#x27;s Sermons on Human Nature, in Works,
          Bohn&#x27;s ed., 385-414. Butler&#x27;s great discovery was that of
          the supremacy of conscience in the moral constitution of man: “Had it
          strength as it has right, had it power as it has manifest authority,
          it would absolutely govern the world.” Conscience = the moral
          judiciary of the soul—not law, nor sheriff, but judge; see under
          Anthropology. Diman, Theistic Argument, 251—“Conscience does not lay
          down a law; it warns us of the existence of a law; and not only of a
          law, but of a purpose—not our own, but the purpose of another, which
          it is our mission to realize.” See Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith,
          218 sq. It proves personality in the Lawgiver, because its utterances
          are not abstract, like those of reason, but are in the nature of
          command; they are not in the indicative, but in the imperative, mood;
          it says, “thou shalt” and “thou shalt not.” This argues will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hutton, Essays, 1:11—“Conscience is an ideal Moses, and thunders from
          an invisible Sinai”; “the Atheist regards conscience not as a
          skylight, opened to let in upon human nature an infinite dawn from
          above, but as a polished arch or dome, completing and reflecting the
          whole edifice beneath.” But conscience cannot be the mere reflection
          and expression of nature, for it represses and condemns nature.
          Tulloch, Theism: “Conscience, like the magnetic needle, indicates the
          existence of an unknown Power which from afar controls its vibrations
          and at whose presence it trembles.” Nero spends nights of terror in
          wandering through the halls of his Golden House. Kant holds that faith
          in duty requires faith in a God who will defend and reward duty—see
          Critique of Pure Reason, 359-387. See also Porter, Human Intellect,
          524.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kant, in his Metaphysic of Ethics, represents the action of conscience
          as like “conducting a case before a court,” and he adds: “Now that he
          who is accused before his conscience should be figured to be just the
          same person as his judge, is an absurd representation of a tribunal;
          since, in such an event, the accuser would always lose his suit.
          Conscience must therefore represent to itself always some other than
          itself as Judge, unless it is to arrive at a contradiction with
          itself.” See also his Critique of the Practical Reason, Werke,
          8:214—“Duty, thou sublime and mighty name, that hast in thee nothing
          to attract or win, but challengest submission; and yet dost threaten
          nothing to sway the will by that which may arouse natural terror or
          aversion, but merely holdest forth a Law; a Law which of itself finds
          entrance into the mind, and even while we disobey, against our will
          compels our reverence, a Law in presence of which all inclinations
          grow dumb, even while they secretly rebel; what origin is there worthy
          of thee? Where can we find the root of thy noble descent, which
          proudly rejects all kinship with the inclinations?” Archbishop Temple
          answers, in his Bampton Lectures, 58, 59, “This eternal Law is the
          Eternal himself, the almighty God.”Robert Browning: “The sense within
          me that I owe a debt Assures me—Somewhere must be Somebody, Ready to
          take his due. All comes to this: Where due is, there acceptance
          follows: find Him who accepts the due.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Salter, Ethical Religion, quoted in Pfleiderer&#x27;s article on
          Religionless Morality, Am. Jour. Theol., 3:237—“The earth and the
          stars do not create the law of gravitation which they obey; no more
          does man, or the united hosts of rational beings in the universe,
          create the law of duty.” The will expressed in the moral imperative is
          superiorto ours, for otherwise it would issue no commands. Yet it is
          one with ours as the life of an organism is one with the life of its
          members. Theonomy is not heteronomy but the highest autonomy, the
          guarantee of our personal freedom against all servitude of man.
          Seneca: “Deo parere libertas est.” Knight, Essays in Philosophy,
          272—“In conscience we see an ‘alter ego’, in us yet not of us, another
          Personality behind our own.” Martineau, Types, 2:105—“Over a person
          only a person can have authority.... A solitary being, with no other
          sentient nature in the universe, would feel no duty”; Study, 1:26—“As
          Perception gives us Will in the shape of Causality over against us in
          the Non-Ego, so Conscience gives us Will in the shape of Authority
          over against us in the Non-Ego.... 2:7—We cannot deduce the phenomena
          of character from an agent who has none.” Hutton, Essays, 1:41,
          42—“When we disobey conscience, the Power which has therein ceased to
          move us has retired only to observe—to keep watch over us as we mould
          ourselves.” Cardinal Newman, Apologia, 377—“Were it not for the voice
          speaking so clearly in my conscience and my heart, I should be an
          atheist, or a pantheist, or a polytheist, when I looked into the
          world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Man&#x27;s emotional and voluntary nature proves the existence of a
          Being who can furnish in himself a satisfying object of human
          affection and an end which will call forth man&#x27;s highest
          activities and ensure his highest progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only a Being of power, wisdom, holiness, and goodness, and all these
          indefinitely greater than any that we know upon the earth, can meet
          this demand of the human soul. Such a Being must exist. Otherwise
          man&#x27;s greatest need would be unsupplied, and belief in a lie be
          more productive of virtue than belief in the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feuerbach calls God “the Brocken-shadow of man himself”;
          “consciousness of God = self-consciousness”; “religion is a dream of
          the human soul”; “all theology is anthropology”; “man made God in his
          own image.” But conscience shows that man does not recognize in God
          simply his like, but also his opposite. Not as Galton: “Piety =
          conscience + instability.” The finest minds are of the leaning type;
          see Murphy, Scientific Bases, 370; Augustine, Confessions, 1:1—“Thou
          hast made us for thyself, and our heart is restless till it finds rest
          in thee.” On John Stuart Mill—“a mind that could not find God, and a
          heart that could not do without him”—see his Autobiography, and
          Browne, in Strivings for the Faith (Christ. Ev. Socy.), 259-287.
          Comte, in his later days, constructed an object of worship in
          Universal Humanity, and invented a ritual which Huxley calls
          “Catholicism minus Christianity.” See also Tyndall, Belfast Address:
          “Did I not believe, said a great man to me once, that an Intelligence
          exists at the heart of things, my life on earth would be intolerable.”
          Martineau, Types of Ethical Theory, 1:505,506.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last line of Schiller&#x27;s Pilgrim reads: “Und das Dort ist
          niemals hier.” The finite never satisfies. Tennyson, Two Voices:
          “&#x27;Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant, Oh life, not death, for
          which we pant; More life, and fuller, that I want.” Seth, Ethical
          Principles, 419—“A moral universe, an absolute moral Being, is the
          indispensable environment of the ethical life, without which it cannot
          attain to its perfect growth.... There is a moral God, or this is no
          universe.” James, Will to Believe, 116—“A God is the most adequate
          possible object for minds framed like our own to conceive as lying at
          the root of the universe. Anything short of God is not a rational
          object, anything more than God is not possible, if man needs an object
          of knowledge, feeling, and will.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Romanes, Thoughts on Religion, 41—“To speak of the Religion of the
          Unknowable, the Religion of Cosmism, the Religion of Humanity, where
          the personality of the First Cause is not recognized, is as unmeaning
          as it would be to speak of the love of a triangle or the rationality
          of the equator.” It was said of Comte&#x27;s system that, “the wine of
          the real presence being poured out, we are asked to adore the empty
          cup.” “We want an object of devotion, and Comte presents us with a
          looking-glass”(Martineau). Huxley said he would as soon adore a
          wilderness of apes as the Positivist&#x27;s rationalized conception of
          humanity. It is only the ideal in humanity, the divine element in
          humanity that can be worshiped. And when we once conceive of this, we
          cannot be satisfied until we find it somewhere realized, as in Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upton, Hibbert Lectures, 265-272—Huxley believes that Evolution is “a
          materialized logical process”; that nothing endures save the flow of
          energy and “the rational order which pervades it.” In the earlier part
          of this process, nature, there is no morality or benevolence. But the
          process ends by producing man, who can make progress only by waging
          moral war against the natural forces which impel him. He must be
          benevolent and just. Shall we not say, in spite of Mr. Huxley, that
          this shows what the nature of the system is, and that there must be a
          benevolent and just Being who ordained it? Martineau, Seat of
          Authority, 63-68—“Though the authority of the higher incentive is
          self-known, it cannot be self-created; for while it is in me, it is
          above me.... This authority to which conscience introduces me, though
          emerging in consciousness, is yet objective to us all, and is
          necessarily referred to the nature of things, irrespective of the
          accidents of our mental constitution. It is not dependent on us, but
          independent. All minds born into the universe are ushered into the
          presence of a real righteousness, as surely as into a scene of actual
          space. Perception reveals another than ourselves; conscience reveals a
          higher than ourselves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We must freely grant, however, that this argument from man&#x27;s
          aspirations has weight only upon the supposition that a wise,
          truthful, holy, and benevolent God exists, who has so constituted our
          minds that their thinking and their affections correspond to truth and
          to himself. An evil being might have so constituted us that all logic
          would lead us into error. The argument is therefore the development
          and expression of our intuitive idea of God. Luthardt, Fundamental
          Truths: “Nature is like a written document containing only consonants.
          It is we who must furnish the vowels that shall decipher it. Unless we
          bring with us the idea of God, we shall find nature but dumb.” See
          also Pfleiderer, Die Religion, 1:174.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. The defects of the Anthropological Argument are: (a) It cannot
          prove a creator of the material universe. (b) It cannot prove the
          infinity of God, since man from whom we argue is finite. (c) It cannot
          prove the mercy of God. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          B. The value of the Argument is, that it assures us of the existence
          of a personal Being, who rules us in righteousness, and who is the
          proper object of supreme affection and service. But whether this Being
          is the original creator of all things, or merely the author of our own
          existence, whether he is infinite or finite, whether he is a Being of
          simple righteousness or also of mercy, this argument cannot assure us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the arguments for the existence of God, however, we assign to
          this the chief place, since it adds to the ideas of causative power
          (which we derived from the Cosmological Argument) and of contriving
          intelligence (which we derived from the Teleological Argument), the
          far wider ideas of personality and righteous lordship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir Wm. Hamilton, Works of Reid, 2:974, note U; Lect. on Metaph.,
          1:33—“The only valid arguments for the existence of God and for the
          immortality of the soul rest upon the ground of man&#x27;s moral
          nature”; “theology is wholly dependent upon psychology, for with the
          proof of the moral nature of man stands or falls the proof of the
          existence of a Deity.” But Diman, Theistic Argument, 244, very
          properly objects to making this argument from the nature of man the
          sole proof of Deity: “It should be rather used to show the attributes
          of the Being whose existence has been already proved from other
          sources”; “hence the Anthropological Argument is as dependent upon the
          Cosmological and Teleological Arguments as they are upon it.”

          Yet the Anthropological Argument is needed to supplement the
          conclusions of the two others. Those who, like Herbert Spencer,
          recognize an infinite and absolute Being, Power and Cause, may yet
          fail to recognize this being as spiritual and personal, simply because
          they do not recognize themselves as spiritual and personal beings,
          that is, do not recognize reason, conscience and free-will in man.
          Agnosticism in philosophy involves agnosticism in religion. R. K.
          Eccles: “All the most advanced languages capitalize the word ‘God,’
          and the word ‘I.’ ” See Flint, Theism, 68; Mill, Criticism of
          Hamilton, 2:266; Dove, Logic of Christian Faith, 211-236, 261-299;
          Martineau, Types, Introd., 3; Cooke, Religion and Chemistry: “God is
          love; but nature could not prove it, and the Lamb was slain from the
          foundation of the world in order to attest it.”

          Everything in philosophy depends on where we begin, whether with
          nature or with self, whether with the necessary or with the free. In
          one sense, therefore, we should in practice begin with the
          Anthropological Argument, and then use the Cosmological and
          Teleological Arguments as warranting the application to nature of the
          conclusions which we have drawn from man. As God stands over against
          man in Conscience, and says to him: “Thou”; so man stands over against
          God in Nature, and may say to him: “Thou.” Mulford, Republic of God,
          28—“As the personality of man has its foundation in the personality of
          God, so the realization by man of his own personality always brings
          man nearer to God.” Robert Browning: “Quoth a young Sadducee: ‘Reader
          of many rolls, Is it so certain we Have, as they tell us, souls?’
          ‘Son, there is no reply!’ The Rabbi bit his beard: ‘Certain, a soul
          have I—We may have none,’ he sneered. Thus Karshook, the Hiram&#x27;s
          Hammer, The Right-hand Temple-column, Taught babes in grace their
          grammar, And struck the simple, solemn.”

          It is very common at this place to treat of what are called the
          Historical and the Biblical Arguments for the existence of God—the
          former arguing, from the unity of history, the latter arguing, from
          the unity of the Bible, that this unity must in each case have for its
          cause and explanation the existence of God. It is a sufficient reason
          for not discussing these arguments, that, without a previous belief in
          the existence of God, no one will see unity either in history or in
          the Bible. Turner, the painter, exhibited a picture which seemed all
          mist and cloud until he put a dab of scarlet into it. That gave the
          true point of view, and all the rest became intelligible. So
          Christ&#x27;s coming and Christ&#x27;s blood make intelligible both
          the Scriptures and human history. He carries in his girdle the key to
          all mysteries. Schopenhauer, knowing no Christ, admitted no philosophy
          of history. He regarded history as the mere fortuitous play of
          individual caprice. Pascal: “Jesus Christ is the centre of everything,
          and the object of everything, and he that does not know him knows
          nothing of nature, and nothing of himself.”
