        <p>1st. The Myth-theory of Strauss (1808–1874).</p>
        <p>
          According to this view, the gospels are crystallizations into story of
          Messianic ideas which had for several generations filled the minds of
          imaginative men in Palestine. The myth is a narrative in which such
          ideas are unconsciously clothed, and from which the element of
          intentional and deliberate deception is absent.
        </p>
        <p>
          This early view of Strauss, which has become identified with his name,
          was exchanged in late years for a more advanced view which extended
          the meaning of the word ‘myths’ so as to include all narratives that
          spring out of a theological idea, and it admitted the existence of
          ‘pious frauds’ in the gospels. Baur, he says, first convinced him that
          the author of the fourth gospel had “not unfrequently composed mere
          fables, knowing them to be mere fictions.” The animating spirit of
          both the old view and the new is the same. Strauss says: “We know with
          certainty what Jesus was not, and what he has not done, namely,
          nothing superhuman and supernatural.” “No gospel can claim that degree
          of historic credibility that would be required in order to make us
          debase our reason to the point of believing miracles.” He calls the
          resurrection of Christ “ein weltgeschichtlicher Humbug.” “If the
          gospels are really historical documents, we cannot exclude miracle
          from the life-story of Jesus;” see Strauss, Life of Jesus, 17; New
          Life of Jesus, 1: preface, xii. Vatke, Einleitung in A, T., 210, 211,
          distinguishes the myth from the saga or legend: The criterion of the
          pure myth is that the experience is impossible, while the saga is a
          tradition of remote antiquity; the myth has in it the element only of
          belief, the saga has in it an element of history. Sabatier, Philos.
          Religion, 37—“A myth is false in appearance only. The divine Spirit
          can avail himself of the fictions of poetry as well as of logical
          reasonings. When the heart was pure, the veils of fable always allowed
          the face of truth to shine through. And does not childhood run on into
          maturity and old age?”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very certain that childlike love of truth was not the animating
          spirit of Strauss. On the contrary, his spirit was that of remorseless
          criticism and of uncompromising hostility to the supernatural. It has
          been well said that he gathered up all the previous objections of
          sceptics to the gospel narrative and hurled them in one mass, just as
          if some Sadducee at the time of Jesus’ trial had put all the taunts
          and gibes, all the buffetings and insults, all the shame and spitting,
          into one blow delivered straight into the face of the Redeemer. An
          octogenarian and saintly German lady said unsuspectingly that “somehow
          she never could get interested” in Strauss’s Leben Jesu, which her
          sceptical son had given her for religious reading. The work was almost
          altogether destructive, only the last chapter suggesting Strauss’s own
          view of what Jesus was.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Luther’s dictum is true that “the heart is the best theologian,”
          Strauss must be regarded as destitute of the main qualification for
          his task. Encyc. Britannica, 22:592—“Strauss’s mind was almost
          exclusively analytical and critical, without depth of religious
          feeling, or philosophical penetration, or historical sympathy. His
          work was rarely constructive, and, save when he was dealing with a
          kindred spirit, he failed as a historian, biographer, and critic,
          strikingly illustrating Goethe’s profoundly true principle that loving
          sympathy is essential for productive criticism.” Pfleiderer, Strauss’s
          Life of Jesus, xix—“Strauss showed that the church formed the mythical
          traditions about Jesus out of its faith in him as the Messiah; but he
          did not show how the church came by the faith that Jesus of Nazareth
          was the Messiah.” See Carpenter, Mental Physiology, 362; Grote, Plato,
          1:249.
        </p>
        <p>We object to the Myth-theory of Strauss, that</p>
        <p>
          (a) The time between the death of Christ and the publication of the
          gospels was far too short for the growth and consolidation of such
          mythical histories. Myths, on the contrary, as the Indian, Greek,
          Roman and Scandinavian instances bear witness, are the slow growth of
          centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The first century was not a century when such formation of myths
          was possible. Instead of being a credulous and imaginative age, it was
          an age of historical inquiry and of Sadduceeism in matters of
          religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horace, in Odes 1:34 and 3:6, denounces the neglect and squalor of the
          heathen temples, and Juvenal, Satire 2:150, says that “Esse aliquid
          manes et subterrantea regna Nee pueri credunt.” Arnold of Rugby: “The
          idea of men writing mythic histories between the times of Livy and of
          Tacitus, and of St. Paul mistaking them for realities!” Pilate’s
          sceptical inquiry, “What is truth?” (Joh_18:38), better represented
          the age. “The mythical age is past when an idea is presented
          abstractly—apart from narrative.” The Jewish sect of the Sadducees
          shows that the rationalistic spirit was not confined to Greeks or
          Romans. The question of John the Baptist, Mat_11:3—“Art thou he that
          cometh, or look we for another?” and our Lord’s answer, Mat_11:4-5—“Go
          and tell John the thing which ye hear and see: the blind receive their
          sight … the dead are raised up,” show that the Jews expected miracles
          to be wrought by the Messiah; yet Joh_10:41—“John indeed did no sign”
          shows also no irresistible inclination to invest popular teachers with
          miraculous powers; see E. G. Robinson, Christian Evidences, 22;
          Westcott, Com. on Joh_10:41; Rogers, Super-human Origin of the Bible,
          61; Cox, Miracles, 50.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The gospels cannot be a mythical outgrowth of Jewish ideas and
          expectations, because, in their main features, they run directly
          counter to these ideas and expectations. The sullen and exclusive
          nationalism of the Jews could not have given rise to a gospel for all
          nations, nor could their expectations of a temporal monarch have led
          to the story of a suffering Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          The O. T. Apocrypha shows how narrow was the outlook of the Jews.
          2Es_6:55-56 says the Almighty has made the world “for our sakes”;
          other peoples, though they “also come from Adam,” to the Eternal “are
          nothing, but be like unto spittle.” The whole multitude of them are
          only, before him, “like a single foul drop that oozes out of a cask”
          (C. Geikie, in S. S. Times). Christ’s kingdom differed from that which
          the Jews expected, both in its spirituality and its universality
          (Bruce, Apologetics, 3). There was no missionary impulse in the
          heathen world; on the other hand, it was blasphemy for an ancient
          tribesman to make known his god to an outsider (Nash, Ethics and
          Revelation, 106). The Apocryphal gospels show what sort of myths the
          N. T. age would have elaborated: Out of a demoniac young woman Satan
          is said to depart in the form of a young man (Bernard, in Literature
          of the Second Century, 99–136).
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The belief and propagation of such myths are inconsistent with
          what we know of the sober characters and self-sacrificing lives of the
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) The mythical theory cannot account for the acceptance of the
          gospels among the Gentiles, who had none of the Jewish ideas and
          expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) It cannot explain Christianity itself, with its belief in Christ’s
          crucifixion and resurrection, and the ordinances which commemorate
          these facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Witness Thomas’s doubting, and Paul’s shipwrecks and scourgings.
          Cf. 2Pe_1:16—οὐ γὰρ σεσοφισμένοις μύθοις ἐξακολουθήσαντες = “we have
          not been on the false track of myths artificially elaborated.” See F.
          W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 49–88. (e) See the two books
          entitled: If the Gospel Narratives are Mythical,—What Then? and, But
          How,—if the Gospels are Historic? (f) As the existence of the American
          Republic is proof that there was once a Revolutionary War, so the
          existence of Christianity is proof of the death of Christ. The change
          from the seventh day to the first, in Sabbath observance, could never
          have come about in a nation so Sabbatarian, had not the first day been
          the celebration of an actual resurrection. Like the Jewish Passover
          and our own Independence Day, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper cannot be
          accounted for, except as monuments and remembrances of historical
          facts at the beginning of the Christian church. See Muir, on the
          Lord’s Supper an abiding Witness to the Death of Christ, in Present
          Day Tracts, 6: no. 36. On Strauss and his theory, see Hackett, in
          Christian Rev., 48; Weiss, Life of Jesus, 155–163; Christlieb, Mod.
          Doubt and Christ. Belief, 379–425; Maclear, in Strivings for the
          Faith, 1–136; H. B. Smith, in Faith and Philosophy, 442–468; Bayne,
