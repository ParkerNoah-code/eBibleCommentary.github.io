        <h2>IV. Contents of this Intuition.</h2>
        <p>
          1. In this fundamental knowledge that God is, it is necessarily
          implied that to some extent men know intuitively what God is, namely,
          (a) a Reason in which their mental processes are grounded; (b) a Power
          above them upon which they are dependent; (c) a Perfection which
          imposes law upon their moral natures; (d) a Personality which they may
          recognize in prayer and worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In maintaining that we have a rational intuition of God, we by no
          means imply that a presentative intuition of God is impossible. Such a
          presentative intuition was perhaps characteristic of unfallen man; it
          does belong at times to the Christian; it will be the blessing of
          heaven (Mat. 5:8—“the pure in heart ... shall see God”; Rev.
          22:4—“they shall see his face”). Men&#x27;s experiences of
          face-to-face apprehension of God, in danger and guilt, give some
          reason to believe that a presentative knowledge of God is the normal
          condition of humanity. But, as this presentative intuition of God is
          not in our present state universal, we here claim only that all men
          have a rational intuition of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be remembered, however, that the loss of love to God has
          greatly obscured even this rational intuition, so that the revelation
          of nature and the Scriptures is needed to awaken, confirm and enlarge
          it, and the special work of the Spirit of Christ to make it the
          knowledge of friendship and communion. Thus from knowing about God, we
          come to know God (John 17:3—“This is life eternal, that they should
          know thee”; 2 Tim. 1:12—“I know him whom I have believed”).

          Plato said, for substance, that there can be no ὅτι οἶδεν without
          something of the ἁ οἶδεν. Harris, Philosophical Basis of Theism,
          208—“By rational intuition man knows that absolute Being exists; his
          knowledge of what it is, is progressive with his progressive knowledge
          of man and of nature.” Hutton, Essays: “A haunting presence besets man
          behind and before. He cannot evade it. It gives new meanings to his
          thoughts, new terror to his sins. It becomes intolerable. He is moved
          to set up some idol, carved out of his own nature, that will take its
          place—a non-moral God who will not disturb his dream of rest. It is a
          righteous Life and Will, and not the mere idea of righteousness that
          stirs men so.” Porter, Hum. Int., 661—“The Absolute is a thinking
          Agent.” The intuition does not grow in certainty; what grows is the
          mind&#x27;s quickness in applying it and power of expressing it. The
          intuition is not complex; what is complex is the Being intuitively
          cognized. See Calderwood, Moral Philosophy, 232; Lowndes, Philos. of
          Primary Beliefs, 108-112; Luthardt, Fund. Truths, 157—Latent faculty
          of speech is called forth by speech of others; the choked-up well
          flows again when debris is cleared away. Bowen, in Bib. Sac.,
          33:740-754; Bowne, Theism, 79.

          Knowledge of a person is turned into personal knowledge by actual
          communication or revelation. First, comes the intuitive knowledge of
          God possessed by all men—the assumption that there exists a Reason,
          Power, Perfection, Personality, that makes correct thinking and acting
          possible. Secondly, comes the knowledge of God&#x27;s being and
          attributes which nature and Scripture furnish. Thirdly, comes the
          personal and presentative knowledge derived from actual reconciliation
          and intercourse with God, through Christ and the Holy Spirit. Stearns,
          Evidence of Christian Experience, 208—“Christian experience verifies
          the claims of doctrine by experiment,—so transforming probable
          knowledge into real knowledge.” Biedermann, quoted by Pfleiderer,
          Grundriss, 18—“God reveals himself to the human spirit, 1. as its
          infinite Ground, in the reason; 2. as its infinite Norm, in the
          conscience; 3. as its infinite Strength, in elevation to religious
          truth, blessedness, and freedom.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I object to this Christian experience, because only
          comparatively few have it, and I am not among the number? Because I
          have not seen the moons of Jupiter, shall I doubt the testimony of the
          astronomer to their existence? Christian experience, like the sight of
          the moons of Jupiter, is attainable by all. Clarke, Christian
          Theology, 113—“One who will have full proof of the good God&#x27;s
          reality must put it to the experimental test. He must take the good
          God for real, and receive the confirmation that will follow. When
          faith reaches out after God, it finds him.... They who have found him
          will be the sanest and truest of their kind, and their convictions
          will be among the safest convictions of man.... Those who live in
          fellowship with the good God will grow in goodness, and will give
          practical evidence of his existence aside from their oral testimony.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Scriptures, therefore, do not attempt to prove the existence of
          God, but, on the other hand, both assume and declare that the
          knowledge that God is, is universal (Rom. 1:19-21, 28, 32; 2:15). God
          has inlaid the evidence of this fundamental truth in the very nature
          of man, so that nowhere is he without a witness. The preacher may
          confidently follow the example of Scripture by assuming it. But he
          must also explicitly declare it, as the Scripture does. “For the
          invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly
          seen” (καθορᾶται—spiritually viewed); the organ given for this purpose
          is the νοῦς (νοούμενα); but then—and this forms the transition to our
          next division of the subject—they are “perceived through the things
          that are made” (τοῖς ποιήμασιν, Rom. 1:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          On Rom. 1:19-21, see Weiss, Bib. Theol. des N. T., 251, note; also
          commentaries of Meyer, Alford, Tholuck, and Wordsworth; τὸ γνωστὸν τοῦ
          θεοῦ = not “that which may be known” (Rev. Vers.) but “that which is
          known” of God; νοούμενα καθορᾶται = are clearly seen in that they are
          perceived by the reason—νοούμενα expresses the manner of the καθορᾶται
          (Meyer); compare John 1:9; Acts 17:27; Rom. 1:28; 2:15. On 1 Cor.
          15:34, see Calderwood, Philos. of Inf., 466—ἀγνωσίαν Θεοῦ τινὲς ἔχουσι
          = do not possess the specially exalted knowledge of God which belongs
          to believers in Christ (cf. 1 Jo. 4:7—“every one that loveth is
          begotten of God, and knoweth God”). On Eph. 2:12, see Pope, Theology,
          1:240—ἄθεοι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ is opposed to being in Christ, and signifies
          rather forsaken of God, than denying him or entirely ignorant of him.
          On Scripture passages, see Schmid, Bib. Theol. des N. T., 486;
          Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, 1:62.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. G. Robinson: “The first statement of the Bible is, not that there
          is a God, but that ‘In the beginning God created the heavens and the
          earth’ (Gen. 1:1). The belief in God never was and never can be the
          result of logical argument, else the Bible would give us proofs.”Many
          texts relied upon as proofs of God&#x27;s existence are simply
          explications of the idea of God, as for example: Ps. 94:9, 10—“He that
          planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he
          not see? He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, even he
          that teacheth man knowledge?”Plato says that God holds the soul by its
          roots,—he therefore does not need to demonstrate to the soul the fact
          of his existence. Martineau, Seat of Authority, 308, says well that
          Scripture and preaching only interpret what is already in the heart
          which it addresses: “Flinging a warm breath on the inward oracles hid
          in invisible ink, it renders them articulate and dazzling as the
          handwriting on the wall. The divine Seer does not convey to you his
          revelation, but qualifies you to receive your own. This mutual
          relation is possible only through the common presence of God in the
          conscience of mankind.”Shedd, Dogmatic Theology, 1:195-220—“The earth
          and sky make the same sensible impressions on the organs of a brute
          that they do upon those of a man; but the brute never discerns the
          ‘invisible things’ of God, his ‘eternal power and godhood’ (Rom.
          1:20).”

          Our subconscious activity, so far as it is normal, is under the
          guidance of the immanent Reason. Sensation, before it results in
          thought, has in it logical elements which are furnished by mind—not
          ours, but that of the Infinite One. Christ, the Revealer of God,
          reveals God in every man&#x27;s mental life, and the Holy Spirit may
          be the principle of self-consciousness in man as in God. Harris, God
          the Creator, tells us that “man finds the Reason that is eternal and
          universal revealing itself in the exercise of his own reason.” Savage,
          Life after Death, 268—“How do you know that your subliminal
          consciousness does not tap Omniscience, and get at the facts of the
          universe?”Savage negatives this suggestion, however, and wrongly
          favors the spirit-theory. For his own experience, see pages 295-329 of
          his book.

          C. M. Barrows, in Proceedings of Soc. for Psychical Research, vol. 12,
          part 30, pages 34-36—“There is a subliminal agent. What if this is
          simply one intelligent Actor, filling the universe with his presence,
          as the ether fills space; the common Inspirer of all mankind, a
          skilled Musician, presiding over many pipes and keys, and playing
          through each what music he will? The subliminal self is a universal
          fountain of energy, and each man is an outlet of the stream. Each
          man&#x27;s personal self is contained in it, and thus each man is made
          one with every other man. In that deep Force, the last fact behind
          which analysis cannot go, all psychical and bodily effects find their
          common origin.” This statement needs to be qualified by the assertion
          of man&#x27;s ethical nature and distinct personality; see section of
          this work on Ethical Monism, in chapter III. But there is truth here
          like that which Coleridge sought to express in his Æolian Harp: “And
          what if all of animated Nature Be but organic harps diversely framed,
          That tremble into thought, as o&#x27;er them sweeps, Plastic and vast,
          one intellectual breeze, At once the soul of each, and God of all?”
          See F. W. H. Myers, Human Personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dorner, System of Theology, 1:75—“The consciousness of God is the true
          fastness of our self-consciousness.... Since it is only in the
          God-conscious man that the innermost personality comes to light, in
          like manner, by means of the interweaving of that consciousness of God
          and of the world, the world is viewed in God (‘sub specie
          eternitatis’), and the certainty of the world first obtains its
          absolute security for the spirit.” Royce, Spirit of Mod. Philosophy,
          synopsis in N. Y. Nation: “The one indubitable fact is the existence
          of an infinite self, a Logos or World-mind (345). That it exists is
          clear, I. Because idealism shows that real things are nothing more nor
          less than ideas, or ‘possibilities of experience’; but a mere
          ‘possibility’, as such, is nothing, and a world of ‘possible’
          experiences, in so far as it is real, must be a world of actual
          experience to some self (367). If then there be a real world, it has
          all the while existed as ideal and mental, even before it became known
          to the particular mind with which we conceive it as coming into
          connection (368). II. But there is such a real world; for, when I
          think of an object, when I mean it, I do not merely have in mind an
          idea resembling it, for I aim at the object, I pick it out, I already
          in some measure possess it. The object is then already present in
          essence to my hidden self (370). As truth consists in knowledge of the
          conformity of a cognition to its object, that alone can know a truth
          which includes within itself both idea and object. This inclusive
          Knower is the Infinite Self (374). With this I am in essence identical
          (371); it is my larger self (372); and this larger self alone is
          (379). It includes all reality, and we know other finite minds,
          because we are one with them in its unity” (409).

          The experience of George John Romanes is instructive. For years he
          could recognize no personal Intelligence controlling the universe. He
          made four mistakes: 1. He forgot that only love can see, that God is
          not disclosed to the mere intellect, but only to the whole man, to the
          integral mind, to what the Scripture calls “the eyes of your
          heart”(Eph. 1:18). Experience of life taught him at last the weakness
          of mere reasoning, and led him to depend more upon the affections and
          intuitions. Then, as one might say, he gave the X-rays of Christianity
          a chance to photograph God upon his soul. 2. He began at the wrong
          end, with matter rather than with mind, with cause and effect rather
          than with right and wrong, and so got involved in the mechanical order
          and tried to interpret the moral realm by it. The result was that
          instead of recognizing freedom, responsibility, sin, guilt, he threw
          them out as pretenders. But study of conscience and will set him
          right. He learned to take what be found instead of trying to turn it
          into something else, and so came to interpret nature by spirit,
          instead of interpreting spirit by nature. 3. He took the Cosmos by
          bits, instead of regarding it as a whole. His early thinking insisted
          on finding design in each particular part, or nowhere. But his more
          mature thought recognized wisdom and reason in the ordered whole. As
          he realized that this is a universe, he could not get rid of the idea
          of an organizing Mind. He came to see that the Universe, as a thought,
          implies a Thinker. 4. He fancied that nature excludes God, instead of
          being only the method of God&#x27;s working. When he learned how a
          thing was done, he at first concluded that God had not done it. His
          later thought recognized that God and nature are not mutually
          exclusive. So he came to find no difficulty even in miracles and
          inspiration; for the God who is in man and of whose mind and will
          nature is only the expression, can reveal himself, if need be, in
          special ways. So George John Romanes came back to prayer, to Christ,
          to the church.
