        <p>Chapter III. Erroneous Explanations, And Conclusion.</p>
        <p>
          Any correct explanation of the universe must postulate an intuitive
          knowledge of the existence of the external world, of self, and of God.
          The desire for scientific unity, however, has occasioned attempts to
          reduce these three factors to one, and according as one or another of
          the three has been regarded as the all-inclusive principle, the result
          has been Materialism, Materialistic Idealism, or Idealistic Pantheism.
          This scientific impulse is better satisfied by a system which we may
          designate as Ethical Monism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may summarize the present chapter as follows: 1. Materialism:
          Universe = Atoms. Reply: Atoms can do nothing without force, and can
          be nothing (intelligible) without ideas. 2. Materialistic Idealism:
          Universe = Force + Ideas. Reply: Ideas belong to Mind, and Force can
          be exerted only by Will. 3. Idealistic Pantheism: Universe = Immanent
          and Impersonal Mind and Will. Reply: Spirit in man shows that the
          Infinite Spirit must be Transcendent and Personal Mind and Will. We
          are led from these three forms of error to a conclusion which we may
          denominate 4. Ethical Monism: Universe = Finite, partial, graded
          manifestation of the divine Life; Matter being God&#x27;s
          self-limitation under the law of necessity, Humanity being God&#x27;s
          self-limitation under the law of freedom, Incarnation and Atonement
          being God&#x27;s self-limitations under the law of grace. Metaphysical
          Monism, or the doctrine of one Substance, Principle, or Ground of
          Being, is consistent with Psychological Dualism, or the doctrine that
          the soul is personally distinct from matter on the one hand and from
          God on the other.
