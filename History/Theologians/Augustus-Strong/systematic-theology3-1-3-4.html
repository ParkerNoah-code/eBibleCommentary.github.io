          4. The amount of testimony necessary to prove a miracle is no greater
          than that which is requisite to prove the occurrence of any other
          unusual but confessedly possible event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hume, indeed, argued that a miracle is so contradictory of all human
          experience that it is more reasonable to believe any amount of
          testimony false than to believe a miracle to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original form of the argument can be found in Hume’s Philosophical
          Works, 4:124–150. See also Bib. Sac., Oct. 1867:615. For the most
          recent and plausible statement of it, see Supernatural Religion,
          1:55–94. The argument maintains for substance that things are
          impossible because improbable. It ridicules the credulity of those who
          “thrust their fists against the posts, And still insist they see the
          ghosts,” and holds with the German philosopher who declared that he
          would not believe in a miracle, even if he saw one with his own eyes.
          Christianity is so miraculous that it takes a miracle to make one
          believe it.
        </p>
        <p>The argument is fallacious, because</p>
        <p>
          (a) It is chargeable with a petitio principii, in making our own
          personal experience the measure of all human experience. The same
          principle would make the proof of any absolutely new fact impossible.
          Even though God should work a miracle, he could never prove it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It involves a self-contradiction, since it seeks to overthrow our
          faith in human testimony by adducing to the contrary the general
          experience of men, of which we know only from testimony. This general
          experience, moreover, is merely negative, and cannot neutralize that
          which is positive, except upon principles which would invalidate all
          testimony whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) It requires belief in a greater wonder than those which it would
          escape. That multitudes of intelligent and honest men should against
          all their interests unite in deliberate and persistent falsehood,
          under the circumstances narrated in the New Testament record, involves
          a change in the sequences of nature far more incredible than the
          miracles of Christ and his apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) John Stuart Mill, Essays on Theism, 216–241, grants that, even if
          a miracle were wrought, it would be impossible to prove it. In this he
          only echoes Hume, Miracles, 112—“The ultimate standard by which we
          determine all disputes that may arise is always derived from
          experience and observation.” But here our own personal experience is
          made the standard by which to judge all human experience. Whately,
          Historic Doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte, shows that the same
          rule would require us to deny the existence of the great Frenchman,
          since Napoleon’s conquests were contrary to all experience, and
          civilized nations had never before been so subdued. The London Times
          for June 18, 1888, for the first time in at least a hundred years or
          in 31, 200 issues, was misdated, and certain pages read June 17,
          although June 17 was Sunday. Yet the paper would have been admitted in
          a court of justice as evidence of a marriage. The real wonder is, not
          the break in experience, but the continuity without the break.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Lyman Abbott: “If the Old Testament told the story of a naval
          engagement between the Jewish people and a pagan people, in which all
          the ships of the pagan people were absolutely destroyed and not a
          single man was killed among the Jews, all the sceptics would have
          scorned the narrative. Every one now believes it, except those who
          live in Spain.” There are people who in a similar way refuse to
          investigate the phenomena of hypnotism, second sight, clairvoyance,
          and telepathy, declaring a priori that all these things are
          impossible. Prophecy, in the sense of prediction, is discredited. Upon
          the same principle wireless telegraphy might be denounced as an
          imposture. The son of Erin charged with murder defended himself by
          Saying: “Your honor, I can bring fifty people who did not see me do
          it.” Our faith in testimony cannot be due to experience.
        </p>

          (c) On this point, see Chalmers, Christian Revelation, 3:70; Starkie
          on Evidence, 739; De Quincey, Theological Essays, 1:162–188; Thornton,
          Old-fashioned Ethics, 143–153; Campbell on Miracles. South’s sermon on
          The Certainty of our Savior’s Resurrection had stated and answered
          this objection long before Hume propounded it.
