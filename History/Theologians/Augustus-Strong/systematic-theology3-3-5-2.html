        <p>2. Errors in matters of History.</p>
        <p>To this objection we reply:</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are often mere mistakes in transcription,
          and have no force as arguments against inspiration, unless it can
          first be shown that inspired documents are by the very fact of their
          inspiration exempt from the operation of those laws which affect the
          transmission of other ancient documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no right to expect that the inspiration of the original writer
          will be followed by a miracle in the case of every copyist. Why
          believe in infallible copyists, more than in infallible printers? God
          educates us to care for his word, and for its correct transmission.
          Reverence has kept the Scriptures more free from various readings than
          are other ancient manuscripts. None of the existing variations
          endanger any important article of faith. Yet some mistakes in
          transcription there probably are. In 1Ch_22:14, instead of 100,000
          talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver (=$3,750,000,000),
          Josephus divides the sum by ten. Dr. Howard Osgood: “A French writer,
          Revillout, has accounted for the differing numbers in Kings and
          Chronicles, just as he accounts for the same differences in Egyptian
          and Assyrian later accounts, by the change in the value of money and
          debasement of issues. He shows the change all over Western Asia.” Per
          contra, see Bacon, Genesis of Gen_45:1-28.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2Ch_13:3; 2Ch_13:17, where the numbers of men in the armies of
          little Palestine are stated as 400,000 and 800,000, and 500,000 are
          said to have been slain in a single battle, “some ancient copies of
          the Vulgate and Latin translations of Josephus have 40,000, 80,000,
          and 50,000”; see Annotated Paragraph Bible, in loco. In 2Ch_17:14-19,
          Jehoshaphat’s army aggregates 1,160,000, besides the garrisons of his
          fortresses. It is possible that by errors in transcription these
          numbers have been multiplied by ten. Another explanation however, and
          perhaps a more probable one, is given under (d) below. Similarly,
          compare 1Sa_6:19, where 50,070 are slain, with the 70 of Josephus;
          2Sa_8:4—“1,700 horsemen,” with 1Ch_18:4—“7,000 horsemen”;
          Est_9:16—75,000 slain by the Jews, with LXX—15,000. In Mat_27:9, we
          have “Jeremiah” for “Zechariah”—this Calvin allows to be a mistake;
          and, if a mistake, then one made by the first copyist, for it appears
          in all the uncials, all the manuscripts and all the versions except
          the Syriac Peshito where it is omitted, evidently on the authority of
          the individual transcriber and translator. In Act_7:16—“the tomb that
          Abraham bought”—Hackett regards “Abraham” as a clerical error for
          “Jacob” (compare Gen_33:18-19). See Bible Com., 3:165, 249, 251, 317.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Other so-called errors are to be explained as a permissible use of
          round numbers, which cannot be denied to the sacred writers except
          upon the principle that mathematical accuracy was more important than
          the general impression to be secured by the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Num_25:9, we read that there fell in the plague 24,000; 1Co_10:8
          says 23,000. The actual number was possibly somewhere between the two.
          Upon a similar principle, we do not scruple to celebrate the Landing
          of the Pilgrims on December 22nd and the birth of Christ on December
          25th. We speak of the battle of Bunker Hill, although at Bunker Hill
          no battle was really fought. In Exo_12:40-41, the sojourn of the
          Israelites in Egypt is declared to be 430 years. Yet Paul, in
          Gal_3:17, says that the giving of the law through Moses was 430 years
          after the call of Abraham, whereas the call of Abraham took place 215
          years before Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt, and Paul should
          have said 645 years instead of 430. Franz Delitzsch: “The Hebrew Bible
          counts four centuries of Egyptian sojourn (Gen_15:13-16), more
          accurately, 430 years (Exo_12:40); but according to the LXX
          (Exo_12:40) this number comprehends the sojourn in Canaan and Egypt,
          so that 215 years come to the pilgrimage in Canaan, and 215 to the
          servitude in Egypt. This kind of calculation is not exclusively
          Hellenistic; it is also found in the oldest Palestinian Midrash. Paul
          stands on this side in Gal_3:17, making, not the immigration into
          Egypt, but the covenant with Abraham the terminus a quo of the 430
          years which end in the Exodus from Egypt and in the legislation”; see
          also Hovey, Com. on Gal_3:17. It was not Paul’s purpose to write
          chronology,—so he may follow the LXX, and call the time between the
          promise to Abraham and the giving of the law to Moses 430 years,
          rather than the actual 600. If he had given the larger number, it
          might have led to perplexity and discussion about a matter which had
          nothing to do with the vital question in hand. Inspiration may have
          employed current though inaccurate statements as to matters of
          history, because they were the best available means of impressing upon
          men’s minds truth of a more important sort. In Gen_15:13 the 430 years
          is called in round numbers 400 years, and so in Act_7:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Diversities of statement in accounts of the same event, so long as
          they touch no substantial truth, may be due to the meagreness of the
          narrative, and might be fully explained if some single fact, now
          unrecorded, were only known. To explain these apparent discrepancies
          would not only be beside the purpose of the record, but would destroy
          one valuable evidence of the independence of the several writers or
          witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the Stokes trial, the judge spoke of two apparently conflicting
          testimonies as neither of them necessarily false. On the difference
          between Matthew and Luke as to the scene of the Sermon on the Mount
          (Mat_5:1; cf. Luk_6:17) see Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, 360. As to
          one blind man or two (Mat_20:30; cf. Luk_18:35) see Bliss, Com. on
          Luke, 275, and Gardiner, in Bib. Sac., July, 1879:513, 514; Jesus may
          have healed the blind men during a day’s excursion from Jericho, and
          it might be described as “when they went out,” or “as they drew nigh
          to Jericho.” Prof. M. B. Riddle: “Luk_18:35 describes the general
          movement towards Jerusalem and not the precise detail preceding the
          miracle; Mat_20:30 intimates that the miracle occurred during an
          excursion from the city,—Luke afterwards telling of the final
          departure”; Calvin holds to two meetings; Godet to two cities; if
          Jesus healed two blind men, he certainly healed one, and Luke did not
          need to mention more than one, even if he knew of both; see Broadus on
          Mat_20:30. In Mat_8:28, where Matthew has two demoniacs at Gadara and
          Luke has only one at Gerasa, Broadus supposes that the village of
          Gerasa belonged to the territory of the city of Gadara, a few miles to
          the Southeast of the lake, and he quotes the case of Lafayette: “In
          the year 1824 Lafayette visited the United States and was welcomed
          with honors and pageants. Some historians will mention only Lafayette,
          but others will relate the same visit as made and the same honors ae
          enjoyed by two persons, namely, Lafayette and his son. Will not both
          be right?” On Christ’s last Passover, see Robinson, Harmony, 212; E.
          H. Sears, Fourth Gospel Appendix A; Edersheim, Life and Times of the
          Messiah, 2:507. Augustine: “Locutiones variæ, sed non contrariæ:
          diversæ, sed non adversæ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bartlett, in Princeton Rev., Jan. 1880:46, 47, gives the following
          modern illustrations: Window’s Journal (of Plymouth Plantation) speaks
          of a ship sent out “by Master Thomas Weston.” But Bradford in his far
          briefer narrative of the matter, mentions it as sent “by Mr. Weston
          and another.” John Adams, in his letters, tells the story of the
          daughter of Otis about her father’s destruction of his own
          manuscripts. At one time he makes her say: “In one of his unhappy
          moments he committed them all to the flames”; yet, in the second
          letter, she is made to say that “he was several days in doing it.” One
          newspaper says: President Hayes attended the Bennington centennial;
          another newspaper says: the President and Mrs. Hayes; a third: the
          President and his Cabinet; a fourth: the President, Mrs. Hayes and a
          majority of his Cabinet. Archibald Forbes, in his account of Napoleon
          III at Sedan, points out an agreement of narratives as to the salient
          points, combined with “the hopeless and bewildering discrepancies as
          to details,” even as these are reported by eye-witnesses, including
          himself, Bismarck, and General Sheridan who was on the ground, as well
          as others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thayer, Change of Attitude, 52, speaks of Luke’s “plump anachronism in
          the matter of Theudas”—Act_5:36—“For before those days rose up
          Theudas.” Josephus, Antiquities, 20:5:1, mentions an insurrectionary
          Theudas, but the date and other incidents do not agree with those of
          Luke. Josephus however may have mistaken the date as easily as Luke,
          or he may refer to another man of the same name. The inscription on
          the Cross is given in Mar_15:26, as “The King of the Jews”; in
          Luk_23:38, as “This is the King of the Jews”; in Mat_27:37, as “This
          is Jesus the King of the Jews”; and in Joh_19:19, as “Jesus of
          Nazareth the King of the Jews.” The entire superscription, in Hebrew,
          Greek and Latin, may have contained every word given by the several
          evangelists combined, and may have read “This is Jesus of Nazareth,
          the King of the Jews,” and each separate report may be entirely
          correct so far as it goes. See, on the general subject, Haley, Alleged
          Discrepancies; Fisher, Beginnings of Christianity, 406–412.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) While historical and archæological discovery in many important
          particulars goes to sustain the general correctness of the Scripture
          narratives, and no statement essential to the moral and religious
          teaching of Scripture has been invalidated, inspiration is still
          consistent with much imperfection in historical detail and its
          narratives “do not seem to be exempted from possibilities of error.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The words last quoted are those of Sanday. In his Bampton Lectures on
          Inspiration, 400, he remarks that “Inspiration belongs to the
          historical books rather as conveying a religious lesson, than as
          histories; rather as interpreting, than as narrating plain matter of
          fact. The crucial issue is that in these last respects they do not
          seem to be exempted from possibilities of error.” R. V. Foster,
          Systematic Theology, (Cumberland Presbyterian): The Scripture writers
          “were not inspired to do otherwise than to take these statements as
          they found them.” Inerrancy is not freedom from misstatements, but
          from error defined as “that which misleads in any serious or important
          sense.” When we compare the accounts of 1 and 2 Chronicles with those
          of 1 and 2 Kings we find in the former an exaggeration of numbers, a
          suppression of material unfavorable to the writer’s purpose, and an
          emphasis upon that which is favorable, that contrasts strongly with
          the method of the latter. These characteristics are so continuous that
          the theory of mistakes in transcription does not seem sufficient to
          account for the facts. The author’s aim was to draw out the religious
          lessons of the story, and historical details are to him of comparative
          unimportance.
        </p>
        <p>
          H. P. Smith, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 108—“Inspiration did
          not correct the Chronicler’s historical point of view, more than it
          corrected his scientific point of view, which no doubt made the earth
          the centre of the solar system. It therefore left him open to receive
          documents, and to use them, which idealized the history of the past,
          and described David and Solomon according to the ideas of later times
          and the priestly class. David’s sins are omitted, and numbers are
          multiplied, to give greater dignity to the earlier kingdom.” As
          Tennyson’s Idylls of the King give a nobler picture of King Arthur,
          and a more definite aspect to his history, than actual records
          justify, yet the picture teaches great moral and religious lessons, so
          the Chronicler seems to have manipulated his material in the interest
          of religion. Matters of arithmetic were minor matters. “Majoribus
          intentus est.”
        </p>
        <p>
          E. G. Robinson: “The numbers of the Bible are characteristic of a
          semi-barbarous age. The writers took care to guess enough. The
          tendency of such an age is always to exaggerate.” Two Formosan savages
          divide five pieces between them by taking two apiece and throwing one
          away. The lowest tribes can count only with the fingers of their
          hands; when they use their toes as well, it marks an advance in
          civilization. To the modern child a hundred is just as great a number
          as a million. So the early Scriptures seem to use numbers with a
          childlike ignorance as to their meaning. Hundreds of thousands can be
          substituted for tens of thousands, and the substitution seems only a
          proper tribute to the dignity of the subject. Gore, in Lux Mundt,
          353—“This was not conscious perversion, but unconscious idealizing of
          history, the reading back into past records of a ritual development
          which was really later. Inspiration excludes conscious deception, but
          it appears to be quite consistent with this sort of idealizing; always
          supposing that the result read back into the earlier history does
          represent the real purpose of God and only anticipates the
          realization.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some who contend that these historical imperfections are due
          to transcription and that they did not belong to the original
          documents. Watts, New Apologetic, 71, 111, when asked what is gained
          by contending for infallible original autographs if they have been
          since corrupted, replies: “Just what we gain by contending for the
          original perfection of human nature, though man has since corrupted
          it. We must believe God’s own testimony about his own work. God may
          permit others to do what, as a holy righteous God, he cannot do
          himself.” When the objector declares it a matter of little consequence
          whether a pair of trousers were or were not originally perfect, so
          long as they are badly rent just now, Watts replies: “The tailor who
          made them would probably prefer to have it understood that the
          trousers did not leave his shop in their present forlorn condition.
          God drops no stitches and sends out no imperfect work.” Watts however
          seems dominated by an a priori theory of inspiration, which blinds him
          to the actual facts of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evans, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 40—“Does the present error
          destroy the inspiration of the Bible as we have it? No. Then why
          should the original error destroy the inspiration of the Bible, as it
          was first given? There are spots on yonder sun; do they stop its being
          the sun? Why, the sun is all the more a sun for the spots. So the
          Bible.” Inspiration seems to have permitted the gathering of such
          material as was at hand, very much as a modern editor might construct
          his account of an army movement from the reports of a number of
          observers; or as a modern historian might combine the records of a
          past age with all their imperfections of detail. In the case of the
          Scripture writers, however, we maintain that inspiration has permitted
          no sacrifice of moral and religious truth in the completed Scripture,
          but has woven its historical material together into an organic whole
          which teaches all the facts essential to the knowledge of Christ and
          of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we come to examine in detail what purport to be historical
          narratives, we must be neither credulous nor sceptical, but simply
          candid and open-minded. With regard for example to the great age of
          the Old Testament patriarchs, we are no more warranted in rejecting
          the Scripture accounts upon the ground that life in later times is so
          much shorter, than we are to reject the testimony of botanists as to
          trees of the Sequoia family between four and five hundred feet high,
          or the testimony of geologists as to Saurians a hundred feet long,
          upon the ground that the trees and reptiles with which we are
          acquainted are so much smaller. Every species at its introduction
          seems to exhibit the maximum of size and vitality. Weismann, Heredity,
          6, 30—“Whales live some hundreds of years; elephants two hundred—their
          gestation taking two years. Giants prove that the plan upon which man
          is constructed can also be carried out on a scale far larger than the
          normal one.” E. Bay Lankester, Adv. of Science, 205–237, 236—agrees
          with Weismann iu his general theory. Sir George Cornewall Lewis long
          denied centenarism, but at last had to admit it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles Dudley Warner, in Harper’s Magazine, Jan. 1895, gives
          instances of men 137, 140, and 192 years old. The German Haller
          asserts that “the ultimate limit of human life does not exceed two
          centuries: to fix the exact number of years is exceedingly difficult.”
          J. Norman Lockyer, in Nature, regards the years of the patriarchs as
          lunar years. In Egypt, the sun being used, the unit of time was a
          year; but in Chaldea, the unit of time was a month, for the reason
          that the standard of time was the moon. Divide the numbers by twelve,
          and the lives of the patriarchs come out very much the same length
          with lives at the present day. We may ask, however, how this theory
          would work in shortening the lives between Noah and Moses. On the
          genealogies in Matthew and Luke, see Lord Harvey, Genealogies of our
