        <h2>II. The Existence of God a first truth.</h2>
        <p>1. Its universality.</p>
        <p>
          That the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence answers the first criterion
          of universality, is evident from the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. It is an acknowledged fact that the vast majority of men have
          actually recognized the existence of a spiritual being or beings, upon
          whom they conceived themselves to be dependent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vedas declare: “There is but one Being—no second.” Max Müller,
          Origin and Growth of Religion, 34—“Not the visible sun, moon and stars
          are invoked, but something else that cannot be seen.” The lowest
          tribes have conscience, fear death, believe in witches, propitiate or
          frighten away evil fates. Even the fetich-worshiper, who calls the
          stone or the tree a god, shows that he has already the idea of a God.
          We must not measure the ideas of the heathen by their capacity for
          expression, any more than we should judge the child&#x27;s belief in
          the existence of his father by his success in drawing the
          father&#x27;s picture. On heathenism, its origin and nature, see
          Tholuck, in Bib. Repos., 1832:86; Scholz, Götzendienst und
          Zauberwesen.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Those races and nations which have at first seemed destitute of
          such knowledge have uniformly, upon further investigation, been found
          to possess it, so that no tribe of men with which we have thorough
          acquaintance can be said to be without an object of worship. We may
          presume that further knowledge will show this to be true of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moffat, who reported that certain African tribes were destitute of
          religion, was corrected by the testimony of his son-in-law,
          Livingstone: “The existence of God and of a future life is everywhere
          recognized in Africa.” Where men are most nearly destitute of any
          formulated knowledge of God, the conditions for the awakening of the
          idea are most nearly absent. An apple-tree may be so conditioned that
          it never bears apples. “We do not judge of the oak by the stunted,
          flowerless specimens on the edge of the Arctic Circle.” The presence
          of an occasional blind, deaf or dumb man does not disprove the
          definition that man is a seeing, hearing and speaking creature. Bowne,
          Principles of Ethics, 154—“We need not tremble for mathematics, even
          if some tribes should be found without the multiplication-table....
          Sub-moral and sub-rational existence is always with us in the case of
          young children; and, if we should find it elsewhere, it would have no
          greater significance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Victor Hugo: “Some men deny the Infinite; some, too, deny the sun;
          they are the blind.” Gladden, What is Left? 148—“A man may escape from
          his shadow by going into the dark; if he comes under the light of the
          sun, the shadow is there. A man may be so mentally undisciplined that
          he does not recognize these ideas; but let him learn the use of his
          reason, let him reflect on his own mental processes, and he will know
          that they are necessary ideas.” On an original monotheism, see
          Diestel, in Jahrbuch für deutsche Theologie, 1860, and vol. 5:669; Max
          Müller, Chips, 1:337; Rawlinson, in Present Day Tracts, No. 11; Legge,
          Religions of China, 8-11; Shedd, Dogmatic Theology, 1:201-208. Per
          contra, see Asmus, Indogerm. Relig., 2:1-8; and synopsis in Bib. Sac.,
          Jan. 1877:167-172.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that those individuals,
          in heathen or in Christian lands, who profess themselves to be without
          any knowledge of a spiritual power or powers above them, do yet
          indirectly manifest the existence of such an idea in their minds and
          its positive influence over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comte said that science would conduct God to the frontier and then bow
          him out, with thanks for his provisional services. But Herbert Spencer
          affirms the existence of a “Power to which no limit in time or space
          is conceivable, of which all phenomena as presented in consciousness
          are manifestations.” The intuition of God, though formally excluded,
          is implicitly contained in Spencer&#x27;s system, in the shape of the
          “irresistible belief” in Absolute Being, which distinguishes his
          position from that of Comte; see H. Spencer, who says: “One truth must
          ever grow clearer—the truth that there is an inscrutable existence
          everywhere manifested, to which we can neither find nor conceive
          beginning or end—the one absolute certainty that we are ever in the
          presence of an infinite and eternal energy from which all things
          proceed.” Mr. Spencer assumes unity in the underlying Reality.
          Frederick Harrison sneeringly asks him: “Why not say ‘forces,’ instead
          of ‘force’?” While Harrison gives us a supreme moral ideal without a
          metaphysical ground, Spencer gives us an ultimate metaphysical
          principle without a final moral purpose. The idea of God is the
          synthesis of the two,—“They are but broken lights of Thee, And thou, O
          Lord, art more than they” (Tennyson, In Memoriam).
        </p>
        <p>
          Solon spoke of ὁ θεός and of τὸ θεῖον, and Sophocles of ὁ μέγας θεός.
          The term for “God” is identical in all the Indo-European languages,
          and therefore belonged to the time before those languages separated;
          see Shedd, Dogm. Theol., 1:201-208. In Virgil&#x27;s Æneid, Mezentius
          is an atheist, a despiser of the gods, trusting only in his spear and
          in his right arm; but, when the corpse of his son is brought to him,
          his first act is to raise his hands to heaven. Hume was a sceptic, but
          he said to Ferguson, as they walked on a starry night: “Adam, there is
          a God!” Voltaire prayed in an Alpine thunderstorm. Shelley wrote his
          name in the visitors&#x27; book of the inn at Montanvert, and added:
          “Democrat, philanthropist, atheist”; yet he loved to think of a “fine
          intellectual spirit pervading the universe”; and he also wrote: “The
          One remains, the many change and pass; Heaven&#x27;s light forever
          shines, Earth&#x27;s shadows fly.” Strauss worships the Cosmos,
          because “order and law, reason and goodness” are the soul of it. Renan
          trusts in goodness, design, ends. Charles Darwin, Life, 1:274—“In my
          most extreme fluctuations, I have never been an atheist, in the sense
          of denying the existence of a God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          D. This agreement among individuals and nations so widely separated in
          time and place can be most satisfactorily explained by supposing that
          it has its ground, not in accidental circumstances, but in the nature
          of man as man. The diverse and imperfectly developed ideas of the
          supreme Being which prevail among men are best accounted for as
          misinterpretations and perversions of an intuitive conviction common
          to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Huxley, Lay Sermons, 163—“There are savages without God, in any proper
          sense of the word; but there are none without ghosts.” Martineau,
          Study, 2:353, well replies: “Instead of turning other people into
          ghosts, and then appropriating one to ourselves [and attributing
          another to God, we may add] by way of imitation, we start from the
          sense of personal continuity, and then predicate the same of others,
          under the figures which keep most clear of the physical and
          perishable.” Grant Allen describes the higher religions as “a
          grotesque fungoid growth,” that has gathered about a primitive thread
          of ancestor-worship. But this is to derive the greater from the less.
          Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, 358—“I can find no trace of ancestor-worship
          in the earliest literature of Babylonia which has survived to us”—this
          seems fatal to Huxley&#x27;s and Allen&#x27;s view that the idea of
          God is derived from man&#x27;s prior belief in spirits of the dead. C.
          M. Tyler, in Am. Jour. Theo., Jan. 1899:144—“It seems impossible to
          deify a dead man, unless there is embryonic in primitive consciousness
          a prior concept of Deity.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Renouf, Religion of Ancient Egypt, 93—“The whole mythology of Egypt
          ... turns on the histories of Ra and Osiris.... Texts are discovered
          which identify Osiris and Ra.... Other texts are known wherein Ra,
          Osiris, Amon, and all other gods disappear, except as simple names,
          and the unity of God is asserted in the noblest language of
          monotheistic religion.” These facts are earlier than any known
          ancestor-worship. “They point to an original idea of divinity above
          humanity” (see Hill, Genetic Philosophy, 317). We must add the idea of
          the superhuman, before we can turn any animism or ancestor-worship
          into a religion. This superhuman element was suggested to early man by
          all he saw of nature about him, especially by the sight of the heavens
          above, and by what he knew of causality within. For the evidence of a
          universal recognition of a superior power, see Flint, Anti-theistic
          Theories, 250-289, 522-533; Renouf, Hibbert Lectures for 1879:100;
          Bib. Sac., Jan. 1884:132-157; Peschel, Races of Men, 261; Ulrici, Leib
          und Seele, 688, and Gott und die Natur, 658-670, 758; Tylor, Primitive
          Culture, 1:377, 381, 418; Alexander, Evidences of Christianity, 22;

          Religion, 50; Methodist Quar. Rev., Jan. 1875:1; J. F. Clark, Ten
          Great Religions, 2:17-21.
        </p>
        <p>2. Its necessity.</p>
        <p>
          That the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence answers the second
          criterion of necessity, will be seen by considering:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. That men, under circumstances fitted to call forth this knowledge,
          cannot avoid recognizing the existence of God. In contemplating finite
          existence, there is inevitably suggested the idea of an infinite Being
          as its correlative. Upon occasion of the mind&#x27;s perceiving its
          own finiteness, dependence, responsibility, it immediately and
          necessarily perceives the existence of an infinite and unconditioned
          Being upon whom it is dependent and to whom it is responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could not recognize the finite as finite, except by comparing it
          with an already existing standard—the Infinite. Mansel, Limits of
          Religious Thought, lect. 3—“We are compelled by the constitution of
          our minds to believe in the existence of an Absolute and Infinite
          Being—a belief which appears forced upon us as the complement of our
          consciousness of the relative and finite.” Fisher, Journ. Chr.
          Philos., Jan. 1883:113—“Ego and non-ego, each being conditioned by the
          other, presuppose unconditioned being on which both are dependent.
          Unconditioned being is the silent presupposition of all our knowing.”
          Perceived dependent being implies an independent; independent being is
          perfectly self-determining; self-determination is personality; perfect
          self-determination is infinite Personality. John Watson, in Philos.
          Rev., Sept. 1893:526—“There is no consciousness of self apart from the
          consciousness of other selves and things; and no consciousness of the
          world apart from the consciousness of the single Reality presupposed
          in both.” E. Caird, Evolution of Religion, 64-68—In every act of
          consciousness the primary elements are implied: “the idea of the
          object, or not-self; the idea of the subject, or self; and the idea of
          the unity which is presupposed in the difference of the self and
          not-self, and within which they act and react on each other.”See
          Calderwood, Philos. of Infinite, 46, and Moral Philos., 77; Hopkins,
          Outline Study of Man, 283-285; Shedd, Dogm. Theol., 1:211.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. That men, in virtue of their humanity, have a capacity for
          religion. This recognized capacity for religion is proof that the idea
          of God is a necessary one. If the mind upon proper occasion did not
          evolve this idea, there would be nothing in man to which religion
          could appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It is the suggestion of the Infinite that makes the line of the far
          horizon, seen over land or sea, so much more impressive than the
          beauties of any limited landscape.” In times of sudden shock and
          danger, this rational intuition becomes a presentative intuition,—men
          become more conscious of God&#x27;s existence than of the existence of
          their fellow-men and they instinctively cry to God for help. In the
          commands and reproaches of the moral nature the soul recognizes a
          Lawgiver and Judge whose voice conscience merely echoes. Aristotle
          called man “a political animal”; it is still more true, as Sabatier
          declares, that “man is incurably religious.” St. Bernard: “Noverim me,
          noverim te.” O. P. Gifford: “As milk, from which under proper
          conditions cream does not rise, is not milk, so the man, who upon
          proper occasion shows no knowledge of God, is not man, but brute.” We
          must not however expect cream from frozen milk. Proper environment and
          conditions are needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the recognition of a divine Personality in nature which
          constitutes the greatest merit and charm of Wordsworth&#x27;s poetry.
          In his Tintern Abbey, he speaks of “A presence that disturbs me with
          the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more
          deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And
          the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky and in the mind
          of man: A motion and a spirit that impels All thinking things, all
          objects of all thought, And rolls through all things.” Robert Browning
          sees God in humanity, as Wordsworth sees God in nature. In his
          Hohenstiel-Schwangau he writes: “This is the glory, that in all
          conceived Or felt or known, I recognize a Mind—Not mine, but like
          mine—for the double joy Making all things for me, and me for Him.”
          John Ruskin held that the foundation of beauty in the world is the
          presence of God in it. In his youth he tells us that he had “a
          continual perception of sanctity in the whole of nature, from the
          slightest thing to the vastest—an instinctive awe mixed with delight,
          an indefinable thrill such as we sometimes imagine to indicate the
          presence of a disembodied spirit.” But it was not a disembodied, but
          an embodied, Spirit that he saw. Nitzsch, Christian Doctrine, §
          7—“Unless education and culture were preceded by an innate
          consciousness of God as an operative predisposition, there would be
          nothing for education and culture to work upon.” On Wordsworth&#x27;s
          recognition of a divine personality in nature, see Knight, Studies,
          282-317, 405-426; Hutton, Essays, 2:113.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. That he who denies God&#x27;s existence must tacitly assume that
          existence in his very argument, by employing logical processes whose
          validity rests upon the fact of God&#x27;s existence. The full proof
          of this belongs under the next head.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am an atheist, God knows”—was the absurd beginning of an argument
          to disprove the divine existence. Cutler, Beginnings of Ethics,
          22—“Even the Nihilists, whose first principle is that God and duty are
          great bugbears to be abolished, assume that God and duty exist, and
          they are impelled by a sense of duty to abolish them.”Mrs. Browning,
          The Cry of the Human: “ ‘There is no God,’ the foolish saith; But
          none, ‘There is no sorrow’; And nature oft the cry of faith In bitter
          need will borrow: Eyes which the preacher could not school By wayside
          graves are raised; And lips say, ‘God be pitiful,’ Who ne&#x27;er
          said, ‘God be praised.’ ” Dr. W. W. Keen, when called to treat an
          Irishman&#x27;s aphasia, said: “Well, Dennis, how are you?” “Oh,
          doctor, I cannot spake!” “But, Dennis, you are speaking.” “Oh, doctor,
          it&#x27;s many a word I cannot spake!” “Well, Dennis, now I will try
          you. See if you cannot say, ‘Horse.’ ” “Oh, doctor dear, ‘horse’ is
          the very word I cannot spake!” On this whole section, see A. M.
          Fairbairn, Origin and Development of the Idea of God, in Studies in
          Philos. of Relig. and History; Martineau, Religion and Materialism,
          45; Bishop Temple, Bampton Lectures, 1884:37-65.
        </p>
        <p>3. Its logical independence and priority.</p>
        <p>
          That the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence answers the third criterion
          of logical independence and priority, may be shown as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. It is presupposed in all other knowledge as its logical condition
          and foundation. The validity of the simplest mental acts, such as
          sense-perception, self-consciousness, and memory, depends upon the
          assumption that a God exists who has so constituted our minds that
          they give us knowledge of things as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. of Religion, 1:88—“The ground of science and of
          cognition generally is to be found neither in the subject nor in the
          object per se, but only in the divine thinking that combines the two,
          which, as the common ground of the forms of thinking in all finite
          minds, and of the forms of being in all things, makes possible the
          correspondence or agreement between the former and the latter, or in a
          word makes knowledge of truth possible.” 91—“Religious belief is
          presupposed in all scientific knowledge as the basis of its
          possibility.” This is the thought of Psalm 36:10—“In thy light shall
          we see light.” A. J. Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 303—“The
          uniformity of nature cannot be proved from experience, for it is what
          makes proof from experience possible.... Assume it, and we shall find
          that facts conform to it.... 309—The uniformity of nature can be
          established only by the aid of that principle itself, and is
          necessarily involved in all attempts to prove it.... There must be a
          God, to justify our confidence in innate ideas.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge, 276—“Reflection shows that the
          community of individual intelligences is possible only through an
          all-embracing Intelligence, the source and creator of finite minds.”
          Science rests upon the postulate of a world-order. Huxley: “The object
          of science is the discovery of the rational order which pervades the
          universe.” This rational order presupposes a rational Author. Dubois,
          in New Englander, Nov. 1890:468—“We assume uniformity and continuity,
          or we can have no science. An intelligent Creative Will is a genuine
          scientific hypothesis [postulate?], suggested by analogy and confirmed
          by experience, not contradicting the fundamental law of uniformity but
          accounting for it.” Ritchie, Darwin and Hegel, 18—“That nature is a
          system, is the assumption underlying the earliest mythologies: to fill
          up this conception is the aim of the latest science.” Royce, Relig.
          Aspect of Philosophy, 435—“There is such a thing as error; but error
          is inconceivable unless there be such a thing as truth; and truth is
          inconceivable unless there be a seat of truth, an infinite
          all-including Thought or Mind; therefore such a Mind exists.”

          B. The more complex processes of the mind, such as induction and
          deduction, can be relied on only by presupposing a thinking Deity who
          has made the various parts of the universe and the various aspects of
          truth to correspond to each other and to the investigating faculties
          of man.

          We argue from one apple to the others on the tree. Newton argued from
          the fall of an apple to gravitation in the moon and throughout the
          solar system. Rowland argued from the chemistry of our world to that
          of Sirius. In all such argument there is assumed a unifying thought
          and a thinking Deity. This is Tyndall&#x27;s “scientific use of the
          imagination.” “Nourished,” he says, “by knowledge partially won, and
          bounded by coöperant reason, imagination is the mightiest instrument
          of the physical discoverer.” What Tyndall calls “imagination”, is
          really insight into the thoughts of God, the great Thinker. It
          prepares the way for logical reasoning,—it is not the product of mere
          reasoning. For this reason Goethe called imagination “die Vorschule
          des Denkens,” or “thought&#x27;s preparatory school.”

          Peabody, Christianity the Religion of Nature, 23—“Induction is
          syllogism, with the immutable attributes of God for a constant term.”
          Porter, Hum. Intellect, 492—“Induction rests upon the assumption, as
          it demands for its ground, that a personal or thinking Deity exists”;
          658—“It has no meaning or validity unless we assume that the universe
          is constituted in such a way as to presuppose an absolute and
          unconditioned originator of its forces and laws”; 662—“We analyze the
          several processes of knowledge into their underlying assumptions, and
          we find that the assumption which underlies them all is that of a
          self-existent Intelligence who not only can be known by man, but must
          be known by man in order that man may know anything besides”; see also
          pages 486, 508, 509, 518, 519, 585, 616. Harris, Philos. Basis of
          Theism, 81—“The processes of reflective thought imply that the
          universe is grounded in, and is the manifestation of, reason”;
          560—“The existence of a personal God is a necessary datum of
          scientific knowledge.” So also, Fisher, Essays on Supernat. Origin of
          Christianity, 564, and in Journ. Christ. Philos., Jan. 1883:129, 130.

          C. Our primitive belief in final cause, or, in other words, our
          conviction that all things have their ends, that design pervades the
          universe, involves a belief in God&#x27;s existence. In assuming that
          there is a universe, that the universe is a rational whole, a system
          of thought-relations, we assume the existence of an absolute Thinker,
          of whose thought the universe is an expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. of Religion, 1:81—“The real can only be thinkable
          if it is realized thought, a thought previously thought, which our
          thinking has only to think again. Therefore the real, in order to be
          thinkable for us, must be the realized thought of the creative
          thinking of an eternal divine Reason which is presented to our
          cognitive thinking.” Royce, World and Individual, 2:41—“Universal
          teleology constitutes the essence of all facts.” A. H. Bradford, The
          Age of Faith, 142—“Suffering and sorrow are universal. Either God
          could prevent them and would not, and therefore he is neither
          beneficent nor loving; or else he cannot prevent them and therefore
          something is greater than God, and therefore there is no God? But here
          is the use of reason in the individual reasoning. Reasoning in the
          individual necessitates the absolute or universal reason. If there is
          the absolute reason, then the universe and history are ordered and
          administered in harmony with reason; then suffering and sorrow can be
          neither meaningless nor final, since that would be the contradiction
          of reason. That cannot be possible in the universal and absolute which
          contradicts reason in man.”

        <p>
          D. Our primitive belief in moral obligation, or, in other words, our
          conviction that right has universal authority, involves the belief in
          God&#x27;s existence. In assuming that the universe is a moral whole,
          we assume the existence of an absolute Will, of whose righteousness
          the universe is an expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. of Religion, 1:88—“The ground of moral obligation
          is found neither in the subject nor in society, but only in the
          universal or divine Will that combines both.... 103—The idea of God is
          the unity of the true and the good, or of the two highest ideas which
          our reason thinks as theoretical reason, but demands as practical
          reason.... In the idea of God we find the only synthesis of the world
          that is—the world of science, and of the world that ought to be—the
          world of religion.” Seth, Ethical Principles, 425—“This is not a
          mathematical demonstration. Philosophy never is an exact science.
          Rather is it offered as the only sufficient foundation of the moral
          life.... The life of goodness ... is a life based on the conviction
          that its source and its issues are in the Eternal and the Infinite.”
          As finite truth and goodness are comprehensible only in the light of
          some absolute principle which furnishes for them an ideal standard, so
          finite beauty is inexplicable except as there exists a perfect
          standard with which it may be compared. The beautiful is more than the
          agreeable or the useful. Proportion, order, harmony, unity in
          diversity—all these are characteristics of beauty. But they all imply
          an intellectual and spiritual Being, from whom they proceed and by
          whom they can be measured. Both physical and moral beauty, in finite
          things and beings, are symbols and manifestations of Him who is the
          author and lover of beauty, and who is himself the infinite and
          absolute Beauty. The beautiful in nature and in art shows that the
          idea of God&#x27;s existence is logically independent and prior. See
          Cousin, The True, the Beautiful, and the Good, 140-153; Kant,
          Metaphysic of Ethics, who holds that belief in God is the necessary
          presupposition of the belief in duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          To repeat these four points in another form—the intuition of an
          Absolute Reason is (a) the necessary presupposition of all other
          knowledge, so that we cannot know anything else to exist except by
          assuming first of all that God exists; (b) the necessary basis of all
          logical thought, so that we cannot put confidence in any one of our
          reasoning processes except by taking for granted that a thinking Deity
          has constructed our minds with reference to the universe and to truth;
          (c) the necessary implication of our primitive belief in design, so
          that we can assume all things to exist for a purpose, only by making
          the prior assumption that a purposing God exists—can regard the
          universe as a thought, only by postulating the existence of an
          absolute Thinker; and (d) the necessary foundation of our conviction
          of moral obligation, so that we can believe in the universal authority
          of right, only by assuming that there exists a God of righteousness
          who reveals his will both in the individual conscience and in the
          moral universe at large. We cannot prove that God is; but we can show
          that, in order to show the existence of any knowledge, thought,
          reason, conscience, in man, man must assume that God is.

          As Jacobi said of the beautiful: “Es kann gewiesen aber nicht bewiesen
          werden”—it can be shown, but not proved. Bowne, Metaphysics, 472—“Our
          objective knowledge of the finite must rest upon ethical trust in the
          infinite”; 480—“Theism is the absolute postulate of all knowledge,
          science and philosophy”; “God is the most certain fact of objective
          knowledge.” Ladd, Bib. Sac., Oct. 1877:611-616—“Cogito, ergo Deus est.
          We are obliged to postulate a not-ourselves which makes for
          rationality, as well as for righteousness.” W. T. Harris: “Even
          natural science is impossible, where philosophy has not yet taught
          that reason made the world, and that nature is a revelation of the
          rational.” Whately, Logic, 270; New Englander, Oct. 1871, art. on
          Grounds of Confidence in Inductive Reasoning; Bib. Sac., 7:415-425;
          Dorner, Glaubenslehre, 1:197; Trendelenburg, Logische Untersuchungen,
          ch. “Zweck”; Ulrici, Gott und die Natur, 540-626; Lachelier, Du
          Fondement de l&#x27;Induction, 78. Per contra, see Janet, Final
          Causes, 174, note, and 457-464, who holds final cause to be, not an
          intuition, but the result of applying the principle of causality to
          cases which mechanical laws alone will not explain.

          Pascal: “Nature confounds the Pyrrhonist, and Reason confounds the
          Dogmatist. We have an incapacity of demonstration, which the former
          cannot overcome; we have a conception of truth which the latter cannot
          disturb.” “There is no Unbelief! Whoever says. ‘To-morrow,’ ‘The
          Unknown,’ ‘The Future,’ trusts that Power alone. Nor dares disown.”
          Jones, Robert Browning, 314—“We cannot indeed prove God as the
          conclusion of a syllogism, for he is the primary hypothesis of all
          proof.” Robert Browning, Hohenstiel-Schwangau: “I know that he is
          there, as I am here, By the same proof, which seems no proof at all,
          It so exceeds familiar forms of proof”; Paracelsus, 27—“To know Rather
          consists in opening out a way Whence the imprisoned splendor may
          escape Than in effecting entrance for a light Supposed to be without.”
          Tennyson, Holy Grail: “Let visions of the night or day Come as they
          will, and many a time they come.... In moments when he feels he cannot
          die, And knows himself no vision to himself, Nor the high God a
          vision, nor that One Who rose again”; The Ancient Sage, 548—“Thou
          canst not prove the Nameless, O my son! Nor canst thou prove the world
          thou movest in. Thou canst not prove that thou art body alone, Nor
          canst Thou prove that thou art spirit alone, Nor canst thou prove that
          thou art both in one. Thou canst not prove that thou art immortal, no,
          Nor yet that thou art mortal. Nay, my son, thou canst not prove that
          I, who speak with thee, Am not thyself in converse with thyself. For
          nothing worthy proving can be proven, Nor yet disproven: Wherefore be
          thou wise, Cleave ever to the sunnier side of doubt, And cling to
          Faith beyond the forms of Faith.”
