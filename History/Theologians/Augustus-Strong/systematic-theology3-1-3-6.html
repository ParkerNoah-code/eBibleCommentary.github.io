        <p>6. Counterfeit Miracles.</p>
        <p>
          Since only an act directly wrought by God can properly be called a
          miracle, it follows that surprising events brought about by evil
          spirits or by men, through the use of natural agencies beyond our
          knowledge, are not entitled to this appellation. The Scriptures
          recognize the existence of such, but denominate them “lying wonders”
          (2Th_2:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          These counterfeit miracles in various ages argue that the belief in
          miracles is natural to the race, and that somewhere there must exist
          the true. They serve to show that not all supernatural occurrences are
          divine, and to impress upon us the necessity of careful examination
          before we accept them as divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          False miracles may commonly be distinguished from the true by (a)
          their accompaniments of immoral conduct or of doctrine contradictory
          to truth already revealed—as in modern spiritualism; (b) their
          internal characteristics of inanity and extravagance—as in the
          liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, or the miracles of the
          Apocryphal New Testament; (c) the insufficiency of the object which
          they are designed to further—as in the case of Apollonius of Tyana, or
          of the miracles said to accompany the publication of the doctrines of
          the immaculate conception and of the papal infallibility; (d) their
          lack of substantiating evidence—as in mediaeval miracles, so seldom
          attested by contemporary and disinterested witnesses; (e) their denial
          or undervaluing of God’s previous revelation of himself in nature—as
          shown by the neglect of ordinary means, in the cases of Faithcure and
          of so-called Christian Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only what is valuable is counterfeited. False miracles presuppose the
          true. Fisher, Nature and Method of Revelation, 283—“The miracles of
          Jesus originated faith in him, while mediæval miracles follow
          established faith. The testimony of the apostles was given in the face
          of incredulous Sadducees. They were ridiculed and maltreated on
          account of it. It was no time for devout dreams and the invention of
          romances.” The blood of St. Januarius at Naples is said to be
          contained in a vial, one side of which is of thick glass, while the
          other side is of thin. A similar miracle was wrought at Hales in
          Gloucestershire. St. Alban, the first martyr of Britain, after his
          head is cut off, carries it about in his hand. In Ireland the place is
          shown where St. Patrick in the fifth century drove all the toads and
          snakes over a precipice into the nether regions. The legend however
          did not become current until some hundreds of years after the saint’s
          bones had crumbled to dust at Saul, near Downpatrick (see Hemphill,
          Literature of the Second Century, 180–182). Compare the story of the
          book of Tobit (6–8), which relates the expulsion of a demon by smoke
          from the burning heart and liver of a fish caught in the Tigris, and
          the story of the Apocryphal New Testament (I, Infancy), which tells of
          the expulsion of Satan in the form of a mad dog from Judas by the
          child Jesus. On counterfeit miracles in general, see Mozley, Miracles,
          15, 161; F. W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 72; A. S. Farrar,
          Science and Theology, 208; Tholuck, Vermischte Schriften, 1:27; Hodge,
          Syst. Theol., 1:630; Presb. Rev., 1881:687–719.
        </p>

          Some modern writers have maintained that the gift of miracles still
          remains in the church. Bengel: “The reason why many miracles are not
          now wrought is not so much because faith is established, as because
          unbelief reigns.” Christlieb: “It is the want of faith in our age
          which is the greatest hindrance to the stronger and more marked
          appearance of that miraculous power which is working here and there in
          quiet concealment. Unbelief is the final and most important reason for
          the retrogression of miracles.” Edward Irving, Works, 5:464—“Sickness
          is sin apparent in the body, the presentiment of death, the forerunner
          of corruption. Now, as Christ came to destroy death, and will yet
          redeem the body from the bondage of corruption, if the church is to
          have a first fruits or earnest of this power, it must be by receiving
          power over diseases that are the first fruits and earnest of death.”
          Dr. A. J. Gordon, in his Ministry of Healing, held to this view. See
          also Boys, Proofs of the Miraculous in the Experience of the Church;
          Bushnell, Nature and the Supernatural, 446–492; Review of Gordon, by
          Vincent, in Presb. Rev., 1883:473–502; Review of Vincent, in Presb.
          Rev., 1884:49–79.
        </p>

          In reply to the advocates of faith-cure in general, we would grant
          that nature is plastic in God’s hand; that he can work miracle when
          and where it pleases him; and that he has given promises which, with
          certain Scriptural and rational limitations, encourage believing
          prayer for healing in cases of sickness. But we incline to the belief
          that in these later ages God answers such prayer, not by miracle, but
          by special providence, and by gifts of courage, faith and will, thus
          acting by his Spirit directly upon the soul and only indirectly upon
          the body. The laws of nature are generic volitions of God, and to
          ignore them and disuse means is presumption and disrespect to God
          himself. The Scripture promise to faith is always expressly or
          impliedly conditioned upon our use of means: we are to work out our
          own salvation, for the very reason that it is God who works in us; it
          is vain for the drowning man to pray, so long as he refuses to lay
          hold of the rope that is thrown to him. Medicines and physicians are
          the rope thrown to us by God; we cannot expect miraculous help, while
          we neglect the help God has already given us; to refuse this help is
          practically to deny Christ’s revelation in nature. Why not live
          without eating, as well as recover from sickness without medicine?
          Faith-feeding is quite as rational as faith-healing. To except cases
          of disease from this general rule as to the use of means has no
          warrant either in reason or in Scripture. The atonement has purchased
          complete salvation, and some day salvation shall be ours. But death
          and depravity still remain, not as penalty, but as chastisement. So
          disease remains also. Hospitals for Incurables, and the deaths even of
          advocates of faith-cure, show that they too are compelled to recognize
          some limit to the application of the New Testament promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of the preceding discussion we must regard the so-called
          Christian Science as neither Christian nor scientific. Mrs. Mary Baker
          G. Eddy denies the authority of all that part of revelation which God
          has made to man in nature, and holds that the laws of nature may be
          disregarded with impunity by those who have proper faith; see G. F.
          Wright, in Bib. Sac., April, 1899:375. Bishop Lawrence of
          Massachusetts: “One of the errors of Christian Science is its neglect
          of accumulated knowledge, of the fund of information stored up for
          these Christian centuries. That knowledge is just as much God’s gift
          as is the knowledge obtained from direct revelation. In rejecting
          accumulated knowledge and professional skill, Christian Science
          rejects the gift of God.” Most of the professed cures of Christian
          Science are explicable by the influence of the mind upon the body,
          through hypnosis or suggestion; (see A. A. Bennett, in Watchman, Feb.
          13, 1903). Mental disturbance may make the mother’s milk a poison to
          the child; mental excitement is a common cause of indigestion; mental
          depression induces bowel disorders; depressed mental and moral
          conditions render a person more susceptible to grippe, pneumonia,
          typhoid fever. Reading the account of an accident in which the body is
          torn or maimed, we ourselves feel pain in the same spot; when the
          child’s hand is crushed, the mother’s hand, though at a distance,
          becomes swollen; the mediæval stigmata probably resulted from
          continuous brooding upon the sufferings of Christ (see Carpenter,
          Mental Physiology, 676–690).
        </p>
        <p>
          But mental states may help as well as harm the body. Mental expectancy
          facilitates cure in cases of sickness. The physician helps the patient
          by inspiring hope and courage. Imagination works wonders, especially
          in the case of nervous disorders. The diseases said to be cured by
          Christian Science are commonly of this sort. In every age fakirs,
          mesmerists, and quacks have availed themselves of these underlying
          mental forces. By inducing expectancy, imparting courage, rousing the
          paralyzed will, they have indirectly caused bodily changes which have
          been mistaken for miracle. Tacitus tell us of the healing of a blind
          man by the Emperor Vespasian. Undoubted cures have been wrought by the
          royal touch in England. Since such wonders have been performed by
          Indian medicine-men, we canaot regard them as having any specific
          Christian character, and when, as in the present case, we find them
          used to aid in the spread of false doctrine with regard to sin,
          Christ, atonement, and the church, we must class them with the “lying
          wonders” of which we are warned in 2Th_2:9. See Harris, Philosophical
          Basis of Theism, 381–386; Buckley, Faith-Healing, and in Century
          Magazine, June, 1886:221–236; Bruce, Miraculous Element in Gospels,
          lecture 8; Andover Review, 1887:249–264.
