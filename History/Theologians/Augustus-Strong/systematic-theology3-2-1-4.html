        <p>4th. The Development-theory of Harnack (born 1851).</p>
        <p>
          This holds Christianity to be a historical development from germs
          which were devoid of both dogma and miracle. Jesus was a teacher of
          ethics, and the original gospel is most clearly represented by the
          Sermon on the Mount. Greek influence, and especially that of the
          Alexandrian philosophy, added to this gospel a theological and
          supernatural element, and so changed Christianity from a life into a
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harnack dates Matthew at 70–75; Mark at 65–70: Luke at 78–93; the
          fourth gospel at 80–110. He regards both the fourth gospel and the
          book of Revelation as the works, not of John the Apostle, but of John
          the Presbyter. He separates the prologue of the fourth gospel from the
          gospel itself, and considers the prologue as a preface added after its
          original composition in order to enable the Hellenistic reader to
          understand it. “The gospel itself,” says Harnack, “contains no
          Logos-idea; it did not develop out of a Logos-idea, such as flourished
          at Alexandria; it only connects itself with such an idea. The gospel
          itself is based upon the historic Christ; he is the subject of all its
          statements. This historical trait can in no way be dissolved by any
          kind of speculation. The memory of what was actually historical was
          still too powerful to admit at this point any Gnostic influences. The
          Logos-idea of the prologue is the Logos of Alexandrine Judaism, the
          Logos of Philo, and it is derived ultimately from the ‘Son of man’ in
          the book of Daniel.…The fourth gospel, which does not proceed from the
          Apostle John and does not so claim, cannot be used as a historical
          source in the ordinary sense of that word.…The author has managed with
          sovereign freedom; has transposed occurrences and has put them in a
          light that is foreign to them; has of his own accord composed the
          discourses, and has illustrated lofty thoughts by inventing situations
          for them. Difficult as it is to recognize, an actual tradition in his
          work is not wholly lacking. For the history of Jesus, however, it can
          hardly anywhere be taken into account; only little can be taken from
          it, and that with caution.…On the other hand it is a source of the
          first rank for the answer of the question what living views of the
          person of Jesus, what light and what warmth, the gospel has brought
          into being.” See Harnack’s article in Zeitschrift für Theol. u.
          Kirche, 2:189–231, and his Wesen des Christenthums, 13. Kaftan also,
          who belongs to the same Ritschlian school with Harnack, tells us in
          his Truth of the Christian Religion, 1:97, that as the result of the
          Logos-speculation, “the centre of gravity, instead of being placed in
          the historical Christ who founded the kingdom of God, is placed in the
          Christ who as eternal Logos of God was the mediator in the creation of
          the world.” This view is elaborated by Hatch in his Hibbert Lectures
          for 1888, on the Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the
          Christian Church.
        </p>
        <p>We object to the Development-theory of Harnack, that</p>
        <p>
          (a) The Sermon on the Mount is not the sum of the gospel, nor its
          original form. Mark is the most original of the gospels, yet Mark
          omits the Sermon on the Mount, and Mark is preëminently the gospel of
          the miracle-worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) All four gospels lay the emphasis, not on Jesus’ life and ethical
          teaching, but on his death and resurrection. Matthew implies Christ’s
          deity when it asserts his absolute knowledge of the Father (11:27),
          his universal judgeship (25:32), his supreme authority (28:18), and
          his omnipresence (28:20), while the phrase “Son of man” implies that
          he is also “Son of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mat_11:27—“All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no
          one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the
          Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal
          him”: Mat_25:32—“and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and
          he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth
          the sheep from the goats”; Mat_28:18—“All authority hath been given
          unto me in heaven and on earth”; Mat_28:20—“lo, I am with you always,
          even unto the end of the world.” These sayings of Jesus in Matthew’s
          gospel show that the conception of Christ’s greatness was not peculiar
          to John: “I am” transcends time; “with you” transcends space. Jesus
          speaks “sub specie etemitatis”; his utterance is equivalent to that of
          Joh_8:58—“Before Abraham was born, I am,” and to that of
          Heb_13:8—“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day, yea and for
          ever.” He is, as Paul declares in Eph_1:23, one “that filleth all in
          all,” that is, who is omnipresent.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. H. Strong, Philos. and Religion, 206—The phrase “Son of man”
          intimates that Christ was more than man: “Suppose I were to go about
          proclaiming myself ‘Son of man.’ Who does not see that it would be
          mere impertinence, unless I claimed to be something more. ‘Son of Man?
          But what of that? Cannot every human being call himself the same?’
          When one takes the title ‘Son of man’ for his characteristic
          designation, as Jesus did, he implies that there is something strange
          in his being Son of man; that this is not his original condition and
          dignity; that it is condescension on his part to be Son of man. In
          short, when Christ calls himself Son of man, it implies that he has
          come from a higher level of being to inhabit this low earth of ours.
          And so, when we are asked ‘What think ye of the Christ? whose son is
          he?’ we must answer, not simply, He is Son of man, but also, He is Son
          of God.” On Son of man, see Driver; on Son of God, see Sanday; both in
          Hastings’ Dictionary of the Bible. Sanday: “The Son is so called
          primarily as incarnate. But that which is the essence of the
          Incarnation must needs be also larger than the Incarnation. It must
          needs have its roots in the eternity of Godhead.” Gore, Incarnation,
          65, 73—“Christ, the final Judge, of the synoptics, is not dissociable
          from the divine, eternal Being, of the fourth gospel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The preëxistence and atonement of Christ cannot be regarded as
          accretions upon the original gospel, since these find expression in
          Paul who wrote before any of our evangelists, and in his epistles
          anticipated the Logos-doctrine of John.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) We may grant that Greek influence, through the Alexandrian
          philosophy, helped the New Testament writers to discern what was
          already present in the life and work and teaching of Jesus; but, like
          the microscope which discovers but does not create, it added nothing
          to the substance of the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gore, Incarnation, 62—“The divinity, incarnation, resurrection of
          Christ were not an accretion upon the original belief of the apostles
          and their first disciples, for these are all recognized as
          uncontroverted matters of faith in the four great epistles of Paul,
          written at a date when the greater part of those who had seen the
          risen Christ were still alive.” The Alexandrian philosophy was not the
          source of apostolic doctrine, but only the form in which that doctrine
          was cast, the light thrown upon it which brought out its meaning. A.
          H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 146—“When we come to John’s gospel,
          therefore, we find in it the mere unfolding of truth that for
          substance had been in the world for at least sixty years.…If the
          Platonizing philosophy of Alexandria assisted in this genuine
          development of Christian doctrine, then the Alexandrian philosophy was
          a providential help to Inspiration. The microscope does not invent; it
          only discovers. Paul and John did not add to the truth of Christ;
          their philosophical equipment was only a microscope which brought into
          clear view the truth that was there already.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:126—“The metaphysical conception of
          the Logos, as immanent in the world and ordering it according to law,
          was filled with religious and moral contents. In Jesus the cosmical
          principle of nature became a religious principle of salvation.” See
          Kilpatrick’a article on Philosophy, in Hastings’ Bible Dictionary.
          Kilpatrick holds that Harnack ignores the self-consciousness of Jesus;
          does not fairly interpret the Acts in its mention of the early worship
          of Jesus by the church before Greek philosophy had influenced it;
          refers to the intellectual peculiarities of the N. T. writers
          conceptions which Paul insists are simply the faith of all Christian
          people as such; forgets that the Christian idea of union with God
          secured through the atoning and reconciling work of a personal
          Redeemer utterly transcended Greek thought, and furnished the solution
          of the problem after which Greek philosophy was vainly groping. (e)
          Though Mark says nothing of the virgin-birth because his story is
          limited to what the apostles had witnessed of Jesus’ deeds, Matthew
          apparently gives us Joseph’s story and Luke gives Mary’s story—both
          stories naturally published only after Jesus’ resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) The larger understanding of doctrine after Jesus’ death was itself
          predicted by our Lord (Joh_16:12). The Holy Spirit was to bring his
          teachings to remembrance, and to guide into all the truth (16:13), and
          the apostles were to continue the work of teaching which he had begun
          (Act_1:1).
        </p>
        <p>
          Joh_16:12-13—“I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
          bear them now. Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he
          shall guide you into all the truth”; Act_1:1—“The former treatise I
          made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began to do and to
          teach.” A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation, 146—“That the beloved
          disciple, after a half century of meditation upon what he had seen and
          heard of God manifest in the flesh, should have penetrated more deeply
          into the meaning of that wonderful revelation is not only not
          surprising,—it is precisely what Jesus himself foretold. Our Lord had
          many things to say to his disciples, but then they could not bear
          them. He promised that the Holy Spirit should bring to their
          remembrance both himself and his words, and should lead them into all
          the truth. And this is the whole secret of what are called accretions
          to original Christianity. So far as they are contained in Scripture,
          they are inspired discoveries and unfoldings, not mere speculations
          and inventions. They are not additions, but elucidations, not vain
          imaginings, but correct intepretations.…When the later theology, then,
          throws out the supernatural and dogmatic, as coming not from Jesus but
          from Paul’s epistles and from the fourth gospel, our claim is that
          Paul and John are only inspired and authoritative interpreters of
          Jesus, seeing themselves and making us see the fulness of the Godhead
          that dwelt in him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          While Harnack, in our judgment, errs in his view that Paul contributed
          to the gospel elements which it did not originally possess, he shows
          us very clearly many of the elements in that gospel which he was the
          first to recognize. In his Wesen des Christenthums, 111, he tells us
          that a few years ago a celebrated Protestant theologian declared that
          Paul, with his Rabbinical theology, was the destroyer of the Christian
          religion. Others have regarded him as the founder of that religion.
          But the majority have seen in him the apostle who best understood his
          Lord and did most to continue his work. Paul, as Harnack maintains,
          first comprehended the gospel definitely: (1) as an accomplished
          redemption and a present salvation—the crucified and risen Christ as
          giving access to God and righteousness and peace therewith; (2) as
          something new, which does away with the religion of the law; (3) as
          meant for all, and therefore for Gentiles also, indeed, as superseding
          Judaism; (4) as expressed in terms which are not simply Greek but also
          human,—Paul made the gospel comprehensible to the world. Islam, rising
          in Arabia, is an Arabian religion still. Buddhism remains an Indian
          religion. Christianity is at home in all lands. Paul put new life into
          the Roman empire, and inaugurated the Christian culture of the West.
          He turned a local into a universal religion. His influence however,
          according to Harnack, tended to the undue exaltation of organization
          and dogma and O. T. inspiration—points in which, in our judgment, Paul
          took sober middle ground and saved Christian truth for the world.
