          The objection rests upon a misunderstanding of the nature and object
          of inspiration. It may be removed by considering that
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) In the case of books made up from preëxisting documents,
          inspiration simply preserved the compilers of them from selecting
          inadequate or improper material. The fact of such compilation does not
          impugn their value as records of a divine revelation, since these
          books supplement each other’s deficiencies and together are sufficient
          for man’s religious needs.

          Luke distinctly informs us that he secured the materials for his
          gospel from the reports of others who were eye-witnesses of the events
          he recorded (Luk_1:1-4). The book of Genesis bears marks of having
          incorporated documents of earlier times. The account of creation which
          begins with Gen_2:4 is evidently written by a different hand from that
          which penned 1:1–31 and 2:1–30. Instances of the same sort may be
          found in the books of Chronicles. In like manner, Marshall’s Life of
          Washington incorporates documents by other writers. By thus
          incorporating them, Marshall vouches for their truth. See Bible Com.,
          1:2, 22.

          Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theology, 1:243—“Luther ascribes to faith critical
          authority with reference to the Canon. He denies the canonicity of
          James, without regarding it as spurious. So of Hebrews and Revelation,
          though later, in 1545, he passed a more favorable judgment upon the
          latter. He even says of a proof adduced by Paul in Galatians that it
          is too weak to hold. He allows that in external matters not only
          Stephen but even the sacred authors contain inaccuracies. The
          authority of the O. T. does not seem to him invalidated by the
          admission that several of its writings have passed through revising
          hands. What would it matter, he asks, if Moses did not write the
          Pentateuch? The prophets studied Moses and one another. If they built
          in much wood, hay and stubble along with the rest, still the
          foundation abides; the fire of the great day shall consume the former;
          for in this manner do we treat the writings of Augustine and others.
          Kings is far more to be believed than Chronicles. Ecclesiastes is
          forged and cannot come from Solomon. Esther is not canonical. The
          church may have erred in adopting a book into the Canon. Faith first
          requires proof. Hence he ejects the Apocryphal books of the O. T. from
          the Canon. So some parts of the N. T. receive only a secondary,
          deuterocanonical position. There is a difference between the word of
          God and the holy Scriptures, not merely in reference to the form, but
          also in reference to the subject matter.”

          H. P. Smith, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 94—“The Editor of the
          Minor Prophets united in one roll the prophetic fragments which were
          in circulation in his time. Finding a fragment without an author’s
          name he inserted it in the series. It would not have been
          distinguished from the work of the author immediately preceding. So
          Zec_9:1-4 came to go under the name of Zechariah, and Isa 40:1-31;
          41:1-29; 42:1-25; 43:1-28; 44:1-28; 45:1-25; 46:1-13; 47:1-15;
          48:1-22; 49:1-26; 50:1-11; 51:1-23; 52:1-15; 53:1-12; 54:1-17;
          55:1-13; 56:1-12; 57:1-21; 58:1-14; 59:1-21; 60:1-22; 61:1-11;
          62:1-12; 63:1-19; 64:1-12; 65:1-25; 66:1-24 under the name of Isaiah.
          Reuss called these ‘anatomical studies.’ ” On the authorship of the
          book of Daniel, see W. C. Wilkinson, in Homiletical Review, March,
          1902:208, and Oct. 1902:305; on Paul, see Hom. Rev., June, 1902:501;
          on 110th Psalm, Hom. Rev., April, 1902:309.

          (b) In the case of additions to Scripture books by later writers, it
          is reasonable to suppose that the additions, as well as the originals,
          were made by inspiration, and no essential truth is sacrificed by
          allowing the whole to go under the name of the chief author.

          Mar_16:9-20 appears to have been added by a later hand (see English
          Revised Version). The Eng. Rev. Vers. also brackets or segregates a
          part of verse 3 and the whole of verse 4 in Joh_5:1-47 (the moving of
          the water by the angel), and the whole passage Joh_7:53; Joh_8:1-11
          (the woman taken in adultery). Westcott and Hort regard the latter
          passage as an interpolation, probably “Western” in its origin (so also
          Mar_16:9-20). Others regard it as authentic, though not written by
          John. The closing chapter of Deuteronomy was apparently added after
          Moses’ death—perhaps by Joshua. If criticism should prove other
          portions of the Pentateuch to have been composed after Moses’ time,
          the inspiration of the Pentateuch would not be invalidated, so long as
          Moses was its chief author or even the original source and founder of
          its legislation (Joh_5:46—“he wrote of me”). Gore, in Lux Mundi,
          355—“Deuteronomy may be a republication of the law, in the spirit and
          power of Moses, and put dramatically into his mouth.”

          At a spot near the Pool of Siloam, Manasseh is said to have ordered
          that Isaiah should be sawn asunder with a wooden saw. The prophet is
          again sawn asunder by the recent criticism. But his prophecy opens
          (Isa 1:1) with the statement that it was composed during a period
          which covered the reigns of four kings—Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and
          Hezekiah—nearly forty years. In so long a time the style of a writer
          greatly changes. Chapters 40–66 may have been written in Isaiah’s
          later age, after he had retired from public life. Compare the change
          in the style of Zechariah, John and Paul, with that in Thomas Carlyle
          and George William Curtis. On Isaiah, see Smyth, Prophecy a
          Preparation for Christ; Bib. Sac., Apr. 1881:230–253; also July, 1881;
          Stanley, Jewish Ch., 2:646, 647; Nägelsbach, Int. to Lange’s Isaiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the view that there were two Isaiahs, see George Adam Smith, Com.
          on Isa 2:1-22 : Isaiah flourished b.c. 740–700. The last 27 chapters
          deal with the captivity (598–538) and with Cyrus (550), whom they
          name. The book is not one continuous prophecy, but a number of
          separate orations. Some of these claim to be Isaiah’s own, and have
          titles, such as “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz” (1:1); “The
          word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw” (2:1). But such titles describe
          only the individual prophecies they head. Other portions of the book,
          on other subjects and in different styles, have no titles at all.
          Chapters 40–66 do not claim to be his. There are nine citations in the
          N. T. from the disputed chapters, but none by our Lord. None of these
          citations were given in answer to the question: Did Isaiah write
          chapters 44–66? Isaiah’s name is mentioned only for the sake of
          reference. Chapters 44–66 set forth the exile and captivity as already
          having taken place. Israel is addressed as ready for deliverance.
          Cyrus is named as deliverer. There is no grammar of the future like
          Jeremiah’s. Cyrus is pointed out as proof that former prophecies of
          deliverance are at last coming to pass. He is not presented as a
          prediction, but as a proof that prediction is being fulfilled. The
          prophet could not have referred the heathen to Cyrus as proof that
          prophecy had been fulfilled, had he not been visible to them in all
          his weight of war. Babylon has still to fall before the exiles can go
          free. But chapters 40–66 speak of the coining of Cyrus as past, and of
          the fall of Babylon as yet to come. Why not use the prophetic perfect
          of both, if both were yet future? Local color, language and thought
          are all consistent with exilic authorship. All suits the exile, but
          all is foreign to the subjects and methods of Isaiah, for example, the
          use of the terms righteous and righteousness. Calvin admits exilic
          authorship (on Isa 55:3). The passage Isa 56:9-12, however, is an
          exception and is preëxilic. Isa 40:1-31; 41:1-29; 42:1-25; 43:1-28;
          44:1-28; 45:1-25; 46:1-13; 47:1-15; 48:1-22 are certainly by one hand,
          and may be dated 555–538. 2nd Isaiah is not a unity, but consists of a
          number of pieces written before, during, and after the exile, to
          comfort the people of God.

          (c) It is unjust to deny to inspired Scripture the right exercised by
          all historians of introducing certain documents and sayings as simply
          historical, while their complete truthfulness is neither vouched for
          nor denied.
        </p>
        <p>
          An instance in point is the letter of Claudius Lysias in
          Act_23:26-30—a letter which represents his conduct in a more favorable
          light than the facts would justify—for he had not learned that Paul
          was a Roman when he rescued him in the temple (Act_21:31-33;
          Act_22:26-29). An incorrect statement may be correctly reported. A set
          of pamphlets printed in the time of the French Revolution might be
          made an appendix to some history of France without implying that the
          historian vouched for their truth. The sacred historians may similarly
          have been inspired to use only the material within their reach,
          leaving their readers by comparison with other Scriptures to judge of
          its truthfulness and value. This seems to have been the method adopted
          by the compiler of 1 and 2 Chronicles. The moral and religious lessons
          of the history are patent, even though there is inaccuracy in
          reporting some of the facts. So the assertions of the authors of the
          Psalms cannot be taken for absolute truth. The authors were not
          sinless models for the Christian,—only Christ is that. But the Psalms
          present us with a record of the actual experience of believers in the
          past. It has its human weakness, but we can profit by it, even though
          it expresses itself at times in imprecations. Jer_20:7—“O Lord, thou
          hast deceived me”—may possibly be thus explained.
