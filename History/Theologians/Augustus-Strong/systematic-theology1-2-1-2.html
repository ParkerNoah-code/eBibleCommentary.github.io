        <h2>2. Scripture and Rationalism.</h2>
        <p>
          Although the Scriptures make known much that is beyond the power of
          man&#x27;s unaided reason to discover or fully to comprehend, their
          teachings, when taken together, in no way contradict a reason
          conditioned in its activity by a holy affection and enlightened by the
          Spirit of God. To reason in the large sense, as including the
          mind&#x27;s power of cognizing God and moral relations—not in the
          narrow sense of mere reasoning, or the exercise of the purely logical
          faculty—the Scriptures continually appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. The proper office of reason, in this large sense, is: (a) To
          furnish us with those primary ideas of space, time, cause, substance,
          design, right, and God, which are the conditions of all subsequent
          knowledge. (b) To judge with regard to man&#x27;s need of a special
          and supernatural revelation. (c) To examine the credentials of
          communications professing to be, or of documents professing to record,
          such a revelation. (d) To estimate and reduce to system the facts of
          revelation, when these have been found properly attested. (e) To
          deduce from these facts their natural and logical conclusions. Thus
          reason itself prepares the way for a revelation above reason, and
          warrants an implicit trust in such revelation when once given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dove, Logic of the Christian Faith, 318—“Reason terminates in the
          proposition: Look for revelation.” Leibnitz: “Revelation is the
          viceroy who first presents his credentials to the provincial assembly
          (reason), and then himself presides.” Reason can recognize truth after
          it is made known, as for example in the demonstrations of geometry,
          although it could never discover that truth for itself. See
          Calderwood&#x27;s illustration of the party lost in the woods, who
          wisely take the course indicated by one at the tree-top with a larger
          view than their own (Philosophy of the Infinite, 126). The novice does
          well to trust his guide in the forest, at least till he learns to
          recognise for himself the marks blazed upon the trees. Luthardt, Fund.
          Truths, lect. viii—“Reason could never have invented a
          self-humiliating God, cradled in a manger and dying on a cross.”
          Lessing, Zur Geschichte und Litteratur, 6:134—“What is the meaning of
          a revelation that reveals nothing?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritschl denies the presuppositions of any theology based on the Bible
          as the infallible word of God on the one hand, and on the validity of
          the knowledge of God as obtained by scientific and philosophic
          processes on the other. Because philosophers, scientists, and even
          exegetes, are not agreed among themselves, he concludes that no
          trustworthy results are attainable by human reason. We grant that
          reason without love will fall into many errors with regard to God, and
          that faith is therefore the organ by which religious truth is to be
          apprehended. But we claim that this faith includes reason, and is
          itself reason in its highest form. Faith criticizes and judges the
          processes of natural science as well as the contents of Scripture. But
          it also recognizes in science and Scripture prior workings of that
          same Spirit of Christ which is the source and authority of the
          Christian life. Ritschl ignores Christ&#x27;s world-relations and
          therefore secularizes and disparages science and philosophy. The faith
          to which he trusts as the source of theology is unwarrantably sundered
          from reason. It becomes a subjective and arbitrary standard, to which
          even the teaching of Scripture must yield precedence. We hold on the
          contrary, that there are ascertained results in science and in
          philosophy, as well as in the interpretation of Scripture as a whole,
          and that these results constitute an authoritative revelation. See
          Orr, The Theology of Ritschl; Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theol., 1:233—“The
          unreasonable in the empirical reason is taken captive by faith, which
          is the nascent true reason that despairs of itself and trustfully lays
          hold of objective Christianity.”
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Rationalism, on the other hand, holds reason to be the ultimate
          source of all religious truth, while Scripture is authoritative only
          so far as its revelations agree with previous conclusions of reason,
          or can be rationally demonstrated. Every form of rationalism,
          therefore, commits at least one of the following errors: (a) That of
          confounding reason with mere reasoning, or the exercise of the logical
          intelligence. (b) That of ignoring the necessity of a holy affection
          as the condition of all right reason in religious things. (c) That of
          denying our dependence in our present state of sin upon God&#x27;s
          past revelations of himself. (d) That of regarding the unaided reason,
          even its normal and unbiased state, as capable of discovering,
          comprehending, and demonstrating all religious truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason must not be confounded with ratiocination, or mere reasoning.
          Shall we follow reason? Yes, but not individual reasoning, against the
          testimony of those who are better informed than we; nor by insisting
          on demonstration, where probable evidence alone is possible; nor by
          trusting solely to the evidence of the senses, when spiritual things
          are in question. Coleridge, in replying to those who argued that all
          knowledge comes to us from the senses, says: “At any rate we must
          bring to all facts the light in which we see them.” This the Christian
          does. The light of love reveals much that would otherwise be
          invisible. Wordsworth, Excursion, book 5 (598)—“The mind&#x27;s repose
          On evidence is not to be ensured By act of naked reason. Moral truth
          Is no mechanic structure, built by rule.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Rationalism is the mathematical theory of knowledge. Spinoza&#x27;s
          Ethics is an illustration of it. It would deduce the universe from an
          axiom. Dr. Hodge very wrongly described rationalism as “an overuse of
          reason.” It is rather the use of an abnormal, perverted, improperly
          conditioned reason; see Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:34, 39, 55, and
          criticism by Miller, in his Fetich in Theology. The phrase “sanctified
          intellect” means simply intellect accompanied by right affections
          toward God, and trained to work under their influence. Bishop Butler:
          “Let reason be kept to, but let not such poor creatures as we are go
          on objecting to an infinite scheme that we do not see the necessity or
          usefulness of all its parts, and call that reasoning.” Newman Smyth,
          Death&#x27;s Place in Evolution, 86—“Unbelief is a shaft sunk down
          into the darkness of the earth. Drive the shaft deep enough, and it
          would come out into the sunlight on the earth&#x27;s other side.” The
          most unreasonable people in the world are those who depend solely upon
          reason, in the narrow sense. “The better to exalt reason, they make
          the world irrational.” “The hen that has hatched ducklings walks with
          them to the water&#x27;s edge, but there she stops, and she is amazed
          when they go on. So reason stops and faith goes on, finding its proper
          element in the invisible. Reason is the feet that stand on solid
          earth; faith is the wings that enable us to fly; and normal man is a
          creature with wings.” Compare γνῶσις (1 Tim. 6:20—“the knowledge which
          is falsely so called”) with ἐπίγνωσις (2 Pet. 1:2—“the knowledge of
          God and of Jesus our Lord” = full knowledge, or true knowledge). See
          Twesten, Dogmatik, 1:467-500; Julius Müller, Proof-texts, 4, 5;
          Mansel, Limits of Religious Thought, 96; Dawson, Modern Ideas of
          Evolution.
