        <p>2. Genuineness of the Books of the Old Testament.</p>
        <p>
          Since nearly one half of the Old Testament is of anonymous authorship
          and certain of its books may be attributed to definite historic
          characters only by way of convenient classification or of literary
          personification, we here mean by genuineness honesty of purpose and
          freedom from anything counterfeit or intentionally deceptive so far as
          respects the age or the authorship of the documents.
        </p>
        <p>We show the genuineness of the Old Testament books:</p>
        <p>
          (a) From the witness of the New Testament, in which all but six books
          of the Old Testament are either quoted or alluded to as genuine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The N. T. shows coincidences of language with the O. T. Apocryphal
          books, but it contains only one direct quotation from them; while,
          with the exception of Judges, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Esther, Ezra,
          and Nehemiah, every book in the Hebrew canon, is used either for
          illustration or proof. The single Apocryphal quotation is found in
          Jud_1:14 and is in all probability taken from the book of Enoch.
          Although Volkmar puts the date of this book at 132 a.d., and although
          some critics hold that Jude quoted only the same primitive tradition
          of which the author of the book of Enoch afterwards made use, the
          weight of modern scholarship inclines to the opinion that the book
          itself was written as early as 170–70 b.c., and that Jude quoted from
          it; see Hastings’ Bible Dictionary: Book of Enoch; Sanday, Bampton
          Lect. on Inspiration, 95. “If Paul could quote from Gentile poets
          (Act_17:28; Tit_1:12), it is hard to understand why Jude could not
          cite a work which was certainly in high standing among the faithful”;
          see Schodde, Book of Enoch 41 , with the Introd. by Ezra Abbot. While
          Jud_1:14 gives us the only direct and express quotation from an
          Apocryphal book, Jud_1:6; Jud_1:9 contain allusions to the Book of
          Enoch and to the Assumption of Moses; see Charles, Assumption of
          Moses, 62. In Heb_1:3, we have words taken from Wis_7:26; and
          Heb_11:34-38 is a reminiscence of 1 Maccabees.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) From the testimony of Jewish authorities, ancient and modern, who
          declare the same books to be sacred, and only the same books, that are
          now comprised in our Old Testament Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Josephus enumerates twenty-two of these books “which are justly
          accredited” (omit θεῖα—Niese, and Hastings’ Dict., 3:607). Our present
          Hebrew Bible makes twenty-four, by separating Ruth from Judges, and
          Lamentations from Jeremiah. See Josephus, Against Apion, 1:8; Smith’s
          Bible Dictionary, article on the Canon, 1:359–360, Philo (born 20
          b.c.) never quotes an Apocryphal book, although he does quote from
          nearly all the books of the O. T.; see Ryle, Philo and Holy Scripture.
          George Adam Smith, Modern Criticism and Preaching, 7—“The theory which
          ascribed the Canon of the O. T. to a single decision of the Jewish
          church in the days of its inspiration is not a theory supported by
          facts. The growth of the O. T. Canon was very gradual. Virtually it
          began in 621 b.c., with the acceptance by all Judah of Deuteronomy,
          and the adoption of the whole Law, or first five books of the O. T.,
          under Nehemiah in 446 b.c. Then came the prophets before 200 b.c., and
          the Hagiographa from a century to two centuries later. The strict
          definition of the last division was not complete by the time of
          Christ. Christ seems to testify to the Law, the Prophets, and the
          Psalms; yet neither Christ nor his apostles make any quotation from
          Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Canticles, or Ecclesiastes, the last of which
          books were not yet recognized by all the Jewish schools. But while
          Christ is the chief authority for the O. T., he was also its first
          critic. He rejected some parts of the Law and was indifferent to many
          others. He enlarged the sixth and seventh commandments, and reversed
          the eye for an eye, and the permission of divorce; touched the leper,
          and reckoned all foods lawful; broke away from literal observance of
          the Sabbath-day; left no commands about sacrifice, temple-worship,
          circumcision, but, by institution of the New Covenant, abrogated these
          sacraments of the Old. The apostles appealed to extra-canonical
          writings.” Gladden, Seven Puzzling Bible Books, 68–96—“Doubts were
          entertained in our Lord’s day as to the canonicity of several parts of
          the O. T., especially Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon,
          Esther.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) From the testimony of the Septuagint translation, dating from the
          first half of the third century, or from 280 to 180 b.c..
        </p>
        <p>
          MSS. of the Septuagint contain, indeed, the O. T. Apocrypha, but the
          writers of the latter do not recognize their own work as on a level
          with the canonical Scriptures, which they regard as distinct from all
          other books (Ecclesiasticus, prologue, and 48:24; also 24:23–27;
          1Ma_12:9; 2Ma_6:23; 1Es_1:28; 1Es_6:1; Bar_2:21). So both ancient and
          modern Jews. See Bissell, in Lange’s Commentary on the Apocrypha,
          Introduction, 44. In the prologue to the apocryphal book of
          Ecclesiasticus, we read of “the Law and the Prophets and the rest of
          the books,” which shows that as early as 130 b.c., the probable date
          of Ecclesiasticus, a threefold division of the Jewish sacred books was
          recognized. That the author, however, did not conceive of these books
          as constituting a completed canon seems evident from his assertion in
          this connection that his grandfather Jesus also wrote. 1Ma_12:9 (80–90
          b.c.) speaks of “the sacred books which are now in our hands.”
          Hastings, Bible Dictionary, 3:611—“The O. T. was the result of a
          gradual process which began with the sanction of the Hexateuch by Ezra
          and Nehemiah, and practically closed with the decisions of the Council
          of Jamnia”—Jamnia is the ancient Jabneh, 7 miles south by west of
          Tiberias, where met a council of rabbins at some time between 90 to
          118 a.d.;. This Council decided in favor of Canticles and
          Ecclesiastes, and closed the O. T. Canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Greek version of the Pentateuch which forms a part of the
          Septuagint is said by Josephus to have been made in the reign and by
          the order of Ptolemy Philadelphus, King of Egypt, about 270 or 280
          b.c. “The legend is that it was made by seventy-two persons in
          seventy-two days. It is supposed, however, by modern critics that this
          version of the several books is the work not only of different hands
          but of separate times. It is probable that at first only the
          Pentateuch was translated, and the remaining books gradually; but the
          translation is believed to have been completed by the second century
          b.c.” (Century Dictionary, in voce). It therefore furnishes an
          important witness to the genuineness of our O. T. documents. Driver,
          Introd. to O. T. Lit., xxxi—“For the opinion, often met with in modern
          books, that the Canon of the O. T. was closed by Ezra, or in Ezra’s
          time, there is no foundation in antiquity whatever.…All that can
          reasonably be treated as historical in the accounts of Ezra’s literary
          labors is limited to the Law.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) From indications that soon after the exile, and so early as the
          times of Ezra and Nehemiah (500–450 b.c.), the Pentateuch together
          with the book of Joshua was not only in existence but was regarded as
          authoritative.
        </p>
        <p>
          2Ma_2:13-15 intimates that Nehemiah founded a library, and there is a
          tradition that a “Great Synagogue” was gathered in his time to
          determine the Canon. But Hastings’ Dictionary, 4:644, asserts that
          “the Great Synagogue was originally a meeting, and not an institution.
          It met once for all, and all that is told about it, except what we
          read in Nehemiah, is pure fable of the later Jews.” In like manner no
          dependence is to be placed upon the tradition that Ezra miraculously
          restored the ancient Scriptures that had been lost during the exile.
          Clement of Alexandria says: “Since the Scriptures perished in the
          Captivity of Nebuchadnezzar, Esdras (the Greek form of Ezra) the
          Levite, the priest, in the time of Artaxerxes, King of the Persians,
          having become inspired in the exercise of prophecy, restored again the
          whole of the ancient Scriptures.” But the work now divided into 1 and
          2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, mentions Darius Codomannus
          (Neh_12:22), whose date is 336 b.c. The utmost the tradition proves is
          that about 300 b.c. the Pentateuch was in some sense attributed to
          Moses; see Bacon, Genesis of Gen_35:1-29; Bib. Sac, 1863:381, 660,
          799; Smith, Bible Dict., art.: Pentateuch; Theological Eclectic,
          6:215; Bissell, Hist. Origin of the Bible, 398–403. On the Men of the
          Great Synagogue, see Wright, Ecclesiastes, 5–12, 475–477.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) From the testimony of the Samaritan Pentateuch, dating from the
          time of Ezra and Nehemiah (500–450 b.c.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Samaritans had been brought by the king of Assyria from “Babylon,
          and from Cuthah and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim”
          (2Ki_17:6; 2Ki_17:24; 2Ki_17:26), to take the place of the people of
          Israel whom the king had carried away captive to his own land. The
          colonists had brought their heathen gods with them, and the incursions
          of wild beasts which the intermission of tillage occasioned gave rise
          to the belief that the God of Israel was against them. One of the
          captive Jewish priests was therefore sent to teach them “the law of
          the god of the land” and he “taught them how they should fear Jehovah”
          (2Ki_17:27-28). The result was that they adopted the Jewish ritual,
          but combined the worship of Jehovah with that of their graven images
          (verse 2Ki_17:33). When the Jews returned from Babylon and began to
          rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, the Samaritans offered their aid, but
          this aid was indignantly refused (Ezr_4:1-24 and Neh_4:1-23).
          Hostility arose between Jews and Samaritans—a hostility which
          continued not only to the time of Christ (Joh_4:9), but even to the
          present day. Since the Samaritan Pentateuch substantially coincides
          with the Hebrew Pentateuch, it furnishes us with a definite past date
          at which it certainly existed in nearly its present form. It witnesses
          to the existence of our Pentateuch in essentially its present form as
          far back as the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green, Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch, 44, 45—“After being
          repulsed by the Jews, the Samaritans, to substantiate their claim of
          being sprung from ancient Israel, eagerly accepted the Pentateuch
          which was brought them by a renegade priest.” W. Robertson Smith, in
          Encyc. Brit., 21:244—“The priestly law, which is throughout based on
          the practice of the priests of Jerusalem before the captivity, was
          reduced to form after the exile, and was first published by Ezra as
          the law of the rebuilt temple of Zion. The Samaritans must therefore
          have derived their Pentateuch from the Jews after Ezra’s reforms, i.
          e., after 444 b.c. Before that time Samaritanism cannot have existed
          in a form at all similar to that which we know; but there must have
          been a community ready to accept the Pentateuch.” See Smith’s Bible
          Dictionary, art.: Samaritan Pentateuch; Hastings, Bible Dictionary,
          art.: Samaria; Stanley Leathes, Structure of the O. T., 1–41.

        <p>
          (f) From the finding of “the book of the law” in the temple, in the
          eighteenth year of King Josiah, or in 621 b.c.
        </p>
        <p>
          2Ki_22:8—“And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
          have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah.” 2Ki_23:2—“The
          book of the covenant” was read before the people by the king and
          proclaimed to be the law of the land. Curtis, in Hastings’ Bible
          Dict., 3:596—“The earliest written law or book of divine instruction
          of whose introduction or enactment an authentic account is given, was
          Deuteronomy or its main portion, represented as found in the temple in
          the 18th year of king Josiah (b.c. 621) and proclaimed by the king as
          the law of the land. From that time forward Israel had a written law
          which the pious believer was commanded to ponder day and night
          (Jos_1:8; Psa_1:2); and thus the Torah, as sacred literature, formally
          commenced in Israel. This law aimed at a right application of Mosaic
          principles.” Ryle, in Hastings’ Bible Dict., 1:602—“The law of
          Deuteronomy represents an expansion and development of the ancient
          code contained in Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36; Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33,
          and precedes the final formulation of the priestly ritual, which only
          received its ultimate form in the last period of revising the
          structure of the Pentateuch.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Andrew Harper, on Deuteronomy, in Expositor’s Bible: “Deuteronomy does
          not claim to have been written by Moses. He is spoken of in the third
          person in the introduction and historical framework, while the
          speeches of Moses are in the first person. In portions where the
          author speaks for himself, the phrase ‘beyond Jordan’ means east of
          Jordan; in the speeches of Moses the phrase ‘beyond Jordan’ means west
          of Jordan; and the only exception is Deu_3:8, which cannot originally
          have been part of the speech of Moses. But the style of both parts is
          the same, and if the 3rd person parts are by a later author, the 1st
          person parts are by a later author also. Both differ from other
          speeches of Moses in the Pentateuch. Can the author be a contemporary
          writer who gives Moses’ words, as John gave the words of Jesus? No,
          for Deuteronomy covers only the book of the Covenant, Exo_20:1-26;
          Exo_21:1-36; Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33. It uses JE but not P, with
          which JE is interwoven. But JE appears in Joshua and contributes to it
          an account of Joshua’s death. JE speaks of kings in Israel
          (Gen_36:31-39). Deuteronomy plainly belongs to the early centuries of
          the Kingdom, or to the middle of it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bacon, Genesis of Gen_43:1-34; Gen_44:1-34; Gen_45:1-28; Gen_46:1-34;
          Gen_47:1-31; Gen_48:1-22; Gen_49:1-33—“The Deuteronomic law was so
          short that Shaphan could read it aloud before the king (2Ki_22:10) and
          the king could read “the whole of it” before the people (2Ki_23:2);
          compare the reading of the Pentateuch for a whole week (Neh_8:2-18).
          It was in the form of a covenant; it was distinguished by curses; it
          was an expansion and modification, fully within the legitimate
          province of the prophet, of a Torah of Moses codified from the
          traditional form of at least a century before. Such a Torah existed,
          was attributed to Moses, and is now incorporated as ‘the book of the
          covenant’ in Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36; Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33;
          Exo_24:1-18. The year 620 is therefore the terminus a quo of
          Deuteronomy. The date of the priestly code is 444 b.c.” Sanday,
          Bampton Lectures for 1893, grants “(1) the presence in the Pentateuch
          of a considerable element which in its present shape is held by many
          to be not earlier than the captivity; (2) the composition of the book
          of Deuteronomy, not long, or at least not very long, before its
          promulgation by king Josiah in the year 621, which thus becomes a
          pivot-date in the history of Hebrew literature.”

          (g) From references in the prophets Hosea (b.c. 743–737) and Amos
          (759–745) to a course of divine teaching and revelation extending far
          back of their day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hos_8:12—“I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law”; here is
          asserted the existence prior to the time of the prophet, not only of a
          law, but of a written law. All critics admit the book of Hosea to be a
          genuine production of the prophet, dating from the eighth century
          b.c.; see Green, in Presb. Rev., 1886:585–608. Amo_2:4—“they have
          rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes”; here is
          proof that, more than a century before the finding of Deuteronomy in
          the temple, Israel was acquainted with God’s law. Fisher, Nature and
          Method of Revelation, 26, 27—“The lofty plane reached by the prophets
          was not reached at a single bound.…There must have been a tap-root
          extending far down into the earth.” Kurtz remarks that “the later
          books of the O. T. would be a tree without roots, if the composition
          of the Pentateuch were transferred to a later period of Hebrew
          history.” If we substitute for the word ‘Pentateuch’ the words ‘Book
          of the covenant,’ we may assent to this dictum of Kurtz. There is
          sufficient evidence that, before the times of Hosea and Amos, Israel
          possessed a written law—the law embraced in Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36;
          Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33; Exo_24:1-18—but the Pentateuch as we now
          have it, including Leviticus, seems to date no further back than the
          time of Jeremiah, 445 b.c.. The Levitical law however was only the
          codification of statutes and customs whose origin lay far back in the
          past and which were believed to be only the natural expansion of the
          principles of Mosaic legislation.

          Leathes, Structure of O. T., 54—“Zeal for the restoration of the
          temple after the exile implied that it had long before been the centre
          of the national polity, that there had been a ritual and a law before
          the exile.” Present Day Tracts, 3:52—Levitical institutions could not
          have been first established by David, It is inconceivable that he
          “could have taken a whole tribe, and no trace remain of so
          revolutionary a measure as the dispossessing them of their property to
          make them ministers of religion.” James Robertson, Early History of
          Israel: “The varied literature of 850–750 b.c. implies the existence
          of reading and writing for some time before. Amos and Hosea hold, for
          the period succeeding Moses, the same scheme of history which modern
          critics pronounce late and unhistorical. The eighth century b.c. was a
          time of broad historic day, when Israel had a definite account to give
          of itself and of its history. The critics appeal to the prophets, but
          they reject the prophets when these tell us that other teachers taught
          the same truth before them, and when they declare that their nation
          had been taught a better religion and had declined from it, in other
          words, that there had been law long before their day. The kings did
          not give law. The priests presupposed it. There must have been a
          formal system of law much earlier than the critics admit, and also an
          earlier reference in their worship to the great events which made them
          a separate people.” And Dillman goes yet further back and declares
          that the entire work of Moses presupposes “a preparatory stage of
          higher religion in Abraham.”

          (h) From the repeated assertions of Scripture that Moses himself wrote
          a law for his people, confirmed as these are by evidence of literary
          and legislative activity in other nations far antedating his time.

          Exo_24:4—“And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah”; Exo_34:27—“And
          Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor
          of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel”;
          Num_33:2—“And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
          by the commandment of Jehovah”; Deu_31:9—“And Moses wrote this law,
          and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark
          of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel”;
          Deu_31:22—“So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
          children of Israel”; Deu_31:24-26—“And it came to pass, when Moses had
          made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they
          were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of
          the covenant of Jehovah, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it
          by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it
          may be there for a witness against thee.” The law here mentioned may
          possibly be only ‘the book of the covenant” (Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36;
          Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33; Exo_24:1-18), and the speeches of Moses in
          Deuteronomy may have been orally handed down. But the fact that Moses
          was “instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (Act_7:22),
          together with the fact that the art of writing was known in Egypt for
          many hundred years before bis time, make it more probable that a
          larger portion of the Pentateuch was of his own composition.

          Kenyon, in Hastings’ Dict., art.: Writing, dates the Proverbs of
          Ptah-hotep, the first recorded literary composition in Egypt, at
          3580–3536 b.c., and asserts the free use of writing among the Sumerian
          inhabitants of Babylonia as early as 4000 b.c. The statutes of
          Hammurabi king of Babylon compare for extent with those of Leviticus,
          yet they date back to the time of Abraham, 2200 b.c.,—indeed Hammurabi
          is now regarded by many as the Amraphel of Gen_14:1. Yet these
          statutes antedate Moses by 700 years. It is interesting to observe
          that Hammurabi professes to have received his statutes directly from
          the Sun-god of Sippar, his capital city. See translation by Winckler,
          in Der alte Orient, 97; Johns, The Oldest Code of Laws; Kelso, in
          Princeton Theol. Rev., July, 1905:399–412—Facts “authenticate the
          traditional date of the Book of the Covenant, overthrow the formula
          Prophets and Law, restore the old order Law and Prophets, and put into
          historical perspective the tradition that Moses was the author of the
          Sinaitic legislation.”

          As the controversy with regard to the genuineness of the Old Testament
          books has turned of late upon the claims of the Higher Criticism in
          general, and upon the claims of the Pentateuch in particular, we
          subjoin separate notes upon these subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Higher Criticism in general. Higher Criticism does not mean
          criticism in any invidious sense, any more than Kant’s Critique of
          Pure Reason was an unfavorable or destructive examination. It is
          merely a dispassionate investigation of the authorship, date and
          purpose of Scripture books, in the light of their composition, style
          and internal characteristics. As the Lower Criticism is a
          text-critique, the Higher Criticism is a structure-critique. A bright
          Frenchman described a literary critic as one who rips open the doll to
          get at the sawdust there is in it. This can be done with a sceptical
          and hostile spirit, and there can be little doubt that some of the
          higher critics of the Old Testament have begun their studies with
          prepossessions against the super-natural, which have vitiated all
          their conclusions. These presuppositions are ofter unconscious, but
          none the less influential. When Bishop Colenso examined the Pentateuch
          and Joshua, he disclaimed any intention of assailing the miraculous
          narratives as such; as if he had said: “My dear little fish, you need
          not fear me; I do not wish to catch you; I only intend to drain the
          pond in which you live.” To many scholars the waters at present seem
          very low in the Hexateuch and indeed throughout the whole Old
          Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shakespeare made over and incorporated many old Chronicles of Plutarch
          and Holinshed, and many Italian tales and early tragedies of other
          writers; but Pericles and Titus Andronicus still pass current under
          the name of Shakespeare. We speak even now of “Gesenius’ Hebrew
          Grammar,” although of its twenty-seven editions the last fourteen have
          been published since his death, and more of it has been written by
          other editors than Gesenius ever wrote himself. We speak of “Webster’s
          Dictionary,” though there are in the “Unabridged” thousands of words
          and definitions that Webster never saw. Francis Brown: “A modern
          writer masters older records and writes a wholly new book. Not so with
          eastern historians. The latest comer, as Renan says, ‘absorbs his
          predecessors without assimilating them, so that the most recent has in
          its belly the fragments of the previous works in a raw state.’ The
          Diatessaron of Tatian is a parallel to the composite structure of the
          O. T. books. One passage yields the following: Mat_21:12 a; Joh_2:14
          a; Mat_21:12 b; Joh_2:14-15; Mat_21:12-13; Joh_2:16; Mar_11:16;
          Joh_2:17-22; all succeeding each other without a break.” Gore, Lux
          Mundi, 353—“There is nothing materially untruthful, though there is
          something uncritical, in attributing the whole legislation to Moses
          acting under the divine command. It would be only of a piece with the
          attribution of the collection of Psalms to David, and of Proverbs to
          Solomon.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The opponents of the Higher Criticism have much to say in reply.
          Sayce, Early History of the Hebrews, holds that the early chapters of
          Genesis were copied from Babylonian sources, but he insists upon a
          Mosaic or pre-Mosaic date for the copying. Hilprecht however declares
          that the monotheistic faith of Israel could never have proceeded “from
          the Babylonian mountain of gods—that charnel-house full of corruption
          and dead men’s bones.” Bissell, Genesis Printed in Colors, Introd.,
          iv—“It is improbable that so many documentary histories existed so
          early, or if existing that the compiler should have attempted to
          combine them. Strange that the earlier should be J and should use the
          word ‘Jehovah,’ while the later P should use the word ‘Elohim,’ when
          ‘Jehovah’ would have far better suited the Priests’ Code.…xiii—The
          Babylonian tablets contain in a continuous narrative the more
          prominent facts of both the alleged Elohistic and Jehovistic sections
          of Genesis, and present them mainly in the Biblical order. Several
          hundred years before Moses what the critics call two were already one.
          It is absurd to say that the unity was due to a redactor at the period
          of the exile, 444 b.c.. He who believes that God revealed himself to
          primitive man as one God, will see in the Akkadian story a
          polytheistic corruption of the original monotheistic account.” We must
          not estimate the antiquity of a pair of boots by the last patch which
          the cobbler has added; nor must we estimate the antiquity of a
          Scripture book by the glosses and explanations added by later editors.
          As the London Spectator remarks on the Homeric problem: “It is as
          impossible that a first-rate poem or work of art should be produced
          without a great master-mind which first conceives the whole, as that a
          fine living bull should be developed out of beef-sausages.” As we
          shall proceed to show, however, these utterances overestimate the
          unity of the Pentateuch and ignore some striking evidences of its
          gradual growth and composite structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Authorship of the Pentateuch in particular. Recent critics,
          especially Kuenen and Robertson Smith, have maintained that the
          Pentateuch is Mosaic only in the sense of being a gradually growing
          body of traditional law, which was codified as late as the time of
          Ezekiel, and, as the development of the spirit and teachings of the
          great law-giver, was called by a legal fiction after the name of Moses
          and was attributed to him. The actual order of composition is
          therefore: (1) Book of the Covenant (Exo_20:1-26; Exo_21:1-36;
          Exo_22:1-31; Exo_23:1-33); (2) Deuteronomy; (3) Leviticus. Among the
          reasons assigned for this view are the facts (a) that Deuteronomy ends
          with an account of Moses’ death, and therefore could not have been
          written by Moses; (b) that in Leviticus Levites are mere servants to
          the priests, while in Deuteronomy the priests are officiating Levites,
          or, in other words, all the Levites are priests; (c) that the books of
          Judges and of 1 Samuel, with their record of sacrifices offered in
          many places, give no evidence that either Samuel or the nation of
          Israel had any knowledge of a law confining worship to a local
          sanctuary. See Kuenen, Prophets and Prophecy in Israel; Wellhausen,
          Geschichte Israels, Band 1; and art.: Israel, in Encyc. Brit., 13:398,
          399, 415; W. Robertson Smith, O. T. in Jewish Church, 306, 386, and
          Prophets of Israel; Hastings, Bible Dict, arts.: Deuteronomy,
          Hexateuch, and Canon of the O. T.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been urged in reply, (1) that Moses may have written, not
          autographically, but through a scribe (perhaps Joshua), and that this
          scribe may have completed the history in Deuteronomy with the account
          of Moses’ death; (2) that Ezra or subsequent prophets may have
          subjected the whole Pentateuch to recension, and may have added
          explanatory notes; (3) that documents of previous ages may have been
          incorporated, in course of its composition by Moses, or subsequently
          by his successors; (4) that the apparent lack of distinction between
          the different classes of Levites in Deuteronomy may be explained by
          the fact that, while Leviticus was written with exact detail for the
          priests, Deuteronomy is the record of a brief general and ora summary
          of the law, addressed to the people at large and therefore naturally
          mentioning the clergy as a whole; (5) that the silence of the book of
          Judges as to the Mosaic ritual may be explained by the design of the
          book to describe only general history, and by the probability that at
          the tabernacle a ritual was observed of which the people in general
          were ignorant. Sacrifices in other places only accompanied special
          divine manifestations which made the recipient temporarily a priest.
          Even if it were proved that the law with regard to a central sanctuary
          was not observed, it would not show that the law did not exist, any
          more than violation of the second commandment by Solomon proves his
          ignorance of the decalogue, or the mediaeval neglect of the N. T. by
          the Roman church proves that the N. T. did not then exist. We cannot
          argue that “where there was transgression, there was no law” (Watts,
          New Apologetic, 83, and The Newer Criticism).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the light of recent research, however, we cannot regard these
          replies as satisfactory. Woods, in his article on the Hexateuch,
          Hastings’ Dictionary, 2:365, presents a moderate statement of the
          results of the higher criticism which commends itself to us as more
          trustworthy. He calls it a theory of stratification, and holds that
          “certain more or less independent documents, dealing largely with the
          same series of events, were composed at different periods, or, at any
          rate, under different auspices, and were afterwards combined, so that
          our present Hexateuch, which means our Pentateuch with the addition of
          Joshua, contains these several different literary strata.…The main
          grounds for accepting this hypothesis of stratification are (1) that
          the various literary pieces, with very few exceptions, will be found
          on examination to arrange themselves by common characteristics into
          comparatively few groups; (2) that an original consecution of
          narrative may be frequently traced between what in their present form
          are isolated fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This will be better understood by the following illustration. Let us
          suppose a problem of this kind: Given a patchwork quilt, explain the
          character of the original pieces out of which the bits of stuff
          composing the quilt were cut. First, we notice that, however well the
          colors may blend, however nice and complete the whole may look, many
          of the adjoining pieces do not agree in material, texture, pattern,
          color, or the like. Ergo, they have been made up out of very different
          pieces of stuff.…But suppose we further discover that many of the
          bits, though now separated, are like one another in material, texture,
          etc., we may conjecture that these have been cut out of one piece. But
          we shall prove this beyond reasonable doubt if we find that several
          bits when unpicked fit together, so that the pattern of one is
          continued in the other; and, moreover, that if all of like character
          are sorted out, they form, say, four groups, each of which was
          evidently once a single piece of stuff, though parts of each are found
          missing, because, no doubt, they have not been required to make the
          whole. But we make the analogy of the Hexateuch even closer, if we
          further suppose that in certain parts of the quilt the bits belonging
          to, say, two of these groups are so combined as to form a subsidiary
          pattern within the larger pattern of the whole quilt, and had
          evidently been sewed together before being connected with other parts
          of the quilt; and we may make it even closer still, if we suppose
          that, besides the more important bits of stuff, smaller
          embellishments, borderings, and the like, had been added so as to
          improve the general effect of the whole.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The author of this article goes on to point out three main portions of
          the Hexateuch which essentially differ from each other. There are
          three distinct codes: the Covenant code (C = Exo 20:22-23:33, 24:3–8),
          the Deuteronomic code (D), and the Priestly code (P). These codes have
          peculiar relations to the narrative portions of the Hexateuch. In
          Genesis, for example, “the greater part of the book is divided into
          groups of longer or shorter pieces, generally paragraphs or chapters,
          distinguished respectively by the almost exclusive use of Elohim or
          Jehovah as the name of God.” Let us call these portions J and E. But
          we find such close affinities between C and JE, that we may regard
          them as substantially one. “We shall find that the larger part of the
          narratives, as distinct from the laws, of Exodus and Numbers belong to
          JE; whereas, with special exceptions, the legal portions belong to P.
          In the last chapters of Deuteronomy and in the whole of Joshua we find
          elements of JE. In the latter book we also find elements which connect
          it with D.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It should be observed that not only do we find here and there
          separate pieces in the Hexateuch, shown by their characters to belong
          to these three sources, JE, D, and P, but the pieces will often be
          found connected together by an obvious continuity of subject when
          pieced together, like the bits of patchwork in the illustration with
          which we started. For example, if we read continuously Gen_11:27-32;
          Gen_12:4-5; Gen_13:6; Gen_13:11-12; Gen_16:1; Gen_16:3; Gen_16:15-16;
          Gen_17:1-27; Gen_19:29; Gen_21:1-5; Gen_23:1-20; Gen_25:7-11—passages
          mainly, on other grounds, attributed to P, we get an almost continuous
          and complete, though very concise, account of Abraham’s life.” We may
          concede the substantial correctness of the view thus propounded. It
          simply shows God’s actual method in making up the record of his
          revelation. We may add that any scholar who grants that Moses did not
          himself write the account of his own death and burial in the last
          chapter of Deuteronomy, or who recognizes two differing accounts of
          creation in Gen_1:1-31; Gen_2:1-25, has already begun an analysis of
          the Pentateuch and has accepted the essential principles of the higher
          criticism.
