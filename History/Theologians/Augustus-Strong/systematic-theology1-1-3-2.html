        <h2>2. Man&#x27;s capacity for the knowledge of God</h2>
        <p>
          In the capacity of the human mind for knowing God and certain of these
          relations.—But it has urged that such knowledge is impossible for the
          following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. Because we can know only phenomena. We reply: (a) We know mental as
          well as physical phenomena. (b) In knowing phenomena, whether mental
          or physical, we know substance as underlying the phenomena, as
          manifested through them, and as constituting their ground of unity.
          (c) Our minds bring to the observation of phenomena not only this
          knowledge of substance, but also knowledge of time, space, cause, and
          right, realities which are in no sense phenomenal. Since these objects
          of knowledge are not phenomenal, the fact that God is not phenomenal
          cannot prevent us from knowing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          What substance is, we need not here determine. Whether we are realists
          or idealists, we are compelled to grant that there cannot be phenomena
          without noumena, cannot be appearances without something that appears,
          cannot be qualities without something that is qualified. This
          something which underlies or stands under appearance or quality we
          call substance. We are Lotzeans rather than Kantians, in our
          philosophy. To say that we know, not the self, but only its
          manifestations in thought, is to confound self with its thinking and
          to teach psychology without a soul. To say that we know no external
          world, but only its manifestations in sensations, is to ignore the
          principle that binds these sensations together; for without a somewhat
          in which qualities inhere they can have no ground of unity. In like
          manner, to say that we know nothing of God but his manifestations, is
          to confound God with the world and practically to deny that there is a
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stählin, in his work on Kant, Lotze and Ritschl, 186-191, 218, 219,
          says well that “limitation of knowledge to phenomena involves the
          elimination from theology of all claim to know the objects of the
          Christian faith as they are in themselves.” This criticism justly
          classes Ritschl with Kant, rather than with Lotze who maintains that
          knowing phenomena we know also the noumena manifested in them. While
          Ritschl professes to follow Lotze, the whole drift of his theology is
          in the direction of the Kantian identification of the world with our
          sensations, mind with our thoughts, and God with such activities of
          his as we can perceive. A divine nature apart from its activities, a
          preexistent Christ, an immanent Trinity, are practically denied.
          Assertions that God is self-conscious love and fatherhood become
          judgments of merely subjective value. On Ritschl, see the works of
          Orr, of Garvie, and of Swing; also Minton, in Pres. and Ref. Rev.,
          Jan. 1902:162-169, and C. W. Hodge, ibid., Apl. 1902:321-326; Flint,
          Agnosticism, 590-597; Everett, Essays Theol. and Lit., 92-99.
        </p>
        <p>
          We grant that we can know God only so far as his activities reveal
          him, and so far as our minds and hearts are receptive of his
          revelation. The appropriate faculties must be exercised—not the
          mathematical, the logical, or the prudential, but the ethical and the
          religious. It is the merit of Ritschl that he recognizes the practical
          in distinction from the speculative reason; his error is in not
          recognizing that, when we do thus use the proper powers of knowing, we
          gain not merely subjective but also objective truth, and come in
          contact not simply with God&#x27;s activities but also with God
          himself. Normal religious judgments, though dependent upon subjective
          conditions, are not simply “judgments of worth” or
          “value-judgments,”—they give us the knowledge of “things in
          themselves.” Edward Caird says of his brother John Caird (Fund. Ideas
          of Christianity, Introd. cxxi)—“The conviction that God can be known
          and is known, and that, in the deepest sense, all our knowledge is
          knowledge of him, was the corner-stone of his theology.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritschl&#x27;s phenomenalism is allied to the positivism of Comte, who
          regarded all so-called knowledge of other than phenomenal objects as
          purely negative. The phrase “Positive Philosophy” implies indeed that
          all knowledge of mind is negative; see Comte, Pos. Philosophy,
          Martineau&#x27;s translation, 26, 28, 33—“In order to observe, your
          intellect must pause from activity—yet it is this very activity you
          want to observe. If you cannot effect the pause, you cannot observe;
          if you do effect it, there is nothing to observe.” This view is
          refuted by the two facts; (1) consciousness, and (2) memory; for
          consciousness is the knowing of the self side by side with the knowing
          of its thoughts, and memory is the knowing of the self side by side
          with the knowing of its past; see Martineau, Essays Philos. and
          Theol., 1:24-40, 207-212. By phenomena we mean “facts, in distinction
          from their ground, principle, or law”; “neither phenomena nor
          qualities, as such, are perceived, but objects, percepts, or beings;
          and it is by an after-thought or reflex process that these are
          connected as qualities and are referred to as substances”; see Porter,
          Human Intellect, 51, 238, 520, 619-637, 640-645.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phenomena may be internal, e. g., thoughts; in this case the noumenon
          is the mind, of which these thoughts are the manifestations. Or,
          phenomena may be external, e. g., color, hardness, shape, size; in
          this case the noumenon is matter, of which these qualities are the
          manifestations. But qualities, whether mental or material, imply the
          existence of a substance to which they belong: they can no more be
          conceived of as existing apart from substance, than the upper side of
          a plank can be conceived of as existing without an under side; see
          Bowne, Review of Herbert Spencer, 47, 207-217; Martineau, Types of
          Ethical Theory, 1; 455, 456—“Comte&#x27;s assumption that mind cannot
          know itself or its states is exactly balanced by Kant&#x27;s
          assumption that mind cannot know anything outside of itself.... It is
          precisely because all knowledge is of relations that it is not and
          cannot be of phenomena alone. The absolute cannot per se be known,
          because in being known it would ipso facto enter into relations and be
          absolute no more. But neither can the phenomenal per se be known, i.
          e., be known as phenomenal, without simultaneous cognition of what is
          non-phenomenal.” McCosh, Intuitions, 138-154, states the
          characteristics of substance as (1) being, (2) power, (3) permanence.
          Diman, Theistic Argument, 337, 363—“The theory that disproves God,
          disproves an external world and the existence of the soul.” We know
          something beyond phenomena, viz.: law, cause, force,—or we can have no
          science; see Tulloch, on Comte, in Modern Theories, 53-73; see also
          Bib. Sac., 1874:211; Alden, Philosophy, 44; Hopkins, Outline Study of
          Man, 87; Fleming, Vocab. of Philosophy, art.: Phenomena; New
          Englander, July, 1875:537-539.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Because we can know only that which bears analogy to our own nature
          or experience. We reply: (a) It is not essential to knowledge that
          there be similarity of nature between the knower and the known. We
          know by difference as well as by likeness. (b) Our past experience,
          though greatly facilitating new acquisitions, is not the measure of
          our possible knowledge. Else the first act of knowledge would be
          inexplicable, and all revelation of higher characters to lower would
          be precluded, as well as all progress to knowledge which surpasses our
          present attainments. (c) Even if knowledge depended upon similarity of
          nature and experience, we might still know God, since we are made in
          God&#x27;s image, and there are important analogies between the divine
          nature and our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The dictum of Empedocles, “Similia similibus percipiuntur,” must
          be supplemented by a second dictum, “Similia dissimilibus
          percipiuntur.” All things are alike, in being objects. But knowing is
          distinguishing, and there must be contrast between objects to awaken
          our attention. God knows sin, though it is the antithesis to his holy
          being. The ego knows the non-ego. We cannot know even self, without
          objectifying it, distinguishing it from its thoughts, and regarding it
          as another.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Versus Herbert Spencer, First Principles, 79-82—“Knowledge is
          recognition and classification.” But we reply that a thing must first
          be perceived in order to be recognized or compared with something
          else; and this is as true of the first sensation as of the later and
          more definite forms of knowledge,—indeed there is no sensation which
          does not involve, as its complement, an at least incipient perception;
          see Sir William Hamilton, Metaphysics, 351, 352; Porter, Human
          Intellect, 206.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Porter, Human Intellect, 486—“Induction is possible only upon the
          assumption that the intellect of man is a reflex of the divine
          intellect, or that man is made in the image of God.” Note, however,
          that man is made in God&#x27;s image, not God in man&#x27;s. The
          painting is the image of the landscape, not, vice versa, the landscape
          the image of the painting; for there is much in the landscape that has
          nothing corresponding to it in the painting. Idolatry perversely makes
          God in the image of man, and so deifies man&#x27;s weakness and
          impurity. Trinity in God may have no exact counterpart in man&#x27;s
          present constitution, though it may disclose to us the goal of
          man&#x27;s future development and the meaning of the increasing
          differentiation of man&#x27;s powers. Gore, Incarnation, 116—“If
          anthropomorphism as applied to God is false, yet theomorphism as
          applied to man is true; man is made in God&#x27;s image, and his
          qualities are, not the measure of the divine, but their counterpart
          and real expression.” See Murphy, Scientific Bases, 122; McCosh, in
          Internat. Rev., 1875:105; Bib. Sac., 1867:624; Martineau, Types of
          Ethical Theory, 2:4-8, and Study of Religion, 1:94.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. Because we know only that of which we can conceive, in the sense of
          forming an adequate mental image. We reply: (a) It is true that we
          know only that of which we can conceive, if by the term “conceive” we
          mean our distinguishing in thought the object known from all other
          objects. But, (b) The objection confounds conception with that which
          is merely its occasional accompaniment and help, namely, the picturing
          of the object by the imagination. In this sense, conceivability is not
          a final test of truth. (c) That the formation of a mental image is not
          essential to conception or knowledge, is plain when we remember that,
          as a matter of fact, we both conceive and know many things of which we
          cannot form a mental image of any sort that in the least corresponds
          to the reality; for example, force, cause, law, space, our own minds.
          So we may know God, though we cannot form an adequate mental image of
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objection here refuted is expressed most clearly in the words of
          Herbert Spencer, First Principles, 25-36, 98—“The reality underlying
          appearances is totally and forever inconceivable by us.” Mansel,
          Prolegomena Logica, 77, 78 (cf. 26) suggests the source of this error
          in a wrong view of the nature of the concept: “The first
          distinguishing feature of a concept, viz.: that it cannot in itself be
          depicted to sense or imagination.” Porter, Human Intellect, 392 (see
          also 429, 656)—“The concept is not a mental image”—only the percept
          is. Lotze: “Color in general is not representable by any image; it
          looks neither green nor red, but has no look whatever.” The generic
          horse has no particular color, though the individual horse may be
          black, white, or bay. So Sir William Hamilton speaks of “the
          unpicturable notions of the intelligence.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Martineau, Religion and Materialism, 39, 40—“This doctrine of
          Nescience stands in exactly the same relation to causal power, whether
          you construe it as Material Force or as Divine Agency. Neither can be
          observed; one or the other must be assumed. If you admit to the
          category of knowledge only what we learn from observation, particular
          or generalized, then is Force unknown; if you extend the word to what
          is imported by the intellect itself into our cognitive acts, to make
          them such, then is God known.” Matter, ether, energy, protoplasm,
          organism, life,—no one of these can be portrayed to the imagination;
          yet Mr. Spencer deals with them as objects of Science. If these are
          not inscrutable, why should he regard the Power that gives unity to
          all things as inscrutable?
        </p>
        <p>
          Herbert Spencer is not in fact consistent with himself, for in divers
          parts of his writings he calls the inscrutable Reality back of
          phenomena the one, eternal, ubiquitous, infinite, ultimate, absolute
          Existence, Power and Cause. “It seems,” says Father Dalgairns, “that a
          great deal is known about the Unknowable.” Chadwick, Unitarianism,
          75—“The beggar phrase ‘Unknowable’ becomes, after Spencer&#x27;s
          repeated designations of it, as rich as Croesus with all saving
          knowledge.” Matheson: “To know that we know nothing is already to have
          reached a fact of knowledge.” If Mr. Spencer intended to exclude God
          from the realm of Knowledge, he should first have excluded him from
          the realm of Existence; for to grant that he is, is already to grant
          that we not only may know him, but that we actually to some extent do
          know him; see D. J. Hill, Genetic Philosophy, 22; McCosh, Intuitions,
          186-189 (Eng. ed., 214); Murphy, Scientific Bases, 133; Bowne, Review
          of Spencer, 30-34; New Englander, July, 1875:543, 544; Oscar Craig, in
          Presb. Rev., July, 1883:594-602.
        </p>
        <p>
          D. Because we can know truly only that which we know in whole and not
          in part. We reply: (a) The objection confounds partial knowledge with
          the knowledge of a part. We know the mind in part, but we do not know
          a part of the mind. (b) If the objection were valid, no real knowledge
          of anything would be possible, since we know no single thing in all
          its relations. We conclude that, although God is a being not composed
          of parts, we may yet have a partial knowledge of him, and this
          knowledge, though not exhaustive, may yet be real, and adequate to the
          purposes of science.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The objection mentioned in the text is urged by Mansel, Limits of
          Religious Thought, 97, 98, and is answered by Martineau, Essays,
          1:291. The mind does not exist in space, and it has no parts: we
          cannot speak of its south-west corner, nor can we divide it into
          halves. Yet we find the material for mental science in partial
          knowledge of the mind. So, while we are not “geographers of the divine
          nature” (Bowne, Review of Spencer, 72), we may say with Paul, not “now
          know we a part of God,” but “now I know [God], in part” (1 Cor.
          13:12). We may know truly what we do not know exhaustively; see Eph.
          3:19—“to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.” I do not
          perfectly understand myself, yet I know myself in part; so I may know
          God, though I do not perfectly understand him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The same argument that proves God unknowable proves the universe
          unknowable also. Since every particle of matter in the universe
          attracts every other, no one particle can be exhaustively explained
          without taking account of all the rest. Thomas Carlyle: “It is a
          mathematical fact that the casting of this pebble from my hand alters
          the centre of gravity of the universe.” Tennyson, Higher Pantheism:
          “Flower in the crannied wall, I pluck you out of the crannies; Hold
          you here, root and all, in my hand, Little flower; but if I could
          understand What you are, root and all, and all in all, I should know
          what God and man is.” Schurman, Agnosticism, 119—“Partial as it is,
          this vision of the divine transfigures the life of man on earth.”
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:167—“A faint-hearted agnosticism is
          worse than the arrogant and titanic gnosticism against which it
          protests.”
        </p>
        <p>
          E. Because all predicates of God are negative, and therefore furnish
          no real knowledge. We answer: (a) Predicates derived from our
          consciousness, such as spirit, love, and holiness, are positive. (b)
          The terms “infinite” and “absolute,” moreover, express not merely a
          negative but a positive idea—the idea, in the former case, of the
          absence of all limit, the idea that the object thus described goes on
          and on forever; the idea, in the latter case, of entire
          self-sufficiency. Since predicates of God, therefore, are not merely
          negative, the argument mentioned above furnishes no valid reason why
          we may not know him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Versus Sir William Hamilton, Metaphysics, 530—“The absolute and the
          infinite can each only be conceived as a negation of the thinkable; in
          other words, of the absolute and infinite we have no conception at
          all.” Hamilton here confounds the infinite, or the absence of all
          limits, with the indefinite, or the absence of all known limits. Per
          contra, see Calderwood, Moral Philosophy, 248, and Philosophy of the
          Infinite, 272—“Negation of one thing is possible only by affirmation
          of another.” Porter, Human Intellect, 652—“If the Sandwich Islanders,
          for lack of name, had called the ox a not-hog, the use of a negative
          appellation would not necessarily authorize the inference of a want of
          definite conceptions or positive knowledge.” So with the infinite or
          not-finite, the unconditioned or not-conditioned, the independent or
          not-dependent,—these names do not imply that we cannot conceive and
          know it as something positive. Spencer, First Principles, 92—“Our
          consciousness of the Absolute, indefinite though it is, is positive,
          and not negative.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Schurman, Agnosticism, 100, speaks of “the farce of nescience playing
          at omniscience in setting the bounds of science.” “The agnostic,” he
          says, “sets up the invisible picture of a Grand Être, formless and
          colorless in itself, absolutely separated from man and from the
          world—blank within and void without—its very existence
          indistinguishable from its non-existence, and, bowing down before this
          idolatrous creation, he pours out his soul in lamentations over the
          incognizableness of such a mysterious and awful non-entity.... The
          truth is that the agnostic&#x27;s abstraction of a Deity is unknown,
          only because it is unreal.” See McCosh, Intuitions, 194, note; Mivart,
          Lessons from Nature, 363. God is not necessarily infinite in every
          respect. He is infinite only in every excellence. A plane which is
          unlimited in the one respect of length may be limited in another
          respect, such as breadth. Our doctrine here is not therefore
          inconsistent with what immediately follows.

          F. Because to know is to limit or define. Hence the Absolute as
          unlimited, and the Infinite as undefined, cannot be known. We answer:
          (a) God is absolute, not as existing in no relation, but as existing
          in no necessary relation; and (b) God is infinite, not as excluding
          all coexistence of the finite with himself, but as being the ground of
          the finite, and so unfettered by it. (c) God is actually limited by
          the unchangeableness of his own attributes and personal distinctions,
          as well as by his self-chosen relations to the universe he has created
          and to humanity in the person of Christ. God is therefore limited and
          defined in such a sense as to render knowledge of him possible.

          Versus Mansel, Limitations of Religious Thought, 75-84, 93-95; cf.
          Spinoza: “Omnis determinatio est negatio;” hence to define God is to
          deny him. But we reply that perfection is inseparable from limitation.
          Man can be other than he is: not so God, at least internally. But this
          limitation, inherent in his unchangeable attributes and personal
          distinctions, is God&#x27;s perfection. Externally, all limitations
          upon God are self-limitations, and so are consistent with his
          perfection. That God should not be able thus to limit himself in
          creation and redemption would render all self-sacrifice in him
          impossible, and so would subject him to the greatest of limitations.
          We may say therefore that God&#x27;s 1. Perfection involves his
          limitation to (a) personality, (b) trinity, (c) righteousness; 2.
          Revelation involves his self-limitation in (a) decree, (b) creation,
          (c) preservation, (d) government, (e) education of the world; 3.
          Redemption involves his infinite self-limitation in the (a) person and
          (b) work of Jesus Christ; see A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation,
          87-101, and in Bap. Quar. Rev., Jan. 1891:521-532.

          Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 135—“The infinite is not the quantitative
          all; the absolute is not the unrelated.... Both absolute and infinite
          mean only the independent ground of things.” Julius Müller, Doct. Sin,
          Introduc., 10—“Religion has to do, not with anObject that must let
          itself be known because its very existence is contingent upon its
          being known, but with the Object in relation to whom we are truly
          subject, dependent upon him, and waiting until he manifest himself.”
          James Martineau, Study of Religion, 1:346—“We must not confound the
          infinite with the total.... The self-abnegation of infinity is but a
          form of self-assertion, and the only form in which it can reveal
          itself.... However instantaneous the omniscient thought, however sure
          the almighty power, the execution has to be distributed in time, and
          must have an order of successive steps; on no other terms can the
          eternal become temporal, and the infinite articulately speak in the
          finite.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfect personality excludes, not self-determination, but
          determination from without, determination by another. God&#x27;s
          self-limitations are the self-limitations of love, and therefore the
          evidences of his perfection. They are signs, not of weakness but of
          power. God has limited himself to the method of evolution, gradually
          unfolding himself in nature and in history. The government of sinners
          by a holy God involves constant self-repression. The education of the
          race is a long process of divine forbearance; Herder: “The limitations
          of the pupil are limitations of the teacher also.” In inspiration, God
          limits himself by the human element through which he works. Above all,
          in the person and work of Christ, we have infinite self-limitation:
          Infinity narrows itself down to a point in the incarnation, and
          holiness endures the agonies of the Cross. God&#x27;s promises are
          also self-limitations. Thus both nature and grace are self-imposed
          restrictions upon God, and these self-limitations are the means by
          which he reveals himself. See Pfleiderer, Die Religion, 1:189, 195;
          Porter, Human Intellect, 653; Murphy, Scientific Bases, 130;

          G. Because all knowledge is relative to the knowing agent; that is,
          what we know, we know, not as it is objectively, but only as it is
          related to our own senses and faculties. In reply: (a) We grant that
          we can know only that which has relation to our faculties. But this is
          simply to say that we know only that which we come into mental contact
          with, that is, we know only what we know. But, (b) We deny that what
          we come into mental contact with is known by us as other than it is.
          So far as it is known at all, it is known as it is. In other words,
          the laws of our knowing are not merely arbitrary and regulative, but
          correspond to the nature of things. We conclude that, in theology, we
          are equally warranted in assuming that the laws of our thought are
          laws of God&#x27;s thought, and that the results of normally conducted
          thinking with regard to God correspond to the objective reality.

          Versus Sir Wm. Hamilton, Metaph., 96-116, and Herbert Spencer, First
          Principles, 68-97. This doctrine of relativity is derived from Kant,
          Critique of Pure Reason, who holds that a priori judgments are simply
          “regulative.” But we reply that when our primitive beliefs are found
          to be simply regulative, they will cease to regulate. The forms of
          thought are also facts of nature. The mind does not, like the glass of
          a kaleidoscope, itself furnish the forms; it recognizes these as
          having an existence external to itself. The mind reads its ideas, not
          into nature, but in nature. Our intuitions are not green goggles,
          which make all the world seem green: they are the lenses of a
          microscope, which enable us to see what is objectively real (Royce,
          Spirit of Mod. Philos., 125). Kant called our understanding “the
          legislator of nature.” But it is so, only as discoverer of
          nature&#x27;s laws, not as creator of them. Human reason does impose
          its laws and forms upon the universe; but, in doing this, it
          interprets the real meaning of the universe.

          Ladd, Philos. of Knowledge: “All judgment implies an objective truth
          according to which we judge, which constitutes the standard, and with
          which we have something in common, i. e., our minds are part of an
          infinite and eternal Mind.” French aphorism: “When you are right, you
          are more right than you think you are.” God will not put us to
          permanent intellectual confusion. Kant vainly wrote “No thoroughfare”
          over the reason in its highest exercise. Martineau, Study of Religion,
          1:135, 136—“Over against Kant&#x27;s assumption that the mind cannot
          know anything outside of itself, we may set Comte&#x27;s equally
          unwarrantable assumption that the mind cannot know itself or its
          states. We cannot have philosophy without assumptions. You dogmatize
          if you say that the forms correspond with reality; but you equally
          dogmatize if you say that they do not.... 79—That our cognitive
          faculties correspond to things as they are, is much less surprising
          than that they should correspond to things as they are not.” W. T.
          Harris, in Journ. Spec. Philos., 1:22, exposes Herbert Spencer&#x27;s
          self-contradiction: “All knowledge is, not absolute, but relative; our
          knowledge of this fact however is, not relative, but absolute.”

          Ritschl, Justification and Reconciliation, 3:16-21, sets out with a
          correct statement of the nature of knowledge, and gives in his
          adhesion to the doctrine of Lotze, as distinguished from that of Kant.
          Ritschl&#x27;s statement may be summarized as follows: “We deal, not
          with the abstract God of metaphysics, but with the God self-limited,
          who is revealed in Christ. We do not know either things or God apart
          from their phenomena or manifestations, as Plato imagined; we do not
          know phenomena or manifestations alone, without knowing either things
          or God, as Kant supposed; but we do know both things and God in their
          phenomena or manifestations, as Lotze taught. We hold to no mystical
          union with God, back of all experience in religion, as Pietism does;
          soul is always and only active, and religion is the activity of the
          human spirit, in which feeling, knowing and willing combine in an
          intelligible order.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But Dr. C. M. Mead, Ritschl&#x27;s Place in the History of Doctrine,
          has well shown that Ritschl has not followed Lotze. His
          “value-judgments” are simply an application to theology of the
          “regulative” principle of Kant. He holds that we can know things not
          as they are in themselves, but only as they are for us. We reply that
          what things are worth for us depends on what they are in themselves.
          Ritschl regards the doctrines of Christ&#x27;s preexistence, divinity
          and atonement as intrusions of metaphysics into theology, matters
          about which we cannot know, and with which we have nothing to do.
          There is no propitiation or mystical union with Christ; and Christ is
          our Example, but not our atoning Savior. Ritschl does well in
          recognizing that love in us gives eyes to the mind, and enables us to
          see the beauty of Christ and his truth. But our judgment is not, as he
          holds, a merely subjective value-judgment,—it is a coming in contact
          with objective fact. On the theory of knowledge held by Kant, Hamilton
