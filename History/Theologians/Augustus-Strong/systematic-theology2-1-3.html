          III. Other Supposed Sources of our Idea of God&#x27;s Existence.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our proof that the idea of God&#x27;s existence is a rational
          intuition will not be complete, until we show that attempts to account
          in other ways for the origin of the idea are insufficient, and require
          as their presupposition the very intuition which they would supplant
          or reduce to a secondary place. We claim that it cannot be derived
          from any other source than an original cognitive power of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Not from external revelation,—whether communicated (a) through the
          Scriptures, or (b)through tradition; for, unless man had from another
          source a previous knowledge of the existence of a God from whom such a
          revelation might come, the revelation itself could have no authority
          for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) See Gillespie, Necessary Existence of God, 10; Ebrard, Dogmatik,
          1:117; H. B. Smith, Faith and Philosophy, 18—“A revelation takes for
          granted that he to whom it is made has some knowledge of God, though
          it may enlarge and purify that knowledge.” We cannot prove God from
          the authority of the Scriptures, and then also prove the Scriptures
          from the authority of God. The very idea of Scripture as a revelation
          presupposes belief in a God who can make it. Newman Smyth, in New
          Englander, 1878:355—We cannot derive from a sun-dial our knowledge of
          the existence of a sun. The sun-dial presupposes the sun, and cannot
          be understood without previous knowledge of the sun. Wuttke, Christian
          Ethics, 2:103—“The voice of the divine ego does not first come to the
          consciousness of the individual ego from without; rather does every
          external revelation presuppose already this inner one; there must echo
          out from within man something kindred to the outer revelation, in
          order to its being recognized and accepted as divine.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fairbairn, Studies in Philos. of Relig. and Hist., 21, 22—“If man is
          dependent on an outer revelation for his idea of God, then he must
          have what Schelling happily termed ‘an original atheism of
          consciousness.’ Religion cannot, in that case, be rooted in the nature
          of man,—it must be implanted from without.” Schurman, Belief in God,
          78—“A primitive revelation of God could only mean that God had endowed
          man with the capacity of apprehending his divine original. This
          capacity, like every other, is innate, and like every other, it
          realizes itself only in the presence of appropriate
          conditions.”Clarke, Christian Theology, 112—“Revelation cannot
          demonstrate God&#x27;s existence, for it must assume it; but it will
          manifest his existence and character to men, and will serve them as
          the chief source of certainty concerning him, for it will teach them
          what they could not know by other means.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Nor does our idea of God come primarily from tradition, for
          “tradition can perpetuate only what has already been originated”
          (Patton). If the knowledge thus handed down is the knowledge of a
          primitive revelation, then the argument just stated applies—that very
          revelation presupposed in those who first received it, and presupposes
          in those to whom it is handed down, some knowledge of a Being from
          whom such a revelation might come. If the knowledge thus handed down
          is simply knowledge of the results of the reasonings of the race, then
          the knowledge of God comes originally from reasoning—an explanation
          which we consider further on. On the traditive theory of religion, see
          Flint, Theism, 23, 338; Cocker, Christianity and Greek Philosophy,
          86-96; Fairbairn, Studies in Philos. of Relig. and Hist., 14, 15;
          Bowen, Metaph. and Ethics, 453, and in Bib. Sac., Oct. 1876;
          Pfleiderer, Religionsphilos., 312-322.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar answers must be returned to many common explanations of
          man&#x27;s belief in God: “Primus in orbe deos fecit timor”;
          Imagination made religion; Priests invented religion; Religion is a
          matter of imitation and fashion. But we ask again: What caused the
          fear? Who made the imagination? What made priests possible? What made
          imitation and fashion natural? To say that man worships, merely
          because he sees other men worshiping, is as absurd as to say that a
          horse eats hay because he sees other horses eating it. There must be a
          hunger in the soul to be satisfied, or external things would never
          attract man to worship. Priests could never impose upon men so
          continuously, unless there was in human nature a universal belief in a
          God who might commission priests as his representatives. Imagination
          itself requires some basis of reality, and a larger basis as
          civilization advances. The fact that belief in God&#x27;s existence
          gets a wider hold upon the race with each added century, shows that,
          instead of fear having caused belief in God, the truth is that belief
          in God has caused fear; indeed, “the fear of Jehovah is the beginning
          of wisdom” (Ps. 111:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Not from experience,—whether this mean (a) the sense-perception and
          reflection of the individual (Locke), (b) the accumulated results of
          the sensations and associations of past generations of the race
          (Herbert Spencer), or (c) the actual contact of our sensitive nature
          with God, the supersensible reality, through the religious feeling
          (Newman Smyth).
        </p>
        <p>
          The first form of this theory is inconsistent with the fact that the
          idea of God is not the idea of a sensible or material object, nor a
          combination of such ideas. Since the spiritual and infinite are direct
          opposites of the material and finite, no experience of the latter can
          account for our idea of the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Locke (Essay on Hum. Understanding, 2:1:4), experience is the
          passive reception of ideas by sensation or by reflection. Locke&#x27;s
          “tabula rasa” theory mistakes the occasion of our primitive ideas for
          their cause. To his statement: “Nihil est in intellectu nisi quod ante
          fuerit in sensu,” Leibnitz replied: “Nisi intellectus
          ipse.”Consciousness is sometimes called the source of our knowledge of
          God. But consciousness, as simply an accompanying knowledge of
          ourselves and our states, is not properly the source of any other
          knowledge. The German Gottesbewusstsein = not “consciousness of God,”
          but “knowledge of God”; Bewusstsein here = not a “conknowing,”but a
          “beknowing”; see Porter, Human Intellect, 86; Cousin, True, Beautiful
          and Good, 48, 49.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fraser, Locke, 143-147—Sensations are the bricks, and association the
          mortar, of the mental house. Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge,
          47—“Develope language by allowing sounds to associate and evolve
          meaning for themselves? Yet this is the exact parallel of the
          philosophy which aims to build intelligence out of sensation....52—One
          who does not know how to read would look in vain for meaning in a
          printed page, and in vain would he seek to help his failure by using
          strong spectacles.”Yet even if the idea of God were a product of
          experience, we should not be warranted in rejecting it as irrational.
          See Brooks, Foundations of Zoölogy, 132—“There is no antagonism
          between those who attribute knowledge to experience and those who
          attribute it to our innate reason; between those who attribute the
          development of the germ to mechanical conditions and those who
          attribute it to the inherent potency of the germ itself; between those
          who hold that all nature was latent in the cosmic vapor and those who
          believe that everything in nature is immediately intended rather than
          predetermined.” All these may be methods of the immanent God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second form of the theory is open to the objection that the very
          first experience of the first man, equally with man&#x27;s latest
          experience, presupposes this intuition, as well as the other
          intuitions, and therefore cannot be the cause of it. Moreover, even
          though this theory of its origin were correct, it would still be
          impossible to think of the object of the intuition as not existing,
          and the intuition would still represent to us the highest measure of
          certitude at present attainable by man. If the evolution of ideas is
          toward truth instead of falsehood, it is the part of wisdom to act
          upon the hypothesis that our primitive belief is veracious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martineau, Study, 2:26—“Nature is as worthy of trust in her processes,
          as in her gifts.” Bowne, Examination of Spencer, 163, 164—“Are we to
          seek truth in the minds of pre-human apes, or in the blind stirrings
          of some primitive pulp? In that case we can indeed put away all our
          science, but we must put away the great doctrine of evolution along
          with it. The experience-philosophy cannot escape this alternative:
          either the positive deliverances of our mature consciousness must be
          accepted as they stand, or all truth must be declared impossible.” See
          also Harris, Philos. Basis Theism, 137-142.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles Darwin, in a letter written a year before his death, referring
          to his doubts as to the existence of God, asks: “Can we trust to the
          convictions of a monkey&#x27;s mind?” We may reply: “Can we trust the
          conclusions of one who was once a baby?” Bowne, Ethics, 3—“The genesis
          and emergence of an idea are one thing; its validity is quite another.
          The logical value of chemistry cannot be decided by reciting its
          beginnings in alchemy; and the logical value of astronomy is
          independent of the fact that it began in astrology.... 11—Even if man
          came from the ape, we need not tremble for the validity of the
          multiplication-table or of the Golden Rule. If we have moral insight,
          it is no matter how we got it; and if we have no such insight, there
          is no help in any psychological theory.... 159—We must not appeal to
          savages and babies to find what is natural to the human mind.... In
          the case of anything that is under the law of development we can find
          its true nature, not by going back to its crude beginnings, but by
          studying the finished outcome.” Dawson, Mod. Ideas of Evolution,
          13—“If the idea of God be the phantom of an apelike brain, can we
          trust to reason or conscience in any other matter? May not science and
          philosophy themselves be similar phantasies, evolved by mere chance
          and unreason?” Even though man came from the ape, there is no
          explaining his ideas by the ideas of the ape: “A man &#x27;s a man for
          a&#x27; that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We must judge beginnings by endings, not endings by beginnings. It
          matters not how the development of the eye took place nor how
          imperfect was the first sense of sight, if the eye now gives us
          correct information of external objects. So it matters not how the
          intuitions of right and of God originated, if they now give us
          knowledge of objective truth. We must take for granted that evolution
          of ideas is not from sense to nonsense. G. H. Lewes, Study of
          Psychology, 122—“We can understand the amœba and the polyp only by a
          light reflected from the study of man.” Seth, Ethical Principles,
          429—“The oak explains the acorn even more truly than the acorn
          explains the oak.” Sidgwick: “No one appeals from the artist&#x27;s
          sense of beauty to the child&#x27;s. Higher mathematics are no less
          true, because they can be apprehended only by trained intellect. No
          strange importance attaches to what was first felt or thought.” Robert
          Browning, Paracelsus: “Man, once descried, imprints forever His
          presence on all lifeless things.... A supplementary reflux of light
          Illustrates all the inferior grades, explains Each back step in the
          circle.” Man, with his higher ideas, shows the meaning and content of
          all that led up to him. He is the last round of the ascending ladder,
          and from this highest product and from his ideas we may infer what his
          Maker is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bixby, Crisis in Morals, 162, 245—“Evolution simply gave man such
          height that he could at last discern the stars of moral truth which
          had previously been below the horizon. This is very different from
          saying that moral truths are merely transmitted products of the
          experiences of utility.... The germ of the idea of God, as of the idea
          of right, must have been in man just so soon as he became man,—the
          brute&#x27;s gaining it turned him into man. Reason is not simply a
          register of physical phenomena and of experiences of pleasure and
          pain: it is creative also. It discerns the oneness of things and the
          supremacy of God.” Sir Charles Lyell: “The presumption is enormous
          that all our faculties, though liable to err, are true in the main and
          point to real objects. The religious faculty in man is one of the
          strongest of all. It existed in the earliest ages, and instead of
          wearing out before advancing civilization, it grows stronger and
          stronger, and is to-day more developed among the highest races than it
          ever was before. I think we may safely trust that it points to a great
          truth.” Fisher, Nat. and Meth. of Rev., 137, quotes Augustine:
          “Securus judicat orbis terrarum,”and tells us that the intellect is
          assumed to be an organ of knowledge, however the intellect may have
          been evolved. But if the intellect is worthy of trust, so is the moral
          nature. George A. Gordon, The Christ of To-day, 103—“To Herbert
          Spencer, human history is but an incident of natural history, and
          force is supreme. To Christianity nature is only the beginning, and
          man the consummation. Which gives the higher revelation of the life of
          the tree—the seed, or the fruit?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The third form of the theory seems to make God a sensuous object, to
          reverse the proper order of knowing and feeling, to ignore the fact
          that in all feeling there is at least some knowledge of an object, and
          to forget that the validity of this very feeling can be maintained
          only by previously assuming the existence of a rational Deity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Newman Smyth tells us that feeling comes first; the idea is secondary.
          Intuitive ideas are not denied, but they are declared to be direct
          reflections, in thought, of the feelings. They are the mind&#x27;s
          immediate perception of what it feels to exist. Direct knowledge of
          God by intuition is considered to be idealistic, reaching God by
          inference is regarded as rationalistic, in its tendency. See Smyth,
          The Religious Feeling; reviewed by Harris, in New Englander, Jan.,
          1878: reply by Smyth, in New Englander, May, 1878.
        </p>
        <p>
          We grant that, even in the case of unregenerate men, great peril,
          great joy, great sin often turn the rational intuition of God into a
          presentative intuition. The presentative intuition, however, cannot be
          affirmed to be common to all men. It does not furnish the foundation
          or explanation of a universal capacity for religion. Without the
          rational intuition, the presentative would not be possible, since it
          is only the rational that enables man to receive and to interpret the
          presentative. The very trust that we put in feeling presupposes an
          intuitive belief in a true and good God. Tennyson said in 1869: “Yes,
          it is true that there are moments when the flesh is nothing to me;
          when I know and feel the flesh to be the vision; God and the spiritual
          is the real; it belongs to me more than the hand and the foot. You may
          tell me that my hand and my foot are only imaginary symbols of my
          existence,—I could believe you; but you never, never can convince me
          that the I is not an eternal Reality, and that the spiritual is not
          the real and true part of me.”
        </p>
        <p>3. Not from reasoning,—because</p>
        <p>
          (a) The actual rise of this knowledge in the great majority of minds
          is not the result of any conscious process of reasoning. On the other
          hand, upon occurrence of the proper conditions, it flashes upon the
          soul with the quickness and force of an immediate revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The strength of men&#x27;s faith in God&#x27;s existence is not
          proportioned to the strength of the reasoning faculty. On the other
          hand, men of greatest logical power are often inveterate sceptics,
          while men of unwavering faith are found among those who cannot even
          understand the arguments for God&#x27;s existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) There is more in this knowledge than reasoning could ever have
          furnished. Men do not limit their belief in God to the just
          conclusions of argument. The arguments for the divine existence,
          valuable as they are for purposes to be shown hereafter, are not
          sufficient by themselves to warrant our conviction that there exists
          an infinite and absolute Being. It will appear upon examination that
          the a priori argument is capable of proving only an abstract and ideal
          proposition, but can never conduct us to the existence of a real
          Being. It will appear that the a posteriori arguments, from merely
          finite existence, can never demonstrate the existence of the infinite.
          In the words of Sir Wm. Hamilton (Discussions, 23)—“A demonstration of
          the absolute from the relative is logically absurd, as in such a
          syllogism we must collect in the conclusion what is not distributed in
          the premises”—in short, from finite premises we cannot draw an
          infinite conclusion.

          particular, we admit that we cannot, in our highest generalizations,
          rise above the finite.” Dr. E. G. Robinson: “The human mind turns out
          larger grists than are ever put in at the hopper.”There is more in the
          idea of God than could have come out so small a knot-hole as human
          reasoning. A single word, a chance remark, or an attitude of prayer,
          suggests the idea to a child. Helen Keller told Phillips Brooks that
          she had always known that there was a God, but that she had not known
          his name. Ladd, Philosophy of Mind, 119—“It is a foolish assumption
          that nothing can be certainly known unless it be reached as the result
          of a conscious syllogistic process, or that the more complicated and
          subtle this process is, the more sure is the conclusion. Inferential
          knowledge is always dependent upon the superior certainty of immediate
          knowledge.”George M. Duncan, in Memorial of Noah Porter, 246—“All
          deduction rests either on the previous process of induction, or on the
          intuitions of time and space which involve the Infinite and Absolute.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Neither do men arrive at the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence by
          inference; for inference is condensed syllogism, and, as a form of
          reasoning, is equally open to the objection just mentioned. We have
          seen, moreover, that all logical processes are based upon the
          assumption of God&#x27;s existence. Evidently that which is
          presupposed in all reasoning cannot itself be proved by reasoning.

          By inference, we of course mean mediate inference, for in immediate
          inference (e. g., “All good rulers are just; therefore no unjust
          rulers are good”) there is no reasoning, and no progress in thought.
          Mediate inference is reasoning—is condensed syllogism; and what is so
          condensed may be expanded into regular logical form. Deductive
          inference: “A negro is a fellow-creature; therefore he who strikes a
          negro strikes a fellow-creature.”Inductive inference: “The first
          finger is before the second; therefore it is before the third.” On
          inference, see Martineau, Essays, 1:105-108; Porter, Human Intellect,
          444-448; Jevons, Principles of Science, 1:14, 136-139, 168, 262.

          Flint, in his Theism, 77, and Herbert, in his Mod. Realism Examined,
          would reach the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence by inference. The
          latter says God is not demonstrable, but his existence is inferred,
          like the existence of our fellow men. But we reply that in this last
          case we infer only the finite from the finite, while the difficulty in
          the case of God is in inferring the infinite from the finite. This
          very process of reasoning, moreover, presupposes the existence of God
          as the absolute Reason, in the way already indicated.

          Substantially the same error is committed by H. B. Smith, Introd. to
          Chr. Theol., 84-133, and by Diman, Theistic Argument, 316, 364, both
          of whom grant an intuitive element, but use it only to eke out the
          insufficiency of reasoning. They consider that the intuition gives us
          only an abstract idea, which contains in itself no voucher for the
          existence of an actual being corresponding to the idea, and that we
          reach real being only by inference from the facts of our own spiritual
          natures and of the outward world. But we reply, in the words of
          McCosh, that “the intuitions are primarily directed to individual
          objects.” We know, not the infinite in the abstract, but infinite
          space and time, and the infinite God. See McCosh, Intuitions, 26, 199,
          who, however, holds the view here combated.

          Schurman, Belief in God, 43—“I am unable to assign to our belief in
          God a higher certainty than that possessed by the working hypotheses
          of science.... 57—The nearest approach made by science to our
          hypothesis of the existence of God lies in the assertion of the
          universality of law ... based on the conviction of the unity and
          systematic connection of all reality.... 64—This unity can be found
          only in self-conscious spirit.” The fault of this reasoning is that it
          gives us nothing necessary or absolute. Instances of working
          hypotheses are the nebular hypothesis in astronomy, the law of
          gravitation, the atomic theory in chemistry, the principle of
          evolution. No one of these is logically independent or prior. Each of
          them is provisional, and each may be superseded by new discovery. Not
          so with the idea of God. This idea is presupposed by all the others,
          as the condition of every mental process and the guarantee of its
          validity.
