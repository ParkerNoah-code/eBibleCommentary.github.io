          IV. The Historical Results of the Propagation of Scripture Doctrine
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. The rapid progress of the gospel in the first centuries of our era
          shows its divine origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. That Paganism should have been in three centuries supplanted by
          Christianity, is an acknowledged wonder of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity was the most
          astonishing revolution of faith and worship ever known. Fifty years
          after the death of Christ, there were churches in all the principal
          cities of the Roman Empire. Nero (37–68) found (as Tacitus declares)
          an “ingens multitudo” of Christians to persecute. Pliny writes to
          Trajan (52–117) that they “pervaded not merely the cities but the
          villages and country places, so that the temples were nearly
          deserted.” Tertullian (160–230) writes: “We are but of yesterday, and
          yet we have filled all your places, your cities, your islands, your
          castles, your towns, your council-houses, even your camps, your
          tribes, your senate, your forum. We have left you nothing but your
          temples.” In the time of the emperor Valerian (253–268), the
          Christians constituted half the population of Rome. The conversion of
          the emperor Constantine (272–337) brought the whole empire, only 300
          years after Jesus’ death, under the acknowledged sway of the gospel.
          See Mcllvaine and Alexander, Evidences of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. The wonder is the greater when we consider the obstacles to the
          progress of Christianity:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The scepticism of the cultivated classes; (b) the prejudice and
          hatred of the common people; and (c) the persecutions set on foot by
          government.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Missionaries even now find it difficult to get a hearing among the
          cultivated classes of the heathen. But the gospel appeared in the most
          enlightened age of antiquity—the Augustan age of literature and
          historical inquiry. Tacitus called the religion of Christ “exitiabilis
          superstitio”—“quos per flagitia invisos vulgus Christianos
          appellabat.” Pliny: “Nihil aliud inveni quam superstitionem pravam et
          immodicam.” If the gospel had been false, its preachers would not have
          ventured into the centres of civilization and refinement; or if they
          had, they would have been detected. (b) Consider the interweaving of
          heathen religions with all the relations of life. Christians often had
          to meet the furious zeal and blind rage of the mob,—as at Lystra and
          Ephesus. (c) Rawlinson, in his Historical Evidences, claims that the
          Catacombs of Rome comprised nine hundred miles of streets and seven
          millions of graves within a period of four hundred years—a far greater
          number than could have died a natural death—and that vast multitudes
          of these must have been massacred for their faith. The Encyclopædia
          Britannica, however, calls the estimate of De Marchi, which Rawlinson
          appears to have taken as authority, a great exaggeration. Instead of
          nine hundred miles of streets, Northcote has three hundred fifty. The
          number of interments to correspond would be less than three millions.
          The Catacombs began to be deserted by the time of Jerome. The times
          when they were universally used by Christians could have been hardly
          more than two hundred years. They did not begin in sand-pits. There
          were three sorts of tufa: (1) rooky, used for quarrying and too hard
          for Christian purposes; (2) sandy, used for sand-pits, too soft to
          permit construction of galleries and tombs; (3) granular, that used by
          Christians. The existence of the Catacombs must have been well known
          to the heathen. After Pope Damasus the exaggerated reverence for them
          began. They were decorated and improved. Hence many paintings are of
          later date than 400, and testify to papal polity, not to that of early
          Christianity. The bottles contain, not blood, but wine of the
          eucharist celebrated at the funeral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fisher, Nature and Method of Revelation, 256–258, calls attention to
          Matthew Arnold’s description of the needs of the heathen world, yet
          his blindness to the true remedy: “On that hard pagan world disgust
          And secret loathing fell; Deep weariness and sated lust Made human
          life a hell. In his cool hall, with haggard eyes, The Roman noble lay;
          He drove abroad, in furious guise, Along the Appian Way; He made a
          feast, drank fierce and fast, And crowned his hair with flowers,—No
          easier nor no quicker passed The impracticable hours.” Yet with
          mingled pride and sadness, Mr. Arnold fastidiously rejects more
          heavenly nutriment. Of Christ he says: “Now he is dead! Far hence he
          lies, In the lorn Syrian town, And on his grave, with shining eyes,
          The Syrian stars look down.” He sees that the millions “Have such need
          of joy, And joy whose grounds are true, And joy that should all hearts
          employ As when the past was new!” The want of the world is: “One
          mighty wave of thought and joy, Lifting mankind amain.” But the poet
          sees no ground of hope: “Fools! that so often here, Happiness mocked
          our prayer, I think might make us fear A like event elsewhere,—Make us
          not fly to dreams, But moderate desire.” He sings of the time when
          Christianity was young: “Oh, had I lived in that great day, How had
          its glory new Filled earth and heaven, and caught away My ravished
          spirit too!” But desolation of spirit does not bring with it any
          lowering of self-esteem, much less the humility which deplores the
          presence and power of evil in the soul, and sighs for deliverance.
          “They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are
          sick” (Mat_9:12). Rejecting Christ, Matthew Arnold embodies in his
          verse “the sweetness, the gravity, the strength, the beauty, and the
          languor of death” (Hutton, Essays, 302).
        </p>
        <p>
          C. The wonder becomes yet greater when we consider the natural
          insufficiency of the means used to secure this progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The proclaimers of the gospel were in general unlearned men,
          belonging to a despised nation. (b) The gospel which they proclaimed
          was a gospel of salvation through faith in a Jew who had been put to
          an ignominious death. (c) This gospel was one which excited natural
          repugnance, by humbling men’s pride, striking at the root of their
          sins, and demanding a life of labor and self-sacrifice. (d) The
          gospel, moreover, was an exclusive one, suffering no rival and
          declaring itself to be the universal and only religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a)The early Christians were more unlikely to make converts than
          modern Jews are to make proselytes, in vast numbers, in the principal
          cities of Europe and America. Celsus called Christianity “a religion
          of the rabble.” (b) The cross was the Roman gallows—the punishment of
          slaves. Cicero calls it “servitutis extremum summumque supplicium.”
          (c) There were many bad religions: why should the mild Roman Empire
          have persecuted the only good one? The answer is in part: Persecution
          did not originate with the official classes; it proceeded really from
          the people at large. Tacitus called Christians “haters of the human
          race.” Men recognized in Christianity a foe to all their previous
          motives, ideals, and aims. Altruism would break up the old society,
          for every effort that centered in self or in the present life was
          stigmatized by the gospel as unworthy. (d) Heathenism, being without
          creed or principle, did not care to propagate itself. “A man must be
          very weak,” said Celsus, “to imagine that Greeks and barbarians, in
          Asia, Europe, and Libya, can ever unite under the same system of
          religion.” So the Roman government would allow no religion which did
          not participate in the worship of the State. “Keep yourselves from
          idols,” “We worship no other God,” was the Christian’s answer. Gibbon,
          Hist. Decline and Fall, 1: chap. 15, mentions as secondary causes: (1)
          the zeal of the Jews; (2) the doctrine of immortality; (3) miraculous
          powers; (4) virtues of early Christians; (5) privilege of parcipation
          in church government. But these causes were only secondary, and all
          would have been insufficient without an invincible persuasion of the
          truth of Christianity. For answer to Gibbon, see Perrone, Prelectiones
          Theologicæ, 1:133.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persecution destroys falsehood by leading its advocates to investigate
          the grounds of their belief; but it strengthens and multiplies truth
          by leading its advocates to see more clearly the foundations of their
          faith. There have been many conscientious persecutors: Joh_16:2—“They
          shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that
          whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God.”
          The Decretal of Pope Urban II reads: “For we do not count them to be
          homicides, to whom it may have happened, through their burning zeal
          against the excommunicated, to put any of them to death.” St. Louis,
          King of France, urged his officers “not to argue with the infidel, but
          to subdue unbelievers by thrusting the sword into them as far as it
          will go.” Of the use of the rack in England on a certain occasion, it
          was said that it was used with all the tenderness which the nature of
          the instrument would allow. This reminds us of Isaak Walton’s
          instruction as to the use of the frog: “Put the hook through his month
          and out at his gills; and, in so doing, use him as though you loved
          him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert Browning, in his Easter Day, 275–288, gives us what purports to
          be A Martyr’s Epitaph, inscribed upon a wall of the Catacombs, which
          furnishes a valuable contrast to the sceptical and pessimistic strain
          of Matthew Arnold: “I was born sickly, poor and mean, A slave: no
          misery could screen The holders of the pearl of price From Cæsar’s
          envy: therefore twice I fought with beasts, and three times saw My
          children suffer by his law; At length my own release was earned: I was
          some time in being burned, But at the close a Hand came through The
          fire above my head, and drew My soul to Christ, whom now I see.
          Sergius, a brother, writes for me This testimony on the wall—For me, I
          have forgot it all.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The progress of a religion so unprepossessing and uncompromising to
          outward acceptance and dominion, within the space of three hundred
          years, cannot be explained without supposing that divine power
          attended its promulgation, and therefore that the gospel is a
          revelation from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stanley, Life and Letters, 1:527—“In the Kremlin Cathedral, whenever
          the Metropolitan advanced from the altar to give his blessing, there
          was always thrown under his feet a carpet embroidered with the eagle
          of old Pagan Rome, to indicate that the Christian Church and Empire of
          Constantinople had succeeded and triumphed over it.” On this whole
          section, see F. W. Farrar, Witness of History to Christ, 91;
          Mcllvaine, Wisdom of Holy Scripture, 139.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The beneficent influence of the Scripture doctrines and precepts,
          wherever they have had sway, shows their divine origin. Notice:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. Their influence on civilization in general, securing a recognition
          of principles which heathenism ignored, such as Garbett mentions: (a)
          the importance of the individual; (b) the law of mutual love; (c) the
          sacredness of human life; (d) the doctrine of internal holiness; (e)
          the sanctity of home; (f) monogamy, and the religious equality of the
          sexes; (g) identification of belief and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continued corruption of heathen lands shows that this change is
          not due to any laws of merely natural progress. The confessions of
          ancient writers show that it is not due to philosophy. Its only
          explanation is that the gospel is the power of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garbett, Dogmatic Faith, 177–186; F. W. Farrar, Witness of History to
          Christ, chap, on Christianity and the Individual; Brace, Gesta
          Christi, preface, vi—“Practices and principles implanted, stimulated
          or supported by Christianity, such as regard for the personality of
          the weakest and poorest; respect for woman; duty of each member of the
          fortunate classes to raise up the unfortunate; humanity to the child,
          the prisoner, the stranger, the needy, and even to the brute;
          unceasing opposition to all forms of cruelty, oppression and slavery;
          the duty of personal purity, and the sacredness of marriage; the
          necessity of temperance; obligation of a more equitable division of
          the profits of labor, and of greater coöperation between employers and
          employed; the right of every human being to have the utmost
          opportunity of developing his faculties, and of all persons to enjoy
          equal political and social privileges; the principle that the injury
          of one nation is the injury of all, and the expediency and duty of
          unrestricted trade and intercourse between all countries; and finally,
          a profound opposition to war, a determination to limit its evils when
          existing, and to prevent its arising by means of international
          arbitration.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Max Müller: “The concept of humanity is the gift of Christ.” Guizot,
          History of Civilization, 1: Introd., tells us that in ancient times
          the individual existed for the sake of the State; in modern times the
          State exists for the sake of the individual. “The individual is a
          discovery of Christ.” On the relations between Christianity and
          Politic a 1 Economy, see A. H. Strong, Philosophy and Religion, pages
          443–460; on the cause of the changed view with regard to the relation
          of the individual to the State, see page 207—“What has wrought the
          change? Nothing but the death of the Son of God. When it was seen that
          the smallest child and the lowest slave had a soul of such worth that
          Christ left his throne and gave up his life to save it, the world’s
          estimate of values changed, and modern history began.” Lucian, the
          Greek satirist and humorist, 160 a.d., said of the Christians: “Their
          first legislator [Jesus] has put it into their heads that they are all
          brothers.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this spirit of common brotherhood which has led in most
          countries to the abolition of cannibalism, infanticide, widow-burning,
          and slavery. Prince Bismarck: “For social well-being I ask nothing
          more than Christianity without phrases”—which means the religion of
          the deed rather than of the creed. Yet it is only faith in the
          historic revelation of God in Christ which has made Christian deeds
          possible. Shaler, Interpretation of Nature, 232–278—Aristotle, if he
          could look over society to-day, would think modern man a new species,
          in his going out in sympathy to distant peoples. This cannot be the
          result of natural selection, for self-sacrifice is not profitable to
          the individual. Altruistic emotions owe their existence to God.
          Worship of God has flowed back upon man’s emotions and has made them
          more sympathetic Self-consciousness and sympathy, coming into conflict
          with brute emotions, originate the sense of sin. Then begins the war
          of the natural and the spiritual. Love of nature and absorption in
          others is the true Nirvana. Not physical science, but the humanities,
          are most needed in education.
        </p>
        <p>
          H. E. Hersey, Introd. to Browning’s Christmas Eve, 19—“Sidney Lanier
          tells us that the last twenty centuries have spent their best power
          upon the development of personality. Literature, education,
          government, and religion, have learned to recognize the individual as
          the unit of force. Browning goes a step further. He declares that so
          powerful is a complete personality that its very touch gives life and
          courage and potency. He turns to history for the inspiration of
          enduring virtue and the stimulus for sustained effort, and he finds
          both in Jesus Christ.” J. P. Cooke, Credentials of Science, 43—The
          change from the ancient philosopher to the modern investigator is the
          change from self-assertion to self-devotion, and the great revolution
          can be traced to the influence of Christianity and to the spirit of
          humility exhibited and inculcated by Christ. Lewes, Hist. Philos.,
          1:408—Greek morality never embraced any conception of humanity; no
          Greek ever attained to the sublimity of such a point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kidd, Social Evolution, 165, 287—It is not intellect that has pushed
          forward the world of modern times: it is the altruistic feeling that
          originated in the cross and sacrifice of Christ. The French Revolution
          was made possible by the fact that humanitarian ideas had undermined
          the upper classes themselves, and effective resistance was impossible.
          Socialism would abolish the struggle for existence on the part of
          individuals. What security would be left for social progress? Removing
          all restrictions upon population ensures progressive deterioration. A
          non-socialist community would outstrip a socialist community where all
          the main wants of life were secure. The real tendency of society is to
          bring all the people into rivalry, not only on a footing of political
          equality, but on conditions of equal social opportunities. The State
          in future will interfere and control, in order to preserve or secure
          free competition, rather than to suspend it. The goal is not socialism
          or State management, but competition in which all shall have equal
          advantages. The evolution of human society is not primarily
          intellectual but religious. The winning races are the religious races.
          The Greeks had more intellect, but we have more civilization and
          progress. The Athenians were as far above us as we are above the negro
          race. Gladstone said that we are intellectually weaker than the men of
          the middle ages. When the intellectual development of any section of
          the race has for the time being outrun its ethical development,
          natural selection has apparently weeded it out, like any other
          unsuitable product. Evolution is developing reverence, with its allied
          qualities, mental energy, resolution, enterprise, prolonged and
          concentrated application, simple minded and single minded devotion to
          duty. Only religion can overpower selfishness and individualism and
          ensure social progress.
        </p>

          B. Their influence upon individual character and happiness, wherever
          they have been tested in practice. This influence is seen (a) in the
          moral transformations they have wrought—as in the case of Paul the
          apostle, and of persons in every Christian community; (b) in the
          self-denying labors for human welfare to which they have led—as in the
          case of Wilberforce and Judson; (c) in the hopes they have inspired in
          times of sorrow and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          These beneficent fruits cannot have their source in merely natural
          causes, apart from the truth and divinity of the Scriptures; for in
          that case the contrary beliefs would be accompanied by the same
          blessings. But since we find these blessings only in connection with
          Christian teaching, we may justly consider this as their cause. This
          teaching, then, must be true, and the Scriptures must be a divine
          revelation. Else God has made a lie to be the greatest blessing to the
          race.

          The first Moravian missionaries to the West Indies walked six hundred
          miles to take ship, worked their passage, and then sold themselves as
          slaves, in order to get the privilege of preaching to the negroes.…The
          father of John G. Paton was a stocking-weaver. The whole family, with
          the exception of the very small children, worked from 6 a.m. to 10
          p.m., with one hour for dinner at noon and a half hour each for
          breakfast and supper. Yet family prayer was regularly held twice a
          day. In these breathing-spells for daily meals John G. Paton took part
          of his time to study the Latin Grammar, that he might prepare himself
          for missionary work. When told by an uncle that, if he went to the New
          Hebrides, the cannibals would eat him, he replied: “You yourself will
          soon be dead and buried, and I had as lief be eaten by cannibals as by
          worms.” The Aneityumese raised arrow-root for fifteen years and sold
          it to pay the £1200 required for printing the Bible in their own
          language. Universal church-attendance and Bible-study make those South
          Sea Islands the most heavenly place on earth on the Sabbath-day.

          In 1839, twenty thousand negroes in Jamaica gathered to begin a life
          of freedom. Into a coffin were put the handcuffs and shackles of
          slavery, relics of the whipping-post and the scourge. As the clock
          struck twelve at night, a preacher cried with the first stroke: “The
          monster is dying!” and so with every stroke until the last, when he
          cried: “The monster is dead!” Then all rose from their knees and sang:
          “Praise God from whom all blessings flow!” … “What do you do that
          for?” said the sick Chinaman whom the medical missionary was tucking
          up in bed with a care which the patient had never received since he
          was a baby. The missionary took the opportunity to tell him of the
          love of Christ.…The aged Australian mother, when told that her two
          daughters, missionaries in China, had both of them been murdered by a
          heathen mob, only replied: “This decides me; I will go to China now
          myself, and try to teach those poor creatures what the love of Jesus
          means.” … Dr. William Ashmore: “Let one missionary die, and ten come
          to his funeral.” A shoemaker, teaching neglected boys and girls while
          he worked at his cobbler’s bench, gave the impulse to Thomas Guthrie’s
          life of faith.

          We must judge religions not by their ideals, but by their
          performances. Omar Khayyam and Mozoomdar give us beautiful thoughts,
          but the former is not Persia, nor is the latter India. “When the
          microscopic search of scepticism, which has hunted the heavens and
          sounded the seas to disprove the existence of a Creator, has turned
          its attention to human society and has found on this planet a place
          ten miles square where a decent man can live in decency, comfort, and
          security, supporting and educating his children, unspoiled and
          unpolluted; a place where age is reverenced, infancy protected,
          manhood respected, womanhood honored, and human life held in due
          regard—when sceptics can find such a place ten miles square on this
          globe, where the gospel of Christ has not gone and cleared the way and
          laid the foundations and made decency and security possible, it will
          then be in order for the sceptical literati to move thither and to
          ventilate their views. But so long as these very men are dependent
          upon the very religion they discard for every privilege they enjoy,
          they may well hesitate before they rob the Christian of his hope and
          humanity of its faith in that Savior who alone has given that hope of
          eternal life which makes life tolerable and society possible, and robs
          death of its terrors and the grave of its gloom.” On the beneficent
          influence of the gospel, see Schmidt, Social Results of Early
          Christianity; D. J. Hill, The Social Influence of Christianity.
