          IV. The Ontological Argument, or Argument from our Abstract and
          Necessary Ideas.
        </h2>
        <p>
          This argument infers the existence of God from the abstract and
          necessary ideas of the human mind. It has three forms:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That of Samuel Clarke. Space and time are attributes of substance
          or being. But space and time are respectively infinite and eternal.
          There must therefore be an infinite and eternal substance or Being to
          whom these attributes belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gillespie states the argument somewhat differently. Space and time are
          modes of existence. But space and time are respectively infinite and
          eternal. There must therefore be an infinite and eternal Being who
          subsists in these modes. But we reply:
        </p>
        <p>
          Space and time are neither attributes of substance nor modes of
          existence. The argument, if valid, would prove that God is not mind
          but matter, for that could not be mind, but only matter, of which
          space and time were either attributes or modes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ontological Argument is frequently called the a priori argument,
          that is, the argument from that which is logically prior, or earlier
          than experience, viz., our intuitive ideas. All the forms of the
          Ontological Argument are in this sense a priori. Space and time are a
          priori ideas. See Samuel Clarke, Works, 2:521; Gillespie, Necessary
          Existence of God. Per contra, see Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, 364:
          Calderwood, Moral Philosophy, 226—“To begin, as Clarke did, with the
          proposition that ‘something has existed from eternity,’ is virtually
          to propose an argument after having assumed what is to be proved.
          Gillespie&#x27;s form of the a priori argument, starting with the
          proposition ‘infinity of extension is necessarily existing,’ is liable
          to the same objection, with the additional disadvantage of attributing
          a property of matter to the Deity.”
        </p>
        <p>
          H. B. Smith says that Brougham misrepresented Clarke: “Clarke&#x27;s
          argument is in his sixth proposition, and supposes the existence
          proved in what goes before. He aims here to establish the infinitude
          and omnipresence of this First Being. He does not prove existence from
          immensity.” But we reply, neither can he prove the infinity of God
          from the immensity of space. Space and time are neither substances nor
          attributes, but are rather relations; see Calderwood, Philos. of
          Infinite, 331-335; Cocker, Theistic Conception of the World, 66-96.
          The doctrine that space and time are attributes or modes of God&#x27;s
          existence tends to materialistic pantheism like that of Spinoza, who
          held that “the one and simple substance” (substantia una et unica) is
          known to us through the two attributes of thought and extension; mind
          = God in the mode of thought; matter = God in the mode of extension.
          Dove, Logic of the Christian Faith, 127, says well that an extended
          God is a material God; “space and time are attributes neither of
          matter nor mind”; “we must carry the moral idea into the natural
          world, not the natural idea into the moral world.” See also, Blunt,
          Dictionary Doct. and Hist. Theol., 740; Porter, Human Intellect, 567.
          H. M. Stanley, on Space and Science, in Philos. Rev., Nov.
          1898:615—“Space is not full of things, but things are spaceful....
          Space is a form of dynamic appearance.” Prof. C. A. Strong: “The world
          composed of consciousness and other existences is not in space, though
          it may be in something of which space is the symbol.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That of Descartes. We have the idea of an infinite and perfect
          Being. This idea cannot be derived from imperfect and finite things.
          There must therefore be an infinite and perfect Being who is its
          cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we reply that this argument confounds the idea of the infinite
          with an infinite idea. Man&#x27;s idea of the infinite is not infinite
          but finite, and from a finite effect we cannot argue an infinite
          cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          This form of the Ontological Argument, while it is a priori, as based
          upon a necessary idea of the human mind, is, unlike the other forms of
          the same argument, a posteriori, as arguing from this idea, as an
          effect, to the existence of a Being who is its cause. A posteriori
          argument = from that which is later to that which is earlier, that is,
          from effect to cause. The Cosmological, Teleological, and
          Anthropological Arguments are arguments a posteriori. Of this sort is
          the argument of Descartes; see Descartes, Meditation 3: “Hæc idea quæ
          in nobis est requirit Deum pro causa; Deusque proinde existit.” The
          idea in men&#x27;s minds is the impression of the workman&#x27;s name
          stamped indelibly on his work—the shadow cast upon the human soul by
          that unseen One of whose being and presence it dimly informs us.
          Blunt, Dict. of Theol., 739; Saisset, Pantheism, 1:54—“Descartes sets
          out from a fact of consciousness, while Anselm sets out from an
          abstract conception”; “Descartes&#x27;s argument might be considered a
          branch of the Anthropological or Moral Argument, but for the fact that
          this last proceeds from man&#x27;s constitution rather than from his
          abstract ideas.” See Bib. Sac., 1849:637.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That of Anselm. We have the idea of an absolutely perfect Being.
          But existence is an attribute of perfection. An absolutely perfect
          Being must therefore exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we reply that this argument confounds ideal existence with real
          existence. Our ideas are not the measure of external reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anselm, Proslogion, 2—“Id, quo majus cogitari nequit, non potest esse
          in intellectu solo.” See translation of the Proslogion, in Bib. Sac.,
          1851:529, 699; Kant, Critique, 368. The arguments of Descartes and
          Anselm, with Kant&#x27;s reply, are given in their original form by
          Harris, in Journ. Spec. Philos., 15:420-428. The major premise here is
          not that all perfect ideas imply the existence of the object which
          they represent, for then, as Kant objects, I might argue from my
          perfect idea of a $100 bill that I actually possessed the same, which
          would be far from the fact. So I have a perfect idea of a perfectly
          evil being, of a centaur, of nothing,—but it does not follow that the
          evil being, that the centaur, that nothing, exists. The argument is
          rather from the idea of absolute and perfect Being—of “that, no
          greater than which can be conceived.” There can be but one such being,
          and there can be but one such idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, even thus understood, we cannot argue from the idea to the actual
          existence of such a being. Case, Physical Realism, 173—“God is not an
          idea, and consequently cannot be inferred from mere ideas.” Bowne,
          Philos. Theism, 43—The Ontological Argument “only points out that the
          idea of the perfect must include the idea of existence; but there is
          nothing to show that the self-consistent idea represents an objective
          reality.”I can imagine the Sea-serpent, the Jinn of the Thousand and
          One Nights, “The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Do grow beneath
          their shoulders.” The winged horse of Uhland possessed every possible
          virtue, and only one fault,—it was dead. If every perfect idea implied
          the reality of its object, there might be horses with ten legs, and
          trees with roots in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Anselm&#x27;s argument implies,” says Fisher, in Journ. Christ.
          Philos., Jan. 1883:114, “that existence in re is a constituent of the
          concept. It would conclude the existence of a being from the
          definition of a word. This inference is justified only on the basis of
          philosophical realism.” Dove, Logic of the Christ. Faith, 141—“The
          Ontological Argument is the algebraic formula of the universe, which
          leads to a valid conclusion with regard to real existence, only when
          we fill it in with objects with which we become acquainted in the
          arguments a posteriori.” See also Shedd, Hist. Doct., 1:331, Dogm.
          Theol., 1:221-241, and in Presb. Rev., April, 1884:212-227 (favoring
          the argument); Fisher, Essays, 574; Thompson, Christian Theism, 171;
          H. B. Smith, Introd. to Christ. Theol., 122; Pfleiderer, Die Religion,
          1:181-187; Studien und Kritiken, 1875:611-655.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dorner, in his Glaubenslehre, 1:197, gives us the best statement of
          the Ontological Argument: “Reason thinks of God as existing. Reason
          would not be reason, if it did not think of God as existing. Reason
          only is, upon the assumption that God is.” But this is evidently not
          argument, but only vivid statement of the necessary assumption of the
          existence of an absolute Reason which conditions and gives validity to
          ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this last must be considered the most perfect form of the
          Ontological Argument, it is evident that it conducts us only to an
          ideal conclusion, not to real existence. In common with the two
          preceding forms of the argument, moreover, it tacitly assumes, as
          already existing in the human mind, that very knowledge of God&#x27;s
          existence which it would derive from logical demonstration. It has
          value, therefore, simply as showing what God must be, if he exists at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the existence of a Being indefinitely great, a personal Cause,
          Contriver and Lawgiver, has been proved by the preceding arguments;
          for the law of parsimony requires us to apply the conclusions of the
          first three arguments to one Being, and not to many. To this one Being
          we may now ascribe the infinity and perfection, the idea of which lies
          at the basis of the Ontological Argument—ascribe them, not because
          they are demonstrably his, but because our mental constitution will
          not allow us to think otherwise. Thus clothing him with all
          perfections which the human mind can conceive, and these in
          illimitable fullness, we have one whom we may justly call God.
        </p>
        <p>
          McCosh, Div. Govt., 12, note—“It is at this place, if we do not
          mistake, that the idea of the Infinite comes in. The capacity of the
          human mind to form such an idea, or rather its intuitive belief in an
          Infinite of which it feels that it cannot form an adequate conception,
          may be no proof (as Kant maintains) of the existence of an infinite
          Being; but it is, we are convinced, the means by which the mind is
          enabled to invest the Deity, shown on other grounds to exist, with the
          attributes of infinity, i. e., to look on his being, power, goodness,
          and all his perfections, as infinite.” Even Flint, Theism, 68, who
          holds that we reach the existence of God by inference, speaks of
          “necessary conditions of thought and feeling, and ineradicable
          aspirations, which force on us ideas of absolute existence, infinity,
          and perfection, and will neither permit us to deny these perfections
          to God, nor to ascribe them to any other being.” Belief in God is not
          the conclusion of a demonstration, but the solution of a problem.
          Calderwood, Moral Philosophy, 226—“Either the whole question is
          assumed in starting, or the Infinite is not reached in concluding.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarke, Christian Theology, 97-114, divides his proof into two parts:
          I. Evidence of the existence of God from the intellectual
          starting-point: The discovery of Mind in the universe is made, 1.
          through the intelligibleness of the universe to us; 2. through the
          idea of cause; 3. through the presence of ends in the universe. II.
          Evidence of the existence of God from the religious starting-point:
          The discovery of the good God is made, 1. through the religious nature
          of man; 2. through the great dilemma—God the best, or the worst; 3.
          through the spiritual experience of men, especially in Christianity.
          So far as Dr. Clarke&#x27;s proof is intended to be a statement, not
          of a primitive belief, but of a logical process, we must hold it to be
          equally defective with the three forms of proof which we have seen to
          furnish some corroborative evidence of God&#x27;s existence. Dr.
          Clarke therefore does well to add: “Religion was not produced by proof
          of God&#x27;s existence, and will not be destroyed by its
          insufficiency to some minds. Religion existed before argument; in
          fact, it is the preciousness of religion that leads to the seeking for
          all possible confirmations of the reality of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The three forms of proof already mentioned—the Cosmological, the
          Teleological, and the Anthropological Arguments—may be likened to the
          three arches of a bridge over a wide and rushing river. The bridge has
          only two defects, but these defects are very serious. The first is
          that one cannot get on to the bridge; the end toward the hither bank
          is wholly lacking; the bridge of logical argument cannot be entered
          upon except by assuming the validity of logical processes; this
          assumption takes for granted at the outset the existence of a God who
          has made our faculties to act correctly; we get on to the bridge, not
          by logical process, but only by a leap of intuition, and by assuming
          at the beginning the very thing which we set out to prove. The second
          defect of the so-called bridge of argument is that when one has once
          gotten on, he can never get off. The connection with the further bank
          is also lacking. All the premises from which we argue being finite, we
          are warranted in drawing only a finite conclusion. Argument cannot
          reach the Infinite, and only an infinite Being is worthy to be called
          God. We can get off from our logical bridge, not by logical process,
          but only by another and final leap of intuition, and by once more
          assuming the existence of the infinite Being whom we had so vainly
          sought to reach by mere argument. The process seems to be referred to
          in Job 11:7—“Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out
          the Almighty unto perfection?”
        </p>
        <p>
          As a logical process this is indeed defective, since all logic as well
          as all observation depends for its validity upon the presupposed
          existence of God, and since this particular process, even granting the
          validity of logic in general, does not warrant the conclusion that God
          exists, except upon a second assumption that our abstract ideas of
          infinity and perfection are to be applied to the Being to whom
          argument has actually conducted us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But although both ends of the logical bridge are confessedly wanting,
          the process may serve and does serve a more useful purpose than that
          of mere demonstration, namely, that of awakening, explicating, and
          confirming a conviction which, though the most fundamental of all, may
          yet have been partially slumbering for lack of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morell, Philos. Fragments, 177, 179—“We can, in fact, no more prove
          the existence of a God by a logical argument, than we can prove the
          existence of an external world; but none the less may we obtain as
          strong a practical conviction of the one, as the other.” “We arrive at
          a scientific belief in the existence of God just as we do at any other
          possible human truth. We assume it, as a hypothesis absolutely
          necessary to account for the phenomena of the universe; and then
          evidences from every quarter begin to converge upon it, until, in
          process of time, the common sense of mankind, cultivated and
          enlightened by ever accumulating knowledge, pronounces upon the
          validity of the hypothesis with a voice scarcely less decided and
          universal than it does in the case of our highest scientific
          convictions.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fisher, Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 572—“What then is the
          purport and force of the several arguments for the existence of God?
          We reply that these proofs are the different modes in which faith
          expresses itself and seeks confirmation. In them faith, or the object
          of faith, is more exactly conceived and defined, and in them is found
          a corroboration, not arbitrary but substantial and valuable, of that
          faith which springs from the soul itself. Such proofs, therefore, are
          neither on the one hand sufficient to create and sustain faith, nor
          are they on the other hand to be set aside as of no value.”A. J.
          Barrett: “The arguments are not so much a bridge in themselves, as
          they are guys, to hold firm the great suspension-bridge of intuition,
          by which we pass the gulf from man to God. Or, while they are not a
          ladder by which we may reach heaven, they are the Ossa on Pelion, from
          whose combined height we may descry heaven.”

          Anselm: “Negligentia mihi videtur, si postquam confirmati sumus in
          fide non studemus quod credimus intelligere.” Bradley, Appearance and
          Reality: “Metaphysics is the finding of bad reasons for what we
          believe upon instinct; but to find these reasons is no less an
          instinct.” Illingworth, Div. and Hum. Personality, lect. III—“Belief
          in a personal God is an instinctive judgment, progressively justified
          by reason.”Knight, Essays in Philosophy, 241—The arguments are
          “historical memorials of the efforts of the human race to vindicate to
          itself the existence of a reality of which it is conscious, but which
          it cannot perfectly define.” H. Fielding, The Hearts of Men,
          313—“Creeds are the grammar of religion. They are to religion what
          grammar is to speech. Words are the expression of our wants; grammar
          is the theory formed afterwards. Speech never proceeded from grammar,
          but the reverse. As speech progresses and changes from unknown causes,
          grammar must follow.” Pascal: “The heart has reasons of its own which
          the reason does not know.” Frances Power Cobbe: “Intuitions are
          God&#x27;s tuitions.” On the whole subject, see Cudworth, Intel.
          System, 3:42; Calderwood, Philos. of Infinite, 150 sq.; Curtis, Human

          Hegel, in his Logic, page 3, speaking of the disposition to regard the
          proofs of God&#x27;s existence as the only means of producing faith in
          God, says: “Such a doctrine would find its parallel, if we said that
          eating was impossible before we had acquired a knowledge of the
          chemical, botanical and zoölogical qualities of our food; and that we
          must delay digestion till we had finished the study of anatomy and
          physiology.” It is a mistake to suppose that there can be no religious
          life without a correct theory of life. Must I refuse to drink water or
          to breathe air, until I can manufacture both for myself? Some things
          are given to us. Among these things are “grace and truth” (John 1:17;
          cf. 9). But there are ever those who are willing to take nothing as a
          free gift, and who insist on working out all knowledge, as well as all
          salvation, by processes of their own. Pelagianism, with its denial of
          the doctrines of grace, is but the further development of a
          rationalism which refuses to accept primitive truths unless these can
          be logically demonstrated. Since the existence of the soul, of the
          world, and of God cannot be proved in this way, rationalism is led to
          curtail, or to misinterpret, the deliverances of consciousness, and
          hence result certain systems now to be mentioned.
