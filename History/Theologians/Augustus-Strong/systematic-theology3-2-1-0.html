        <p>1. Genuineness of the Books of the New Testament.</p>
        <p>
          We do not need to adduce proof of the existence of the books of the
          New Testament as far back as the third century, for we possess
          manuscripts of them which are at least fourteen hundred years old,
          and, since the third century, references to them have been inwoven
          into all history and literature. We begin our proof, therefore, by
          showing that these documents not only existed, but were generally
          accepted as genuine, before the close of the second century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen was born as early as 186 a.d.; yet Tregelles tells us that
          Origen’s works contain citations embracing two-thirds of the New
          Testament. Hatch, Hibbert Lectures, 12—“The early years of
          Christianity were in some respects like the early years of our
          lives.…Those early years are the most important in our education. We
          learn then, we hardly know how, through effort and struggle and
          innocent mistakes, to use our eyes and ears, to measure distance and
          direction, by a process which ascends by unconscious steps to the
          certainty which we feel in our maturity.…It was in some such
          unconscious way that the Christian thought of the early centuries
          gradually acquired the form which we find when it emerges as it were
          into the developed manhood of the fourth century.”
        </p>
        <p>
          A. All the books of the New Testament, with the single exception of 2
          Peter, were not only received as genuine, but were used in more or
          less collected form, in the latter half of the second century. These
          collections of writings, so slowly transcribed and distributed, imply
          the long continued previous existence of the separate books, and
          forbid us to fix their origin later than the first half of the second
          century.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Tertullian (160–230) appeals to the ‘New Testament’ as made up of
          the ‘Gospels’ and ‘Apostles.’ He vouches for the genuineness of the
          four gospels, the Acts, 1 Peter, 1 John, thirteen epistles of Paul,
          and the Apocalypse; in short, to twenty-one of the twenty-seven books
          of our Canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanday, Bampton Lectures for 1893, is confident that the first three
          gospels took their present shape before the destruction of Jerusalem.
          Yet he thinks the first and third gospels of composite origin, and
          probably the second. Not later than 125 a.d. the four gospels of our
          Canon had gained a recognized and exceptional authority. Andover
          Professors, Divinity of Jesus Christ, 40—“The oldest of our gospels
          was written about the year 70. The earlier one, now lost, a great part
          of which is preserved in Luke and Matthew, was probably written a few
          years earlier.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The Muratorian Canon in the West and the Peshito Version in the
          East (having a common date of about 160) in their catalogues of the
          New Testament writings mutually complement each other’s slight
          deficiencies, and together witness to the fact that at that time every
          book of our present New Testament, with the exception of 2 Peter, was
          received as genuine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hovey, Manual of Christian Theology, 50—“The fragment on the Canon,
          discovered by Muratori in 1738, was probably written about 170 a.d.,
          in Greek. It begins with the last words of a sentence which must have
          referred to the Gospel of Mark, and proceeds to speak of the Third
          Gospel as written by Luke the physician, who did not see the Lord, and
          then of the Fourth Gospel as written by John, a disciple of the Lord,
          at the request of his fellow disciples and his elders.” Bacon, N. T.
          Introduction, 50, gives the Muratorian Canon in full; 30—“Theophilus
          of Antioch (181–190) is the first to cite a gospel by name, quoting
          Joh_1:1 as from ‘John, one of those who were vessels of the Spirit.”
          On the Muratorian Canon, see Tregelles, Muratorian Canon. On the
          Peshito Version, see Schaff, Introd. to Rev. Gk.-Eng. N.T., xxxvii;
          Smith’s Bible Dict., pp. 3388, 3389.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The Canon of Marcion (140), though rejecting all the gospels but
          that of Luke, and all the epistles but ten of Paul’s, shows,
          nevertheless, that at that early day “apostolic writings were regarded
          as a complete original rule of doctrine.” Even Marcion, moreover, does
          not deny the genuineness of those writings which for doctrinal reasons
          he rejects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcion, the Gnostic, was the enemy of all Judaism, and regarded the
          God of the O. T. as a restricted divinity, entirely different from the
          God of the N. T. Marcion was “ipso Paulo paulinior”—“plus loyal que le
          roi.” He held that Christianity was something entirely new, and that
          it stood in opposition to all that went before it. His Canon consisted
          of two parts: the “Gospel” (Luke, with its text curtailed by omission
          of the Hebraistic elements) and the Apostolicon (the epistles of
          Paul). The epistle to Diognetus by an unknown author, and the epistle
          of Barnabas, shared the view of Marcion. The name of the Deity was
          changed from Jehovah to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. If Marcion’s view
          had prevailed, the Old Testament would have been lost to the Christian
          Church. God’s revelation would have been deprived of its proof from
          prophecy. Development from the past, and divine conduct of Jewish
          history, would have been denied. But without the Old Testament, as H.
          W. Beecher maintained, the New Testament would lack background; our
          chief source of knowledge with regard to God’s natural attributes of
          power, wisdom, and truth would be removed: the love and mercy revealed
          in the New Testament would seem characteristics of a weak being, who
          could not enforce law or inspire respect. A tree has as much breadth
          below ground as there is above; so the O. T. roots of God’s revelation
          are as extensive and necessary as are its N. T. trunk and branches and
          leaves. See Allen, Religious Progress, 81; Westcott, Hist. N. T.
          Canon, and art.: Canon, in Smith’s Bible Dictionary. Also Reuss,
          History of Canon; Mitchell, Critical Handbook, part I.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. The Christian and Apostolic Fathers who lived in the first half of
          the second century not only quote from these books and allude to them,
          but testify that they were written by the apostles themselves. We are
          therefore compelled to refer their origin still further back, namely,
          to the first century, when the apostles lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Irenæus (120–200) mentions and quotes the four gospels by name,
          and among them the gospel according to John: “Afterwards John, the
          disciple of the Lord, who also leaned upon his breast, he likewise
          published a gospel, while he dwelt in Ephesus in Asia.” And Irenæus
          was the disciple and friend of Polycarp (80–166), who was himself a
          personal acquaintance of the Apostle John. The testimony of Irenæus is
          virtually the evidence of Polycarp, the contemporary and friend of the
          Apostle, that each of the gospels was written by the person whose name
          it bears.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this testimony it is objected that Irenæus says there are four
          gospels because there are four quarters of the world and four living
          creatures in the cherubim. But we reply that Irenæus is here stating,
          not his own reason for accepting four and only four gospels, but what
          he conceives to be God’s reason for ordaining that there should be
          four. We are not warranted in supposing that he accepted the four
          gospels on any other ground than that of testimony that they were the
          productions of apostolic men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chrysostom, in a similar manner, compares the four gospels to a
          chariot and four: When the King of Glory rides forth in it, he shall
          receive the triumphal acclamations of all peoples. So Jerome: God
          rides upon the cherubim, and since there are four cherubim, there must
          be four gospels. All this however is an early attempt at the
          philosophy of religion, and not an attempt to demonstrate historical
          fact. L. L. Paine, Evolution of Trinitarianism, 319–367, presents the
          radical view of the authorship of the fourth gospel. He holds that
          John the apostle died a.d. 70, or soon after, and that Irenæus
          confounded the two Johns whom Papias so clearly distinguished—John the
          Apostle and John the Elder. With Harnack, Paine supposes the gospel to
          have been written by John the Elder, a contemporary of Papias. But we
          reply that the testimony of Irenæus implies a long continued previous
          tradition. R. W. Dale, Living Christ and Four Gospels, 145—“Religious
          veneration such as that with which Irenæus regarded these books is of
          slow growth. They must have held a great place in the Church as far
          back as the memory of living men extended.” See Hastings’ Bible
          Dictionary, 2:695.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Justin Martyr (died 148) speaks of ‘memoirs (ἀπομνημονεύματα) of
          Jesus Christ,’ and his quotations, though sometimes made from memory,
          are evidently cited from our gospels.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this testimony it is objected: (1) That Justin Martyr uses the term
          ‘memoirs’ instead of ‘gospels.’ We reply that he elsewhere uses the
          term ‘gospels’ and identifies the ‘memoirs’ with them: Apol.,
          1:66—“The apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called
          gospels,” i. e., not memoirs, but gospels, was the proper title of his
          written records. In writing his Apology to the heathen Emperors,
          Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Antoninus, he chooses the term ‘memoirs’,
          or ‘memorabilia’, which Xenophon had used as the title of his account
          of Socrates, simply in order that he may avoid ecclesiastical
          expressions unfamiliar to his readers and may commend his writing to
          lovers of classical literature. Notice that Matthew must be added to
          John, to justify Justin’s repeated statement that there were “memoirs”
          of our Lord “written by apostles,” and that Mark and Luke must be
          added to justify his further statement that these memoirs were
          compiled by “his apostles and those who followed them.” Analogous to
          Justin’s use of the word ‘memoirs’ is his use of the term ‘Sunday’,
          instead of Sabbath: Apol. 1:67—“On the day called Sunday, all who live
          in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the
          memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read.”
          Here is the use of our gospels in public worship, as of equal
          authority with the O. T. Scriptures; in fact, Justin constantly quotes
          the words and acts of Jesus’ life from a written source, using the
          word γέγραπται. See Morison, Com. on Mat., ix; Hemphill, Literature of
          Second Century, 234.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Justin’s testimony it is objected: (2) That in quoting the words
          spoken from heaven at the Savior’s baptism, he makes them to be: “My
          son, this day have I begotten thee,” so quoting Psa_2:7, and showing
          that he was ignorant of our present gospel. Mat_3:17. We reply that
          this was probably a slip of the memory, quite natural in a day when
          the gospels existed only in the cumbrous form of manuscript rolls.
          Justin also refers to the Pentateuch for two facts which it does not
          contain; but we should not argue from this that he did not possess our
          present Pentateuch. The plays of Terence are quoted by Cicero and
          Horace, and we require neither more nor earlier witnesses to their
          genuineness,—yet Cicero and Horace wrote a hundred years after
          Terence. It is unfair to refuse similar evidence to the gospels.
          Justin had a way of combining into one the sayings of the different
          evangelists—a hint which Tatian, his pupil, probably followed out in
          composing his Diatessaron. On Justin Martyr’s testimony, see Ezra
          Abbot, Genuineness of the Fourth Gospel, 49, note. B. W. Bacon,
          Introd. to N. T., speaks of Justin as “writing circa 155 a.d.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Papias (80–164), whom Irenæus calls a ‘hearer of John,’ testifies
          that Matthew “wrote in the Hebrew dialect the sacred oracles (τὰ
          λόγια),” and that “Mark, the interpreter of Peter, wrote after Peter,
          ὔστερον Πέτρῳ [or under Peter’s direction], an unsystematic account
          (οὐ τάξει)” of the same events and discourses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this testimony it is objected: (1) That Papias could not have had
          our gospel of Matthew, for the reason that this is Greek. We reply,
          either with Bleek, that Papias erroneously supposed a Hebrew
          translation of Matthew, which he possessed, to be the original; or
          with Weiss, that the original Matthew was in Hebrew, while our present
          Matthew is an enlarged version of the same. Palestine, like modern
          Wales, was bilingual; Matthew, like James, might write both Hebrew and
          Greek. While B. W. Bacon gives to the writing of Papias a date so late
          as 145–160 a.d., Lightfoot gives that of 130 a.d.. At this latter date
          Papias could easily remember stories told him so far back as 80 a.d.,
          by men who were youths at the time when our Lord lived, died, rose and
          ascended. The work of Papias had for its title Λογίων κυριακῶν
          ἐξήγησις—“Exposition of Oracles relating to the Lord” = Commentaries
          on the Gospels. Two of these gospels were Matthew and Mark. The view
          of Weiss mentioned above has been criticized upon the ground that the
          quotations from the O. T. in Jesus’ discourses in Matthew are all
          taken from the Septuagint and not from the Hebrew. Westcott answers
          this criticism by suggesting that, in translating his Hebrew gospel
          into Greek, Matthew substituted for his own oral version of Christ’s
          discourses the version of these already existing in the oral common
          gospel. There was a common oral basis of true teaching, the
          “deposit”—τὴν παραθήκην—committed to Timothy (1Ti_6:20; 2Ti_1:12;
          2Ti_1:14), the same story told many times and getting to be told in
          the same way. The narratives of Matthew, Mark and Luke are independent
          versions of this apostolic testimony. First came belief; secondly,
          oral teaching; thirdly, written gospels. That the original gospel was
          in Aramaic seems probable from the fact that the Oriental name for
          “tares,” zawān, (Mat_13:25) has been transliterated into Greek,
          ζιζάνια. Morison, Com. on Mat., thinks that Matthew originally wrote
          in Hebrew a collection of Sayings of Jesus Christ, which the Nazarenes
          and Ebionites added to, partly from tradition, and partly from
          translating his full gospel, till the result was the so-called Gospel
          of the Hebrews; but that Matthew wrote his own gospel in Greek after
          he had written the Sayings in Hebrew. Professor W. A. Stevens thinks
          that Papias probably alluded to the original autograph which Matthew
          wrote in Aramaic, but which he afterwards enlarged and translated into
          Greek. See Hemphill, Literature of the Second Century, 267.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the testimony of Papias it is also objected: (2) That Mark is the
          most systematic of all evangelists, presenting events as a true
          annalist, in chronological order. We reply that while, so far as
          chronological order is concerned, Mark is systematic, so far as
          logical order is concerned he is the most unsystematic of the
          evangelists, showing little of the power of historical grouping which
          is so discernible in Matthew. Matthew aimed to portray a life, rather
          than to record a chronology. He groups Jesus’ teachings in chapters 5,
          6, and 7; his miracles in chapters 8 and 9; his directions to the
          apostles in chapter 10; chapters 11 and 12 describe the growing
          opposition; chapter 13 meets this opposition with his parables; the
          remainder of the gospel describes our Lord’s preparation for his
          death, his progress to Jerusalem, the consummation of his work in the
          Cross and in the resurrection. Here is true system, a philosophical
          arrangement of material, compared with which the method of Mark is
          eminently unsystematic. Mark is a Froissart, while Matthew has the
          spirit of J. R. Green. See Bleek, Introd. to N. T., 1:108, 1:126;
          Weiss, Life of Jesus, 1:27–39.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The Apostolic Fathers,—Clement of Rome (died 101), Ignatius of
          Antioch (martyred 115), and Polycarp (80–166),—companions and friends
          of the apostles, have left us in their writings over one hundred
          quotations from or allusions to the New Testament writings, and among
          these every book, except four minor epistles (2 Peter, Jud_1:2 and 3
          John) is represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although these are single testimonies, we must remember that they are
          the testimonies of the chief men of the churches of their day, and
          that they express the opinion of the churches themselves. “Like
          banners of a hidden army, or peaks of a distant mountain range, they
          represent and are sustained by compact, continuous bodies below.” In
          an article by P. W. Calkins, McClintock and Strong’s Encyclopædia,
          1:315–317, quotations from the Apostolic Fathers in great numbers are
          put side by side with the New Testament passages from which they quote
          or to which they allude. An examination of these quotations and
          allusions convinces us that these Fathers were in possession of all
          the principal books of our New Testament. See Ante-Nicene Library of
          T. and T. Clark; Thayer, in Boston Lectures for 1871:324; Nash, Ethics
          and Rev_11:1-19—“Ignatius says to Polycarp: ‘The times call for thee,
          as the winds call for the pilot.’ So do the times call for reverent,
          fearless scholarship in the church.” Such scholarship, we are
          persuaded, has already demonstrated the genuineness of the N. T.
          documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) In the synoptic gospels, the omission of all mention of the
          fulfilment of Christ’s prophecies with regard to the destruction of
          Jerusalem is evidence that these gospels were written before the
          occurrence of that event. In the Acts of the Apostles, universally
          attributed to Luke, we have an allusion to ‘the former treatise’, or
          the gospel by the same author, which must, therefore, have been
          written before the end of Paul’s first imprisonment at Rome, and
          probably with the help and sanction of that apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Act_1:1—“The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that
          Jesus began both to do and to teach.” If the Acts was written a.d. 63,
          two years after Paul’s arrival at Rome, then “the former treatise,”
          the gospel according to Luke, can hardly be dated later than 60; and
          since the destruction of Jerusalem took place in 70, Matthew and Mark
          must have published their gospels at least as early as the year 68,
          when multitudes of men were still living who had been eye-witnesses of
          the events of Jesus’ life. Fisher, Nature and Method of Revelation,
          180—“At any considerably later date [than the capture of Jerusalem]
          the apparent conjunction of the fall of the city and the temple with
          the Parousia would have been avoided or explained.…Matthew, in its
          present form, appeared after the beginning of the mortal struggle of
          the Romans with the Jews, or between 65 and 70. Mark’s gospel was
          still earlier. The language of the passages relative to the Parousia,
          in Luke, is consistent with the supposition that he wrote after the
          fall of Jerusalem, but not with the supposition that it was long
          after.” See Norton, Genuineness of the Gospels; Alford, Greek
          Testament, Prolegomena, 30, 31, 36, 45–47.

          C. It is to be presumed that this acceptance of the New Testament
          documents as genuine, on the part of the Fathers of the churches, was
          for good and sufficient reasons, both internal and external, and this
          presumption is corroborated by the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) There is evidence that the early churches took every care to
          assure themselves of the genuineness of these writings before they
          accepted them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidences of care are the following:—Paul, in 2Th_2:2, urged the
          churches to use care, “to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from
          your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by
          epistle as from us”; 1Co_5:9—“I wrote unto you in my epistle to have
          no company with fornicators”; Col_4:16—“when this epistle hath been
          read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the
          Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.” Melito
          (169), Bishop of Sardis, who wrote a treatise on the Revelation of
          John, went as far as Palestine to ascertain on the spot the facts
          relating to the Canon of the O. T., and as a result of bis
          investigations excluded the Apocrypha. Ryle, Canon of O. T.,
          203—“Melito, the Bishop of Sardis, sent to a friend a list of the O.
          T. Scriptures which he professed to have obtained from accurate
          inquiry, while traveling in the East, in Syria. Its contents agree
          with those of the Hebrew Canon, save in the omission of Esther.”
          Serapion, Bishop of Antioch (191–213, Abbot), says: “We receive Peter
          and other apostles as Christ, but as skilful men we reject those
          writings which are falsely ascribed to them.” Geo. H. Ferris, Baptist
          Congress, 1899:94—“Serapion, after permitting the reading of the
          Gospel of Peter in public services, finally decided against it, not
          because he thought there could be no fifth gospel, but because he
          thought it was not written by Peter.” Tertullian (160–230) gives an
          example of the deposition of a presbyter in Asia Minor for publishing
          a pretended work of Paul; see Tertullian, De Baptismo, referred to by
          Godet on John, Introduction; Lardner, Works, 2:304, 305; McIlvaine,
          Evidences, 92.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The style of the New Testament writings, and their complete
          correspondence with all we know of the lands and times in which they
          profess to have been written, affords convincing proof that they
          belong to the apostolic age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the mingling of Latin and Greek, as in σπεκουλάτωρ (Mar_6:27)
          and κεντυρίων (Mar_15:39); of Greek and Aramæan, as in πρασιαὶ πρασιαί
          (Mar_6:40) and βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως (Mat_24:15); this could hardly
          have occurred after the first century. Compare the anachronisms of
          style and description in Thackeray’s “Henry Esmond,” which, in spite
          of the author’s special studies and his determination to exclude all
          words and phrases that had originated in his own century, was marred
          by historical errors that Macaulay in his most remiss moments would
          hardly have made. James Russell Lowell told Thackeray that “different
          to” was not a century old. “Hang it, no!” replied Thackeray. In view
          of this failure, on the part of an author of great literary skill, to
          construct a story purporting to be written a century before his time
          and that could stand the test of historical criticism, we may well
          regard the success of our gospels in standing such tests as a
          practical demonstration that they were written in, and not after, the
          apostolic age. See Alexander, Christ and Christianity, 27–37; Blunt,
          Scriptural Coincidences, 244–354.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The genuineness of the fourth gospel is confirmed by the fact that
          Tatian (155–170), the Assyrian, a disciple of Justin, repeatedly
          quoted it without naming the author, and composed a Harmony of our
          four gospels which he named the Diatessaron; while Basilides (130) and
          Valentinus (150), the Gnostics, both quote from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sceptical work entitled “Supernatural Religion” said in 1874; “No
          one seems to have seen Tatian’s Harmony, probably for the very simple
          reason that there was no such work”; and "There is no evidence
          whatever connecting Tatian’s Gospel with those of our Canon.” In 1876,
          however, there was published in a Latin form in Venice the Commentary
          of Ephraem Syrus on Tatian, and the commencement of it was: “In the
          beginning was the Word” (Joh_1:1). In 1888, the Diatessaron itself was
          published in Rome in the form of an Arabic translation made in the
          eleventh century from the Syriac. J. Rendel Harris, in Contemp. Rev.,
          1893:800 sq., says that the recovery of Tatian’s Diates-saron has
          indefinitely postponed the literary funeral of St. John. Advanced
          critics, he intimates, are so called, because they run ahead of the
          facts they discuss. The gospels must have been well established in the
          Christian church when Tatian undertook to combine them. Mrs. A. S.
          Lewis, in S. S. Times, Jan. 23, 1904—“The gospels were translated into
          Syriac before a.d. 160. It follows that the Greek document from which
          they were translated was older still, and since the one includes the
          gospel of St. John, so did the other.” Hemphill, Literature of the
          Second Century, 183–231, gives the birth of Tatian about 120, and the
          date of his Diatessaron as 172 a.d..
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference in style between the Revelation and the gospel of John
          is due to the fact that the Revelation was written during John’s exile
          in Patmos, under Nero, in 67 or 68, soon after John had left Palestine
          and had taken up his residence at Ephesus. He had hitherto spoken
          Aramæan, and Greek was comparatively unfamiliar to him. The gospel was
          written thirty years after, probably about 97, when Greek had become
          to him like a mother tongue. See Lightfoot on Galatians, 343, 347; per
          contra, see Milligan, Revelation of St. John. Phrases and ideas which
          indicate a common authorship of the Revelation and the gospel are the
          following: “the Lamb of God,” “the Word of God,” “the True” as an
          epithet applied to Christ, “the Jews” as enemies of God, “manna,” “him
          whom they pierced”; see Elliott, Horæ Apocalypticæ, 1:4, 5. In the
          fourth gospel we have ἀμνός in Apoc. ἀρνίον, perhaps better to
          distinguish “the Lamb” from the diminutive τὸ θηρίον, “the beast.”
          Common to both Gospel and Rev. are ποιεῖν, “to do” [the truth];
          περιπατεῖν, of moral conduct; ἀληθινός, “genuine”; διψᾷ, πεινᾷν, of
          the higher wants of the soul; σκηνοῦν ἐν, ποιμαίνειν, ὁδηγεῖν; also
          ‘overcome,’ ‘testimony,’ ‘Bridegooom,’ ‘Shepherd,’ ‘Water of life.’ In
          the Revelation there are grammatical solecisms: nominative
          forgenitive, 1:4—ἀπὸ ὁ ὤν; nominative for accusative, 7:9—εἶδον.…ὄχλος
          πολύς; accusative for nominative, 20:2—τὸν δράκοντα ὁ ὄφις. Similarly
          we have in Rom_12:5—τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ εἶς instead of τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ ἕνα, where
          κατὰ has lost its regimen—a frequent solecism in later Greek writers;
          see Godet on John, 1:269, 270. Emerson reminded Jones Very that the
          Holy Ghost surely writes good grammar. The Apocalypse seems to show
          that Emerson was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author of the fourth gospel speaks of John in the third person,
          “and scorned to blot it with a name.” But so does Cæsar speak of
          himself in his Commentaries. Harnack regards both the fourth gospel
          and the Revelation as the work of John the Presbyter or Elder, the
          former written not later than about 110 a.d.;.; the latter from 93 to
          96, but being a revision of one or more underlying Jewish apocalypses.
          Vischer has expounded this view of the Revelation; and Porter holds
          substantially the same, in his article on the Book of Revelation in
          Hastings’ Bible Dictionary, 4:239–266. “It is the obvious advantage of
          the Vischer-Harnack hypothesis that it places the original work under
          Nero and its revised and Christianized edition under Domitian.”
          (Sanday, Inspiration, 371, 372, nevertheless dismisses this hypothesis
          as raising worse difficulties than it removes. He dates the Apocalypse
          between the death of Nero and the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.)
          Martineau, Seat of Authority, 227, presents the moral objections to
          the apostolic authorship, and regards the Revelation, from chapter 4:1
          to 22:5, as a purely Jewish document of the date 66–70, supplemented
          and revised by a Christian, and issued not earlier than 136: “How
          strange that we should ever have thought it possible for a personal
          attendant upon the ministry of Jesus to write or edit a book mixing up
          fierce Messianic conflicts, in which, with the sword, the gory
          garment, the blasting flame, the rod of iron, as his emblems, he leads
          the war-march, and treads the winepress of the wrath of God until the
          deluge of blood rises to the horses bits, with the speculative
          Christology of the second century, without a memory of his life, a
          feature of his look, a word from his voice, or a glance back at the
          hillsides of Galilee, the courts of Jerusalem, the road to Bethany, on
          which his image must be forever seen!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The force of this statement, however, is greatly broken if we consider
          that the apostle John, in his earlier days, was one of the “Boanerges,
          which is, Sons of thunder” (Mar_3:17), but became in his later years
          the apostle of love: 1Jn_4:7—“Beloved, let us love one another: for
          love is of God.” The likeness of the fourth gospel to the epistle,
          which latter was undoubtedly the work of John the apostle, indicates
          the same authorship for the gospel. Thayer remarks that “the discovery
          of the gospel according to Peter sweeps away half a century of
          discussion. Brief as is the recovered fragment, it attests indubitably
          all four of our canonical books.” Riddle, in Popular Com., 1:25—“If a
          forger wrote the fourth gospel, then Beelzebub has been casting out
          devils for these eighteen hundred years.” On the genuineness of the
          fourth gospel, see Bleek, Introd. to N. T., 1:250; Fisher, Essays on
          Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 33, also Beginnings of Christianity,

          (d) The epistle to the Hebrews appears to have been accepted during
          the first century after it was written (so Clement of Rome, Justin
          Martyr, and the Peshito Version witness). Then for two centuries,
          especially in the Roman and North African churches, and probably
          because its internal characteristics were inconsistent with the
          tradition of a Pauline authorship, its genuineness was doubted (so
          Tertullian, Cyprian, Irenæus, Muratorian Canon). At the end of the
          fourth century, Jerome examined the evidence and decided in its favor;
          Augustine did the same; the third Council of Carthage formally
          recognized it (397); from that time the Latin churches united with the
          East in receiving it, and thus the doubt was finally and forever
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle to the Hebrews, the style of which is so unlike that of
          the Apostle Paul, was possibly written by Apollos, who was an
          Alexandrian Jew, “a learned man” and “mighty in the Scriptures”
          (Act_18:24); but it may notwithstanding have been written at the
          suggestion and under the direction of Paul, and so be essentially
          Pauline. A. C. Kendrick, in American Commentary on Hebrews, points out
          that while the style of Paul is prevailingly dialectic, and only in
          rapt moments becomes rhetorical or poetic, the style of the Epistle to
          the Hebrews is prevailingly rhetorical, is free from anacoloutha, and
          is always dominated by emotion. He holds that these characteristics
          point to Apollos as its author. Contrast also Paul’s method of quoting
          the O. T.: “it is written” (Rom_11:8; 1Co_1:31; Gal_3:10) with that of
          the Hebrews: “he saith” (8:5, 13), “he hath said” (4:4). Paul quotes
          the O. T. fifty or sixty times, but never in this latter way.
          Heb_2:3—“which having at the first been spoken by the Lord, was
          confirmed unto us by them that heard”—shows that the writer did not
          receive the gospel at first hand. Luther and Calvin rightly saw in
          this a decisive proof that Paul was not the author, for he always
          insisted on the primary and independent character of his gospel.
          Harnack formerly thought the epistle written by Barnabas to Christians
          at Rome, a.d.; 81–96. More recently however he attributes it to
          Priscilla, the wife of Aquila, or to their joint authorship. The
          majesty of its diction, however, seems unfavorable to this view.
          William T. C. Hanna: “The words of the author … are marshalled
          grandly, and move with the tread of an army, or with the swell of a
          tidal wave”; see Franklin Johnson, Quotations in N. T. from O. T.,
          xii. Plumptre, Introd. to N. T., 37, and in Expositor, Vol. I, regards
          the author of this epistle as the same with that of the Apocryphal
          Wisdom of Solomon, the latter being composed before, the former after,
          the writer’s conversion to Christianity. Perhaps our safest conclusion
          is that of Origen: “God only knows who wrote it.” Harnack however
          remarks: “The time in which our ancient Christian literature, the N.
          T. included, was considered as a web of delusions and falsifications,
          is past. The oldest literature of the church is, in its main points,
          and in most of its details, true and trustworthy.” See articles on
          Hebrews, in Smith’s and in Hastings’ Bible Dictionaries.

        <p>
          (e) As to 2 Peter, Jud_1:2 and 3 John, the epistles most frequently
          held to be spurious, we may say that, although we have no conclusive
          external evidence earlier than a.d. 160, and in the case of 2 Peter
          none earlier than a.d. 230–250, we may fairly urge in favor of their
          genuineness not only their internal characteristics of literary style
          and moral value, but also the general acceptance of them all since the
          third century as the actual productions of the men or class of men
          whose names they bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firmilianus (250), Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, is the first clear
          witness to 2 Peter. Origen (230) names it, but, in naming it, admits
          that its genuineness is questioned. The Council of Laodicea (372)
          first received it into the Canon. With this very gradual recognition
          and acceptance of 2 Peter, compare the loss of the later works of
          Aristotle for a hundred and fifty years after his death, and their
          recognition as genuine so soon as they were recovered from the cellar
          of the family of Neleus in Asia; DeWette’s first publication of
          certain letters of Luther after the lapse of three hundred years, yet
          without occasioning doubt as to their genuineness; or the concealment
          of Milton’s Treatise on Christian Doctrine, among the lumber of the
          State Paper Office in London, from 1677 to 1823; see Mair, Christian
          Evidences, 95. Sir William Hamilton complained that there were
          treatises of Cudworth, Berkeley and Collier, still lying unpublished
          and even unknown to their editors, biographers and fellow
          metaphysicians, but yet of the highest interest and importance; see
          Mansel, Letters, Lectures and Reviews, 381; Archibald, The Bible
          Verified, 27. 2 Peter was probably sent from the East shortly before
          Peter’s martyrdom; distance and persecution may have prevented its
          rapid circulation in other countries. Sagebeer, The Bible in Court,
          114—“A ledger may have been lost, or its authenticity for a long time
          doubted, but when once it is discovered and proved, it is as
          trustworthy as any other part of the res gestæ” See Plumptre, Epistles
          of Peter, Introd., 73–81; Alford on 2 Peter 4: Prolegomena, 157;
          Westcott, on Canon, in Smith’s Bib. Dict., 1:370, 373; Blunt, Diet.
          Doct. and Hist. Theol., art.: Canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is urged by those who doubt the genuineness of 2 Peter that the
          epistle speaks of “your apostles” (3:2), just as Jud_1:17 speaks of
          “the apostles,” as if the writer did not number himself among them.
          But 2 Peter begins with “Simon Peter, a servent and apostle of Jesus
          Christ,” and Jude, “brother of James” (verse 1) was a brother of our
          Lord, but not an apostle. Hovey, Introd. to N. T., xxxi—“The earliest
          passage manifestly based upon 2 Peter appears to be in the so-called
          Second Epistle of the Roman Clement, 16:3, which however is now
          understood to be a Christian homily from the middle of the second
          century.” Origen (born 186) testifies that Peter left one epistle,
          “and perhaps a second, for that is disputed.” He also says: “John
          wrote the Apocalypse, and an epistle of very few lines; and, it may
          be, a second and a third; since all do not admit them to be genuine.”
          He quotes also from James and from Jude, adding that their canonidty
          was doubted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harnack regards 1 Peter, 2 Peter, James, and Jude, as written
          respectively about 160, 170, 130, and 130, but not by the men to whom
          they are ascribed—the ascriptions to these authors being later
          additions. Hort remarks: “If I were asked, I should say that the
          balance of the argument was against 2 Peter, but the moment I had done
          so I should begin to think I might be in the wrong.” Sanday, Oracles
          of God, 73 note, considers the arguments in favor of 2 Peter
          unconvincing, but also the arguments against. He cannot get beyond a
          non liquet. He refers to Salmon, Introd. to N. T., 529–559, ed. 4, as
          expressing his own view. But the later conclusions of Sanday are more
          radical. In his Bampton Lectures on Inspiration, 348, 399, he says: 2
          Peter “is probably at least to this extent a counterfeit, that it
          appears under a name which is not that of its true author.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Chase, in Hastings’ Bib. Dict., 3:806–817, says that “the first piece
          of certain evidence as to 2 Peter is the passage from Origen quoted by
          Eusebius, though it hardly admits of doubt that the Epistle was known
          to Clement of Alexandria.…We find no trace of the epistle in the
          period when the tradition of apostolic days was still living.…It was
          not the work of the apostle but of the second century … put forward
          without any sinister motive … the personation of the apostle an
          obvious literary device rather than a religious or controversial
          fraud. The adoption of such a verdict can cause perplexity only when
          the Lord’s promise of guidance to his Church is regarded as a charter
          of infallibility.” Against this verdict we would urge the dignity and
          spiritual value of 2 Peter—internal evidence which in our judgment
          causes the balance to incline in favor of its apostolic authorship.

          (f) Upon no other hypothesis than that of their genuineness can the
          general acceptance of these four minor epistles since the third
          century, and of all the other books of the New Testament since the
          middle of the second century, be satisfactorily accounted for. If they
          had been mere collections of floating legends, they could not have
          secured wide circulation as sacred books for which Christians must
          answer with their blood. If they had been forgeries, the churches at
          large could neither have been deceived as to their previous
          non-existence, nor have been induced unanimously to pretend that they
          were ancient and genuine. Inasmuch, however, as other accounts of
          their origin, inconsistent with their genuineness, are now current, we
          proceed to examine more at length the most important of these opposing
          views.

          The genuineness of the New Testament as a whole would still be
          demonstrable, even if doubt should still attach to one or two of its
          books. It does not matter that 2nd Alcibiades was not written by
          Plato, or Pericles by Shakespeare. The Council of Carthage in 397 gave
          a place in the Canon to the O. T. Apocrypha, but the Reformers tore it
          out. Zwingli said of the Revelation: “It is not a Biblical book,” and
          Luther spoke slightingly of the Epistle of James. The judgment of
          Christendom at large is more trustworthy than the private impressions
          of any single Christian scholar. To hold the books of the N. T. to be
          written in the second century by other than those whose names they
          bear is to hold, not simply to forgery, but to a conspiracy of
          forgery. There must have been several forgers at work, and, since
          their writings wonderfully agree, there must have been collusion among
          them. Yet these able men have been forgotten, while the names of far
          feebler writers of the second century have been preserved.

          G. F. Wright, Scientific Aspects of Christian Evidences, 343—“In civil
          law there are ‘statutes of limitations’ which provide that the general
          acknowledgment of a purported fact for a certain period shall be
          considered as conclusive evidence of it. If, for example, a man has
          remained in undisturbed possession of land for a certain number of
          years, it is presumed that he has a valid claim to it, and no one is
          allowed to dispute his claim.” Mair, Evidences, 99—“We probably have
          not a tenth part of the evidence upon which the early churches
          accepted the N. T. books as the genuine productions of their authors.
          We have only their verdict.” Wynne, in Literature of the Second
          Century, 58—“Those who gave up the Scriptures were looked on by their
          fellow Christians as ‘traditores’, traitors, who had basely yielded up
          what they ought to have treasured as dearer than life. But all their
          books were not equally sacred. Some were essential, and some were
          non-essential to the faith. Hence arose the distinction between
          canonical and non-canonical. The general consciousness of Christians
          grew into a distinct registration.” Such registration is entitled to
          the highest respect, and lays the burden of proof upon the objector.

          D. Rationalistic Theories as to the origin of the gospels. These are
          attempts to eliminate the miraculous element from the New Testament
          records, and to reconstruct the sacred history upon principles of
          naturalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Against them we urge the general objection that they are unscientific
          in their principle and method. To set out in an examination of the New
          Testament documents with the assumption that all history is a mere
          natural development, and that miracles are therefore impossible, is to
          make history a matter, not of testimony, but of a priori speculation.
          It indeed renders any history of Christ and his apostles impossible,
          since the witnesses whose testimony with regard to miracles is
          discredited can no longer be considered worthy of credence in their
          account of Christ’s life or doctrine.

          In Germany, half a century ago, “a man was famous according as he had
          lifted up axes upon the thick trees” (Psa_74:5, A. V.), just as among
          the American Indians he was not counted a man who could not show his
          scalps. The critics fortunately scalped each other; see Tyler,
          Theology of Greek Poets, 79—on Homer. Nicoll, The Church’s One
          Foundation, 15—“Like the mummers of old, sceptical critics send one
          before them with a broom to sweep the stage clear of everything for
          their drama. If we assume at the threshold of the gospel study that
          everything of the nature of miracle is impossible, then the specific
          questions are decided before the criticism begins to operate in
          earnest.” Matthew Arnold: “Our popular religion at present conceives
          the birth, ministry and death of Christ as altogether steeped in
          prodigy, brimful of miracle,—and miracles do not happen.” This
          presupposition influences the investigations of Kuenen, and of A. E.
          Abbott, in his article on the Gospels in the Encyc. Britannica. We
          give special attention to four of the theories based upon this
          assumption.
