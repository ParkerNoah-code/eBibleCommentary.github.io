        <p>3. Probability of Miracles.</p>
        <p>
          A. We acknowledge that, so long as we confine our attention to nature,
          there is a presumption against miracles. Experience testifies to the
          uniformity of natural law. A general uniformity is needful, in order
          to make possible a rational calculation of the future, and a proper
          ordering of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Butler, Analogy, part ii, chap. ii; F. W. Farrar, Witness of
          History to Christ, 3–45; Modern Scepticism, 1:179–227; Chalmers,
          Christian Revelation, 1:47. G. D. B. Pepper: “Where there is no law,
          no settled order, there can be no miracle. The miracle presupposes the
          law, and the importance assigned to miracles is the recognition of the
          reign of law. But the making and launching of a ship may be governed
          by law, no less than the sailing of the ship after it is launched. So
          the introduction of a higher spiritual order into a merely natural
          order constitutes a new and unique event.” Some Christian apologists
          have erred in affirming that the miracle was antecedently as probable
          as any other event, whereas only its antecedent improbability gives it
          value as a proof of revelation. Horace: “Nec deus intersit, nisi
          dignus vindice nodus Inciderit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          B. But we deny that this uniformity of nature is absolute and
          universal. (a) It is not a truth of reason that can have no
          exceptions, like the axiom that a whole is greater than its parts. (b)
          Experience could not warrant a belief in absolute and universal
          uniformity, unless experience were identical with absolute and
          universal knowledge. (c) We know, on the contrary, from geology, that
          there have been breaks in this uniformity, such as the introduction of
          vegetable, animal and human life, which cannot be accounted for,
          except by the manifestation in nature of a supernatural power.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Compare the probability that the sun will rise to-morrow morning
          with the certainty that two and two make four. Huxley, Lay Sermons,
          158, indignantly denies that there is any ‘must’ about the uniformity
          of nature: “No one is entitled to say a priori that any given
          so-called miraculous event is impossible.” Ward, Naturalism and
          Agnosticism, 1:84—“There is no evidence for the statement that the
          mass of the universe is a definite and unchangeable quantity”; 108,
          109—“Why so confidently assume that a rigid and monotonous uniformity
          is the only, or the highest, indication of order, the order of an ever
          living Spirit, above all? How is it that we depreciate machine-made
          articles, and prefer those in which the artistic impulse, or the
          fitness of the individual case, is free to shape and to make what is
          literally manufactured, hand-made? … Dangerous as teleological
          arguments in general may be, we may at least safely say the world was
          not designed to make science easy.…To call the verses of a poet, the
          politics of a statesman, or the award of a judge mechanical, implies,
          as Lotze has pointed out, marked disparagement, although it implies,
          too, precisely those characteristics—exactness and invariability—in
          which Maxwell would have us see a token of the divine.” Surely then we
          must not insist that divine wisdom must always run in a rut, must ever
          repeat itself, must never exhibit itself in unique acts like
          incarnation and resurrection. See Edward Hitchcock, in Bib. Sac.,
          20:489–561, on “The Law of Nature’s Constancy Subordinate to the
          Higher Law of Change”; Jevons, Principles of Science, 2:430–438;
          Mozley, Miracles, 26.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) S. T. Coleridge, Table Talk, 18 December, 1831—“The light which
          experience gives us is a lantern on the stern of the ship, which
          shines only on the waves behind us.” Hobbes: “Experience concludeth
          nothing universally.” Brooks, Foundations of Zoölogy, 131—“Evidence
          can tell us only what has happened, and it can never assure us that
          the future must be like the past; 132—Proof that all nature is
          mechanical would not be inconsistent with the belief that everything
          in nature is immediately sustained by Providence, and that my volition
          counts for something in determining the course of events.” Royce,
          World and Individual, 2:204—“Uniformity is not absolute. Nature is a
          vaster realm of life and meaning, of which we men form a part, and of
          which the final unity is in God’s life. The rhythm of the heart-beat
          has its normal regularity, yet its limited persistence. Nature may be
          merely the habits of free will. Every region of this universally
          conscious world may be a centre whence issues new conscious life for
          communication to all the worlds.” Principal Fairbairn: “Nature is
          Spirit.” We prefer to say: “Nature is the manifestation of spirit, the
          regularities of freedom.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Other breaks in the uniformity of nature are the coming of Christ
          and the regeneration of a human soul. Harnack, what is Christianity,
          18, holds that though there are no interruptions to the working of
          natural law, natural law is not yet fully known. While there are no
          miracles, there is plenty of the miraculous. The power of mind over
          matter is beyond our present conceptions. Bowne, Philosophy of Theism,
          210—The effects are no more consequences of the laws than the laws are
          consequences of the effects = both laws and effects are exercises of
          divine will. King, Reconstruction in Theology, 56—We must hold, not to
          the uniformity of law, but to the universality of law; for evolution
          has successive stages with new laws coming in and becoming dominant
          that had not before appeared. The new and higher stage is practically
          a miracle from the point of view of the lower. See British Quarterly
          Review, Oct. 1881:154; Martineau, Study, 2:200, 203, 209.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. Since the inworking of the moral law into the constitution and
          course of nature shows that nature exists, not for itself, but for the
          contemplation and use of moral beings, it is probable that the God of
          nature will produce effects aside from those of natural law, whenever
          there are sufficiently important moral ends to be served thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath the expectation of uniformity is the intuition of final cause;
          the former may therefore give way to the latter. See Porter, Human
          Intellect, 592–615—Efficient causes and final causes may conflict, and
          then the efficient give place to the final. This is miracle. See
          Hutton, in Nineteenth Century, Aug. 1885, and Channing, Evidences of
          Revealed Religion, quoted in Shedd, Dogm. Theol., 1:534, 535—“The
          order of the universe is a means, not an end, and like all other means
          must give way when the end can be beat promoted without it. It is the
          mark of a weak mind to make an idol of order and method; to cling to
          established forms of business when they clog instead of advancing it.”
          Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 357—“The stability of the heavens is
          in the sight of God of less importance than the moral growth of the
          human spirit.” This is proved by the Incarnation. The Christian sees
          in this little earth the scene of God’s greatest revelation. The
          superiority of the spiritual to the physical helps us to see our true
          dignity in the creation, to rule our bodies, to overcome our sins.
          Christ’s suffering shows us that God is no indifferent spectator of
          human pain. He subjects himself to our conditions, or rather in this
          subjection reveals to us God’s own eternal suffering for sin. The
          atonement enables us to solve the problem of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          D. The existence of moral disorder consequent upon the free acts of
          man’s will, therefore, changes the presumption against miracles into a
          presumption in their favor. The non-appearance of miracles, in this
          case, would be the greatest of wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stearns, Evidence of Christian Experience, 331–335—So a man’s personal
          consciousness of sin, and above all his personal experience of
          regenerating grace, will constitute the best preparation for the study
          of miracles. “Christianity cannot be proved except to a bad
          conscience.” The dying Vinet said well: “The greatest miracle that I
          know of is that of my conversion. I was dead, and I live; I was blind,
          and I see; I was a slave, and I am free; I was an enemy of God, and I
          love him; prayer, the Bible, the society of Christians, these were to
          me a source of profound ennui; whilst now it is the pleasures of the
          world that are wearisome to me, and piety is the source of all my joy.
          Behold the miracle! And if God has been able to work that one, there
          are none of which he is not capable.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the physical and the moral are not “sundered as with an axe.”
          Nature is but the lower stage or imperfect form of the revelation of
          God’s truth and holiness and love. It prepares the way for the miracle
          by suggesting, though more dimly, the same essential characteristics
          of the divine nature. Ignorance and sin necessitate a larger
          disclosure. G. S. Lee, The Shadow Christ, 84—“The pillar of cloud was
          the dim nightlamp that Jehovah kept burning over his infant children,
          to show them that he was there. They did not know that the night
          itself was God.” Why do we have Christmas presents in Christian homes?
          Because the parents do not love their children at other times? No; but
          because the mind becomes sluggish in the presence of merely regular
          kindness, and special gifts are needed to wake it to gratitude. So our
          sluggish and unloving minds need special testimonies of the divine
          mercy. Shall God alone be shut up to dull uniformities of action?
          Shall the heavenly Father alone be unable to make special
          communications of love? Why then are not miracles and revivals of
          religion constant and uniform? Because uniform blessings would be
          regarded simply as workings of a machine. See Mozley, Miracles,
          preface, xxiv; Turner, Wish and will, 291–315; N. W. Taylor, Moral
          Government, 2:388–423.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. As belief in the possibility of miracles rests upon our belief in
          the existence of a personal God, so belief in the probability of
          miracles rests upon our belief that God is a moral and benevolent
          being. He who has no God but a God of physical order will regard
          miracles as an impertinent intrusion upon that order. But he who
          yields to the testimony of conscience and regards God as a God of
          holiness, will see that man’s unholiness renders God’s miraculous
          interposition most necessary to man and most becoming to God. Our view
          of miracles will therefore be determined by our belief in a moral, or
          in a non-moral, God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philo, in his Life of Moses, 1:88, speaking of the miracles of the
          quails and of the water from the rock, says that “all these unexpected
          and extraordinary things are amusements or playthings of God.” He
          believes that there is room for arbitrariness in the divine procedure.
          Scripture however represents miracle as an extraordinary, rather than
          as an arbitrary act. It is “his work, his stranges work … his act, his
          strange act” (Isa_28:21). God’s ordinary method is that of regular
          growth and development. Chadwick, Unitarianism, 72—“Nature is
          economical. If she wants an apple, she develops a leaf; if she wants a
          brain, she develops a vertebra. We always thought well of backbone;
          and, if Goethe’s was a sound suggestion, we think better of it now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is commonly, but very erroneously, taken for granted that miracle
          requires a greater exercise of power than does God’s upholding of the
          ordinary processes of nature. But to an omnipotent Being our measures
          of power have no application. The question is not a question of power,
          but of rationality and love. Miracle implies selfrestraint, as well as
          self-unfolding, on the part of him who works it. It is therefore not
          God’s common method of action; it is adopted only when regular methods
          will not suffice; it often seems accompanied by a sacrifice of feeling
          on the part of Christ (Mat_17:17—“O faithless and perverse generation,
          how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring
          him hither to me”; Mar_7:34—“looking up to heaven, he sighed, and
          saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened”; cf. Mat_12:39—“An evil
          and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no
          sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.”
        </p>
        <p>
          F. From the point of view of ethical monism the probability of miracle
          becomes even greater. Since God is not merely the intellectual but the
          moral Reason of the world, the disturbances of the world-order which
          are due to sin are the matters which most deeply affect him. Christ,
          the life of the whole system and of humanity as well, must suffer;
          and, since we have evidence that he is merciful as well as just, it is
          probable that he will rectify the evil by extraordinary means, when
          merely ordinary means do not avail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like creation and providence, like inspiration and regeneration,
          miracle is a work in which God limits himself, by a new and peculiar
          exercise of his power,—limits himself as part of a process of
          condescending love and as a means of teaching sense-environed and
          sin-burdened humanity what it would not learn in any other way.
          Self-limitation, however, is the very perfection and glory of God, for
          without it no self-sacrificing love would be possible (see page 9,
          F.). The probability of miracles is therefore argued not only from
          God’s holiness but also from his love. His desire to save men from
          their sins must be as infinite as his nature. The incarnation, the
          atonement, the resurrection, when once made known to us, commend
          themselves, not only as satisfying our human needs, but as worthy of a
          God of moral perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          An argument for the probability of the miracle might be drawn from the
          concessions of one of its chief modern opponents, Thomas H. Huxley. He
          tells us in different places that the object of science is “the
          discovery of the rational order that pervades the universe,” which in
          spite of his professed agnosticism is an unconscious testimony to
          Reason and will at the basis of all things. He tells us again that
          there is no necessity in the uniformities of nature: “When we change
          ‘will’ into ‘must,’ we introduce an idea of necessity which has no
          warrant in the observed facts, and has no warranty that I can discover
          elsewhere.” He speaks of “the infinite wickedness that has attended
          the course of human history.” Yet he has no hope in man’s power to
          save himself: “I would as soon adore a wilderness of apes,” as the
          Pantheist’s rationalized conception of humanity. He grants that Jesus
          Christ is “the noblest ideal of humanity which mankind has yet
          worshiped.” Why should be not go further and concede that Jesus Christ
          most truly represents the infinite Reason at the heart of things, and
          that his purity and love, demonstrated by suffering and death, make it
          probable that God will use extraordinary means for man’s deliverance?
          It is doubtful whether Huxley recognized his own personal sinfulness
          as fully as he recognized the sinfulness of humanity in general. If he
          had done so, he would have been willing to accept miracle upon even a
          slight preponderance of historical proof. As a matter of fact, he
          rejected miracle upon the grounds assigned by Hume, which we now
          proceed to mention.
