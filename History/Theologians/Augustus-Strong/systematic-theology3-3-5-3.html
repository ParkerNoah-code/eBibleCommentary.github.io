        <p>3. Errors in Morality.</p>
        <p>
          (a) What are charged as such are sometimes evil acts and words of good
          men—words and acts not sanctioned by God. These are narrated by the
          inspired writers as simple matter of history, and subsequent results,
          or the story itself, is left to point the moral of the tale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instances of this sort are Noah’s drunkenness (Gen_9:20-27); Lot’s
          incest (Gen_19:30-38); Jacob’s falsehood (Gen_27:19-24); David’s
          adultery (2Sa_11:1-4); Peter’s denial (Mat_26:69-75). See Lee,
          Inspiration, 265, note. Esther’s vindictiveness is not commended, nor
          are the characters of the Book of Esther said to have acted in
          obedience to a divine command. Crane, Religion of To-morrow, 241—“In
          law and psalm and prophecy we behold the influence of Jehovah working
          as leaven among a primitive and barbarous people. Contemplating the
          Old Scriptures in this light, they become luminous with divinity, and
          we are furnished with the principle by which to discriminate between
          the divine and the human in the book. Particularly in David do we see
          a rugged, half-civilized, kingly man, full of gross errors, fleshly
          and impetuous, yet permeated with a divine Spirit that lifts him,
          struggling, weeping, and warring, up to some of the loftiest
          conceptions of Deity which the mind of man has conceived. As an
          angelic being, David is a caricature; as a man of God, as an example
          of God moving upon and raising up a most human man, he is a splendid
          example. The proof that the church is of God, is not its
          impeccability, but its progress.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Where evil acts appear at first sight to be sanctioned, it is
          frequently some right intent or accompanying virtue, rather than the
          act itself, upon which commendation is bestowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Rahab’s faith, not her duplicity (Jos_2:1-24 : cf. Heb_11:31 and
          Jam_2:25); Jael’s patriotism, not her treachery (Jdg_4:17-22; cf.
          Jdg_5:24), Or did they cast in their lot with Israel and use the
          common stratagems of war (see next paragraph)? Herder: “The
          limitations of the pupil are also limitations of the teacher.” While
          Dean Stanley praises Solomon for tolerating idolatry, James Martineau,
          Study, 2:137, remarks: “It would be a ridiculous pedantry to apply the
          Protestant pleas of private judgment to such communities as ancient
          Egypt and Assyria.…It is the survival of coercion, after conscience
          has been born to supersede it, that shocks and revolts us in
          persecution.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Certain commands and deeds are sanctioned as relatively
          just—expressions of justice such as the age could comprehend, and are
          to be judged as parts of a progressively unfolding system of morality
          whose key and culmination we have in Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exo_20:25—“I gave them statutes that were not good“—as Moses’
          permission of divorce and retaliation (Deu_24:1; cf. Mat_5:31-32;
          Mat_19:7-9. Exo_21:24; cf. Mat_5:38-39). Compare Elijah’s calling down
          fire from heaven (2Ki_1:10-12) with Jesus’ refusal to do the same, and
          his intimation that the spirit of Elijah was not the spirit of Christ
          (Luk_9:52-56); cf. Mattheson, Moments on the Mount, 253–255, on
          Mat_17:8—“Jesus only”: “The strength of Elias paled before him. To
          shed the blood of enemies requires less strength than to shed one’s
          own blood, and to conquer by fire is easier than to conquer by love.”
          Hovey: “In divine revelation, it is first starlight, then dawn,
          finally day.” George Washington once gave directions for the
          transportation to the West Indies and the sale there of a refractory
          negro who had given him trouble. This was not at variance with the
          best morality of his time, but it would not suit the improved ethical
          standards of today. The use of force rather than moral suasion is
          sometimes needed by children and by barbarians. We may illustrate by
          the Sunday School scholar’s unruliness which was cured by his
          classmates during the week. “What did you say to him?” asked the
          teacher. “We did n’t say nothing; we just punched his head for him.”
          This was Old Testament righteousness. The appeal in the O. T. to the
          hope of earthly rewards was suitable to a stage of development not yet
          instructed as to heaven and hell by the coming and work of Christ;
          compare Exo_20:12 with Mat_5:10; Mat_25:46. The Old Testament aimed to
          fix in the mind of a selected people the idea of the unity and
          holiness of God; in order to exterminate idolatry, much other teaching
          was postponed. See Peabody, Religion of Nature, 45; Mozley, Ruling
          Ideas of Early Ages; Green, in Presb., Quar., April, 1877:221–252;
          McIivaine, Wisdom of Holy Scripture, 328–368; Brit, and For. Evang.
          Rev., Jan. 1878:1–32; Martineau, Study, 2:137.
        </p>
        <p>
          When therefore we find in the inspired song of Deborah, the prophetess
          (Jdg_5:30), an allusion to the common spoils of war—“a damsel, two
          damsels to every man” or in Pro_31:6-7—“Give strong drink unto him
          that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul. Let him
          drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more”—we do
          not need to maintain that these passages furnish standards for our
          modern conduct. Dr. Fisher calls the latter “the worst advice to a
          person in affliction, or dispirited by the loss of property.” They
          mark past stages in God’s providential leading of mankind. A higher
          stage indeed is already intimated in Pro_31:4—“it is not for kings to
          drink wine, Nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?” We see
          that God could use very imperfect instruments and could inspire very
          imperfect men. Many things were permitted for men’s “hardness of
          heart” (Mat_19:8). The Sermon on the Mount is a great advance on the
          law of Moses (Mat_5:21—“Ye hare heard that it was said to them of old
          time”; cf. Mat_5:22—“But I say unto you”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert G. Ingersoll would have lost his stock in trade if Christians
          had generally recognized that revelation is gradual, and is completed
          only in Christ. This gradualness of revelation is conceded in the
          common phrase: “the new dispensation.” Abraham Lincoln showed his
          wisdom by never going far ahead of the common sense of the people. God
          similarly adapted his legislation to the capacities of each successive
          age. The command to Abraham to sacrifice his son (Gen_22:1-19) was a
          proper test of Abraham’s faith in a day when human sacrifice violated
          no common ethical standard because the Hebrew, like the Roman, “patria
          potestas” did not regard the child as having a separate individuality,
          but included the child in the parent and made the child equally
          responsible for the parent’s sin. But that very command was given only
          as a test of faith, and with the intent to make the intended obedience
          the occasion of revealing God’s provision of a substitute and so of
          doing away with human sacrifice for all future time. We may well
          imitate the gradualness of divine revelation in our treatment of
          dancing and of the liquor traffic.

          (d) God’s righteous sovereignty affords the key to other events. He
          has the right to do what he will with his own, and to punish the
          transgressor when and where he will; and he may justly make men the
          foretellers or executors of his purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foretellers, as in the imprecatory Psalms (Psa_137:9; cf. Isa_13:16-18
          and Jer_50:16; Jer_50:29); executors, as in the destruction of the
          Canaanites (Deu_7:2; Deu_7:16). In the former case the Psalm was not
          the ebullition of personal anger, but the expression of judicial
          indignation against the enemies of God. We must distinguish the
          substance from the form. The substance was the denunciation of God’s
          righteous judgments; the form was taken from the ordinary customs of
          war in the Psalmist’s time. See Park, in Bib. Sac., 1862:165; Cowles,
          Com. on Psa_137:1-9; Perowne on Psalms, Introd., 61; Presb. and Ref.
          Rev., 1897:490–505; cf. 2Ti_4:14—“the Lord will render to him
          according to his works” = a prophecy, not a curse, ἀποδώσει, not
          ἀποδὠη, as in A. V. In the latter case, an exterminating war was only
          the benevolent surgery that amputated the putrid limb, and so saved
          the religious life of the Hebrew nation and of the after-world. See
          Dr. Thomas Arnold, Essay on the Right Interpretation of Scripture;
          Fisher, Beginnings of Christianity, 11–24.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interpretation of these events has been proposed, which would
          make them illustrations of the principle indicated in (c) above: E. G.
          Robinson, Christian Theology, 45—“It was not the imprecations of the
          Psalm that were inspired of God, but his purposes and ideas of which
          these were by the times the necessary vehicle; just as the adultery of
          David was not by divine command, though through it the purpose of God
          as to Christ’s descent was accomplished.” John Watson (Ian Maclaren),
          Cure of Souls, 143—“When the massacre of the Canaanites and certain
          proceedings of David are flung in the face of Christians, it is no
          longer necessary to fall back on evasious or special pleading. It can
          now be frankly admitted that, from our standpoint in this year of
          grace, such deeds were atrocious, and that they never could have been
          according to the mind of God, but that they must be judged by their
          date, and considered the defects of elementary moral processes. The
          Bible is vindicated, because it is, on the whole, a steady ascent, and
          because it culminates in Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lyman Abbott, Theology of an Evolutionist, 56—“Abraham mistook the
          voice of conscience, calling on him to consecrate his only son to God,
          and interpreted it as a command to slay his son as a burnt offering.
          Israel misinterpreted his righteous indignation at the cruel and
          lustful rites of the Canaanitish religion as a divine summons to
          destroy the worship by putting the worshipers to death; a people
          undeveloped in moral judgment could not distinguish between formal
          regulations respecting camp-life and eternal principles of
          righteousness, such as, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, but
          embodied them in the same code, and seemed to regard them as of equal
          authority.” Wilkinson, Epic of Paul, 281—“If so be such man, so placed
          … did in some part That utterance make his own, profaning it, To be
          his vehicle for sense not meant By the august supreme inspiring
          Will”—i. e., putting some of his own sinful anger into God’s calm
          predictions of judgment. Compare the stern last words of “Zechariah,
          the son of Jehoiada, the priest” when stoned to death in the temple
          court: “Jehovah look upon it and require it” (2Ch_24:20-22), with the
          last words of Jesus: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what
          they do” (Luk_23:34) and of Stephen: “Lord, lay not this sin to their
          charge” (Act_7:60).
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) Other apparent immoralities are due to unwarranted
          interpretations. Symbol is sometimes taken for literal fact; the
          language of irony is understood as sober affirmation; the glow and
          freedom of Oriental description are judged by the unimpassioncd style
          of Western literature; appeal to lower motives is taken to exclude,
          instead of preparing for, the higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Hos_1:2-3, the command to the prophet to marry a harlot was
          probably received and executed in vision, and was intended only as
          symbolic: compare Jer_25:15-18—“Take this cup.…and cause all the
          nations.…to drink.” Literal obedience would have made the prophet
          contemptible to those whom he would instruct, and would require so
          long a time as to weaken, if not destroy, the designed effect; see
          Ann. Par. Bible, in loco. In 2Ki_6:19, Elisha’s deception, so called,
          was probably only ironical and benevolent; the enemy dared not resist,
          because they were completely in his power. In the Song of Solomon, we
          have, as Jewish writers have always held, a highly-wrought dramatic
          description of the union between Jehovah and his people, which we must
          judge by Eastern and not by Western literary standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Francis W. Newman, in his Phases of Faith, accused even the New
          Testament of presenting low motives for human obedience. It is true
          that all right motives are appealed to, and some of these motives are
          of a higher sort than are others. Hope of heaven and fear of hell are
          not the highest motives, but they may be employed as preliminary
          incitements to action, even though only love for God and for holiness
          will ensure salvation. Such motives are urged both by Christ and by
          his apostles: Mat_6:20—“lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven”;
          Mat_10:28—“fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
          hell”; Jud_1:23—“some save with fear, snatching them out of the fire.”
          In this respect the N. T. does not differ from the O. T. George Adam
          Smith has pointed out that the royalists got their texts, “the powers
          that be” (Rom_13:1) and “the king as supreme” (1Pe_2:13), from the N.
          T., while the O. T. furnished texts for the defenders of liberty.
          While the O. T. deals with national life, and the discharge of social
          and political functions, the N. T. deals in the main with individuals
          and with their relations to God. On the whole subject, see Hessey,
          Moral Difficulties of the Bible; Jellett, Moral Difficulties of the O.
          T.; Faith and Free Thought (Lect. by Christ. Ev. Soc), 2:173; Rogers,
          Eclipse of Faith; Butler, Analogy, part ii, chap, iii; Orr, Problem of
          the O. T., 465–483.
