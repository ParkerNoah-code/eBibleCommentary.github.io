        <p>7. Certain books unworthy of a place in inspired Scripture.</p>
        <p>
          (a) This charge may be shown, in each single case, to rest upon a
          misapprehension of the aim and method of the book, and its connection
          with the remainder of the Bible, together with a narrowness of nature
          or of doctrinal view, which prevents the critic from appreciating the
          wants of the peculiar class of men to which the book is especially
          serviceable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luther called James “a right strawy epistle.” His constant pondering
          of the doctrine of justification by faith alone made it difficult for
          him to grasp the complementary truth that we are justified only by
          such faith as brings forth good works, or to perceive the essential
          agreement of James and Paul. Prof. R. E. Thompson, in S. S. Times,
          Dec. 3, 1898:803, 804—“Luther refused canonical authority to books not
          actually written by apostles or composed (as Mark and Luke) under
          their direction. So he rejected from the rank of canonical authority
          Hebrews, James, Jude, 2 Peter, Revelation. Even Calvin doubted the
          Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, excluded the book of Revelation from
          the Scripture on which he wrote Commentaries, and also thus ignored 2
          and 3 John.” G. P. Fisher in S. S. Times, Aug. 29, 1891—“Luther, in
          his preface to the N. T. (Edition of 1522), gives a list of what he
          considers as the principal books of the N. T. These are John’s Gospel
          and First Epistle, Paul’s Epistles, especially Romans and Galatians,
          and Peter’s First Epistle. Then he adds that ‘St. James’ Epistle is a
          right strawy Epistle compared with them’—‘ein recht strohern Epistel
          gegen sie,’ thus characterizing it not absolutely but only
          relatively.” Zwingle even said of the Apocalypse: “It is not a
          Biblical book.” So Thomas Arnold, with his exaggerated love for
          historical accuracy and definite outline, found the Oriental imagery
          and sweeping visions of the book of Revelation so bizarre and
          distasteful that he doubted their divine authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The testimony of church history and general Christian experience
          to the profitableness and divinity of the disputed books is of greater
          weight than the personal impressions of the few who criticize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instance the testimonies of the ages of persecution to the worth of
          the prophecies, which assure God’s people that his cause shall surely
          triumph. Denney, Studies in Theology, 226—“It is at least as likely
          that the individual should be insensible to the divine message in a
          book, as that the church should have judged it to contain such a
          message if it did not do so.” Milton, Areopagitica: “The Bible brings
          in holiest men passionately murmering against Providence through all
          the arguments of Epicurus.” Bruce, Apologetics, 329—“O. T. religion
          was querulous, vindictive, philolevitical, hostile toward foreigners,
          morbidly self-conscious, and tending to self-righteousness.
          Ecclesiastes shows us how we ought not to feel. To go about crying
          Vanitas! is to miss the lesson it was meant to teach, namely, that the
          Old Covenant was vanity—proved to be vanity by allowing a son of the
          Covenant to get into so despairing a mood.” Chadwick says that
          Ecclesiastes got into the Canon only after it had received an orthodox
          postscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:193—“Slavish fear and self-righteous
          reckoning with God are the unlovely features of this Jewish religion
          of law to which the ethical idealism of the prophets had degenerated,
          and these traits strike us most visibly in Pharsiaism.…It was this
          side of the O. T. religion to which Christianity took a critical and
          destroying attitude, while it revealed a new and higher knowledge of
          God. For, says Paul, ‘ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto
          fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption’ (Rom_8:15). In unity
          with God man does not lose his soul but preserves it. God not only
          commands but gives.” Ian Maclaren (John Watson), Cure of Souls,
          144—“When the book of Ecclesiastes is referred to the days of the
          third century b.c., then its note is caught, and any man who has been
          wronged and embittered by political tyranny and social corruption has
          his bitter cry included in the book of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Such testimony can be adduced in favor of the value of each one of
          the books to which exception is taken, such as Esther, Job, Song of
          Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Jonah, James, Revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Esther is the book, next to the Pentateuch, held in highest reverence
          by the Jews. “Job was the discoverer of infinity, and the first to see
          the bearing of infinity on righteousness. It was the return of
          religion to nature. Job heard the voice beyond the Sinai-voice”
          (Shadow-Cross, 89). Inge, Christian Mysticism, 43—“As to the Song of
          Solomon, its influence upon Christian Mysticism has been simply
          deplorable. A graceful romance in honor of true love has been
          distorted into a precedent and sanction for giving way to hysterical
          emotions in which sexual imagery has been freely used to symbolize the
          relation between the soul and its Lord.” Chadwick says that the Song
          of Solomon got into the Canon only after it had received an
          allegorical interpretation. Gladden, Seven Puzzling Bible Books, 165,
          thinks it impossible that “the addition of one more inmate to the
          harem of that royal rake, King Solomon, should have been made the type
          of the spiritual affection between Christ and his church. Instead of
          this, the book is a glorification of pure love. The Shulamite,
          transported to the court of Solomon, remains faithful to her shepherd
          lover, and is restored to him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bruce, Apologetics, 321—“The Song of Solomon, literally interpreted as
          a story of true love, proof against the blandishments of the royal
          harem, is rightfully in the Canon as a buttress to the true religion;
          for whatever made for purity in the relations of the sexes made for
          the worship of Jehovah—Baal worship and impurity being closely
          associated.” Rutherford, McCheyne, and Spurgeon have taken more texts
          from the Song of Solomon than from any other portion of Scripture of
          like extent. Charles G. Finney, Autobiography, 378—“At this time it
          seemed as if my soul was wedded to Christ in a sense which I never had
          any thought or conception of before. The language of the Song of
          Solomon was as natural to me as my breath. I thought I could
          understand well the state he was in when he wrote that Song, and
          concluded then, as I have ever thought since, that that Song was
          written by him after he had been reclaimed from his great backsliding.
          I not only had all the fulness of my first love, but a vast accession
          to it. Indeed, the Lord lifted me up so much above anything that I had
          experienced before, and taught me so much of the meaning of the Bible,
          of Christ’s relations and power and willingness, that I found myself
          saying to him: I had not known or conceived that any such thing was
          true.” On Jonah, see R. W. Dale, in Expositor, July, 1892, advocating
          the non-historical and allegorical character of the book. Bib. Sac.,
          10:737–764—“Jonah represents the nation of Israel as emerging through
          a miracle from the exile, in order to carry out its mission to the
          world at large. It teaches that God is the God of the whole earth;
          that the Ninevites as well as the Israelites are dear to him; that his
          threatenings of penalty are conditional.”
