        <h2>II. Divisions of Theology.</h2>
        <p>
          Theology is commonly divided into Biblical, Historical, Systematic,
          and Practical.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Biblical Theology aims to arrange and classify the facts of
          revelation, confining itself to the Scriptures for its material, and
          treating of doctrine only so far as it was developed at the close of
          the apostolic age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instance DeWette, Biblische Theologie; Hofmann, Schriftbeweis;
          Nitzsch, System of Christian Doctrine. The last, however, has more of
          the philosophical element than properly belongs to Biblical Theology.
          The third volume of Ritschl&#x27;s Justification and Reconciliation is
          intended as a system of Biblical Theology, the first and second
          volumes being little more than an historical introduction. But
          metaphysics, of a Kantian relativity and phenomenalism, enter so
          largely into Ritschl&#x27;s estimates and interpretations, as to
          render his conclusions both partial and rationalistic. Notice a
          questionable use of the term Biblical Theology to designate the
          theology of a part of Scripture severed from the rest, as
          Steudel&#x27;s Biblical Theology of the Old Testament; Schmidt&#x27;s
          Biblical Theology of the New Testament; and in the common phrases:
          Biblical Theology of Christ, or of Paul. These phrases are
          objectionable as intimating that the books of Scripture have only a
          human origin. Upon the assumption that there is no common divine
          authorship of Scripture, Biblical Theology is conceived of as a series
          of fragments, corresponding to the differing teachings of the various
          prophets and apostles, and the theology of Paul is held to be an
          unwarranted and incongruous addition to the theology of Jesus. See
          Reuss, History of Christian Theology in the Apostolic Age.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Historical Theology traces the development of the Biblical
          doctrines from the time of the apostles to the present day, and gives
          account of the results of this development in the life of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          By doctrinal development we mean the progressive unfolding and
          apprehension, by the church, of the truth explicitly or implicitly
          contained in Scripture. As giving account of the shaping of the
          Christian faith into doctrinal statements, Historical Theology is
          called the History of Doctrine. As describing the resulting and
          accompanying changes in the life of the church, outward and inward,
          Historical Theology is called Church History. Instance
          Cunningham&#x27;s Historical Theology; Hagenbach&#x27;s and
          Shedd&#x27;s Histories of Doctrine; Neander&#x27;s Church History.
          There is always a danger that the historian will see his own views too
          clearly reflected in the history of the church. Shedd&#x27;s History
          of Christian Doctrine has been called “The History of Dr. Shedd&#x27;s
          Christian Doctrine.” But if Dr. Shedd&#x27;s Augustinianism colors his
          History, Dr. Sheldon&#x27;s Arminianism also colors his. G. P.
          Fisher&#x27;s History of Christian Doctrine is unusually lucid and
          impartial. See Neander&#x27;s Introduction and Shedd&#x27;s Philosophy
          of History.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Systematic Theology takes the material furnished by Biblical and by
          Historical Theology, and with this material seeks to build up into an
          organic and consistent whole all our knowledge of God and of the
          relations between God and the universe, whether this knowledge be
          originally derived from nature or from the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Systematic Theology is therefore theology proper, of which Biblical
          and Historical Theology are the incomplete and preparatory stages.
          Systematic Theology is to be clearly distinguished from Dogmatic
          Theology. Dogmatic Theology is, in strict usage, the systematizing of
          the doctrines as expressed in the symbols of the church, together with
          the grounding of these in the Scriptures, and the exhibition, so far
          as may be, of their rational necessity. Systematic Theology begins, on
          the other hand, not with the symbols, but with the Scriptures. It asks
          first, not what the church has believed, but what is the truth of
          God&#x27;s revealed word. It examines that word with all the aids
          which nature and the Spirit have given it, using Biblical and
          Historical Theology as its servants and helpers, but not as its
          masters. Notice here the technical use of the word “symbol,” from
          συμβάλλω, = a brief throwing together, or condensed statement of the
          essentials of Christian doctrine. Synonyms are: Confession, creed,
          consensus, declaration, formulary, canons, articles of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dogmatism argues to foregone conclusions. The word is not, however,
          derived from “dog,” as Douglas Jerrold facetiously suggested, when he
          said that “dogmatism is puppyism full grown,” but from δοκέω to think,
          to opine. Dogmatic Theology has two principles: (1) The absolute
          authority of creeds, as decisions of the church: (2) The application
          to these creeds of formal logic, for the purpose of demonstrating
          their truth to the understanding. In the Roman Catholic Church, not
          the Scripture but the church, and the dogma given by it, is the
          decisive authority. The Protestant principle, on the contrary, is that
          Scripture decides, and that dogma is to be judged by it. Following
          Schleiermacher, Al. Schweizer thinks that the term “Dogmatik”should be
          discarded as essentially unprotestant, and that “Glaubenslehre” should
          take its place; and Harnack, Hist. Dogma, 6, remarks that “dogma has
          ever, in the progress of history, devoured its own progenitors.” While
          it is true that every new and advanced thinker in theology has been
          counted a heretic, there has always been a common faith—“the faith
          which was once for all delivered unto the saints” (Jude 3)—and the
          study of Systematic Theology has been one of the chief means of
          preserving this faith in the world. Mat. 15:13, 14—“Every plant which
          my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. Let them alone:
          they are blind guides” = there is truth planted by God, and it has
          permanent divine life. Human errors have no permanent vitality and
          they perish of themselves. See Kaftan, Dogmatik, 2, 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Practical Theology is the system of truth considered as a means of
          renewing and sanctifying men, or, in other words, theology in its
          publication and enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this department of theology belong Homiletics and Pastoral
          Theology, since these are but scientific presentations of the right
          methods of unfolding Christian truth, and of bringing it to bear upon
          men individually and in the church. See Van Oosterzee, Practical
          Theology; T. Harwood Pattison, The Making of the Sermon, and Public
          Prayer; Yale Lectures on Preaching by H. W. Beecher, R. W. Dale,
          Phillips Brooks, E. G. Robinson, A. J. F. Behrends, John Watson, and
          others; and the work on Pastoral Theology, by Harvey.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sometimes asserted that there are other departments of theology
          not included in those above mentioned. But most of these, if not all,
          belong to other spheres of research, and cannot properly be classed
          under theology at all. Moral Theology, so called, or the science of
          Christian morals, ethics, or theological ethics, is indeed the proper
          result of theology, but is not to be confounded with it. Speculative
          theology, so called, respecting, as it does, such truth as is mere
          matter of opinion, is either extra-scriptural, and so belongs to the
          province of the philosophy of religion, or is an attempt to explain
          truth already revealed, and so falls within the province of Systematic
          Theology. “Speculative theology starts from certain a priori
          principles, and from them undertakes to determine what is and must be.
          It deduces its scheme of doctrine from the laws of mind or from axioms
          supposed to be inwrought into its constitution.” Bib. Sac.,
          1852:376—“Speculative theology tries to show that the dogmas agree
          with the laws of thought, while the philosophy of religion tries to
          show that the laws of thought agree with the dogmas.” Theological
          Encyclopædia (the word signifies “instruction in a circle”) is a
          general introduction to all the divisions of Theology, together with
          an account of the relations between them. Hegel&#x27;s Encyclopædia
          was an attempted exhibition of the principles and connections of all
          the sciences. See Crooks and Hurst, Theological Encyclopædia and
          Methodology; Zöckler, Handb. der theol. Wissenschaften, 2:606-769.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relations of theology to science and philosophy have been
          variously stated, but by none better than by H. B. Smith, Faith and
          Philosophy, 18—“Philosophy is a mode of human knowledge—not the whole
          of that knowledge, but a mode of it—the knowing of things rationally.”
          Science asks: “What do I know?” Philosophy asks: “What can I know?”
          William James, Psychology, 1:145—“Metaphysics means nothing but an
          unusually obstinate effort to think clearly.” Aristotle: “The
          particular sciences are toiling workmen, while philosophy is the
          architect. The workmen are slaves, existing for the free master. So
          philosophy rules the sciences.” With regard to philosophy and science
          Lord Bacon remarks: “Those who have handled knowledge have been too
          much either men of mere observation or abstract reasoners. The former
          are like the ant: they only collect material and put it to immediate
          use. The abstract reasoners are like spiders, who make cobwebs out of
          their own substance. But the bee takes a middle course: it gathers its
          material from the flowers of the garden and the field, while it
          transforms and digests what it gathers by a power of its own. Not
          unlike this is the work of the philosopher.” Novalis: “Philosophy can
          bake no bread; but it can give us God, freedom and immortality.” Prof.
          DeWitt of Princeton: “Science, philosophy, and theology are the three
          great modes of organizing the universe into an intellectual system.
          Science never goes below second causes; if it does, it is no longer
          science,—it becomes philosophy. Philosophy views the universe as a
          unity, and the goal it is always seeking to reach is the source and
          centre of this unity—the Absolute, the First Cause. This goal of
          philosophy is the point of departure for theology. What philosophy is
          striving to find, theology asserts has been found. Theology therefore
          starts with the Absolute, the First Cause.” W. N. Clarke, Christian
          Theology, 48—“Science examines and classifies facts; philosophy
          inquires concerning spiritual meanings. Science seeks to know the
          universe; philosophy to understand it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 7—“Natural science has for its subject
          matter things and events. Philosophy is the systematic exhibition of
          the grounds of our knowledge. Metaphysics is our knowledge respecting
          realities which are not phenomenal, e. g., God and the soul.” Knight,
          Essays in Philosophy, 81—“The aim of the sciences is increase of
          knowledge, by the discovery of laws within which all phenomena may be
          embraced and by means of which they may be explained. The aim of
          philosophy, on the other hand, is to explain the sciences, by at once
          including and transcending them. Its sphere is substance and essence.”
          Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge, 3-5—“Philosophy = doctrine of
          knowledge (is mind passive or active in knowing?—Epistemology) +
          doctrine of being (is fundamental being mechanical and unintelligent,
          or purposive and intelligent?—Metaphysics). The systems of Locke,
          Hume, and Kant are preëminently theories of knowing; the systems of
          Spinoza and Leibnitz are preëminently theories of being. Historically
          theories of being come first, because the object is the only
          determinant for reflective thought. But the instrument of philosophy
          is thought itself. First then, we must study Logic, or the theory of
          thought; secondly, Epistemology, or the theory of knowledge; thirdly,
          Metaphysics, or the theory of being.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Professor George M. Forbes on the New Psychology: “Locke and Kant
          represent the two tendencies in philosophy—the empirical, physical,
          scientific, on the one hand, and the rational, metaphysical, logical,
          on the other. Locke furnishes the basis for the associational schemes
          of Hartley, the Mills, and Bain; Kant for the idealistic scheme of
          Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. The two are not contradictory, but
          complementary, and the Scotch Reid and Hamilton combine them both,
          reacting against the extreme empiricism and scepticism of Hume.
          Hickok, Porter, and McCosh represented the Scotch school in America.
          It was exclusively analytical; its psychology was the
          faculty-psychology; it represented the mind as a bundle of faculties.
          The unitary philosophy of T. H. Green, Edward Caird, in Great Britain,
          and in America, of W. T. Harris, George S. Morris, and John Dewey, was
          a reaction against this faculty-psychology, under the influence of
          Hegel. A second reaction under the influence of the Herbartian
          doctrine of apperception substituted function for faculty, making all
          processes phases of apperception. G. F. Stout and J. Mark Baldwin
          represent this psychology. A third reaction comes from the influence
          of physical science. All attempts to unify are relegated to a
          metaphysical Hades. There is nothing but states and processes. The
          only unity is the laws of their coëxistence and succession. There is
          nothing a priori. Wundt identifies apperception with will, and regards
          it as the unitary principle. Külpe and Titchener find no self, or
          will, or soul, but treat these as inferences little warranted. Their
          psychology is psychology without a soul. The old psychology was
          exclusively static, while the new emphasizes the genetic point of
          view. Growth and development are the leading ideas of Herbert Spencer,
          Preyer, Tracy and Stanley Hall. William James is explanatory, while
          George T. Ladd is descriptive. Cattell, Scripture, and Münsterberg
          apply the methods of Fechner, and the Psychological Review is their
          organ. Their error is in their negative attitude. The old psychology
          is needed to supplement the new. It has greater scope and more
          practical significance.” On the relation of theology to philosophy and
          to science, see Luthardt, Compend. der Dogmatik, 4; Hagenbach,
          Encyclopädie, 109.
