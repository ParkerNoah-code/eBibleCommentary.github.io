        <h2>Chapter I. Origin Of Our Idea Of God&#x27;s Existence.</h2>
        <p>
          God is the infinite and perfect Spirit in whom all things have their
          source, support, and end.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the definition of the term God, see Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:366.
          Other definitions are those of Calovius: “Essentia spiritualis
          infinite”; Ebrard: “The eternal source of all that is temporal”;
          Kahnis: “The infinite Spirit”; John Howe: “An eternal, uncaused,
          independent, necessary Being, that hath active power, life, wisdom,
          goodness, and whatsoever other supposable excellency, in the highest
          perfection, in and of itself”; Westminster Catechism: “A Spirit
          infinite, eternal and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power,
          holiness, justice, goodness and truth”; Andrew Fuller: “The first
          cause and last end of all things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The existence of God is a first truth; in other words, the knowledge
          of God&#x27;s existence is a rational intuition. Logically, it
          precedes and conditions all observation and reasoning.
          Chronologically, only reflection upon the phenomena of nature and of
          mind occasions its rise in consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term intuition means simply direct knowledge. Lowndes (Philos. of
          Primary Beliefs, 78) and Mansel (Metaphysics, 52) would use the term
          only of our direct knowledge of substances, as self and body; Porter
          applies it by preference to our cognition of first truths, such as
          have been already mentioned. Harris (Philos. Basis of Theism, 44-151,
          but esp. 45, 46) makes it include both. He divides intuitions into two
          classes: 1. Presentative intuitions, as self-consciousness (in virtue
          of which I perceive the existence of spirit and already come in
          contact with the supernatural), and sense-perception (in virtue of
          which I perceive the existence of matter, at least in my own organism,
          and come in contact with nature); 2. Rational intuitions, as space,
          time, substance, cause, final cause, right, absolute being. We may
          accept this nomenclature, using the terms “first truths” and “rational
          intuitions” as equivalent to each other, and classifying rational
          intuitions under the heads of (1) intuitions of relations, as space
          and time; (2) intuitions of principles, as substance, cause, final
          cause, right; and (3) intuition of absolute Being, Power, Reason,
          Perfection, Personality, as God. We hold that, as upon occasion of the
          senses cognizing (a) extended matter, (b) succession, (c) qualities,
          (d) change, (e) order, (f) action, respectively, the mind cognizes (a)
          space, (b) time, (c) substance, (d) cause, (e) design, (f) obligation,
          so upon occasion of our cognizing our finiteness, dependence and
          responsibility, the mind directly cognizes the existence of an
          Infinite and Absolute Authority, Perfection, Personality, upon whom we
          are dependent and to whom we are responsible.

          Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge, 60—“As we walk in entire
          ignorance of our muscles, so we often think in entire ignorance of the
          principles which underlie and determine thinking. But as anatomy
          reveals that the apparently simple act of walking involves a highly
          complex muscular activity, so analysis reveals that the apparently
          simple act of thinking involves a system of mental principles.” Dewey,
          Psychology, 238, 244—“Perception, memory, imagination, conception—each
          of these is an act of intuition.... Every concrete act of knowledge
          involves an intuition of God.” Martineau, Types, 1:459—The attempt to
          divest experience of either percepts or intuitions is “like the
          attempt to peel a bubble in search for its colors and contents: in
          tenuem ex oculis evanuit auram”; Study, 1:199—“Try with all your might
          to do something difficult, e. g., to shut a door against a furious
          wind, and you recognize Self and Nature—causal will, over against
          external causality”; 201—“Hence our fellow-feeling with Nature”;
          65—“As Perception gives us Will in the shape of Causality over against
          us in the non-ego, so Conscience gives us Will in the shape of
          Authority over against us in the non-ego”; Types, 2:5—“In perception
          it is self and nature, in morals it is self and God, that stand face
          to face in the subjective and objective antithesis”; Study, 2:2, 3—“In
          volitional experience we meet with objective causality; in moral
          experience we meet with objective authority,—both being objects of
          immediate knowledge, on the same footing of certainty with the
          apprehension of the external material world. I know of no logical
          advantage which the belief in finite objects around us can boast over
          the belief in the infinite and righteous Cause of all”; 51—“In
          recognition of God as Cause, we raise the University; in recognition
          of God as Authority, we raise the Church.”

          Kant declares that the idea of freedom is the source of our idea of
          personality,—personality consists in the freedom of the whole soul
          from the mechanism of nature. Lotze, Metaphysics, § 244—“So far as,
          and so long as, the soul knows itself as the identical subject of
          inward experience, it is, and is named simply for that reason,
          substance.”Illingworth, Personality, Human and Divine, 32—“Our
          conception of substance is derived, not from the physical, but from
          the mental world. Substance is first of all that which underlies our
          mental affections and manifestations.” James, Will to Believe,
          80—“Substance, as Kant says, means ‘das Beharrliche,’ the abiding,
          that which will be as it has been, because its being is essential and
          eternal.” In this sense we have an intuitive belief in an abiding
          substance which underlies our own thoughts and volitions, and this we
          call the soul. But we also have an intuitive belief in an abiding
          substance which underlies all natural phenomena and all the events of
          history, and this we call God. Among those who hold to this general
          view of an intuitive knowledge of God may be mentioned the
