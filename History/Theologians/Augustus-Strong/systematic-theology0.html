        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
          The present work is a revision and enlargement of my “Systematic
          Theology,” first published in 1886. Of the original work there have
          been printed seven editions, each edition embodying successive
          corrections and supposed improvements. During the twenty years which
          have intervened since its first publication I have accumulated much
          new material, which I now offer to the reader. My philosophical and
          critical point of view meantime has also somewhat changed. While I
          still hold to the old doctrines, I interpret them differently and
          expound them more clearly, because I seem to myself to have reached a
          fundamental truth which throws new light upon them all. This truth I
          have tried to set forth in my book entitled “Christ in Creation,” and
          to that book I refer the reader for further information.
        </p>
        <p>
          That Christ is the one and only Revealer of God, in nature, in
          humanity, in history, in science, in Scripture, is in my judgment the
          key to theology. This view implies a monistic and idealistic
          conception of the world, together with an evolutionary idea as to its
          origin and progress. But it is the very antidote to pantheism, in that
          it recognizes evolution as only the method of the transcendent and
          personal Christ, who fills all in all, and who makes the universe
          teleological and moral from its centre to its circumference and from
          its beginning until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither evolution nor the higher criticism has any terrors to one who
          regards them as parts of Christ&#x27;s creating and educating process.
          The Christ in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
          himself furnishes all the needed safeguards and limitations. It is
          only because Christ has been forgotten that nature and law have been
          personified, that history has been regarded as unpurposed development,
          that Judaism has been referred to a merely human origin, that Paul has
          been thought to have switched the church off from its proper track
          even before it had gotten fairly started on its course, that
          superstition and illusion have come to seem the only foundation for
          the sacrifices of the martyrs and the triumphs of modern missions. I
          believe in no such irrational and atheistic evolution as this. I
          believe rather in him in whom all things consist, who is with his
          people even to the end of the world, and who has promised to lead them
          into all the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophy and science are good servants of Christ, but they are poor
          guides when they rule out the Son of God. As I reach my seventieth
          year and write these words on my birthday, I am thankful for that
          personal experience of union with Christ which has enabled me to see
          in science and philosophy the teaching of my Lord. But this same
          personal experience has made me even more alive to Christ&#x27;s
          teaching in Scripture, has made me recognize in Paul and John a truth
          profounder than that disclosed by any secular writers, truth with
          regard to sin and atonement for sin, that satisfies the deepest wants
          of my nature and that is self-evidencing and divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am distressed by some common theological tendencies of our time,
          because I believe them to be false to both science and religion. How
          men who have ever felt themselves to be lost sinners and who have once
          received pardon from their crucified Lord and Savior can thereafter
          seek to pare down his attributes, deny his deity and atonement, tear
          from his brow the crown of miracle and sovereignty, relegate him to
          the place of a merely moral teacher who influences us only as does
          Socrates by words spoken across a stretch of ages, passes my
          comprehension. Here is my test of orthodoxy: Do we pray to Jesus? Do
          we call upon the name of Christ, as did Stephen and all the early
          church? Is he our living Lord, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent? Is
          he divine only in the sense in which we are divine, or is he the
          only-begotten Son, God manifest in the flesh, in whom is all the
          fulness of the Godhead bodily? What think ye of the Christ? is still
          the critical question, and none are entitled to the name of Christian
          who, in the face of the evidence he has furnished us, cannot answer
          the question aright.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the influence of Ritschl and his Kantian relativism, many of our
          teachers and preachers have swung off into a practical denial of
          Christ&#x27;s deity and of his atonement. We seem upon the verge of a
          second Unitarian defection, that will break up churches and compel
          secessions, in a worse manner than did that of Channing and Ware a
          century ago. American Christianity recovered from that disaster only
          by vigorously asserting the authority of Christ and the inspiration of
          the Scriptures. We need a new vision of the Savior like that which
          Paul saw on the way to Damascus and John saw on the isle of Patmos, to
          convince us that Jesus is lifted above space and time, that his
          existence antedated creation, that he conducted the march of Hebrew
          history, that he was born of a virgin, suffered on the cross, rose
          from the dead, and now lives forevermore, the Lord of the universe,
          the only God with whom we have to do, our Savior here and our Judge
          hereafter. Without a revival of this faith our churches will become
          secularized, mission enterprise will die out, and the candlestick will
          be removed out of its place as it was with the seven churches of Asia,
          and as it has been with the apostate churches of New England.
        </p>
        <p>
          I print this revised and enlarged edition of my “Systematic Theology,”
          in the hope that its publication may do something to stem this fast
          advancing tide, and to confirm the faith of God&#x27;s elect. I make
          no doubt that the vast majority of Christians still hold the faith
          that was once for all delivered to the saints, and that they will
          sooner or later separate themselves from those who deny the Lord who
          bought them. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the
          Lord will raise up a standard against him. I would do my part in
          raising up such a standard. I would lead others to avow anew, as I do
          now, in spite of the supercilious assumptions of modern infidelity, my
          firm belief, only confirmed by the experience and reflection of a
          half-century, in the old doctrines of holiness as the fundamental
          attribute of God, of an original transgression and sin of the whole
          human race, in a divine preparation in Hebrew history for man&#x27;s
          redemption, in the deity, preëxistence, virgin birth, vicarious
          atonement and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord, and in his
          future coming to judge the quick and the dead. I believe that these
          are truths of science as well as truths of revelation; that the
          supernatural will yet be seen to be most truly natural; and that not
          the open-minded theologian but the narrow-minded scientist will be
          obliged to hide his head at Christ&#x27;s coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The present volume, in its treatment of Ethical Monism, Inspiration,
          the Attributes of God, and the Trinity, contains an antidote to most
          of the false doctrine which now threatens the safety of the church. I
          desire especially to call attention to the section on Perfection, and
          the Attributes therein involved, because I believe that the recent
          merging of Holiness in Love, and the practical denial that
          Righteousness is fundamental in God&#x27;s nature, are responsible for
          the utilitarian views of law and the superficial views of sin which
          now prevail in some systems of theology. There can be no proper
          doctrine of the atonement and no proper doctrine of retribution, so
          long as Holiness is refused its preëminence. Love must have a norm or
          standard, and this norm or standard can be found only in Holiness. The
          old conviction of sin and the sense of guilt that drove the convicted
          sinner to the cross are inseparable from a firm belief in the
          self-affirming attribute of God as logically prior to and as
          conditioning the self-communicating attribute. The theology of our day
          needs a new view of the Righteous One. Such a view will make it plain
          that God must be reconciled before man can be saved, and that the
          human conscience can be pacified only upon condition that propitiation
          is made to the divine Righteousness. In this volume I propound what I
          regard as the true Doctrine of God, because upon it will be based all
          that follows in the volumes on the Doctrine of Man, and the Doctrine
          of Salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The universal presence of Christ, the Light that lighteth every man,
          in heathen as well as in Christian lands, to direct or overrule all
          movements of the human mind, gives me confidence that the recent
          attacks upon the Christian faith will fail of their purpose. It
          becomes evident at last that not only the outworks are assaulted, but
          the very citadel itself. We are asked to give up all belief in special
          revelation. Jesus Christ, it is said, has come in the flesh precisely
          as each one of us has come, and he was before Abraham only in the same
          sense that we were. Christian experience knows how to characterize
          such doctrine so soon as it is clearly stated. And the new theology
          will be of use in enabling even ordinary believers to recognize
          soul-destroying heresy even under the mask of professed orthodoxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make no apology for the homiletical element in my book. To be either
          true or useful, theology must be a passion. Pectus est quod theologum
          facit, and no disdainful cries of “Pectoral Theology!” shall prevent
          me from maintaining that the eyes of the heart must be enlightened in
          order to perceive the truth of God, and that to know the truth it is
          needful to do the truth. Theology is a science which can be
          successfully cultivated only in connection with its practical
          application. I would therefore, in every discussion of its principles,
          point out its relations to Christian experience, and its power to
          awaken Christian emotions and lead to Christian decisions. Abstract
          theology is not really scientific. Only that theology is scientific
          which brings the student to the feet of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would hasten the day when in the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.
          I believe that, if any man serve Christ, him the Father will honor,
          and that to serve Christ means to honor him as I honor the Father. I
          would not pride myself that I believe so little, but rather that I
          believe so much. Faith is God&#x27;s measure of a man. Why should I
          doubt that God spoke to the fathers through the prophets? Why should I
          think it incredible that God should raise the dead? The things that
          are impossible with men are possible with God. When the Son of man
          comes, shall he find faith on the earth? Let him at least find faith
          in us who profess to be his followers. In the conviction that the
          present darkness is but temporary and that it will be banished by a
          glorious sunrising, I give this new edition of my “Theology” to the
          public with the prayer that whatever of good seed is in it may bring
          forth fruit, and that whatever plant the heavenly Father has not
          planted may be rooted up.
