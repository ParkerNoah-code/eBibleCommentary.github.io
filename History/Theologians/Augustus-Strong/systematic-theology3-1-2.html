        <h2>II. Marks of the Revelation man may expect</h2>
        <p>
          1. As to its substance. We may expect this later revelation not to
          contradict, but to confirm and enlarge, the knowledge of God which we
          derive from nature, while it remedies the defects of natural religion
          and throws light upon its problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaiah’s appeal is to God’s previous communications of truth:
          Isa_8:20—“To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according
          to this word, surely there is no morning for them.” And Malachi
          follows the example of Isaiah; Mal_4:4—“Remember ye the law of Moses
          my servant.” Our Lord himself based his claims upon the former
          utterances of God: Luk_24:27—“beginning from Moses and from all the
          prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things
          concerning himself.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As to its method. We may expect it to follow God’s methods of
          procedure in other communications of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishop Butler (Analogy, part ii, chap. iii) has denied that there is
          any possibility of judging a priori how a divine revelation will be
          given. “We are in no sort judges beforehand,” he says, “by what
          methods, or in what proportion, it were to be expected that this
          supernatural light and instruction would be afforded us.” But Bishop
          Butler somewhat later in his great work (part ii, chap. iv) shows that
          God’s progressive plan in revelation has its analogy in the slow,
          successive steps by which God accomplishes his ends in nature. We
          maintain that the revelation in nature affords certain presumptions
          with regard to the revelation of grace, such for example as those
          mentioned below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leslie Stephen, in Nineteenth Century, Feb. 1891:180—“Butler answered
          the argument of the deists, that the God of Christianity was unjust,
          by arguing that the God of nature was equally unjust. James Mill,
          admitting the analogy, refused to believe in either God. Dr. Martineau
          has said, for similar reasons, that Butler ‘wrote one of the most
          terrible persuasives to atheism ever produced.’ So J. H. Newman’s
          ‘kill or cure’s argument is essentially that God has either revealed
          nothing, or has made revelations in some other places than in the
          Bible. His argument, like Butler’s, may be as good a persuasive to
          scepticism as to belief.” To this indictment by Leslie Stephen we
          reply that it has cogency only so long as we ignore the fact of human
          sin. Granting this fact, our world becomes a world of discipline,
          probation and redemption, and both the God of nature and the God of
          Christianity are cleared from all suspicion of injustice. The analogy
          between God’s methods in the Christian system and his methods in
          nature becomes an argument in favor of the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) That of continuous historical development,—that it will be given
          in germ to early ages, and will be more fully unfolded as the race is
          prepared to receive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instances of continuous development in God’s impartations are found in
          geological history; in the growth of the sciences; in the progressive
          education of the individual and of the race. No other religion but
          Christianity shows “a steady historical progress of the vision of one
          infinite Character unfolding itself to man through a period of many
          centuries.” See sermon by Dr. Temple, on the Education of the World,
          in Essays and Reviews; Rogers, Superhuman Origin of the Bible,
          374–384; Walker, Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation. On the
          gradualness of revelation, see Fisher, Nature and Method of
          Revelation, 467–86; Arthur H. Hallam, in John Brown’s Rab and his
          Friends, 282—“Revelation is a gradual approximation of the infinite
          Being to the ways and thoughts of finite humanity.” A little fire can
          kindle a city or a world; but ten times the heat of that little fire,
          if widely diffused, would not kindle anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) That of original delivery to a single nation, and to single
          persons in that nation, that it may through them be communicated to
          mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each nation represents an idea. As the Greek had a genius for liberty
          and beauty, and the Roman a genius for organization and law, so the
          Hebrew nation had a “genius for religion” (Renan); this last, however,
          would have been useless without special divine aid and
          superintendence, as witness other productions of this same Semitic
          race, such as Bel and the Dragon, in the Old Testament Apocrypha; the
          gospels of the Apocryphal New Testament; and later still, the Talmud
          and the Koran.
        </p>
        <p>
          The O. T. Apocrypha relates that, when Daniel was thrown a second time
          into the lions’s den, an angel seized Habbakuk in Judea by the hair of
          his head and carried him with a bowl of pottage to give to Daniel for
          his dinner. There were seven lions, and Daniel was among them seven
          days and nights. Tobias starts from his father’s house to secure his
          inheritance, and his little dog goes with him. On the banks of the
          great river a great fish threatens to devour him, but he captures and
          despoils the fish. He finally returns successful to his father’s
          house, and his little dog goes in with him. In the Apocryphal Gospels,
          Jesus carries water in his mantle when his pitcher is broken; makes
          clay birds on the Sabbath, and, when rebuked, causes them to fly;
          strikes a youthful companion with death, and then curses his accusers
          with blindness; mocks his teachers, and resents control. Later Moslem
          legends declare that Mohammed caused darkness at noon; whereupon the
          moon flew to him, went seven times around the Kaäba, bowed, entered
          his right sleeve, split into two halves after slipping out at the
          left, and the two halves, after retiring to the extreme east and west,
          were reunited. These products of the Semitic race show that neither
          the influence of environment nor a native genius for religion
          furnishes an adequate explanation of our Scriptures. As the flame on
          Elijah’s altar was caused, not by the dead sticks, but by the fire
          from heaven, so only the inspiration of the Almighty can explain the
          unique revelation of the Old and New Testaments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hebrews saw God in conscience. For the most genuine expression of
          their life we “must look beneath the surface, in the soul, where
          worship and aspiration and prophetic faith come face to face with God”
          (Genung, Epic of the Inner Life, 28). But the Hebrew religion needed
          to be supplemented by the sight of God in reason, and in the beauty of
          the world. The Greeks had the love of knowledge, and the æsthetic
          sense. Butcher, Aspects of the Greek Genius, 34—“The Phœnicians taught
          the Greeks how to write, but it was the Greeks who wrote.” Aristotle
          was the beginner of science, and outside the Aryan race none but the
          Saracens ever felt the scientific impulse. But the Greek made his
          problem clear by striking all the unknown quantities out of it. Greek
          thought would never have gained universal currency and permanence if
          it had not been for Roman jurisprudence and imperialism. England has
          contributed her constitutional government, and America her manhood
          suffrage and her religious freedom. So a definite thought of God is
          incorporated in each nation, and each nation has a message to every
          other. Act_17:26—God “made of one every nation of men to dwell on all
          the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons, and
          the bounds of their habitation”; Rom_3:12—“What advantage then hath
          the Jew? … first of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of
          God.” God’s choice of the Hebrew nation, as the repository and
          communicator of religious truth, is analogous to his choice of other
          nations, as the repositories and communicators of æsthetic,
          scientific, governmental truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hegel: “No nation that has played a weighty and active part in the
          world’s history has ever issued from the simple development of a
          single race along the unmodified lines of blood-relationship. There
          must be differences, conflicts, a composition of opposed forces.” The
          conscience of the Hebrew, the thought of the Greek, the organization
          of the Latin, the personal loyalty of the Teuton, must all be united
          to form a perfect whole. “While the Greek church was orthodox, the
          Latin church was Catholic; while the Greek treated of the two wills in
          Christ, the Latin treated of the harmony of our wills with God; while
          the Latin saved through a corporation, the Teuton saved through
          personal faith.” Brereton, in Educational Review, Nov. 1901:339—“The
          problem of France is that of the religious orders; that of Germany,
          the construotion of society; that of America, capital and labor.”
          Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:183, 184—“Great ideas never come from
          the masses, but from marked individuals. These ideas, when propounded,
          however, awaken an echo in the masses, which shows that the ideas had
          been slumbering unconsciously in the souls of others.” The hour
          strikes, and a Newton appears, who interprets God’s will in nature. So
          the hour strikes, and a Moses or a Paul appears, who interprets God’s
          will in morals and religion. The few grains of wheat found in the
          clasped hand of the Egyptian mummy would have been utterly lost if one
          grain had been sown in Europe, a second in Asia, a third is Africa,
          and a fourth in America; all being planted together in a flower-pot,
          and their product in a garden-bed, and the still later fruit in a
          farmer’s field, there came at last to be a sufficient crop of new
          Mediterranean wheat to distribute to all the world. So God followed
          his ordinary method in giving religious truth first to a single nation
          and to chosen individuals in that nation, that through them it might
          be given to all mankind. See British Quarterly, Jan. 1874: art.:
          Inductive Theology.

          (c) That of preservation in written and accessible documents, handed
          down from those to whom the revelation is first communicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphabets, writing, books, are our chief dependence for the history of
          the past; all the great religions of the world are book-religions; the
          Karens expected their teachers in the new religion to bring to them a
          book. But notice that false religions have scriptures, but not
          Scripture; their sacred books lack the principle of unity which is
          furnished by divine inspiration. H. P. Smith, Biblical Scholarship and
          Inspiration, 68—“Mohammed discovered that the Scriptures of the Jews
          were the source of their religion. He called them a ‘book-people,’ and
          endeavored to construct a similar code for his disciples. In it God is
          the only speaker; all its contents are made known to the prophet by
          direct revelation; its Arabic style is perfect; its text is
          incorruptible; it is absolute authority in law, science and history.”
          The Koran is a grotesque human parody of the Bible; its exaggerated
          pretensions of divinity, indeed, are the best proof that it is of
          purely human origin. Scripture, on the other hand, makes no such
          claims for itself, but points to Christ as the sole and final
          authority. In this sense we may say with Clarke, Christian Theology,
          20—“Christianity is not a book-religion, but a lifereligion. The Bible
          does not give us Christ, but Christ gives us the Bible.” Still it is
          true that for our knowledge of Christ we are almost wholly dependent
          upon Scripture. In giving his revelation to the world, God has
          followed his ordinary method of communicating and preserving truth by
          means of written documents. Recent investigations, however, now render
          it probable that the Karen expectation of a book was the survival of
          the teaching of the Nestorian missionaries, who as early as the eighth
          century penetrated the remotest parts of Asia, and left in the wall of
          the city of Singwadu in Northwestern China a tablet as a monument of
          their labors. On book-revelation, see Rogers, Eclipse of Faith, 73–96,
          281–304.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As to its attestation. We may expect that this revelation will be
          accompanied by evidence that its author is the same being whom we have
          previously recognized as God of nature. This evidence must constitute
          (a) a manifestation of God himself; (b) in the outward as well as the
          inward world; (c) such as only God’s power or knowledge can make; and
          (d) such as cannot be counterfeited by the evil, or mistaken by the
          candid, soul. In short, we may expect God to attest by miracles and by
          prophecy, the divine mission and authority of those to whom he
          communicates a revelation. Some such outward sign would seem to be
          necessary, not only to assure the original recipient that the supposed
          revelation is not a vagary of his own imagination, but also to render
          the revelation received by a single individual authoritative to all
          (compare Jdg_6:17; Jdg_6:36-40—Gideon asks a sign, for himself;
          1Ki_18:36-38—Elijah asks a sign, for others).
        </p>
        <p>
          But in order that our positive proof of a divine revelation may not be
          embarrassed by the suspicion that the miraculous and prophetic
          elements in the Scripture history create a presumption against its
          credibility, it will be desirable to take up at this point the general
          subject of miracles and prophecy.
