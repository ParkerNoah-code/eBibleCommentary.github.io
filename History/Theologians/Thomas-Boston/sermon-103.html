        <p align="justify">Thomas Boston, 1676–1732</p>
        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          Isaiah 61:1, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord
          has anointed me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THIS text is that upon which our Lord Jesus himself preached to the
          congregation at Nazareth, Luke 4:16–19. And if we ask of whom the
          prophet spoke, Jesus tells you, verse 21, that it was of him. Though
          the prophet perhaps had an eye to himself, and to the promised
          deliverance from the Babylonish captivity; yet certainly Christ, and
          the spiritual deliverance by him, is the principal subject. Jesus is
          here described as the Mediator between God and man. In the words we
          have two things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The glorious qualifications of our Mediator: "The Spirit of the
          Lord God is upon me." Here are the three persons of the Trinity
          distinguished. The Lord God, his Son, and his Spirit. Our Lord Jesus
          being both God and man, the Holy Spirit, with all his gifts, was put
          on the man Christ. At his baptism the Spirit descended upon him like a
          dove, Matthew 3:16. On him also the Spirit rested, and never again
          departed from him, but continued filling him at all times with graces
          and gifts for the discharge of his great trust. So that he says the
          Spirit is upon me, not is come upon me.—We have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The reason of these glorious qualifications. This was, because they
          were necessary for the office to which he was called: "Because the
          Lord God has anointed me." It behooved him to be both God and man. As
          he was God, he could have nothing added to him; but as he was man, it
          behooved him to be endowed with unparalleled qualifications for this
          unparalleled office.—Here consider his call to the work. The Lord
          anointed him, as prophets, priests, and kings were accustomed to be,
          and thus were called and set apart to their respective offices; in
          like manner was Christ called of the Father to the Meditorial works,
          not with material oil, as they were, but with the Holy Spirit, which
          was signified by that oil.—Again, consider his mission: the Lord sent
          him. He did not come unsent to the world; but his Father having called
          him, and furnished him for the work, sent him away to exercise his
          commission, and to perform his work.—Consider, next, the work he was
          called to, and sent out upon. Consider this work with respect to
          Christ himself; and it is threefold. First, As a prophet or preacher
          of the gospel, revealing the Father's mind. Secondly, A priest or
          healer, a spiritual physician, for sin-sick souls, to bind up the
          broken-hearted. Thirdly, As a king, to issue out proclamations, far
          more joyful than those of Cyrus to the captives, as the spiritual
          captivity and imprisonment is far worse than a corporal one.—Consider
          the work as it respects the different sorts of people with whom he has
          to deal; and it is twofold. First, Some of them have some good in them
          wrought by his Spirit; and of these, some are the meek, others are
          broken-hearted. Secondly, Some of them have no good in them, they are
          captives, prisoners to Satan. Both sorts are in his commission, as
          persons he has to deal with.—Consider this work as it respects the
          different cases of these sorts of persons; and it is fourfold. 1st, To
          the meek, he has to carry good tidings. 2dly, to the broken-hearted,
          he has to bind up their wounds. 3dly, To the captives he has to give
          deliverance, and 4thly, To the prisoners he has to open the prison
          doors. Thus he is, by the Father's special appointment, to give
          suitable help to each case. A more particular explication of these
          things will be given as we advance in the subject.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, here is a great work; and because of it, (or, as it is in the
          Hebrew, answerable to it), he is endowed with the Spirit, with his
          graces and gifts, without which he could not be qualified for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The subject of our present discourse, is our Lord's qualification for
          his work: "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me." Here our Lord
          commends himself to poor sinners, that they may come to him, and be
          happy in him. Who can commend him to purpose but himself? He commends
          himself to us, from the fullness of the Spirit lodged in him, as in
          Revelation 3:1, "And unto the angel of the church of Sardis write,
          These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
          stars." As when the soul is gone, the body can move and act no more;
          so where the Spirit of God is gone from men, they can do no more good.
          While destitute of the Spirit, they are shut up under an uninterrupted
          barrenness. Now, this is the natural case of the whole world. To the
          world, then, under the want of the Spirit, Christ here makes public
          proclamation where the Spirit is to be found; as if he had said, "O
          all you spiritless, lifeless sinners, dead to grace and goodness, be
          it known unto you, "the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me." He says as
          Joseph said to his brethren, Genesis 45:9, and downwards. The Spirit
          came upon Moses and the prophets, but they could spare none of their
          oil; if they could, they could not have communicated it. But the
          Spirit is on me, as the oil in the cistern, to be dispersed by the
          pipes of conveyance to poor sinners who will come to me. This is
          indeed a proclamation of a well-stored and cheap market, to a country
          perishing under famine, to which they should all resort.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That this is the true intent of these words, appears first, Because it
          is plain from the original accentuation, that the principal purpose of
          the text, is not to show why the Spirit was on Christ, (for in that
          case the chief stop within the verse had been at broken-hearted), but
          to show, that the Spirit is on him, (for there the great stop is.)
          "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me," etc. Secondly, Because an
          amazing change is prophesied, in the preceding chapter, to come upon
          the church of the Gentiles; and so here follows the accounting for it:
          "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me," to be communicated for
          effecting this change.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From this part of the subject, I observe the following
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE, That the Spirit of God was eminently on Jesus Christ, to be
          communicated to poor sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This was typified by the ointment poured out on the head of the High
          Priest, Psalm 133:2. Compare John 1:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">For illustrating this doctrine, we propose,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show in what eminent sort the Spirit of the Lord was upon Christ
          the Mediator.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To confirm this point, That the Spirit is put upon Christ to be
          communicated.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. I will consider the reasonableness and suitableness of this
          glorious device, of the Spirit's being put on Christ, to be
          communicated to poor sinners.—And then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. We shall improve the subject.—We are,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show in what eminent sort the Spirit of the Lord was upon the
          Mediator.—Here we observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the gifts and graces of the Spirit were conferred on Christ's
          human nature in a singular measure: Psalm 45:7, "God, your God, has
          anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows." What these
          are you may see, Isaiah 3:2, 3. Others have had much of these, but
          never any so much of them as the man Christ, though they were not
          infinite, which is a property peculiar to the divine perfections. Thus
          his enemies were obliged to confess, that he spoke as never man spoke.
          And in this sense that testimony, John 3:34, "God gives not his Spirit
          by measure unto him," may be applied even to Christ's manhood; namely,
          that God gives not his gifts and graces to him sparingly, as out of a
          measure, but with a full hand most abundantly.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The fullness of the Spirit was upon the Mediator; and that is an
          infinite fullness, for he is God as well as man: Colossians 2:9, "For
          in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." The Holy Spirit
          is an infinite Spirit of boundless perfections, all which Jesus Christ
          as God does fully possess. The divine nature, an unfathomable depth of
          perfections, was united to the human nature in our Mediator; so that
          he has not only a portion of the Spirit, but the whole fullness of the
          Spirit, John 3:34. Saints have, and can have, by their measure; but
          the ocean of perfections, which knows no bounds, and all grace, were
          and was in him.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That the Spirit was at all times alike on that Mediator. The Spirit
          came sometimes on the prophets, instructing them what to say, and
          exciting them to say it; but sometimes the spirit of prophecy did not
          blow, they had it not at their command: 1 Peter 1:21, "For the
          prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God
          spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit." See an instance, 2
          Samuel 7:2–5, where the prophet Nathan knew not how to direct David,
          until the word of the Lord came to him. So the Spirit of
          sanctification in the saints, though he never departs from them, yet
          how often is there a dead calm in their souls, which requires them to
          say, as in Song 4:16, "Awake, O north wind! and come, you south; blow
          upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved
          come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits." But the Spirit
          rested on Jesus Christ, Isaiah 11:2; it dwells in him, Colossians 2:9.
          He never can be at a loss for want of the Spirit, whose waters in him
          are never shallow, but still continue alike deep. We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That the Spirit is upon him in the fullness of a fountain, to be
          communicated to those who come to him: Zechariah 13:1, "In that day
          there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and the
          inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity:" so "Jesus
          breathed on his disciples," John 20:22, and said unto them, "Receive
          you the Holy Spirit." All others, even the saints in Heaven, have but
          the fullness of a vessel, what only may serve themselves. But he has
          the fullness of a spring, where the waters are ever flowing, and
          therefore can furnish all others who come to him, and yet have never
          the less to himself.—We come now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To confirm this point, That the Spirit was in Christ to be
          communicated.—We observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That this is plain from scripture-testimony: Revelation 3:1, "He
          has the seven spirits of God." All the saints have the Spirit of God.
          He dwells in each of them; if any man have not the Spirit of Christ,
          he is none of his, Romans 8:9. But then this is quite another thing
          than the simple having of the Spirit. Christ has the Spirit as he has
          the seven stars, that is, at his disposal, to give them or take them
          from whom he will: Psalm 66:18, "You have received gifts for men; yes,
          for the rebellious also, that the Lord God may dwell among them."
          Compare Ephesians 4:8. Whence it is plain, that Christ received these
          gifts, received them to give them to men.—This is plain,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. For Christ, as Mediator and surety of the new covenant, is a common
          person, as Adam was in the first covenant, who received the stock of
          all mankind in his hand, and lost it. Now, free grace has made up the
          stock again, and put it in a sure hand, where it never can be lost:
          Psalm 89:19, "I have laid help upon one that is mighty." He is the
          second Adam, and therefore the fullness of the Spirit and of his grace
          is put upon him, to be communicated by him to poor sinners.—Consider
          farther,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That Christ could not have been qualified to execute the office to
          which the Father had called him, without communicating the Spirit to
          those with whom he has to deal; therefore says the text, "The Spirit
          of the Lord God is upon me, because he has sent me to preach good
          tidings to the meek." How shall the poor meek ones, who see nothing in
          them or about them to recommend them to God, believe the good tidings,
          without the Spirit of faith? How can the broken-hearted have their
          wounds bound up without the healing spirit? How can the captives and
          prisoners be delivered, unless the Spirit break off their
          fetters.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That it is from Jesus Christ that all who partake of the
          Spirit do receive the Spirit; there is no other channel of conveyance:
          John 1:16, "Out of his fullness have all we received, and grace for
          grace." John 6:63, "It is the Spirit that quickens: the words that I
          speak unto you are spirit, and they are life." It is he who sends the
          Spirit, John 15:16. It is true, the Father is said to give the Spirit
          to them that ask him, Luke 11:13; but it is still in Christ's name,
          and for his sake, John 14:29. Therefore he is called the Spirit of
          God's Son, whom he sends forth into the hearts of his people.—We now
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To consider the reasonableness and suitableness of his glorious
          device, of the Spirit being put on Christ to be communicated to poor
          sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is most suitable to the Father's honor, that guilty criminals
          partake of his Spirit through a Mediator. God looked on all the fallen
          race of man, and could be pleased with none of them: Psalm 14:3, "They
          are all gone aside; they are altogether become filthy." But behold his
          own Son became man! and he is well pleased with him, with his person
          and mediation, and therefore with sinners in him, Matthew 3:17. In
          Christ he meets with the sinner; and his justice being satisfied by
          him, he may, with safety to his own honor, communicate with the poor
          creatures, and they receive his Spirit, as members of his own Son,
          their glorious Head.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is most suitable to the honor of the Son, who is appointed head
          over all things to the church, which is his body, Ephesians 1:23. This
          is that honor which his Father has put upon him, that he be the great
          steward of Heaven, the trustee for all the elect of God, the great
          dispenser of the Father's favors, to the objects of everlasting love.
          And as Pharaoh put an honor upon Joseph, by ordering his petitioners
          to go to Joseph; so does the Father put honor upon Christ, his own
          well-beloved Son, by a similar appointment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is most suitable to the honor of the Holy Spirit; for in this
          manner the gift of the Spirit appears to be by the infinite value of
          the blood of the Son of God: Revelation 5:6, "The Lamb slain has seven
          horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth
          into all the earth." No receiving of this holy fire, but from the
          altar where a Savior was slain. No communicating of that Spirit, but
          through the blood of the Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is most suitable to the sinner's case; for Christ is bone
          of our bone, and flesh of our flesh. He is our near kinsman, through
          whom we come to God boldly: Ephesians 3:12, "In whom we have boldness
          and access with confidence by the faith of him." We are not able to
          behold an unveiled God, his glory would dazzle and confound us; but
          through the veil of the flesh of Christ we may behold him and live.—We
          now come,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To a practical improvement of the subject. And this,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">First, In a use for information.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This lets us see the transcendent glory and beauty of Jesus Christ.
          Pharaoh could say of Joseph to his servants, Genesis 41:38, "Can we
          find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?" How
          does the firmament shine with the stars which sparkle in it! How
          beautiful is the earth, when decked with the variety of the gifts of
          nature in the spring! But what are all these to the Mediator's glory
          and beauty, in whom all the gifts and graces of God's Spirit do
          center: Psalm 45:2, "You are fairer than the sons of men; grace is
          poured into your lips." There is no man, however well qualified, that
          excels in all things, there is a want in every individual, but no want
          in Christ; Song 5:16, "Yes, he is altogether lovely." (Hebrews He is
          all desires).—We may learn,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The absolute fullness and sufficiency of Christ to make the sinner
          who comes to him perfectly happy; he gives them rest, Matthew 11:28.
          There is a fullness of the Spirit in him to answer all their
          necessities, be what they will. Behold the whole constellation of
          gifts and graces in our exalted Redeemer. Every good gift, natural,
          moral, or religious, comes from this Spirit. Some have one gift of
          him, some another; but our Lord Jesus Christ has all, which is more
          than all the excellencies to be found in angels and men. And what can
          he want to bestow, who has the Spirit to give to those who come to
          him?—We may learn,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The freedom of grace in Christ. He has all, and he communicates all
          freely. The spring runs freely without price or hire. It is a pleasure
          to have a full breast sucked: and it is a pleasure to our blessed
          Redeemer to do good and to communicate to undeserving sinners.—We may
          see,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The absolute need we have of Christ. You are ruined without the
          Spirit, you will pine away in your guilt, rust away in your
          corruptions, and, like dead corpses, be buried out of God's sight, if
          you get not the Spirit; and you cannot have the Spirit but from
          Christ. This is the only market opened to relieve your necessities.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, You are inexcusable if you continue without the Spirit, for
          you may have the Spirit if you come to Christ; but, alas! he may say
          of us, as John 5:40, "You will not come unto me that you may have
          life." I would raise your dead souls, I would quicken you, I would
          make you as a well-watered garden: but alas! you care not for the
          Spirit. Proverbs 1:25, "You have set at nothing all my counsel, and
          would none of my reproof."—We shall improve this subject,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Secondly, In a use of exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. I would exhort you, then, to come to Christ, that you may partake
          of his Spirit. Christ is saying to you this day, "The Spirit of the
          Lord God is upon me." Come, and I will pour him out upon you. Alas for
          the want of the Spirit this day! it appears sadly in the whole church,
          in the congregation, in neighborhoods, and in families. There is
          enough of a selfish, devilish, carnal, worldly, profane, and formal
          spirit, but little of a holy heavenly spirit, to be seen this day. But
          we may get the spirit, if we will by faith come to Christ for it. O
          that we were moving to him for this spirit!—To be more particular, we
          would exhort you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Come to Christ, O you dead and lifeless sinner, who are lying
          rotting under the power of your lusts, who have a heart within you
          which cannot repent and mourn, or let go the dead grip it has taken of
          the world, and of sinful courses. His Spirit is a spirit of life,
          which will make the dry bones live, the withered soul flourish as an
          herb, the heart, which is like a clog now in duties, to be like the
          chariots of Amminadab: Ephesians 5:14, "Awake, you that sleep, and
          arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Come, drooping, fainting, dispirited soul, who are harassed with
          terrors, pierced with fearful apprehension, whose heart is like a
          stone, dying within you. His Spirit is a spirit of light, life, and
          comfort: he binds up the broken-hearted, makes light to arise to those
          who go mourning without the sun, takes off the sackcloth, and girds
          with gladness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Come, hard-hearted sinner, whom nothing can move, neither judgments
          nor mercies, who can not mourn either for your own sins, or the sins
          of the generation. His Spirit can soften the heart. He will take away
          your stony heart, and give you an heart of flesh. An outpouring of the
          Spirit would melt down the heart, and dissolve it in tears of godly
          sorrow, this would break the bands of iron and brass: Zechariah 12:10,
          "And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the
          inhabitants, of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication;
          and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall
          mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son; and shall be in
          bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Come, tempted sinner, who are harassed with temptations, and are
          ready to say, One day I shall fall before this great adversary. The
          Spirit is a spirit of power, 2 Tim 1:7. It may be, that temptations
          come in on you like a breaking forth of waters, threatening to sweep
          all before them; but come to Christ for his Spirit, who is able to
          stem the tide, to create peace, and to make you more than a conqueror.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Come, unfruitful sinner. The Lord is at much pains with you by
          ordinances and providences, yet you are barren! you bring forth no
          fruit answerable to the pains of the Gardener. What is the reason the
          Spirit comes not with the word and providences? But you may have the
          Spirit from Christ, and this would make you fruitful: Ephesians 5:9,
          "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness,
          and truth." The blowing of that wind from Heaven would make the spices
          flow out, Canticles 4:16, and cause you to make progress in your
          journey to the Zion above.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Come, unholy sinner. The Spirit which Christ has to give, is a
          spirit of holiness, Romans 1:4. He works like water in washing the
          polluted soul, like fire in burning up corruption. He is the great
          principle of holiness, who works it wherever he comes, and makes of
          the very worst a vessel fit for the Master's use.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Come to Christ for his Spirit, whatever your case be; you will
          find a suitable cure from him, by the fullness of the Spirit in him;
          he is suited for every case that is put in his hand: Colossians 2:9,
          10, "For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And you
          are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities and
          powers." He will be eyes to the blind, light to them that sit in
          darkness, legs to the lame, meat to the hungry, drink to the thirsty,
          clothing to the naked; all in all.—To prevail with you in coming to
          Christ for the Spirit, I would offer you the following motives—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 1. The Spirit of the Lord is absolutely necessary for you to
          have, you cannot want him, you must have him. The world may as well
          want the sun, moon, and stars, as you can want the Spirit; for without
          the Spirit you can do nothing but sin. When the soul is away, the body
          is dead, and can do nothing but lie and rot in a grave: and when the
          Spirit of God is not in a man, he is dead in sin, and can do nothing
          but sin: John 6:63, "It is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits
          nothing: the words that I speak unto you they are spirit, and they are
          life." You cannot have a good and aceptable thought, nor perform any
          duty acceptable: John 4:24, "God is a Spirit, and they that worship
          him, must worship him in spirit and in truth." So that all pains are
          lost upon you, as on the dead tree, to which summer and winter are
          alike.—Again, without the Spirit, you are none of Christ's, Romans
          8:9, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
          All those who are Christ's, they are sealed and marked with the Spirit
          of Christ: Ephesians 1:13, "In whom also, after that you believed, you
          were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise." Men set their mark on
          their sheep, and therefore says one, If such a one be one of my sheep,
          it has such a mark; so says our Lord, If one of my sheep, he has my
          Spirit in him; and so without the Spirit, without Christ, and without
          the Father, therefore without the Spirit, without God in the
          world.—Farther, without the Spirit, you are undone forever: for so you
          are without God, and therefore without hope, Ephesians 2:12. The dead
          corpse may be kept a while, but when there is no hope of the return of
          life, it is buried in a grave; so, without the Spirit, you may be kept
          a while through God's patience, but the end will be, to be east into
          the pit, and buried out of God's sight in fiery flames.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 2. You cannot have the Spirit but from Jesus Christ. The blessed
          Mediator is the bowl from which this holy oil is conveyed to all the
          lamps which burn with it. The Spirit, Bays he, is on me: 1 John 2:20,
          "But you have an unction from the holy One, and you know all things."
          Verse 27, "But the anointing which you have received of him, abides in
          you." The Egyptians must have starved, if they had not been supplied
          with corn by Joseph, for he had all the corn at his disposal; and we
          must be for over without the Spirit, if we receive him not from
          Christ. The Spirit dwells in none but as members of Christ: and whence
          shall the members have life but from the Head?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 3. You may have the Spirit, and that freely, from Christ:
          Proverbs 1:23, "Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my
          Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you." And the promise
          is very bountiful, you may have all free of cost: Revelation 22:17,
          "And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." The Spirit
          on Christ is that water of life which gives life to the dead, and life
          more abundantly to the living; and the terms are, Ask of him, and he
          will give you living water, John 4:10. Not only drops of the Spirit,
          but the Spirit poured out, floods of the same: Isaiah 44:3, "For I
          will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry
          ground: I will pour my Spirit upon your seed, and my blessing upon
          your offspring." John 7:38, 39, "He who believes on me, as the
          scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
          water. (But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on
          him should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because
          that Jesus was not yet glorified)."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, By way of motive, if you will not come to Christ for the
          Spirit, you judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, you are
          slighters of Christ, and dreadful will your reckoning be: Proverbs
          1:24–27, "Because I have called, and you have refused: I have
          stretched out my hand, and no man regarded. But you have set at
          nothing all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. I also will
          laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes; when your
          fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind;
          when distress and anguish comes upon you." It will he more tolerable
          for those who never heard where they might partake of the Spirit than
          for you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In conclusion, I shall only add the following directions—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Pray earnestly for the Spirit, in the name of Christ; you have a
          promise of the Spirit; says God, by the prophet Ezekiel, "And I will
          put my spirit within you." And said Jesus, "If you then being evil,
          know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more should
          your heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" Take
          courage, then, believe the promise, press it and depend upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Unite with Jesus Christ, accepting him in the gospel-offer, and
          giving yourselves away freely to him. Bring your dead soul to the Lord
          of life, and he will breathe in it, and you shall be like the dead man
          laid in the sepulcher of Elisha, who revived, and stood upon his feet,
          whenever he touched the prophet's bones, 2 Kings 13:21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Wait and look for the Spirit in Christ's ordinances,
          especially the preaching of the gospel. They who would have the wind
          to blow on them, go out into the open air; though they may for the
          present miss it, they wait until it blows, when in like manner
          exercised, then you shall know that the ministration of the Spirit is
          glorious, 2 Corinthians 3:8. Amen.

        <p align="justify">
          UNDER this part of the text, we propose to consider the necessity of
          the fullness of the Spirit being lodged in Christ. It was necessary,
          because the Lord has anointed him unto, and sent him forth upon the
          mediatory work. The greatness of that work required it.—Here I observe
          the following doctrines—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. That our Lord Jesus Christ was by the Father anointed to,

          DOCTRINE II. That the work upon which Jesus the Mediator was sent
          forth, necessarily required the fullness of the Spirit to be lodged in
          him.—We begin with
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. That our Lord Jesus Christ was by the Father anointed to,
          and sent forth upon, the mediatory work.—Or, in other words,

          That our Mediator, the Lord Jesus, was anointed by the Father unto

          II. Speak of the sending which flowed from and followed upon it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Make some practical improvement.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I am to consider the anointing here mentioned. In attending to this
          I shall, first, show what is meant by this anointing. Secondly, With
          which Christ was anointed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, We are to show what is meant by this anointing. Under the Old
          Testament, anointing was a ceremony used for consecrating kings,
          priests, and prophets: thus David was anointed king, Aaron was
          anointed priest, Elisha anointed a prophet. This ceremony signified
          two things—The designation of the person to the office. It being a
          sign, by the divine appointment, that this was the person whom God had
          called to this work; it was also a discovery of the divine purpose, as
          thereby the person was consecrated to the office; though sometimes it
          was long after that he got his orders to proceed to the actual
          exercise of it. Thus Samuel, by the command of the Lord, anointed
          David king long before he assumed the government, 1 Samuel
          16:13—Again, this ceremony also signified the endowment of the person
          with the abilities and qualifications necessary to fit him for the
          work. Thus, when Saul was anointed king, God gave him another heart, 1
          Samuel 10:13, "And when David was anointed king, the Spirit of the
          Lord came upon him from that day forward," 1 Samuel 16:13.
          Accordingly, Christ's anointing signifies two things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. His designation to the mediatory office. The Father pitched upon
          his Son, and set him apart for this grand work, to recover a ruined
          world. He made choice of him to be the repairer of the great breach,
          and put the breach under his hand. Hence he is called God's elect or
          chosen one; Isaiah 42:1, "Behold (says God) my servant whom I uphold,
          mine elect in whom my soul delights." Christ's anointing signifies,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. His being fitted and furnished for that office to which he was
          designed and set apart: John 3:31, "For he whom God has sent, speaks
          the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure unto him.
          Hence it is said of him, that he is able to save them to the uttermost
          that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession
          for them." It was an unparalleled work, and so unparalleled
          qualifications were necessary for it. He was pitched upon to be the
          Father's servant in the great work of recovering an elect world. He
          was infinitely wise who made the choice, and therefore could not but
          pitch on a suitable person: he was also infinitely powerful, and
          all-sufficient, and therefore could fully qualify him for it. We have
          both the choice and the furniture together: Isaiah 42:1, "Behold my
          servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delights: I have put
          my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles."
          And this is the import of the anointing.—But let us view it more
          particularly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the designation or choice made by the Father. Infinite wisdom
          appeared in it most conspicuously, with infinite love to an elect
          world. When the divine decree and purpose of man's redemption was laid
          down by the Trinity, the great thing next to be considered was, who
          should undertake the work, and be the Redeemer. No mere man could be
          chosen, for none could have a back to bear such a burden. All were
          guilty, and could not satisfy for their own sin, far less purchase
          salvation for others. No angel could be chosen, for even they, with
          their stock, could not have been able to have discharged the debt, in
          regard it was infinite; wherefore the Father made choice of his own
          Son, as a person who could undertake it; Psalm 89:19, 20, "Then you
          spoke in vision to your holy One, and said, I have laid help upon one
          that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people; I have
          found David my servant, and with my holy oil have I anointed him." He
          being the Son of God, it doubtless became the divine perfections to
          pitch on him, as one who was to purchase for us the adoption of sons,
          and to bring many children to glory.—Let us view this anointing,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In qualifying him for the work, in which the same love and wisdom
          appears. Our Mediator had to die, for without shedding of blood, there
          could be no remission of sin." The divine nature was not capable of
          dying, therefore he prepared him a body: Hebrews 10:5, "Wherefore,
          when he comes into the world, be says, Sacrifice and offering you
          would not, but a body you have prepared me." The same nature which
          sinned had to suffer; therefore he did not create him a body out of
          nothing, but prepared him one of the seed of Adam. He was chosen out
          of the people: Galatians 4:4, "God sent forth his Son, made of a
          woman, made under the law." But farther, oar nature was corrupted, and
          our flesh sinful flesh; therefore it could not be immediately united
          to the divine nature; wherefore he sanctified the substance of which
          that precious body was formed, and made him a holy human nature:
          Hebrews 7:26, "For such an high priest became us, who is holy,
          harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
          heavens," While what the human nature could do or suffer, would not
          have possessed sufficient virtue, if separated from the divine;
          therefore he unites it with it, John 1:14, "And the word was made
          flesh, and dwelt among us." And hence the human nature was filled with
          all gifts and graces necessary to it, for that part which it was to
          act in the great work.—Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Inquire with which Christ was anointed. Not with material
          oil, but with the Spirit, signified by it: Psalm 45:7, "God, your God,
          has anointed you with the oil of gladness, above your fellows." And
          while the designation of the person was from eternity, the Spirit's
          descending on him like a dove at his baptism was the discovery of that
          eternal choice, and served for the visible designation of him to the
          world: Matthew 3:16, 17, "And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up
          immediately out of the water: and, lo! the heavens were opened unto
          him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
          upon him: and, lo! a voice from Heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son
          in whom I am well pleased." And by the same Spirit it was that he was
          qualified and fitted for the mediatory work, his holy human nature
          being with it.—If it be inquired, how his having been anointed can be
          the reason of the Spirit's being upon him, when the Spirit was that
          with which he was anointed? I answer, That Christ's having been
          anointed with the Spirit to qualify him for the mediatory work, is a
          very proper reason why the Spirit was lodged and continues to be in
          Christ, to be communicated from him to the members of his mystical
          body.

          II. We are now shortly to speak of the sending of Christ by the
          Father. As he anointed, so he sent him. This means the Father's
          calling him out unto the exercise of his office for which he had been
          designed, and for which he had been qualified. He was seasonably sent
          to the work by the Father, and he willingly came and put hand to it,
          for his Father's glory, and the salvation of poor sinners: Psalm 40:7,
          "Then said he, Lo I come; in the volume of the book it is written of
          me, I delight to do your will, O my God! Yes, your law is within my
          heart." We may observe three periods of this sending.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The first period was at Adam's fall, when all mankind was newly ruined
          by the first sin; then the Mediator came and looked on the ruins of
          the world, Genesis 3:8; preached deliverance to the captives, verse
          15, telling them that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of
          the serpent. He healed the broken-hearted, by covering Adam and his
          wife with coats of skin, verse 21, even the skins of sacrifices, a
          type of the righteousness of a slain Redeemer. Thus he under-propped
          the world by his mediation, when all was shaken loose by man's
          disobedience. He began immediately to repair the breach, and kept the
          world from absolute and irreparable ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The second period was at his birth, in the fullness of time, when he
          became man, being born of the virgin: Galatians 4:4, "When the
          fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a
          woman, made under the law." The world was then in a deplorable
          condition; the knowledge of the true God was lost among the Gentiles,
          religion was corrupted among the Jews, some few were groaning for the
          consolation of Israel. Then he came in the flesh, being born of a mean
          woman, and laid in a manger; but at his birth the angels sung, as in
          Luke 2:14, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will
          towards men."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The third period was when he entered on the public exercise of his
          ministry at his baptism; then was he, in a special manner, sent out on
          that work to which he was called: Matthew 3:17, "This is my beloved
          Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 4:17, "From that time, Jesus
          began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of God is at
          hand." Then he went about his work, preaching the gospel, to bring
          sinners to God; he also became obedient unto the death, according to
          the everlasting covenant between him and his Father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. We now proceed to make some practical improvement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1st, In a use of information.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This subject informs us, that the salvation of sinners was the
          concern of a whole Trinity. How great a work must it be, when the
          Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, each acted their part for
          bringing it about. The Father sent the Son, the Son submitted to be
          sent as Mediator, and by the Holy Spirit he was fitted for the work.
          Never, then, think little of that salvation, which required such
          causes and authors to bring it about.—It informs us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That Jesus Christ is perfectly able to save sinners: Hebrews 7:25,
          "He is able to save to the uttermost." He was the Father's choice to
          that great work, which may assure us he was an able hand for it. He
          has all given him to fit him for it, which the fullness of the Godhead
          affords. The Father had never taken him cautioner, if he had not been
          perfectly able to pay the debt. He had never laid the sinner's help
          upon him, if he had not been able to bear the weight of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. See here the manifold wisdom of God, how it is displayed in the
          contrivance of salvation through Christ. The first creation was a work
          of wisdom; but the second was more so; the confused heap at first was
          little in comparison of the confusion sin brought into the world, but
          divine wisdom brought order out of this confusion. Truth meets with
          mercy, righteousness and peace embrace each other, sin is punished,
          and the sinner spared. Out of the greatest affront to God, rises the
          occasion of his greatest glory, his Son's obedience instead of theirs.
          When at the fall Hell rejoiced, angels stood astonished, and men lay
          groveling in the depth of misery, wisdom found out a way of recovery,
          to the marring of the devil's joy, the dissipating man's fears, and
          giving angels a mystery of wisdom to pry into: Ephesians 3:10, "To the
          intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places,
          might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to
          the eternal purpose which be purposed in Jesus Christ our Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. See here the amazing mercy of God to objects in the deepest misery.
          To have given rebel sinners some years' respite from their due
          punishment, to have locked them up in Hell, to be released after some
          millions of years, would have glorified mercy; but for an offended God
          to provide a Mediator himself, proclaims the height and depth of
          infinite mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. See here the love of God to poor sinners. The love of the Father is
          wonderful, in sending his own Son to recover sinners by his obedience
          and death: John 3:16, "God so loved the world, that he gave his Son,
          his only-begotten Son, unto the death, the most bitter death, even the
          death of the cross."—The love of Christ, which undertook that heavy
          work for poor sinners. Here is love admirable in all its dimensions:
          Christ coming in the room of sinners. If you doubt his love, look into
          his pierced side, and behold its glowings there.—The love of the
          Spirit dwelling in Christ, as the Head, to enliven poor sinners as his
          members, being in him, exciting, moving him forward to the work, and
          fitting him for it.—I shall only add a use of exhortation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O! sirs, let Christ be your choice, as he was the Father's. His Father
          is well pleased with him, be you also well pleased with him. Employ
          him in your every case, put all your cases in his hand, lay your help
          where the Father has laid it. Receive him whom the Father has sent,
          receive him for all the ends to which the Father has anointed and sent
          him. He is called Messiah, and Christ, to denote his being anointed as
          the Prophet, Priest, and King of his people; he was anointed for all
          these offices, receive and improve him in them all. He is anointed as
          the great Prophet, to declare the mind of God to sinners: Isaiah 61:1,
          He is to "preach good tidings to the meek." Receive him for your
          Prophet, and teacher; renouncing your own wisdom, submit yourselves to
          be taught by his word and Spirit; and go to him for direction in all
          cases. He is an anointed Priest: Psalm 110:4, "The Lord has sworn, and
          will not repent, you are a Priest forever after the order of
          Melchizedek." Receive him as your Priest, laying the weight of your
          souls on his sacrifice and intercession; renouncing all confidence in
          yourselves. Carry your guilt to him, to be carried off by his
          atonement, and put all your spiritual sacrifices in his hand, for only
          out of his hand will they be accepted. He is anointed King: Psalm 2:6,
          "Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion." Submit yourselves
          a willing people to the royal Mediator to receive his commandments, to
          live according to his laws, to pursue the interest of his kingdom in
          the world, and to fight under his banner against the devil, the world,
          and the flesh; since for these ends he is sent, and has come, it lies
          on us to receive him as such. And that this may have weight with you,
          consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Who sent him; the Father, the first person of the glorious
          Trinity: John 5:37, "The Father himself," said he, "that has sent me,
          has borne witness of me." And will we not welcome him whom the Father
          has sent, and entertain him for the ends for which he is sent? The
          Father had a concern for the salvation of lost sinners, and has sent
          them a deliverer, a Savior. How will you answer if you slight
          him?—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Who is sent. The Father has put an honor on man, beyond what he
          has put on angels, in that he sent a Savior for the one, not for the
          other. Had he sent a lower person, an angel, with what profound
          respect ought we to have received him as the messenger of the Lord?
          how much more when he has sent his own Son?—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The errand and design on which he was sent; namely, to recover a
          lost world, to make up the peace between God and sinners: Luke 19:10,
          "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
          O! may not his errand make him a welcome messenger to the world? If we
          will not receive him on this errand, we are self-destroyers a second
          time, who having first given ourselves a dreadful wound, in the next
          place reject the Savior, the Physician sent to us.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) The work he was sent upon for this end; doing-work,
          suffering-work. His doing-work we have in our text, it will be
          pleasing and acceptable to sensible sinners. His suffering-work was
          hard work, but was a necessary foundation for the other. He preached
          good tidings, but he brought them from his own death. He binds up the
          broken-hearted, but the healing medicine is his own blood; he
          proclaims deliverance, but the ransom was his own life.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) Whence and where he was sent; from the Father's bosom to this
          earth, where he was entertained with all evil treatment, until they
          nailed him to a cross, and he was buried in a grave, Philippians
          2:6–8. He was sent from the regions of bliss to this lower world, and
          refused not the journey; he was sent from the hallelujahs of angels,
          to endure the contradiction of sinners against himself. And when he is
          come, will we not receive him?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider the necessity of this mission: Psalm 40:6, "Sacrifice
          and offering you did not desire; mine ears have you opened;
          burnt-offerings and sin-offerings have you not required; then said I,
          Lo! I come. "The world had universally perished without remedy if he
          had not come. He bare up the pillars thereof, and warded off the blow
          of justice, by laying his own neck on the block And now that he is
          come, he must be embraced and improved, else we perish; for, Acts
          4:12, "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
          other name under Heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved."
          There is no other salvation to look to: Hebrews 2:3, "How then shall
          we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?"—I shall now go on to
          illustrate very briefly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. That the work upon which the Mediator was sent forth,
          necessarily required the fullness of the Spirit to be lodged in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In illustrating this, all that I intend is, to confirm the point
          briefly, and then conclude with a very short improvement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To confirm this point, we need do no more but give a short account of
          Christ's mediatory work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Christ is the day's-man between God and sinners. He was employed to
          take cognisance of the difference between the two parties, to decide
          who it was had done the wrong, and on what terms they might be
          reconciled. Hence we read, John 5:22, "For the Father judges no man,
          but has committed all judgment unto the Son." He has framed the
          covenant of reconciliation, as Mediator between the parties: Song 3:9,
          "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon." In him
          is found what Job so much desired, Job 9:33, "a day's-man to lay his
          hands upon both:" namely, to keep the dissenting parties asunder, lest
          they should fall foul of one another. This the Mediator had to do;
          this he did when he timeously stepped in between an offended God and
          guilty sinners, like the ram caught in the thicket, when Isaac was
          lying bound on the altar, which stopped the execution, and held the
          hand of justice, Psalm 6:7, (quoted above).—He is a day's-man, to keep
          them together, lest they should quite separate, and the reconciliation
          of the parties blow up. Thus Christ deals with sinners, who otherwise
          would run away from God, and never come in terms with him. Thus he did
          with our first parents, whom he brought out of their hiding-place, to
          set matters on a new footing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He is the Messenger that goes between the parties, intimating the
          mind of the one to the other, in order to make reconciliation. And in
          the respect Moses was a typical mediator: Deuteronomy 5:5, "I stood
          between the Lord and you at that time, to show you the word of the
          Lord: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into
          the mount." So Christ is called the Messenger of the covenant, Malachi
          3:1. He brings the Lord's mind to poor sinners, unfolds the thoughts
          of love which were from eternity in his breast: John 1:18, "No man has
          seen God at any time, the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of
          the Father, he has declared him." Thus he brings down the covenant out
          of the register of Heaven, and proclaims it to rebels: and if there be
          any among them content to come into it, and who accept of it, he
          reports their acceptance to his Father: John 17:8, "For I have given
          unto them the words which you gave unto me, and they have received
          them, and have known surely that I came out from you; and they have
          believed that you did send me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He is a Surety between the parties, and therefore is called the
          surety of a better testament, Hebrews 7:22; engaging and taking burden
          upon him on their behalf, that so the peace may be firm and
          lasting.—Christ the Mediator, is surety for man to God. In the first
          covenant, man had no surety for himself; and there needed none. He was
          able to do all that was required of him; for he was in good case,
          there was no flaw in his estate; but in his fallen state, God would
          not take his word, nor his most solemn engagement; it behooved him to
          have a surety to undertake for him, and that both by way of
          satisfaction and caution. Man was broken, was drowned in debt which he
          never would be able to pay, and so he needed a surety to make
          satisfaction, who should be able and would engage himself to pay the
          debt. Christ the Mediator then became surety for the broken man,
          undertook to pay all his debt, gave in his bond for it in the covenant
          of redemption, which the Father accepted: Psalm 89:19, "I have laid
          help upon one that is mighty;" he engaged body for body, life for
          life, like Judah for Benjaman, Genesis 43:9, in the fullness of time
          he paid the debt, and got up the discharge at his own resurrection
          from the dead. Man was false and fickle, and not to be trusted; so
          needed a cautioner who would bind for his good behavior. Christ became
          cautioner for the poor prodigals, engaging himself that they shall
          consent to the covenant: John 6:37, "All that the Father gives me,
          shall come to me: and him that comes to me, I will in nowise cast
          out." And that having consented, they shall hold by it, and never fall
          away totally and finally: John 10:28, "And I will give unto them
          eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any one pluck
          them out of my hand." By his Spirit of faith and holiness, which he
          puts in them, he accordingly secures them.—He is also surety for God
          to man. He undertook that God's part of the covenant shall be
          punctually fulfilled to us: 2 Corinthians 1:20, "For all the promises
          of God in him are yes, and in him amen, to the glory of God by us." It
          is true, the infinite veracity and power of the principal leaves no
          need of a surety, in respect of himself; but poor guilty sinners,
          sensible of their own unworthiness, are timorous, misbelieving,
          distrustful creatures; and therefore, that they may be helped to
          believe, there is a surety of their own nature, even the man Christ
          Jesus, granted unto them. That all the promises of God in the covenant
          shall be fulfilled to those who come into it, he has completely
          ensured. He has given his cautionary word: John 5:24, "Truly, truly, I
          say unto you, He who hears my word, and believes on him that sent me,
          has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is
          passed from death to life." He has given his Spirit as an earnest and
          seal of the promise, Ephesians 1:13, "In whom also, after you
          believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is
          the earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the purchased
          possession, unto the praise of his glory." He has given them the
          first-fruits of the Spirit in themselves, Romans 8:23. He has also
          given them the sacrament. He has gone to deal with it, saying, "This
          is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many, for the
          remission of sins," Matthew 26:28.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. He is an intercessor between the parties: Isaiah 53:12, "He makes
          intercession for the transgressors." He, by his interest, manages
          between the Lord and poor sinners, to set matters right, and keep them
          so. This is that which relates to the application of his redemption,
          and puts life in the Mediator's death, that it may be efficacious to
          his chosen ones. As the high priest appeared in the holy of holies,
          presenting the blood of the sacrifice to the Lord; so does Christ
          appear in Heaven to intercede for those for whom he has died. And he
          intercedes,—as a peace-maker, who actually makes peace between God and
          every believing sinner; hence, Hebrews 12:24, he is "Jesus the
          Mediator of the new covenant;" and his blood is "the blood of
          sprinkling, that speaks better things than that of Abel." By his
          means, he who was before an enemy is reconciled to God, brought within
          the bond of the covenant of peace, and gets a right to all the
          benefits of it. As by his gracious Spirit he extinguishes the real
          enmity of the sinner against God, so by his intercession he removes
          the legal enmity in God against the sinner.—He intercedes as the
          Secretary, or favorite courtier of Heaven, bringing in the sinner into
          the comfortable gracious presence of God, procuring him access to God,
          and communion with him in duties: Ephesians 3:12, "In whom we have
          boldness and access, with confidence, by the faith of him." Thus,
          through the vail of his flesh, the believing sinner draws near to God,
          and God draws near to him with his quickening, sanctifying, and
          comforting influences. The sinner looks on God with the confidence a
          child does on a father.—He intercedes as a resident at the court of
          Heaven: Hebrews 9:24, "He is entered into Heaven itself, now to appear
          in the presence of God for us." And by this means he maintains that
          peace which he has made between God and believers: Romans 5:1, "Being
          justified by faith, we have peace with God; through our Lord Jesus
          Christ:" he keeps the believer's trade with Heaven open and free for
          them: Romans 5:2, "By whom also we have access by faith, into this
          grace, wherein we stand, and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God."
          He removes any emergent differences, Isaiah 53:12; and so ensures, by
          the covenant of peace, that there can never be a total rupture between
          Heaven and them: Hebrews 7:25, "Wherefore he is able to save them to
          the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make
          intercession for them."—He intercedes as an Advocate at the bar of
          God: 1 John 2:1, "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,
          Jesus Christ the righteous." He pleads their cause before God, upon
          the ground of his own sufferings, against all their accusers and
          whatever is charged upon them, so that they are freed from
          condemnation, their right and title to Heaven is still vindicated,
          notwithstanding their many failures; and wrath can go no farther
          against them than temporary strokes.—He intercedes as a Solicitor for
          his people before the Lord. He presents their petitions, and solicits
          for the granting of them. With much incence he offers the prayers of
          all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne,
          Revelation 8:3. They have many wants, both as to temporal and
          spiritual things. They must go to God for them, and put up their
          petitions. But he must present them, else they cannot be heard.

          5. He is the Administrator of the covenant, God's deputy-governor, to
          dispose of the benefits of the covenant, and to manage the whole
          matter between the Lord and sinners: Matthew 28:18, "All power is
          given unto me in Heaven and in earth." As Joseph was set over the land
          of Egypt, so he is set over his Father's house, all commerce between
          the Lord and sinners being through his mediation. As they can offer
          nothing to God acceptably, but through him: so they can receive no
          benefit from Heaven but through his hand: John 5:22, "For the Father
          judges no man, but committed all judgment unto the Son." He has to
          bring the elect to consent to the covenant; to rule and govern them in
          it; to protect, provide, and furnish them with all necessities through
          the wilderness: and, finally, to give them the crown and kingdom at
          last; this is the office and work to which Christ was anointed;
          neither men nor angels could be fit for such a trust. Could any
          manage, it without a fullness of the Spirit lodged in him? therefore,
          as in John 5:22, (quoted above), and in verse 23, "All men should
          honor the Son, even as they honor the Father: he who honors not the
          Son, honors not the Father that sent him." All men should honor the
          Son, for none but one who had the fullness of the divine perfections
          could be capable of such a trust. Who else was fit to be day's-man
          between God and sinners? Who else could be the messenger of the
          covenant, for who has known the mind of the Lord, but his
          only-begotten and well-beloved Son, who from eternity lay in his
          bosom?

        <p align="justify"><b>I conclude with a very short improvement.</b></p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Learn hence, that the work of the salvation of sinners, restoring
          them to the favor of God, and to make them happy, is a great work, and
          a work which was not easily accomplished. It was a work above the
          power of men or angels, a work not to be performed but by him who has
          all power in Heaven and earth. Think on this you that judge it such an
          easy thing to obtain mercy; and assure yourself it is a work which can
          never be done but by Christ's own hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Highly esteem and honor Christ, particularly by believing in him,
          who is thus qualified for this great work. O what need of the fullness
          of the Spirit in him to support him under the load of the elect's
          debt,—in order to the discharging of it,—and to touch and turn the
          hearts of sinners unto God!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, See your absolute need of Christ. you must have an interest in
          him, else you cannot be saved. His mediation only can save you from
          the wrath of God, and from the lowest Hell. Amen.
