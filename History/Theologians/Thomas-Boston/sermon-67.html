          Luke 6:46 "And why call you me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which
          I say?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THERE was, together with the disciples, a great multitude gathered to
          hear Christ, and to be healed by him, verse 17. Many of them pretended
          a great regard for him; but it went no farther than good words. Our
          Lord tells them, that such is every man, good or bad, according as his
          life is, verses 44, 45, "For every tree is known by his own fruit: for
          of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-bush gather they
          grapes. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings
          forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of
          his heart, brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of
          the heart, his mouth speaks." And he closely applies this to their
          conscience in the text. Wherein we have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A concession. He grants they made a fair profession; they called
          him Lord, their Lord. They owned his authority and Lordship over them,
          as if they were his subjects and servants ready to receive and obey
          his commands. They addressed themselves to him for his help, one and
          another crying, Lord, help me, pleading to receive benefit by him as
          their Lord. And this they did at times with much seeming zeal and
          concern, Lord, Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A charge. He charges them with nothing like this in their practice.
          Though they called him their Lord, they carried not themselves at all
          as his subjects and servants. Though they would have him to do for
          them, they would do nothing for him. In his preaching and life, he
          laid their duty before them: but though they owned him for their Lord,
          they showed no regard in their practice to what he said, no conformity
          to his doctrine and example.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. An expostulation. He puts them to consider the inconsistency of
          these things, and the unaccountableness of yoking together a
          profession and a practice that destroyed one another. A lord and a
          subject or servant are relatives; to the one it belongs to command, to
          the other to obey, Malachi 1:6. Why will you plead the relation, and
          yet throw off the duty of the relation? "If you call me your Lord, why
          do you not what I say or bid you? If you will not do what I say or bid
          you, why do you call me your Lord?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Two doctrines are deducible from the text thus explained.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. There are who call Christ their Lord, owning his authority
          over them, and looking for benefit by him, who yet make not conscience
          of doing the things which he as a Lord says to them, and requires of
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. It lies on men's consciences before the Lord, to take it
          home to themselves, to consider and answer it, how they come to call
          Christ their Lord, and yet make not conscience of doing the things
          which he as a Lord says to them, and requires of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I shall handle these doctrines in order.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. There are who call Christ their Lord, owning his authority
          over them, and looking for benefit by him, who yet make not conscience
          of doing the things which he as a Lord says to them, and requires of
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Consider men's calling Christ their Lord.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Consider their not doing the things which he says, notwithstanding
          of their calling him their Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show how it comes to pass, that people call Christ Lord, and
          their Lord, and yet make not conscience of doing what he says.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Apply the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I will consider men's calling Christ their Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Under this head, I will show,</p>
        <p align="justify">1. How men call Christ their Lord.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. What they do call Christ, that call him their Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">3. What is the import of their calling him Lord.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, I will show how men call Christ their Lord. Men call him their
          Lord,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Professing Christianity. Christians is the name of Christ's
          disciples who owned him for their Lord and Master: Acts 11:26. "The
          disciples were called Christians first at Antioch." As you are called
          Christians, you are called by his name, owning him for your Lord and
          Master: Matthew 23:10. "One is your Master even Christ. Some, that
          they may take to themselves a liberty, which others may not, will
          pretend they do not make a profession. Strange! Christians and yet not
          professors! Can there be a more holy profession, than that of
          Christianity, whereof Christ is the head! Hebrews 3:1. "Wherefore,
          holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle
          and high priest of our profession, Christ Jesus. Nay, at that rate you
          take the name, and throw off the thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Being baptized in his name, Matthew 28:19. They are thereby
          externally marked for his subjects and servants, and renounce the
          devil, the world, and the flesh. It is a badge of subjection to
          Christ, which the members of the visible church have taken on, to
          distinguish them from the world, whereof Satan is the God; while
          Christ is the Lord and God of the church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Praying unto him, or to God in his name, Acts. 7:59. Daniel 9:17.
          Every praying person, so far as he prays like a Christian, calls
          Christ his Lord, and begs his help; though many do little consider
          what that requires of them in their practice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Attending the assemblies of his people to hear his word, Ezekiel
          23:31. The Lord Christ has appointed these assemblies for declaring
          his will to his people, as to what he will do for them, and what he
          will have them to do: and the very coming thither in a way of outward
          reverence, is a calling him Lord, from whom we are to learn our duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consenting personally to the covenant, Isaiah 44:5. Thereby they say,
          he is, and shall be forever their Lord, and that they shall be his
          only, wholly, and forever. And at whatever time any have given such
          consent, they have no power to retract it after. Whether ever they
          shall renew it again or not, it stands recorded before God, and they
          will be judged by him accordingly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Partaking of the sacrament of the Lord's supper. The very
          name of that ordinance bears the partakers to call him so, 1
          Corinthians 11:23, 26. And it is a very solemn profession before the
          world, angels, and men, that he is our Lord, and we give up with all
          other lords. We take Heaven's seal upon it, and in a manner make oath
          that it is so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, I will show what they do call Christ, that call him their
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They call him their Lord God; as Thomas did, John 20:28, "My Lord,
          and my God." They own him to be God their Creator, who made them, and
          preserves and sustains them, to be their Sovereign Lord, the Most High
          God with his Father and Spirit, unless they declare the contrary. For
          so the universal church of Christ on earth do understand Christ to be
          the Lord, Romans 9:5, however lightly men let of his commands.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Their Lord Proprietor, Master, and Owner, however little regard
          they show to the will of his providence and precepts, Romans 14:9. For
          as all things are his by creation, so the Father has by a new title
          made him heir of all things, Lord of all, which is declared in the
          gospel, Acts 10:36. And so the head of every man is Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Their Lord Redeemer, Exodus 20:2. however unsuitably they walk to
          the redemption purchased by him. For so his people understand him to
          be our Lord, who bought us with his precious blood, paying our ransom
          while we were captives of sin and Satan, giving himself for us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Their Lord Husband, however refractory and disobedient they prove
          to him: Jeremiah 3:14, "Turn, O backsliding children, says the Lord,
          for I am married unto you." Isaiah 54:5, "Your maker is your husband,
          the Lord of hosts is his name." And so they own their obligation to be
          subject to him, faithful and obedient until death. For as he is Lord,
          he is a Lord Head and Husband, to his church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, Their Lord King, however rebellious they be: Isaiah 33:22,
          "The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our
          King, he will save us." They own him to be King in Zion, having power
          and royal dominion over them, to command, reward, and punish, as they
          carry themselves towards him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, What is the import of their calling him Lord? Men calling him
          so, do in effect own, acknowledge, and profess,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. His undoubted authority to command and prescribe duty to them:
          owning him as their Lord Husband, King, and God, they cannot deny but
          he has authority to bind them with laws. The husband claims authority
          over his spouse, the king over his subjects; and shall not God claim
          authority over his own creatures? All these meet together in Christ
          our Lord; so, by our own confession, he has authority over us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The justice and equity of his commands: Romans 7:12, "The law is
          holy; and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Husbands and
          kings among men, may require unjust things of their relatives, through
          their own perverseness or blindness: but he being our Lord God, is
          essentially just, and can command nothing but what is truly good. Will
          we venture to attack the holiness of God, to accuse his commands of
          injustice, for an excuse of our neglect of them?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Our absolute obligation to obey him. If he is our Lord, we owe him
          an illimited subjection, obedience without disputing his commands,
          Psalm 119:4. and a resignation to his providence without reserve,
          Matthew 20:15. As the clay is in the hand of the potter, so are we in
          his. The potsherds of the earth may strive with one another, but shall
          they strive with their Maker?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The strongest ties upon us to be for him. If he is our Proprietor
          and Redeemer, are we not bound by all the ties of honor and gratitude
          to be wholly his? Do we say, he redeemed us from death, and can we
          deny but we are bound to live for him? Has he redeemed us by dying for
          us, in our room and stead, and so saved us from dying eternally; what
          possible stronger incentive can there be to obedience?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, The expectation of happiness from him. Calling him our
          Lord, we expect from him and by him, the pardon of our sin, the favor
          of God, and a part in the kingdom of Heaven, Matthew 7:21. We know
          that he is not only Lord of this world, but of the other world; and so
          we raise our expectation accordingly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I will consider men's not doing the things which he says,
          notwithstanding all this. We may take it up in three things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Christ as a Lord prescribes duty to his subjects. He has not an
          empty title of lordship and dominion, but is a Lawgiver: Isaiah 33:22,
          "He is our Lawgiver." And the law of the ten commands, in their
          spirituality and extent, is his law, binding by his authority on all
          that call him Lord, Exodus 20:2, 3, etc. As he is the Lord our God, he
          claims absolute and illimited subjection and obedience of us; as he is
          our Proprietor, he claims the absolute disposal of us; as he is our
          Redeemer, he requires our living wholly to him; as he is our Husband,
          he demands our being subject to him in love, faithfulness, and
          obedience until death, yes forever; and as he is our King, he requires
          the duty of faithful subjects, and to have no commerce with his
          enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He intimates his will to them as to their duty. He says what he
          would have them to do. We have his written laws in the Bible, which is
          God's word to every one into whose hand it comes. His ministers, as
          his messengers, do in his name proclaim his laws, and require
          obedience to them. Conscience within men's breasts testifies the
          necessity of obedience. So that none can pretend ignorance. If they be
          ignorant of his will, it is affected; they desire not to know it; as
          those do, Job 21:14, who say unto God, "Depart from us; for we desire
          not the knowledge of your ways."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Yet men neglect it, and regard it not in their practice. They plead
          the relation to him, but make no conscience of the duty of it. He has
          laid down their duty in laws and commands, and has intimated it to
          them: but they take no heed to regulate their practice according to
          them. He says what things he would have them to do, but they do them
          not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, They have no due sense of their being absolutely bound up to his
          will, but fancy themselves to be at some liberty to walk according to
          their own, as if the government were divided between Christ and
          themselves: Psalm 12:4, "Who have said, With our tongue will we
          prevail, our lips are our own: who is lord over us? They do not feel
          the tie of the yoke of Christ always upon them, but are like bullocks
          unaccustomed to the yoke, skipping at ease according to their own
          pleasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They frame not their life according to his will. Their habitual
          walk and practice is not holy, but loose, licentious, untender,
          carnal, and like the world, not like the followers of Christ; like the
          Ephesians in their unconverted state, Ephesians 2:2, who "walked
          according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the
          power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of
          disobedience." They attend ordinances, and perform some religious
          duties: but look into the strain of their conversation, it is no wise
          Christ-like, but world-like; contrary to that exhortation, Romans
          12:2, "Be you not conformed to this world; but be you transformed by
          the renewing of your mind."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, They never set themselves to do all that he says; contrary to
          what the Psalmist did, Psalm 119:6, who "had respect unto all God's
          commandments." This one or other thing that he says, they do: but they
          were never brought to a compliance with the things he says without
          reserve. They pick and choose out some things, but they reject others:
          a clear evidence that his authority which is stamped on all his
          commands, has little weight with them, James 2:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, They habitually do against what he says, making their own lusts
          and inclinations their law; like those who said, Jeremiah 2:25, "I
          have loved strangers, and after them will I go." They call him their
          Lord; but Satan and their lusts are really their lords, to whom they
          yield their obedience, being captives at their pleasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, They do nothing purely because he says it, else they would
          endeavor to do all. In what they do, they have other ends than to
          please him: they do it to please themselves, for their own profit,
          pleasure, or safety.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The third general head is, to show how it comes to pass, that
          people call Christ Lord, and their Lord, and yet make not conscience
          of doing what he says. The springs of this ruining practice, that so
          prevails, are many: as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The want of a thorough change in their nature; Luke 6:43, 44, "A
          good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit: neither does a corrupt tree
          bring forth good fruit. For every tree is known by his own fruit: for
          of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-bush gather they
          grapes." There is some change made on them, therefore they call Christ
          Lord; it is not carried through, therefore they do not what he says.
          Hence they are neither cold nor hot; they are neither professed
          enemies, nor cordial friends; like the Laodiceans, of whom our Lord
          said, Revelation 3:15, "I know your works, that you are neither cold
          nor hot."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Good education and religious company embalms some dead souls; but
          still they want the principle of the Spirit of life; like those of
          whom the apostle says, Jude verse 19, "These be they who separate
          themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. So they continue dead in
          sin still, and their course of life becomes abominable with dead
          works, until in end they are twice dead, verse 12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The gospel being new to some, makes a reel among their
          affections; as it did among the stony-ground hearers, Matthew 13:20,
          21, "He who received the seed into stony places, the same is he who
          hears the word, and anon with joy receives it: yet has he not root in
          himself, but endures for a while: for when tribulation or persecution
          arises because of the word, by and by he is offended. So that they
          have some liking of the gospel, and begin to look kindly towards the
          way of God: but it changes not their hearts, verse 21. And the newness
          going away, these affections wear off, and they begin to appear in
          their own colors of black nature. Hence we have many, who, while they
          were springing up in youth, blossomed fair, and solemnly gave their
          names to Christ at sacraments: but being grown up, turn stark naught.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, They get some new light into their heads, but no new life into
          their hearts. This was the case of many of John's hearers, who
          afterwards withered away; concerning whom Christ said, John 5:35, "He
          was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season
          to rejoice in his light."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Many get awakening grace, that never get converting grace.
          Their convictions bring them to call Christ Lord; but they living
          strangers to the work of conversion, cannot do the things which he
          says.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Entertaining wrong notions of religion. They form to themselves
          such notions of religion, as leave them at liberty in the course of
          their walk.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They think that is religion to call Christ Lord in performing
          duties of worship, praying, etc. and consider not that the substance
          of religion lies in holy, tender walking: Titus 2:11, 12, "The grace
          of God that brings salvation, has appeared to all men; teaching us,
          that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
          righteously, and godly in this present world." Hence having done these
          duties of worship, they are at no more care to keep their hearts in
          the Lord's fear all the day long; but, on the contrary, can take the
          greater liberty to themselves in loose walking; as the whore did,
          Proverbs 7:14, 15, "I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I
          paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet you, diligently to seek
          your face, and I have found you." Hence publicans and harlots enter
          into the kingdom of Heaven before such persons.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) They think that faith will save them, though it be dead, idle,
          and inactive; contrary to what the apostle says, James 2:14, "What
          does it profit, my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have
          not works? can faith save him? verse 26, "As the body without the
          spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." They do not
          consider, that that faith is not saving faith, which is so. Hence they
          can take a great deal of liberty in the way of sin, and put off
          repentance from time to time, even to a death-bed, upon the confidence
          that their faith in Christ will save them. Such have been of old, and
          still are, Jude verse 4, "For there are certain men crept in unawares,
          who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men,
          turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only
          Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ." There is no true faith but what
          purifies the heart, Acts 15:9. and sanctifies the whole man; and the
          salvation by faith, is salvation from sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Reigning unbelief. Of this our Lord complained, John 5:40, "You
          will not come to me, that you might have life." Whatever pretenses
          there are to believing in Christ, the unholiness of the lives of men
          is a convincing evidence, that unbelief is reigning at bottom with
          most of us: Isaiah 53:1, "Who has believed our report? and to whom is
          the arm of the Lord revealed?" The holiness of God, the spirituality
          of his law, his hatred of sin, and how severely he punishes, are not
          believed. The report concerning Christ, another world, Heaven and
          Hell, sinks not deep into the hearts of many. If these things were
          truly believed, it is not possible that men could be so easy in a way
          of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4, Want of consideration, Luke 15:17. People dream away their
          lifetime; and however deep they can enter into the consideration of
          other things, they have no power to consider their soul's state and
          case: Isaiah 44:20, "He feeds of ashes: a deceived heart has turned
          him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a
          lie in my right hand?" Self-examination is utterly neglected; so there
          is no due reflection made on their souls' state, and the course of
          life they are leading: Isaiah 1:3, "The ox knows his owner, and the
          donkey his masters crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not
          consider."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The natural enmity of the heart prevailing against conviction;
          Romans 8:7. "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
          subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Hence is rebelling
          against the light, keeping the truth prisoner in the head, that it may
          not get into the conversation to rule there, Romans 1:18. There are
          notions of truth that force their own way into the mind, especially
          under a clear gospel-ministry: the natural enmity yoking with these,
          fights against them; and getting over them, runs with a stronger
          current than otherwise, Romans 7:13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Unmortified lusts still keeping the rule and dominion over
          the soul, though Christ has the name of their Lord. Many call Christ
          Master, who are still servants to sin, serving diverse lusts and
          pleasures. Hence these hurry them into sinful courses, that they must
          do what their impetuous lusts drive them to, and cannot do the things
          that Christ says.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information. Hence we may see,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That ungodly sinners after the dropping of the gospel, are
          self-condemned, and will be condemned out of their own mouths. They
          own Christ's authority over them, which Jews and pagans do not; and
          yet they regard it not in their walk, Malachi 1:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They are unreasonable and foolish in their expectation of benefit
          from Christ, and shall be disappointed: Matthew 7:21. "Not every one
          that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven:
          but he who does the will of my Father which is in Heaven." O how can
          we expect salvation from Christ, who have no regard to what he says!
          You will not do his will to honor him, but dishonor him by trampling
          on his commands! will not be saved from sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A profession of subjection to Christ, and bearing the external
          badges of it, is common to many of the devil's goats with Christ's
          sheep. Nobody needs value themselves upon it; for though we say well
          for Christ as our Lord, yet if we do not accordingly, we but deceive
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, No man has reason to be stumbled at religion itself,
          because of the unsuitable lives of some professors of it. Many such
          stumbling-blocks are laid down this day in the way of the blind world;
          they that lay them shall bear their judgment: but why should it be
          improved against the truths or practice of religion itself, since our
          Lord plainly forewarns that it will be so?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Of Exhortation. You do all call Christ your Lord, profess
          Christianity, have been baptized in his name, etc. Consider calmly and
          seriously, how your life answers your profession, whether you do what
          he says or not, what regard you show to his commands in your practice.
          Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is expected that they who own Christ for their Lord, should
          carry themselves as his subjects and servants, that his will should be
          their law, his commands the rule of their life. To call him Lord, and
          yet cast his laws behind your backs, is to mock him with those,
          Matthew 27:29, 30. "And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they
          put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
          knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail King of the Jews. And
          they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If he is your Lord, as he has power and authority to command you,
          so he has power to revenge your disobedience, and to reward your
          obedience. His obedient children may be sure their labor shall not be
          in vain, 1 Corinthians 15; and the disobedient will find the weight of
          his hand, that will grind them to powder, 2 Thessalonians 1:7. 8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. As he is a Lord, he is Lord and Savior, Lord Redeemer. And what is
          it that he redeems from, and saves from? Is it not sin? Titus 2:14.
          "He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
          and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
          Matthew 1:21. "You shall call his name Jesus: for he shall save his
          people from their sins." He gave his life for that end, Ephesians
          5:25, 26. What horrid injury must it then be, to pretend he is your
          Lord, to save you, and yet you will live in your sin, directly
          contrary to what his precious blood was shed for?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Though we are not saved by our doing, but by believing; yet
          faith and holiness are inseparable: James 2:14. "What does it profit
          though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save
          him?" Where there is not holiness of heart and life, there is no true
          faith in Christ there. Faith if it be true, unites the soul to Christ,
          works by love, purifies the heart, carries the soul heavenward in its
          conversation. Doing in perfection what Christ says, is reached by no
          believers here; but doing in sincerity, is what differences them still
          from unbelievers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider well then what regard you show to what Christ says. And let
          your consciences answer these questions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Can you say before the Lord, appealing to his omniscience, that you
          have renounced your own will, lusts, and inclinations, to follow
          whatever the Lord discovers to be his will for you to do; and you
          sincerely endeavor to stick by that renunciation, to conform
          yourselves to his will? Acts 9:6. I doubt most of us have never been
          brought that length yet; and that many who have said it at some times
          have resiled from it, and follow their own will more than Christ's to
          this day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Do you really so far comply with whatever God has discovered to be
          your duty, that you dare not neglect it, but must endeavor it? Psalm
          119:6. Can you think you show an upright regard to the Lord's
          commands, when there are some of them that you can cast behind your
          back? No; if you regard them not all, you regard none of them as you
          ought. Say not, There is none can do all. It is true, none can do all
          perfectly; but there is no upright man, but he will put hand to all
          that he knows to be his duty, and do his endeavor in every one of
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Do you sincerely set yourselves to oppose and fight against
          everything the Lord discovers to be sin, and are you longing to have
          the victory over it? Romans 7:24. Are there not some sins that are
          your bosom-idols, which you cannot be brought to part with? Are there
          not such sins with many who indulge themselves in sins, of the
          vileuess of which none can be ignorant, that are not given up to a
          reprobate sense, as lying, filthiness, dishonest dealing, etc.?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Do you really lie open to discoveries of sin and duty from the
          Lord's word? Job 34:31, 32. An upright servant desires to know his
          master's will; but the refractory and rebellious servant, having no
          mind to do it, cares not for knowing it, Job 21:14 Do you read the
          Bible, or care for hearing it read, and attend to it as that from
          whence you are to learn your duty? When you do read or hear the word,
          do you embrace it as the rule you are to regulate your practice by?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. What weight has Christ's saying a thing with you, when a multitude
          of the world says against it? The world says there is no ill in many
          things, that the Bible says there is much ill in. It says, there is no
          harm, where the word says there is. In a word, the Bible says, the way
          to Heaven is the way of strictness or straitness; the world says,
          there is no need of that strictness of life. Now, when the world's
          opinion carries it in your practice against Christ's decision in his
          word, do you do the things which Christ says?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Do you, in every part of your life and conversation, endeavor to
          approve yourselves to Christ as your Lord? 1 Peter 1:15, "As he which
          has called you is holy, so are you holy in all manner of
          conversation?" Do you look on him as the party with whom you have to
          do in all; not only in your religious duties, but in the common
          affairs of life, or worldly business? not only in your personal walk,
          but in the several relations wherein you stand, as husbands, wives,
          children, and servants? 1 Corinthians 7:24. Alas! most men shuffle out
          any regard to Christ's commands, out of their worldy business, and
          their relations, confining their religion to their religious duties of
          praying, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Lastly, How do you take any intimations of the Lord Christ's will
          made to you, to discover your duty or your sin in particular cases?
          Have they a silencing weight with your consciences, or do they but
          irritate your passions? Isaiah 11:6. So the Psalmist showed his
          regard, Psalm 141:5, "Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a
          kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil, which
          shall not break my head." Those that cannot bear an admonition,
          reproof, or to be told of a fault, but presently are up in their own
          defense to ward off conviction, show they have more regard to their
          credit, than their conscience, the authority of Christ the Lord, and
          anything he says, Hosea 4:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. It lies on men's consciences before the Lord, to take it
          home to themselves, to consider and answer it, how they come to call
          Christ their Lord, and yet not make conscience of doing the things
          which he as a Lord says to them, and requires of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In discoursing this doctrine, I shall only show the import of the
          expostulation in the text, and then conclude with a word of
          application.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. will show the import of this expostulation. It imports,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That Christ is in earnest for our obedience. He is not indifferent
          what regard we show to what he says as our Lord: Psalm 119:4, "He has
          commanded us to keep his precepts diligently." He is a jealous Lord,
          and will not endure your baulking of any of his commands: Exodus
          23:21, "Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not: for he
          will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him." Though we
          are not to lay the weight of our acceptance with God on our obedience,
          yet there is a weight of evidence lies on it. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The evidence of our belonging to Christ, in a saving relation,
          lies upon it: John 15:14, "You are my friends, if you do whatever I
          command you." If you do not what he says, he will disown you as none
          of his, Luke 13:28, pretend what you will. Christ sets his seal on all
          that belong to him, as soon as they become his; whereby they may be
          distinguished from the world lying in wickedness, 2 Timothy 2:19, "The
          foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them
          that are his." If you want that seal, he will reject you as none of
          his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The evidence of your right to Heaven lies on it: Revelation
          22:14, "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they might
          have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates
          into the city." And therefore, at the great day, the works of the
          saints, and of the wicked, are brought out before the world in
          judgment; the former as evidences of their title to Heaven, the latter
          as grounds of the sentence of damnation. If you baulk any of the least
          of his commands, you thereby baulk your evidence for Heaven, and so
          perish: Matthew 5:19, "Whoever shall break one of these least
          commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
          the kingdom of Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is possible for us in this life to get the things that Christ
          says, done acceptably, in all the parts thereof. If it were not so,
          then, by the text, no body at all would be allowed to call him Lord;
          which is certainly false: Matthew 7:21, "Not every one that says unto
          me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven: but he who
          does the will of my Father which is in Heaven." So there are two sorts
          that call him Lord; some that do, some that do not what he says; the
          former allowed, the other rejected. The doctrine of the imperfection
          of the saint's obedience, is a stone of stumbling to many a blind
          soul. To prevent your stumbling.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Distinguish between doing the will of Christ in all its parts,
          and in all its degrees. The latter no man in this life can do at any
          rate; but in every part of his obedience he fails in some degree:
          James 3:2, "For in many things we offend all." But the former every
          true believer actually does: Psalm 119:6, he has "respect unto all
          God's commandments." A whole family hears so many particular pieces of
          work prescribed to them all by the father and master of the family.
          His grown children do them all exactly to his mind: the younger
          children, who are but learning to work, put hand to every one of them,
          and baulk none of the pieces; but they do none of them exactly.
          Refractory servants do some of them, but others of them they never
          notice. Just so it is with the saints in Heaven, true believers on
          earth, and hypocrites.

          Now, here lies the snare: none, say you, in this world can do all that
          is required of them, but they come short in many things: and so do but
          we.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. They come short of the degrees of every part, it is true; but
          if they are believers indeed, they do not come short of the parts
          themselves, as you do. The whole parts of the will of God known to
          them, they do, and dare not but fall in with: and this will
          distinguish between them and you, that baulk any part of his will made
          known to you, as between David and Saul, Acts. 13:22. See Colossians
          4:12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Distinguish between doing the will of Christ perfectly, and
          acceptably. No man in this life can do the former, Philip. 3:12. But
          every true believer does the latter, Acts 10:25. You that are masters
          know very well to make this distinction in your own work. If a child
          of yours, or a pliable servant, show a real good-will to obey your
          orders, you accept of their work, though it is not every way as you
          would have it. So does the Lord: 2 Corinthians 8:12, "For if there be
          first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and
          not according to that he has not." But if a servant say, I cannot do
          it every way as he would have it done, and therefore I will let it
          alone altogether; how take you that? And how will Christ take such
          treatment off your hand, in plain instances of duty which you quite
          neglect, and of sin which you indulge yourselves in?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here is your share: none do the will of Christ perfectly; and I do
          many things, though not all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Ay but true believers, though they do not do it perfectly, yet
          they do it so as God for Christ's sake accepts of their doing it: and
          that you do not, and that you are not careful about; but can be easy,
          whether he accept of it or not: and since you are not universal in
          your obedience, you are not sincere, nor are accepted in anything.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Distinguish between ability in ourselves, to do the will of
          Christ acceptably, and ability for it in Christ, offered to us in the
          gospel, and to be brought in by faith. No man, saint nor sinner, has
          the former: 2 Corinthians 3:5, "We are not sufficient of ourselves to
          think anything as of ourselves." But all true believers do get the
          latter: Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ which
          strengthens me." you bid a servant do such a piece of work, and he
          neglecting it tells you, I wanted instruments for it: How take you
          that? Will you not say, Why did you not come in and get the
          instruments for it? Did not my bidding you do it, suppose I allowed
          with which to do it?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here is your snare: We can do nothing of ourselves, say you: and
          thereupon the sluggard puts his hands in his bosom; and many a poor
          sinner lies down in his bed of ease and sloth, laying his head on this
          soft pillow, and sleeps full sound until the flames of Hell awaken
          him. But that will not excuse you from doing the will of Christ; but
          it will bring you under a double guilt, one of not doing what he says,
          another of slighting his offered grace that might have enabled you:
          and so you will be condemned, not because you could not, but because
          you would not do the things he said.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the covenant of works perfect obedience only could be accepted, and
          there was strength for it allowed to Adam in that covenant, which he
          lost. In the covenant of grace sincere obedience, though imperfect,
          may be accepted; and there is strength allowed in this covenant for
          it, whereby every piece of obedience that he requires may be done,
          though not as it should be, yet so as it may be accepted: 2
          Corinthians 3:5, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think
          anything as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God." Chapter
          12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect
          in weakness." Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ
          which strengthens me." Only this strength is lodged in Christ, and
          must be fetched in by believing the promises, Psalm 28:7; Jeremiah
          17:7, 8. Now, the commands of Christ to sinners that hear the gospel,
          import an allowance of sufficient grace and strength for them thus to
          be fetched in: 2 Timothy 2:1, "You therefore, my son, be strong in the
          grace that is in Christ Jesus." Exodus 20:2, etc., "I am the Lord your
          God," etc. "You shall have no other gods before me." The little
          noticing of this weakens believers in their obedience, and the total
          neglect of it by others ruins them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Notwithstanding the things that Christ says may be got done
          acceptably, yet many that call him Lord will not do them: Titus 1:16,
          "They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him," etc. He
          has made his yoke easy, but yet they will not let it come on their
          fair necks: they say, as Luke 19:14, "We will not have this man to
          reign over us." The devil and their lusts get leave to ride them, but
          they will not be led by Christ. They say, they cannot help it; but the
          truth is, they will not help it, for they will have none of his help
          for it; as the Lord complains the Israelites did, Psalm 81:11, "My
          people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me." So
          their ruin is lodged upon a twofold score,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Obedience to sin, and disobedience to Christ, is their choice.
          The way of life and death are set before them, and they choose the
          latter: Proverbs 8:36, "He who sins against me, wrongs his own soul;
          all they that hate me, love death." Ezekiel 18:31, "Cast away from you
          all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed, and make you a
          new heart, and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?"
          Christ calls them to a holy, serious, humble, modest, and pious life.
          That they cannot endure; but cost what it will, they must have a
          light, proud, unclean, sensual, and loose life, wherein they may
          think, talk, and carry themselves at liberty from the strictness of a
          holy walk, and tender conscience.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They have neither heart nor use for the grace and strength that
          is in Christ Jesus, John 5:40; Psalm 81:11, "And therefore they can
          live without him, John 6:67, 68. They may have use for it, that really
          desire to have their lusts mortified, temptations resisted, their
          hearts and lives truly sanctified: but that is not their case. How
          then can they have a heart for it? What heart can they have for
          cleansing and purifying things, that love rather to be wallowing in
          the mire? Therefore the opened fountain of Christ's blood and Spirit
          is neglected. For as the Lord says, Jeremiah 13:27, "I have seen your
          adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your whoredom, and
          your abominations on the hills in the fields: woe unto you, O
          Jerusalem, will you not be made clean? when shall it once be?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Christ is highly displeased with the disobedience of those that
          call him Lord, who will not do what he says, Psalm 50:16â€“22. Men will
          not believe this: they think little of their neglect of what he says,
          and they think that he looks on it as they do. He is their Savior; but
          they consider not, that he is, and will be their Judge. But to
          persuade you of it, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, His infinite purity and holiness, Isaiah 6:3. He is the Holy One
          of Israel. He is of the self-same numerical essence or nature with the
          Father; all the attributes of God, and particularly his holiness, are
          in him, Exodus 23:21, "Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him
          not: for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in
          him." Therefore whatever is in Scripture of the holiness of God,
          belongs to him. And his willingness to receive sinners is, not to save
          them in their sins, but to cleanse them from them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The dreadful strokes he has brought on such as called him Lord,
          for not doing the things that he says. He has in all ages of the
          church set up some monuments of this his displeasure. Whence came the
          fire that devoured Nadab and Abihu; came it not from before the Lord?
          Leviticus 10:1, 2, and was not that the Lord Christ? Acts 7:38. Who
          struck Ananias and Sapphira dead for lying unto God? Korah, Dathan,
          and Abiram, Uzzah, etc.? was it not Christ? John 5:22, "For the Father
          judges no man; but has committed all judgment unto the Son.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Does he not refuse communion with such persons in holy
          ordinances, and thereby testify his displeasure against them? Hosea
          5:15, "I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their
          offence, and seek my face." What will it avail to attend, ordinances,
          to come to a communion table, while we continue in such a case? There
          can be no communion with Christ, Psalm 24:3, 4; Isaiah 1:15, 16. Even
          particular pieces of unrepented-of guilt and untenderness, may be a
          controversy on which he will refuse communion with those that are
          habitually holy: Psalm 66:18, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
          Lord will not hear me." What then can others expect? Amos 3:3, "Can
          two walk together, except they be agreed?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider how he will treat them at the last day: Luke 19:27,
          "Those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them,
          bring hither, and slay them before me." He is the Lamb of God, to take
          away the sins of the world; but he will be as a lion to them that will
          not do what he says, when he comes in flaming fire, taking vengeance
          on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
          Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from
          the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 2
          Thessalonians 1:8, 9. In vain will they then call him Lord, and plead
          their eating and drinking in his presence, Luke 13:25, 26, 27.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. There is a great evil in calling Christ Lord, and not doing what he
          says; an evil that highly provokes him, as casting dishonor on him in
          a very special manner. There is something in it, that, so to speak,
          touches to the quick, beyond the dishonor done to him by others:
          Revelation 3:15, 16, "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor
          hot: I would you were cold or hot. So then because you are lukewarm,
          and neither cold nor hot, I will spue you out of my mouth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Their sins and looseness of life reflect a peculiar dishonor on
          him, as pretending a relation to him: Romans 2:24, "For the name of
          God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you." How do you think
          yourselves touched and affronted with the miscarriages of your
          children and servants? Learn from that, how Christ takes with your
          sins and looseness of life. They are a blaspheming of his name and
          doctrine, calling him, in effect, the minister of sin, 1 Timothy 6:1;
          Titus 2:4, 5. It is not in the power of open enemies to reach him such
          a blow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They do Satan a peculiar pleasure. If there is any of the dust
          that is the serpent's meat, that relishes better with him than the
          rest, it is the sins and miscarriages of those that call Christ Lord:
          that is a feast for him; he will do more for it than for other ten,
          Job 1:7, 8. As there is joy in Heaven at a sinner's repentance, there
          is a joy in Hell among the devil and his angels at the falls of those
          that call Christ Lord. The enemy takes a peculiar pleasure and pride,
          in having not only his own professed servants, but others in Christ's
          livery following and serving him. In that, he can vie with Christ for
          a good master before the blind world, when he can show them so many at
          his back; that sometimes gave their names to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, They wound the heart of the real children of God, and make the
          whole family sigh more heavily, than the sins of others would do,
          Psalm 55:12. Where the sins of open enemies do but scratch like a pin,
          theirs will pierce like a sword, Canticles 1:6. It covers them with
          shame, fills them with sorrow and indignation, and makes them weary of
          their post; as it did the prophet, Jeremiah 9:2, "Oh, that I had in
          the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my
          people, and go from them: for they be all adulterers, an assembly of
          treacherous men." What wonder then, that Christ the master of the
          family resent it dreadfully?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Christ will disown them for his servants, that in their practice
          disown him for their Lord, not doing what he says. They count the duty
          of servants grievous to them, and therefore he will divest them of the
          honor and privilege of his servants. They secretly loath him and his
          service, however fair they carry it, calling him Lord; and he will let
          all the world see that his soul loathes them, Revelation 3:16.
          "Because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue you
          out of my mouth." And this he does two ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Spuing them out of his mouth unto the earth; whereas before they
          were exalted unto Heaven, in respect of hopefulness of their souls'
          case, and of external church-privileges. In Scripture style, the
          church is called Heaven, professors the sons of God: the devil's
          kingdom, or the world lying in wickedness, is called the earth, the
          children of men, Genesis 6:2; and 11:1; Revelation 12:4. The gospel is
          Christ's call to sinners to come out of the world lying in wickedness
          and be separate from them, joining themselves to the church, the
          family of God. Many profess to come away, and join so, and solemnly
          declare it by the partaking of the Lord's table: but though they so
          call him Lord, they do not the things that he says. And our jealous
          Lord being provoked with it spues them out, and in the sight of the
          world throws them back unto the earth they said they came from; and
          there they lie again amidst the world lying in wickedness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Three things concur in this awful dispensation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They are let fall into the mire of some gross pollution of the
          outward man: 2 Peter 2:22, "It is happened unto them, according to the
          true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and, The sow
          that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire." Cain turns a murderer,
          Judas a betrayer of his master, Ananias and Sapphira liars, Demas a
          lover of the world, Jezebel and her children in Thyatira fall into
          adultery and fornication, etc. Revelation 2:20, 21, 22, 23.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Their leaf of appearance in religion falls. Though they get
          space, they get no grace to repent and cover, Revelation 2:21; but
          they are from that time blasted, wither, and fade away: John 15:6, "If
          a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered;
          and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are
          burned." And they turn just the hue of the rest of the world lying in
          wickedness; spiritual death is painted in their faces; whereof this
          generation affords many frightful instances: Luke 8:18, "Take heed
          therefore how you hear: for whoever has, to him shall be given; and
          whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to
          have."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Hence they lose their new name, and get their old one back again.
          What credit or reputation they had for religion and seriousness, is
          blown up. Their name stinks in that case among the serious godly, and
          they look upon them as none of theirs, Isaiah 65:15, "And you shall
          leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord shall slay
          you, and call his servants by another name." This is an awful case,
          Zechariah 11:8. "Three shepherds also I cut off in one month, and my
          soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Spueing them out of his mouth into the pit, at the last day:
          Luke 13:27, 28. "He shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence you
          are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity. There shall be
          weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac,
          and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you
          yourselves thrust out." In vain will they then cry, "Lord, Lord open
          to us: Matthew 25:11, 12, "Afterward came also the other virgins,
          saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us. But he answered and said, Truly I
          say unto you, I know you not." In vain will they plead their eating
          and drinking in his presence. They called him Lord; but they walked
          with the workers of iniquity, and they will be led forth with them:
          Psalm 125:5, "As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the
          Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity" They will see
          that he will count it inconsistent with his honor to own them: Mark
          8:38, "Whoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this
          audulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be
          ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father, with the holy
          angels." They got their names enrolled in the visible church, among
          his servants; but he will blot them out publicly: Exodus 32:33, "And
          the Lord said unto Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I
          blot out of my book." Compared with Revelation 3:5, "He who overcomes,
          the same shall be clothed in white clothing; and I will not blot out
          his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before
          my Father, and before his angels."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Men are ruined in this way, because they do not consider it. It is
          want of consideration that leaves them at ease, calling Christ Lord,
          and yet not doing what he says: Isaiah 44:20, "He feeds on ashes: a
          deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul,
          nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?" They are out of their
          place, like a wandering bird, Proverbs 27:8; and they are easy in it,
          because they are out of themselves, out of their wits, like the
          prodigal, Luke 15:17. They consider not this matter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, They call Christ Lord, and so bribe and soothe their blind and
          sleepy consciences. If they should give up with all pretensions to
          Christ and religion, they could have no peace with their consciences:
          therefore they will attend ordinances; hear the word, though they will
          not do it; pray in secret or in their families, though perhaps out of
          the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing; they will partake of
          the Lord's table, though they will not give up with the table of
          devils. These things flatter their consciences to be easy; as was the
          case with Micah, Judg. 17:13, "Then said Micah, Now know I that the
          Lord will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They do not the things that he says however, and so satisfy
          their unmortified lusts. Thus they please both parties within them.
          Their saying fair pleases their conscience; and their not doing what
          Christ says, pleases their lusts. They have no more ado with Christ,
          but to be called by his name. For the rest, they will "eat their own
          bread, and wear their own apparel," and will not make their religion
          burdensome to their lusts by mortification and tender walking; and so
          they are easy on that side.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">But there are three things they do not consider.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) What inconsistency is in this course: 2 Corinthians 6:14, 15,
          "What fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
          communion has light with darkness? and what concord has Christ with
          Belial?" It is made up of contradictions. Their profession condemns
          their practice as abominable; and their practice condemns their
          profession as horrid juggling and dissembling with God. You pray for
          pardon of sin as a crime, and yet return to it with delight: that God
          would make you holy; and yet you will not part with your lusts, but
          have a horror of being bound up to a holy walk: that God would at
          length receive you into Heaven; and yet if you were there even now in
          the temper you are in, you would flee out of it as from a Hell,
          because you have not relish of either person or thing that is there,
          and for nothing but what is not there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) How heinously the Lord Christ takes it, that men should yoke
          Satan's service with his, 2 Corinthians 6:15, forfeited. He looks on
          it as highly dishonorable to him, and after a sort more than if they
          should profess themselves none of his, Revelation 3:16, forfeited.
          That is an awful word of great indignation, Ezekiel 20:39; "As for
          you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord God, Go you, serve you
          every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not hearken unto
          me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with
          your idols." It bears, that their duties are but a polluting of his
          name. Your praying, hearing, and communicating will not cleanse the
          abomination of a loose life: but looseness of conversation will defile
          all these, Hag. 2:12â€“14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) What the end of such a course will be, what it will issue in at
          length: Deuteronomy 32:29, "O that they were wise, that they
          understood this, that they would consider their latter end!" It cannot
          miss of a fearful issue: Isaiah 50:11, "Behold, all you that kindle a
          fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of
          your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled. This shall you
          have of mine hand, you shall lie down in sorrow." Psalm 125:5, "As for
          such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them
          forth with the workers of iniquity." See it in the parable of the
          foolish builder, the foolish virgins, the tares among the wheat, the
          man at the marriage-supper without the wedding-garment, etc. It is
          pity men should not consider timely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Lastly, People ought to consider it, see what account they can make
          of it, and how they will answer it. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, How they will answer it to their own consciences. Conscience may
          be asleep now, but it will certainly awaken: and the longer it be in
          awakening, it will be the more severe when it is roused, as in the
          case of Belshazzar and Felix. You cannot shun a reckoning with your
          conscience. As silent as it is, you will find it has marked your ways
          in its book: Proverbs 20:27, "The spirit of man is the candle of the
          Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly." And if conscience
          condemn you as hypocritical pretenders to Christ, what will come of
          you? 1 John 3:20, "For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than
          our heart, and knows all things." And if you die with an ill
          conscience, it will be a gnawing worm forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, How they will answer it to the Lord Christ in the judgment.
          There will be a day of judgment, wherein the tribunal will be set, the
          books opened, and men's whole lives will be called over: Ecclesiastes
          12:14, "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
          secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." And every
          one will be judged according to his works: 2 Corinthians 5:10, "For we
          must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may
          receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done,
          whether it be good or bad" Then men's calling Christ Lord, will be
          tried by their doing or not doing the things that he says. And what
          will men then say to the question in the text, "Why call you me Lord,
          Lord, and do not the things that I say?" and to that question, "How
          came you in hither, not having a wedding-garment?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. I come now to a word of Application.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, Let me examine into this matter, and ask and put it to every
          one's conscience before the Lord, Why call you Christ Lord, and do not
          the things that he says? You are rational creatures; you will not
          allow that you are fools, that have no reason for what you do, or not
          do. Therefore "produce your cause, says the Lord; bring forth your
          strong reasons, says the King of Jacob, Isaiah 41:21. What is your
          plea? Is it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. We are saved by faith, and not by good works?</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. I have answered that already, that though the weight of our
          acceptance with God, lies not on good works, yet the weight of our
          evidence does. I add, that though we are not saved by, yet we are
          saved to, good works and obedience: Ephesians 2:10, "For we are his
          workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has
          before ordained that we should walk in them, 1 Peter 1:2, "Elect
          according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
          sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the
          blood of Jesus Christ," etc. So if you are not brought to do what
          Christ says, you are not saved. But perhaps you will insist, and say,
          O but we will be saved after death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. If you be not saved while you are in life, you will never be
          saved after death. The notion of salvation begun after death, is
          unknown to the Bible: Ephesians 2:8, "For by grace are you saved,
          through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God," 2
          Timothy 1:9, "Who have saved us, and called us with a holy calling,
          not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
          grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began,"
          Titus 3:5, "Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but
          according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and
          renewing of the Holy Spirit."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. We have no strength in ourselves.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. That also I have answered at large. If the law came to you
          with its commands without the gospel, there would be something in
          this, though not so much but the law would overthrow it; as in the
          case of pagans, Romans 2:12, "For as many as have sinned without law,
          shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law,
          shall be judged by the law." But since the gospel comes with the law,
          telling you there is ability for it in Christ, which you may have by
          faith; your plea is rejected, and you are condemned, not only for not
          doing what Christ says, but for refusing strength to do it with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We do several things, and there is no body but has failings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. You may do many things, as Herod, Mark 6:20: but if you set
          not yourselves to do all the parts of Christ's will known to you,
          without reserve, you do nothing: James 2:10, "For whoever shall keep
          the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
          Sound believers fail of degrees, but not of the parts: Psalm 119:6,
          David said "I have respect unto all your commandments," Acts 13:22, "I
          have found David the son of Jesse; a man after mine own heart, which
          shall fulfill all my will"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. God is merciful, and Christ is our gracious Savior; we trust he
          will not be severe on us for our sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. That is a trust in God and Christ, not upon his word, but over
          the belly of his word; so that either it must fail and disappoint you,
          or God's truth must fail: Hebrews 12:14, "Without holiness no man
          shall see the Lord," Psalm 125:5, "As for such as turn aside unto
          their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of
          iniquity," "But his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle,
          and it shall bring him to the king of terrors," Job 18:14. Is that the
          use you have for the mercy of God? Psalm 130:4. and for the grace of
          Christ? See the character of such, Jude 4, "There are certain men
          crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this
          condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into
          laciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. What needs all that strictness of life in our case: we are neither
          ministers nor elders, to have any character of that sort to support?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. It is evident, that many take a liberty in sinful practices
          from this; practices which they would condemn in them, though they
          allow them in themselves. Ministers and elders un-tender and loose in
          their life and practice, shall bear their judgment, as betrayers of
          the cause of religion to an ungodly world. But it will be no comfort
          to you to go to Hell with unholy ministers and elders. And therefore
          you must either take the strait way with godly and tender ministers
          and elders to Heaven; or else, in the first place, find out in your
          Bible, where the strait way to Heaven is only for ministers and
          elders, but there is a wide way to it for others. You must seek
          another Bible for it; for this mentions but one strait way to Heaven,
          for you and them both: Matthew 7:13. 14. "Enter you in at the strait
          gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to
          destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is
          the gate and narrow is the way that leads unto life, and few there be
          that find it." But if you belong to Christ, you bear a character as
          venerable as that of a minister: you are priests, 1. Peter 2:9.
          Revelation 1:6. Hebrews 12:23. If you say, You are not so much as
          professors:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Are you Christians or not? If you be, set yourselves to answer
          that profession, and no more is required of you; or else why do you
          profess so much?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, But we hope to repent, reform, and find mercy, before we
          die.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. When? The young when they grow old, and the old when they come
          to a death-bed. And who has secured you that you shall see another
          day? Not God, I am sure: Hebrews 3:7. "The Holy Spirit says, Today if
          you will hear his voice." And if you should be old, and get a
          death-bed to lie in a while, how know you that you will get grace to
          repent? Truly it is not God's ordinary way: Job. 20:11. "His bones are
          full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the
          dust."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Let me expostulate this matter with you, how you come to
          call Christ Lord, and do not the things that he says.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Do you think that religion is just a matter of form and fair show,
          to say prayers, and come to the church on the sabbath, etc. not
          carrying it through the whole of your walk? If you do, you will show
          yourselves void of it, 2. Timothy 3:5. Galatians 6:12. Isaiah 58:5, 6,
          7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Do you not mock the Lord Christ by this, and, like Judas, betray
          him with a kiss, Matthew 26:49. But "be not deceived; God is not
          mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap," Galatians
          6:7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Have you no regard to the honor of Christ? If he is your Lord and
          you expect salvation by him, what hearts have you that cannot be moved
          thereby, to live to his praise, and be useful for him in the world?
          They who have no use for holy walking, after salvation is secured by
          Christ, are surely far from salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Is not the cause of Christ and religion much the worse of you?
          Romans 2:24. "For the name of God is blasphemed through you." Do you
          call him Lord, that you may have the more access to affront and
          dishonor him? Do you join yourselves to the church and kingdom of
          Christ, that you may by such compliance advance the interests of
          Satan's kingdom?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Has Christ's character as a Lord no weight on your consciences? Do
          you think it is a mere empty title? you will find it otherwise:
          Malachi 1:6. "If I be a father, where is mine honor? and if I be a
          master, where is my fear? says the Lord of Hosts." Luke 19:27. "But
          those mine enemies which would that I should reign over them, bring
          hither and slay them before me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, How will we answer it at the great day? If you think it is
          long to that, it will be longer after, that it will sit in your con
          sciences and gnaw, that you called him Lord, and did not the things
          that he said: and it may he a very short while, that it might be in
          your power to get things put in better case for that day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I shall conclude with a few advices.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Examine yourselves, and search out your sins sincerely, as in the
          sight of God: Hag. 1:7. "Thus says the Lord of hosts, Consider your
          ways. Look into the several parts and periods of your life, and see
          how they have been led. Look into your public and private walk; into
          your relations, how you have carried as a husband, wife, etc; into
          both tables of the law, how you have behaved towards God, and towards
          man; into your sins of omission and comission, your secret sins that
          are hidden from the eyes of the world, the sin that is your particular
          bias. Look into your heart-sins: and trace up all to the sin of your
          nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Seeing yourself a sinful, ruined creature, solemnly take hold of
          the covenant of grace, personally entering into it by embracing Christ
          offered to you in the gospel, trusting in him as your Savior, for his
          whole salvation from sin, and from wrath, on the ground of God's
          faithfulness in the promise; thus going to Christ for your
          sanctification, as well as justification; to purge you from the filth
          as well as the guilt of sin, 1 Corinthians 1:30, receiving and eying
          him in all his offices.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly, Lay down an honest purpose and resolution, in the faith of
          the grace and strength in Christ Jesus, offered and exhibited to you
          in the gospel, and provided in the covenant, to comply henceforth with
          the whole will of Christ declared to you in his word, without
          exception or reserve; to subject your souls wholly to the authority of
          his word, to comply with every duty therein made known to you, and to
          fight against every sin there discovered to you. So shall you call him
          Lord, and he call you his servants, Acts 11:23; Psalm 119:112.
