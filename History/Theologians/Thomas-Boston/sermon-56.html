        <p align="justify"></p>
        <p align="justify">
          Several Sermons Preached at Ettrick, in the Year 1717.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Luke 13:5. "I tell you, No! but unless you repent, you shall all
          likewise perish!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          WHEN we consider the abounding sin and hardness of heart prevailing
          under a preached gospel, it must needs let us see, that the doctrine
          of repentance is both necessary and seasonable, to pluck the brands
          out of the burning; or if that will not do, to leave men without
          excuse. Sinners stave off repentance, as if they were resolved to
          persist in sin come what will, or at least as halting between two
          opinions: But here is a peremptory decision of the case in this text,
          "I tell you, Nay: but except you repent, you shall all likewise
          perish."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In these words we have two things.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. An abuse of a dispensation of providence corrected: "I tell you,
          Nay." Some had told our Lord the news of Pilate the Roman governor's
          falling on some Galileans, with his soldiers, and killing them, while
          they were sacrificing. It seems the tellers of this news, or others in
          the company, were apt to think, that these were sinners beyond others,
          because an unordinary judgment had fallen on them. Our Lord tells
          them, that it would not bear such a conclusion. He puts them in mind
          of another remarkable providence, namely, the tower of Siloam in
          Jerusalem its falling on and killing eighteen persons: but here he
          shows that this did not befall them, because they were greater sinners
          than all the rest in Jerusalem; nay there were as great sinners as
          those, which missed that stroke, and others like it too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The right use of the dispensation instructed: "But except you
          repent, you shall all likewise perish." The right use is to learn
          repentance from the ruin of others; if others give us an example at
          their own cost, that we take heed to it and improve it to our
          repentance and reformation. This is the import of the particle but.
          These words are a peremptory certification given to sinners by our
          Lord. And the proposition in its own nature includes a twofold
          certification.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, A certification of ruin upon impenitence. Sinners go on in their
          course, yet hope that all may be well. No, says our Lord, deceive not
          yourselves; for if you do not repent, there is no hope of saving you.
          There is here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The matter on which the certification is given, "Except you
          repent;" that is, If you do not repent, if you be not duly humbled for
          your sins, and sincerely turn from them. If you harden your hearts
          under your guilt, keep still your sinful courses, and refuse to let
          them go, they will ruin you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The thing certified, which is perishing likewise; not perishing
          in that very manner, but you shall perish as surely as they did. The
          judgments of God shall pursue you, and you shall perish forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The extent of the certification, "All—perish." This clears the
          perishing to be meant of everlasting death. Though signal temporal
          judgments do pursue all that are impenitent, yet eternal punishment
          will; no impenitent sinner shall escape that, however they may escape
          temporal strokes of signal vengeance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) The peremptoriness of it. This appears in two things. 1. That
          solemn assertion, "I tell you," supposed to be repeated in the last
          clause. Take it out of the mouth of the Lord himself, that you shall
          perish except you repent. This has been told you by many, but you
          would not believe: but now I tell it you out of my own mouth. And to
          hear this out of the mouth of the Savior, may strike a sinner with
          concern, and let him see, that Christ's blood will never be laid out
          on a person continuing impenitent, to save him from death. 2. In the
          relation intimate to be between the punishment of those so signally
          smitten by the hand of God, and the future punishment of all
          impenitent sinners; the former is a pledge of the latter. This is
          intimated by the particle likewise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, A certification of life and repentance. This is implied here as
          Genesis 2:17. God has made as sure connection between repentance and
          life, as between impenitence and death. Be your sins never so great,
          if you repent of them, and turn from them, they shall never be your
          ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Before I come to the main point I design, I shall lay before you some
          observations from the words.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Obs. 1. That those who meet with more signal strokes than others, are
          not therefore, nor are to be accounted greater sinners than others.
          The Lord spares some as great sinners, as he signally punishes, I tell
          you, nay.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Reasons of this dispensation of Providence.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because of God's sovereign power and absolute dominion, which he
          will have the world to understand: Matthew, 20:15. "Is it not lawful
          for me to do what I will with mine own?" Thus our Lord accounts for
          the dispensation of the man's being born blind, John 9:3. All men have
          that in them and about them, which may make them liable to the
          heaviest strokes that any of the children of men meet with; And
          therefore whatever any suffer, the Lord does them no wrong, since he
          punishes them less than their iniquity deserves: but among many whom
          justice may strike, sovereignty picks out some, and causes them to
          smart. And who may say, "what do you?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because we are now under the mixed dispensation of providence; not
          the unmixed, reserved to another world, when all men shall be put into
          their unalterable state. Now, hereunto this is very agreeable that God
          signally punish some of a society, while others as guilty do escape,
          that the whole may, with David, Psalm 101:1, "sing of mercy and
          judgment too." And thus the dispensation of divers colors is held up
          in the world, as a display of the manifold wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because the mercy of God to some is magnified by his severity on
          others. As black set by white makes the white appear the better; so
          God's severity against some, may be a looking-glass to others, wherein
          they may see how much they stand obliged to free grace and mercy,
          Romans 11:22. Men are never fairer to prize health in themselves, than
          when they see others tossed on sick beds; nor to prize the exercise of
          sense and reason, and other mercies, than when they see what miserable
          and pitiful sights they are that are deprived of these. And this
          should make folk patient and thankful under the strokes of the Lord's
          hand, because if he take away a mercy, health for instance, or perhaps
          a member or limb of their body, being taken away, it may be more
          serviceable for him, than when they had it, in so far as it shall
          serve to magnify the mercy of God to others, that see and notice the
          hand of the Lord. See Matthew 21:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because in very signal strokes very signal mercies may be wrapped
          up. So it was in Joseph's case; there was a very singular blessing on
          the head of him that was separated from his brethren. Job's troubles
          were but a dark hour before a very glorious day. The halt Jacob got in
          his thigh, was more excellent, as a badge of his wrestling with the
          angel, than Esau's retinue of four hundred men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, Because this dispensation is in some sort necessary to
          confirm us in the belief of the judgment of the great day. God
          punishes some remarkably, that the world may see that there is a God
          that judges on the earth; he does not so punish all, that men may be
          assured that there is a judgment to come. If none were punished here,
          the world would improve that for Atheism; if all were punished, it
          would be improved to Sadducism.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Then learn that unordinary strokes may befall those that are
          not unordinary sinners; and therefore be not rash in your judgment
          concerning the strokes that others meet with. It is true, whatever we
          or others meet with, it is deserved at the Lord's hand; and when God
          follows an unordinary seen sin with an unordinary judgment, as in the
          case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, it is no breach of charity to judge
          that that stroke comes for that sin. But when people, in whose
          conversation you see no signal sin, meet with signal strokes, beware
          of harsh judging. For in the way of the Lord's dispensation, some will
          meet with a signal stroke for some sin, such as the world would think
          little or nothing of, if they knew it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Then adore the mercy of God to you, and wonder at his sparing you,
          when you see others smart under the hand of God, which you do not
          feel. Acknowledge, that whatever others meet with, the same might have
          been your lot, if the Lord had dealt with you as you deserve; as the
          church did, Lamentations 3:22, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we
          are not consumed, because his compassions fail not."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Obs. 2. That the strokes which any meet with, are pledges of ruin to
          impenitent sinners. But "Except you repent, you shall all likewise
          perish."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Reasons of this are,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because they show how hateful to God sin is, in whoever it is:
          Isaiah 42:24, "Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers?
          did not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
          walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law." God has no
          delight in the misery of his own creatures, Ezekiel 18:23. He must
          therefore have a mighty hatred against sin, in that he is so heavy
          oftentimes on the work of his own hands for it. Not only his enemies
          smart for sin, but his dear friends; yes, his dear Son smarted for it,
          when it lay on him but by imputation. And therefore how can impenitent
          sinners think to escape? Luke 23:31, "For if they do these things in a
          green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because they show how just God is. He is the Judge of all the
          earth, and cannot but do right, Genesis 18:25. Now, though justice may
          delay the punishment of one longer than another, yet it will not allow
          to punish some, and forever to spare others, in the same state. For
          that would be manifest partiality, which God hates, Ezekiel 18:20. And
          therefore the apostle tells us, 2 Thessalonians 1:6. that "it is a
          righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that
          trouble" the saints.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because whatever any meet with in the way of sin, is really
          designed for warning to others, as is clear from the text. See 1
          Corinthians 10:11, 12. And they that will not be taught by the example
          of others, may expect to be made examples to teach others, as Lot's
          wife was. But the wise will have their eyes in their head, while
          impenitent sinners pass on and perish, as those that will not take,
          warning. Hence it comes to pass, that the stroke afar off not
          prevailing, is oftentimes brought nearer home.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Because all those strokes which sinners meet with in this
          life, are the spittings of the shower of wrath that abides the
          impenitent world, after which the full shower may certainly be looked
          for. As the joys in believing are the pledges of eternal joy, flowing
          from one fountain with it; the first-fruits of Canaan's land, which
          will be followed with the full harvest: so all the outlettings of
          God's wrath on sinners here, are the pledges of eternal wrath, and
          first-fruits of Hell, which will be followed with the harvest of
          misery, being the same in kind, Revelation 20:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Be not unconcerned spectators of all the effects of God's anger
          for sin going abroad in the world; for your part and mine is deep in
          them. There is none of them but says to us, as in the same
          condemnation, "Except you repent, you shall all likewise perish." O
          how unconcernedly do many look on the miseries of others, how far are
          they from taking a lesson to themselves therefrom! But a hard heart
          and seared conscience, which cannot be awakened by the dispensations
          of providence far off from them, do but invite the heavy stroke to
          fall on themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider, O impenitent sinners, how can you escape, when your ruin
          is insured by so many pledges thereof from the Lord's hand, while you
          go on in sin? When a sinner goes out of God's way, he leaves his soul
          in pawn for his return by repentance; but the impenitent sinner never
          returns to loose his pawn, and so loses it. When God lets out any of
          his wrath in any measure on the children of men, that is God's pawn
          for his bringing eternal wrath on the impenitent; and we may be sure,
          that however careless we be of our pawns, God will not lose his.
          Therefore consider your ways, and repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Obs. 3. The strokes that others meet with, are loud calls to to us to
          repent. That is the language of all the afflicting providences which
          we see going on in the world. To confirm this, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. God does not strike one for sin with a visible stroke, but with an
          eye to all. The reason which God gives in his law for punishing some
          transgressors severely, is, that "all Israel might hear, and fear, and
          do no such thing." In the infancy of the Jewish church, he consumed
          Nadab and Abihu with fire, Leviticus 10:2 compared with verse 9. In
          the infancy of the Christian church, Ananias and Sapphira were struck
          dead for a lie. Why all this, but to be a warning to all that should
          come after?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Thereby we may see how dangerous a thing sin is to be harbored; and
          if we will look inward, we may ever see, that there is sin in us also
          against the God of Israel. If we saw one stung by a serpent which he
          had taken up, would not we quickly throw away one which we had taken
          up too, lest we should fare no better? How can we think to prosper in
          that way, where we see it goes so very ill with others?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. We may see that none go on impenitently in a sinful course, but
          over the belly of thousands of calls from Providence to repent,
          besides all those they have from the word. Look abroad into the world,
          O sinner, and consider how many have fallen into ruin, and are still
          falling by their iniquity. As many as there are of these, so many
          mouths are there calling you to repent, and turn from your sin. "Who
          did ever harden himself against God, and prosper?" And do you think,
          that your case shall be an exception to the general rule? No; so many
          witnesses give their testimony to you, that "except you repent, you
          shall likewise perish."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Impenitency under the gospel cannot have the least shadow of
          excuse. The calls of Providence common to the whole world, are
          sufficient to leave the very heathens without excuse, Romans 1:20: how
          much more shall the calls of the word and Providence too make us
          inexcusable, if we do not repent? Sinners make many shifts for
          themselves, to preserve the life of their lusts, and to keep
          themselves from this unpleasant exercise: but they will be but
          fig-leaf covers before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. How much more do strokes from the hand of the Lord on ourselves
          call us to repent? Hosea 2:6, 7, "Therefore behold, I will hedge up
          your way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her
          paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
          overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then
          shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was
          it better with me than now." What Absalom's design was in burning
          Joab's corn-field, is the design of afflicting providences. And
          therefore impenitency and hardness of heart under the strokes of the
          Lord's hand, is highly aggravated, Jeremiah 5:3. Every cross that we
          meet with, is a charge from Heaven to turn from our sinful course, and
          from the particular ills of our way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I come now to the principal doctrine of the text.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. Sinners, except they repent, shall perish. This is an except
          without any exception. Be who they will, if they be sinners, they must
          repent or perish. All are sinners, and by sin depart from God; and
          they must come back again to him by repentance, else they are forever
          ruined. Be they sinners of a greater or lesser size, they must be
          penitent sinners, or it had been better for them they had never been
          born.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Explain the nature of repentance.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall explain the nature of repentance. And here we may consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. What it is in its general nature.</p>
        <p align="justify">2. How it is wrought in the soul.</p>
        <p align="justify">3. The subject of true repentance.</p>
        <p align="justify">4. The parts of repentance.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          FIRST, We may consider what repentance is in its general nature. It is
          a saying grace: 2 Timothy 2:25, "In meekness instructing those that
          oppose themselves; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the
          acknowledging of the truth." It is a grace given us of God freely,
          enabling and disposing a soul to all the acts of turning from sin unto
          God; and it is saying, as in its own nature distinguishing a man from
          a hypocrite, and having a sure connection with eternal salvation. To
          unfold this more particularly, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is not a transient action, as Papists and some ignorant
          creatures imagine, as if a sigh for sin, an act of sorrow for it, a
          confession of it with a "God be merciful to me a sinner," were
          repentance. No, no; these may be acts of repentance while they proceed
          from a truly penitent heart. But repentance itself is not a passing
          act, but an abiding grace, Zechariah 12:10; a continuing frame and
          disposition of the soul; a principle lying deep in the heart,
          disposing a man to mourn for and turn from sin on all occasions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is not a passing work of the first days of one's religion, as
          some professors take it to be; but a grace in the heart, setting one
          to an answerable working all the days of his life. It is a spring of
          waters of sorrow in the heart for sin, which will spring up there
          while sin is there, though sometimes through hardness of heart it may
          be stopped for a while. They that look on repentance as the first
          stage in the way to Heaven, and looking back to the sorrowful hours
          which they had when the Lord first began to deal with them, reckon
          that they have passed the first stage, are in a dangerous condition.
          And whoever endeavors not to carry on their repentance, I doubt if
          they ever at all repented yet. As when Moses had smote the rock in the
          wilderness, and the waters began to gush out, those waters ran (it is
          thought, 1 Corinthians 10:4.) and followed them while in the
          wilderness: so the heart first smitten with repentance for sin at the
          soul's first conversion to God, the wound still bleeds, and is never
          bound up to bleed no more, until the band of glory be put about it in
          Heaven, Revelation 21:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Hence initial and progressive repentance, though the former be the
          repentance of a sinner, the latter of a saint, are no more different
          kinds of repentance, than the soul's virgin love to Christ, and their
          love to him through the course of their spiritual marriage with him;
          or than faith in its first, and after actings. But as the mid-day and
          evening sun are the same with the morning sun, so are these; though
          the rising morning sun may be most noticed by the traveler, who having
          traveled in the night, was thereby brought from darkness to light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is not a common grace, but a special saving one. Men may have a
          repentance for their sin, gnawing their consciences, and tormenting
          their hearts, which they will carry on in Hell through eternity: being
          only the first movings of the worm in the soul that never dies: as
          Judas's repentance seems to have been Simon Magus's and Pharaoh's.
          They may bitterly rue their sin, as Esau, Genesis 27:34 who never
          truly repent of it, Hebrews 12:17; and the stony heart may be broken
          in a thousand pieces, while yet every piece remains a stone. They may
          have a superficial sorrow for sin, and a light joy succeeding it,
          whose hearts were never pierced to the quick; and therefore the joy
          goes, as the effects of a scud of rain on the parched ground, Matthew
          13:20, 21. But true repentance is a repentance never repented of,
          kindly working in the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          SECONDLY, We may consider how repentance is wrought in the soul. And
          here two questions must be answered, and two points cleared, namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Who works repentance, or is the author of it? And that is the
          sanctifying Spirit of Jesus Christ: Zechariah 12:13. "And I will pour
          upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
          spirit of grace and of supplications, and they shall look upon me whom
          they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his
          only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
          bitterness for his first-born." Sometimes notorious prodigals become
          true penitents; as a persecuting Saul turned to be a preaching Paul:
          so that the world is amazed with the change, and are ready to say as
          in Saul's case, 1 Samuel 10:11. "What is this that is come unto the
          son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? But that query, verse
          12. "But who is their father?" gives a rational account of the matter.
          All sort of timber to divine grace is alike easy to hew. And forasmuch
          as the house of God is ordinarily built of the knottiest wood,
          publicans and harlots entering into the kingdom of God before Scribes
          and Pharisees, it may plainly appear, that repentance is not the work
          of nature, but of grace; not of men's own spirit, but Christ's Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is evident from the word, Jeremiah 13:21, "Can the Ethiopian
          change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good,
          that are accustomed to do evil." It is the Lord's own work to "take
          away the stony heart, and give an heart of flesh," Ezekiel 36:26. It
          is the office of the exalted Mediator to give repentance, in whose
          hand it is to send the Spirit, Acts 5:31. Ministers may preach
          repentance, but cannot work in it themselves, and far less in others.
          They may sow the seed, but cannot make it grow, 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7.
          It is but a perhaps if God give repentance, when they have done their
          utmost, 2 Timothy 2:25. But if at all their weapons be mighty, it is
          through God, 2 Corinthians 10:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. By what means does the Spirit work repentance? That is by the word,
          whether read or preached. The word is the channel wherein the
          influences of the Spirit flow; and from these it has its piercing,
          melting, and heart-softening virtue, as the pool of Bethesda had its
          healing virtue from the angel's troubling the water: Acts 11:20, 21.
          "And some of them were men of Cyprus, and Cyrene, which when they were
          come to Antioch, spoke unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
          And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed,
          and turned unto the Lord." Junius, who was deeply plunged in Atheism,
          was brought to repentance by reading John 1. in a New Testament which
          his father had purposely laid down in his chamber, if perhaps he might
          take it up and read it. Augustine was converted by reading Romans
          13:13, 14. "Let us walk honestly as in the day; not in rioting and
          drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
          envying. But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision
          for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof." Three thousand we find
          were wrought on by one sermon, Acts 2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many and various are the occasions of repentance, which the Lord
          blesses for bringing home the word to the soul, and the soul by it
          unto God. Personal afflictions have been so in the case of many, Hosea
          2:7. The sight of strokes on others has been blessed to some. The
          first occasion of Luther's turning serious was a fright by the violent
          death of a dear companion of his. Nay, God has made falls into gross
          sins occasions of repentance unto many, whereof there are several
          instances, as Achan, the thief on the cross, etc. Flavel gives an
          account of one, in the case of an attempt of self-murder. Augustine
          heard a voice, saying, "Take up, and read." Nay, God can make a dream
          in the night such an occasion, Job 33:15, 16. But these are not
          properly the means, but the occasions which bring men to consider of
          the word, which is the true and proper means. And here the Spirit of
          the Lord makes use of both parts of the word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The law, to break the hard heart: Jeremiah 23:29, "Is not my
          word—like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? says the Lord" It
          goes before like John Baptist to prepare the way of the Lord into the
          heart. And the Spirit of the Lord making use of it in a soul, is
          called "the Spirit of bondage," Romans 8:15. And here each part of the
          law has its proper use.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The commands of it, to convince the soul of sin: Romans 7:7, I
          had not known sin," says the apostle, "but by the law: for I had not
          known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet." The
          commands of the law, held forth to the soul in their spirituality and
          vast extent, are the looking-glass wherein the sinner is made to see
          his black face, the sins and sinfulness of his nature, heart, and
          life, which he must repent of.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The threatenings of it, to convince the soul of judgment:
          Galatians 3:10, "As many as are of the works of the law, are under the
          curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in
          all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." These
          carried home on the soul, disturb its rest in sin, and let the man see
          that he has been sleeping within the sea-mark of divine vengeance, and
          so give him a frightful wakening. These discover the danger of sin for
          time and eternity, and tell him that he must turn over a new leaf,
          else he is ruined.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The gospel, to melt the hard heart like a fire, Jeremiah 23:29,
          "Is not my word like as a fire? says the Lord; and so to bow and bend
          it from sin towards God," Zechariah 12:10, "And I will pour upon the
          house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of
          grace and of supplications, and they shall look upon me whom they have
          pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son,
          and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for
          his first-born." Thus the soul that was driven by the law, is kindly
          led and drawn by the gospel to repentance. The law serves to make a
          terrible reel in the conscience and affections: but the gospel is
          Christ's key to open the heart, and to turn about the will that he may
          come in, Galatians 3:2. The stormy wind, and earthquake, may go before
          in the law; but the still small voice of the gospel is that which the
          Lord is in. This is evident, if you consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) That repentance is the doctrine of the gospel. I do indeed think,
          that it cannot be denied but that the law requires repentance as a
          duty, in so far as it binds the apostate sinner to return to God: but
          in the meantime it gives no hope of mercy to the penitent, seeing its
          constant voice is, "Cursed is every one that continues not in all
          things which are written in the book of the law to do them." But the
          gospel gives the glad tidings of place for repentance, and shows how
          the apostate creature returning will be accepted. And there can be no
          true returning to God, where there is no hope of acceptance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Repentance is a promise of the covenant of grace: Ezekiel 36:31,
          "Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were
          not good, and shall loath yourselves in your own sight, for your
          iniquities, and for your abominations." It is not only the duty of
          God's elect, but their privilege, made over to them in Jesus Christ,
          purchased by his death, and bestowed on them by virtue of his
          exaltation, Acts 5:31. And hence, as one of the benefits of that
          covenant, it is sealed in baptism, Mark 1:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The sum of what is said on this second head, is, that repentance is an
          evangelical softness of heart, and bent of spirit to turn away from
          sin, and to turn to God, wrought in a soul by the Spirit of Christ.
          The Spirit of holiness being given to Christ without measure, he puts
          the same Spirit in his elect in the day of his power; who by his grace
          melts the heart for sin, and bends it away from sin to holiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Repentance is not a man's taking up himself, in the point of
          his outward conversation. It is one thing to reform the life, another
          to reform the heart, by changing the will. The former is within the
          reach of mere nature, the other is not to be effected but by a
          supernatural hand, Jeremiah 31:18. The former may make one a painted
          sepulcher, the latter makes him a new creature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Legal repentance is no true repentance: and therefore though one
          have it, he may perish; as Pharaoh, Judas, etc. It makes a fretful
          restless conscience under the terror of God's wrath but mean while it
          leaves a hard heart, glued to sin. The law and its terrors coming into
          a sinful soul, may raise the dust ready to choke the sinner, as in a
          house when a sweeping; but it will never be made clean, unless the
          gospel have its efficacy on the heart, as the water which lays that
          dust. Hence it comes to pass, that sinners sometimes have sharp
          convictions, but mean while their lusts grow as rampant as ever after.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. See the folly of delaying repentance, and not striking in with the
          motions of the Spirit, when one has them. How do people put off
          repentance from time to time, as if it were wholly in their power to
          do it at any time! But they that cannot command wind and tide, have
          need to fall in with them while they serve, least if they go, they be
          left hopeless. O delay not, lest the Spirit of the Lord be provoked to
          depart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Learn whom you are to look to for repentance. It is the
          work of the Lord's Spirit; and unto him you are to look for his grace
          to loose the bands of wickedness, to soften the hard heart, and to
          turn you to himself, Jeremiah 31:18.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, We may consider the subject of true repentance, what it is.
          It is a convinced believing soul. An unconvinced sinner cannot be a
          true penitent; for what the eye sees not, the heart rues not. Neither
          can an unbelieving sinner be so; for without faith the heart may be
          rent for sin, but not from it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, The soul wherein true repentance is wrought, is a convinced
          soul: Job 36:9, 10, "He showoth them their work, and their
          transgressions that they have exceeded. He opens also their ear to
          discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity." Acts 2:37.
          38, "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
          said unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren,
          what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized
          every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
          sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." The first
          particular work in the creation was making light; and the letting in a
          new light by conviction, is the first work in the new creation. God
          begins his work, where Satan ends his; who having got the soul asleep
          in the arms of its lusts, shuts the windows, and draws the curtains,
          that it may sleep sound, until it awaken in bell. But the Spirit of
          the Lord by conviction opens them, and awakens the sinner ordinarily,
          if not always, in a fright. Here consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. How this conviction is wrought. It is done by the erecting of a
          criminal court within the sinner's own breast, which the man cannot
          absent himself from, more than he can go out of himself. He must stay
          and answer, unless he prevail with the judge to let fall the process;
          as, alas! many do by silencing their consciences one way or other to
          their own ruin. And in this court,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The Spirit of the Lord, awakening the sleepy conscience, sets it
          upon the bench, so that the man becomes his own judge: John 16:8, "And
          when he [the Comforter] is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and
          of righteousness, and of judgment." The man searches and tries his own
          heart and life, which was before neglected as the sluggard's garden.
          But now every corner thereof is ransacked, and secret things set in
          the light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The man is convicted as a sinner by the law. His nature, heart,
          and life brought to the holy law and compared with it, he is found
          evidently to be guilty and a transgressor. Hence says the apostle,
          Romans 7:9, "I was alive without the law once: but when the
          commandment came, sin revived, and I died." The law as a looking-glass
          is held before his eyes, and he sees his spots. His own conscience is
          as a thousand witnesses against him, and he cannot deny the charge. So
          his mouth is stopped, and his sin at length has found him out, Romans
          3:19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, The man is sentenced and condemned by his own conscience
          according to the law, adjudging him liable to death, eternal death,
          for his sins: Galatians 3:10, "Cursed is every one that continues not
          in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." He
          is therefore a condemned malefactor in his own eyes, by the sentence
          of the law pronounced against him. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The effects of this conviction; which are these.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, A painful sense of sin, an affecting sight of it, Romans 7:9.
          forfeited. For now the sore is lanced; and they see those sins, and
          that in sin, which they saw not before; and their eyes affect their
          hearts. As when the sun shines into a house, the motes are discovered,
          which did not before appear: so is it here. And the sin which sat
          light on them before, becomes a burden too heavy to them to bear; for
          now they are roused out of their lethargy, and feel their sores. It is
          a burden on their spirits, which sinks them; on their backs, that bows
          them down; on their heads, which they are not able to discharge
          themselves of. Therefore the soul coming to Christ is represented as a
          man with a burden on him: Psalm 55:22, "Cast your burden upon the
          Lord, and he shall sustain you." Hosea 14:2, "Take with you words, and
          turn to the Lord, say unto him, Take away all iniquity;" (Hebrews)
          Lift off iniquity as a burden.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Terror on their hearts: Psalm 9:20, "Put them in fear, O Lord;
          that the nations may know themselves to be but men." The convinced
          jailor, a man who wore a sword, falls a-trembling, Acts 16:29: for the
          terror of God is too high for the stoutest heart, that knows not what
          it is to fear the face of man. The soul that was fearless before,
          because blind to its own hazard, now that his eyes are opened, is
          magor missabib. For what heart can be strong before an angry God,
          brandishing the sword of a fiery law over the conscience, which
          awakened, is the tenderest part of the man?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Legal sorrow for sin: Acts 2:37, "Now when they heard this, they
          were pricked in their heart." There are stounds of grief that go
          through their hearts like arrows, Psalm 45:5; and these are very
          piercing, Proverbs 18:14, "The spirit of a man will sustain his
          infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? The man sees now that he
          has been murdering his own soul, and he groans out an elegy over his
          dead self; which is raised the higher, that he thought his soul was
          alive, when really it was dead. He calls himself fool and beast for
          doing as he did. But what is very sad, though his heart be rent in
          pieces for his sin, yet it is not rent from it. What grieves him thus,
          is purely selfish; his separation from God, without whom he sees he
          cannot be happy; and his liableness to his wrath and curse, which he
          sees will ruin him forever to lie under.

        <p align="justify">
          4thly, A racking anxiety how to be delivered out of this state: Acts
          2:37, "Now when they heard this, they said,—What shall we do?" And
          here many times fear and hope take their several turns in his anxious
          soul; sometimes hoping, sometimes desponding, like Jonah in the
          whale's belly, Jon. 2:4, "Then I said, I am cast out of your sight;
          yet I will look again toward your holy temple." Conviction of sin will
          make way for care into the most careless head, and will make folk
          bestow many thoughts on the neglected salvation, that used not to
          bestow one serious thought upon the business. And this care will
          swallow up all others, as that of a drowning man to save his life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. The unconvinced sinner is an impenitent sinner. Hearken you
          young ones, and old, that have lived at ease, and with a hale heart,
          in respect of your souls' state, all your days. They may sleep sound
          indeed, whom the devil is rocking in the cradle of a natural
          impenitent state. But you will get a wakening yet, either in time to
          bring you to repentance, or when time is gone, and there is no more
          place for repentance, Jeremiah 48:11, 12, "For except you repent, you
          shall perish." Ah poor sinner, you were never yet in the next step to
          repentance. Your sore has not been lanced yet, therefore surely the
          filthy matter is never yet cast out by repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Convictions and legal qualms of conscience are not repentance: for
          they do but qualify the subject for it, and that in part only. These
          are very necessary things I have spoke of under this head; but they
          are but like the unripe fruit, which must be ripened by the work of
          the gospel on the heart, and brought to a perfection by the warm sun
          of gospel-influences, before he that has them can be accounted a
          penitent indeed. Or rather, they are like the blossoms which go
          before, and differ in kind from the fruit, which often fall off, and
          no fruit follows at all. Folk may have had these many days and years
          since, that never repented to this day, Hosea 6:4. The first-fruits of
          the second death may be mistaken by many for the pangs of the new
          birth. And therefore you that have had them consider well what issue
          they have had; for it is not enough to have been in them, but to have
          got right out of them. Wrong curing of some diseases, breeds others,
          that prove mortal to many.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">The right issue out of them lies in three things.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It lies in self-denial, or un-selfing of the soul, when the soul is
          shaken out of itself for justification and sanctification too:
          Jeremiah 31:18, "I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus,
          You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed
          to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the Lord
          my God." Compared with verse 19, "Surely after that I was turned, I
          repented; and after that I was instructed. I smote upon my thigh: I
          was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of
          my youth." They see the heinousness of sin, and the corruption of
          their nature too, so as they conclude themselves utterly unable to
          help themselves in either of these points, and so come off from
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It lies in faith, or believing; in coming to Jesus Christ for all,
          in point of justification and sactiflcation too: Isaiah 45:24.
          "Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and
          strength." The soul being turned off its own bottom, comes and builds
          on him for what it wants, and looks to him for his blood and Spirit.
          Thus "the law is a school-master to bring us unto Christ, that we
          might be justified by faith," Galatians 3:24. See Jeremiah 3:22, 23.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It lies in repentance, or a kindly melting of the heart for sin,
          Jeremiah 31:18. Zechariah 12:10 as done against a gracious God, whom
          the heart is knit to in love. The soul comes from before the throne of
          justice, where it stood weeping for itself and its own misery, unto
          the throne of grace, where it stands weeping for having offended such
          a gracious Father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They land at this threefold shore, who come rightly out of these
          depths. But many plunge up and down in them a while, and land again
          just in the same side they went in at. Some land at the shore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Of formality, or a legal walk, 2 Timothy 3:5. "Having a form of
          godliness but denying the power thereof." They change their former
          ways but retain their old heart. They go indeed to religious duties,
          but they never go out of them to Christ. They act not as they did; but
          still they have the old principle of action, acting from self, and to
          self; so that though they change their work, they still work to the
          old master. And thus many continue in a profession of religion, living
          on their duties, never coming to Christ. Others land at the shore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Of their former security. They are neither better inwardly nor
          outwardly; but they come out of their qualms of conscience, as one out
          of a fever, returning just to their old way of living; as was the case
          with Felix, Acts 24:25. who said to "Paul, go your way for this time;
          when I have a convenient season, I will call for you." Others land at
          the shore,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Of profanity; turning worse than before: Matthew 12:43, 44, 45,
          "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry
          places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, I will return into
          my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he finds it
          empty, swept, and garnished. Then goes he, and takes with himself
          seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and
          dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first."
          Their lusts dammed up for a while, run with more vigor than ever
          thereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, The soul wherein repentance is wrought, is a believing soul.
          Faith is the spring and sourse of repentance so that though the grace
          of faith and repentance are given together and at once in respect of
          time, yet, in the order of nature, faith goes before repentance, and
          the acting of faith goes before the exercise of repentance. And he who
          would repent, must first believe in Christ that he may repent. I know
          that some teach otherwise. But this is the doctrine of the Scriptures
          and our Catechism. To confirm it, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That faith is absolutely the leading grace, and the first breathing
          of a quickened soul: Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith it is impossible to
          please God;" therefore it is impossible to repent, for that is very
          pleasing to him, Jeremiah 31:20. So John 15:5, "Without me," that is,
          separate from me, and there is no union with him but by the Spirit of
          faith, "you can do nothing" acceptable to God, therefore you cannot
          repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is particularly the leading grace to repentance: Zechariah
          12:10, "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall
          mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son." Thus it is represented
          in fact, Acts 11:21, "And a great number believed, and turned unto the
          Lord." If repentance be the emptying of the soul by the dropping of
          the tears of godly sorrow, it is faith that generates them in the
          heart. It is faith that melts the hard heart, which drop in
          repentance. The eye of faith fixes on God in Christ, and then the soul
          turns to him by repentance, Jeremiah 3:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The scripture usually proposes the objects of faith, and promises
          of grace, for motives to repentance; thereby discovering, that it is
          by a believing application of these, that a soul is brought to
          repentance: Jeremiah 3:14, "Turn, O backsliding children, says the
          Lord, for I am married unto you." Verse 22, "Return, you backsliding
          children, and I will heal your backslidings: behold, we come unto you,
          for you are the Lord our God." Joel 2:12, 13, "Therefore also now,
          says the Lord, Turn you even to me with all your heart, and with
          fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rend your heart and
          not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious
          and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of
          the evil." Hosea 6:1, "Come and let us return unto the Lord: for he
          has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.
          Chapter 14:1, "O Israel, return unto the Lord your God, for you have
          fallen by your iniquity." Nay the very law proclaimed on mount Sinai
          with so much terror, is graciously prefaced with gospel-grace for
          faith to work on in the first place; "I am the Lord your God," etc.
          And thus the doctrine of the New Testament concerning repentance is
          proposed to sinners, Matthew 3:2, and 4:17, "Repent you: for the
          kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, The nature of repentance plainly teaches this. It is a
          cordial turning from sin to God: but is it possible to turn to God,
          but through Christ? John 14:6, "I am the way, and the truth, and the
          life: no man comes unto the Father, but by me." And is there any way
          of coming to Christ, but by faith? The soul then that would turn and
          go to God again by repentance, must needs take Christ by faith, by the
          way. The people indeed wept; but did they put away the strange wives,
          or set to it, until one cried, Ezra 10:2, "We have trespassed against
          our God, and have taken strange wives, of the people of the land: yet
          now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing?" They must not be
          only prisoners of fear, but of hope that will turn, Zechariah 9:12,
          "Turn you to the strong hold, you prisoners of hope." Repentance is a
          kindly humiliation and mourning for sin; but the faithless heart may
          roar under law-horror, will never kindly mourn but under
          gospel-influences.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. Repentance is placed before faith, Mark 1:15; and sometimes
          repentance only is mentioned to natural men as the way to salvation,
          as in our text, and Acts 2:38, and 3:19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">ANSWER,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Repentance no doubt is absolutely necessary to salvation; and no
          man needs pretend to faith, that does not repent, for they are
          inseparable. But that will no more infer the precedence of repentance
          to faith, than that, Hebrews 12:14, will infer the precedence of
          holiness to it. Now, this is all our text aims at.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Repentance being the end, and faith the means to that end, no
          wonder they be so placed: for the end is first in one's intention, yet
          the means are first in practice. So Mark 1:15. Christ commands sinners
          to repent; but then in order to repenting, he commands them to
          believe. So Acts 2:38, believing is implied in the command to be
          baptized. And therefore, speaking of the result of this work, verse
          44, it is said, "And all that believed," etc. So Acts 3:19, it is
          implied in being converted; compared with Hebrews 3:12, "Take heed,
          brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in
          departing from the living God," And that this is the true reason of
          this way of speaking, namely, that repentance is the end, and faith
          the means, is clear from Acts 20:21, "Testifying—repentance toward
          God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:" for that Scripture can
          bear no other meaning, without destroying that fundamental truth, that
          Christ is the way to the Father. John preached repentance, Mark 1:4,
          but how did he direct them to it? Acts 19:4, "John truly baptized with
          the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should
          believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Then it is not gospel-doctrine, that Christ will receive none
          but true penitents, or that none but such have a warrant to embrace
          Christ by faith: Revelation 21:17, "And the Spirit and the bride say,
          Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst,
          come: and whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." The
          evil of this doctrine is, that it sets sinners to spin repentance out
          of their own affections, and to fetch it with them to Christ, instead
          of coming to him by faith to get it. And it hinders sensible sinners
          from coming to Christ, as keeping them back until they be persuaded
          that they have true repentance. I say, persuaded; for how can a sinner
          come to Christ until he be persuaded he has a warrant so to do? If
          Christ will receive none but such as have true repentance, then none
          other are invited to come; for surely those that are invited, will be
          welcome upon their coming: if none other be invited, then impenitent
          sinners are not bound to come to Christ; for none are bound to come,
          but those that are invited; "for where there is no law, there is no
          transgression." However, none are here in Christ by faith, but
          thereupon they become true penitents; and none but true penitents will
          see Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Then for sensible sinners to think that they dare not and ought not
          to believe, and embrace Christ, until they be more deeply humbled, and
          do more thoroughly repent of their sins, and in a word, be more fit to
          receive him, is but a gilded deceit, and a trick of the false heart,
          to make the soul stay long in the place of the breaking forth of
          children, and die there at length. The Scripture holds forth quite
          other doctrine: Revelation 3:20. "Behold, I stand at the door, and
          knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
          him, and will sup with him, and he with me." Isaiah 55:1. "Ho, every
          one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has no money;
          come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy wine and milk without money, and
          without price." It is one thing what a sinner will do; another, what
          he may and ought to do. It is very true, there are many who will never
          come to Christ, if they be not made more sensible of their need of him
          than they are. But all that hear the gospel may and ought to come, be
          their case what it will; and those that come not, will be condemned
          for their not coming, John 3:19. Therefore let every sensible sinner
          under that temptation think, that he is in the case of a drowning man,
          who if he stand disputing whether he may catch hold of the rope
          reached to him to hale him to land, a wave may come and sweep him
          away; and therefore without disputing he must take hold of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. This shows the true way to deal with a hard heart, to soften it,
          and bring it to hearty repentance. It is to believe. You must do like
          those birds, that first fly up, and then come down on their prey;
          first soar aloft in the way of believing, and then come down in true
          humiliation: Zechariah 12:10.—"They shall look upon me whom they have
          pierced, and they shall mourn for him." One may otherwise toil long in
          vain with a hard heart. Unbelief will lock up the heart, as the waters
          with a hard frost; for hard thoughts of God set the soul at a distance
          more and more from him, when the believing of the proclaimed pardon
          touches the rebels' hearts, and makes them come in.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, The more faith the more repentance; as the fuller the
          spring is, the streams run with the more vigorous current. According
          to your faith be it unto you, is the rule of the dispensation of
          grace. For faith is the provisor for all other graces, as being the
          conduit pipe by which grace comes from the fountain of grace to the
          soul; so that it failing, all fails; and it moving vigorously, the
          rest do so too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION. How are we to act faith in order to repentance?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER 1. Firmly believe, that whatever your guilt be, God is
          reconciled to you in Christ Jesus; that there is hope of your case, if
          you can attain to the way laid out for bettering it. You have God's
          word for this: Isaiah 1:18. "Come now, and let us reason together,
          says the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white
          as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."
          Ezekiel 18:23. "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?
          says the Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways and
          live?" This will quicken your endeavors after the happiness of your
          souls. Satan strikes at this foundation, to keep the soul from
          repentance, many ways. He will tell you, it cannot be thought that God
          can ever love the like of you. But the Lord says the contrary: Hosea
          14:4. "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for
          mine anger is turned away from him." Again, Satan will tell you, that
          you were not elected, but made for destruction; though God never set
          him nor you in the secrets of his decrees: Deuteronomy 29:29. "The
          secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are
          revealed belong unto us." But why does he tell you all this, but to
          make you careless? which being done, he knows you cannot repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Believe that Jesus Christ is both able and willing to save you from
          sin and from wrath. You have ground to believe his ability: 1 John
          1:7. "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin."
          Hebrews 7:25. "He is able to save them to the uttermost, that come
          unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them."
          And you have also ground to believe his willingness: Isaiah 55:1.
          Revelation 22:17. both forfeited. This will set you a step further on;
          and truly this being believed by a sensible sinner, the bargain is
          almost closed. Therefore Satan works against the tossed soul's
          believing this, to the end he may not come to an anchor or rest, but
          may plunge up and down in the depths, knowing no landing place. Hence
          these hellish suggestions, What have you to do with the promises of
          grace? they will be made out to others, but not to you. But see Acts
          2:39. compared with verse 36. Hence also the suggestion of having
          sinned the unpardonable sin. But why is that sin unpardonable? not
          that the physician cannot or will not cure it, Hebrews 7:25. John
          6:37; but because the sinner will never after desire to come to him,
          but willfully and maliciously rejects him. Hence also that suggestion,
          that Christ died not for him. But surely Satan never saw the roll of
          those whom Christ died for, and knows it no more than we, Deuteronomy
          29:29. forfeited. We ought not to call that in question, but leave
          that matter to the Lord. It is plain, that we are commanded to
          believe, 1 John 3:23. Let us do so, and we shall have evidences that
          Christ died for us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Christ has given his consent to be yours in his word; believe it;
          and do you consent to be his, accepting of the covenant, and of Christ
          therein to be your head and husband. Take him in all his offices as
          offered; and solemnly lay the whole weight of your soul, for
          justification and sanctification, on him. Lay over the burden of your
          guilt on his blood, of your raging lusts on his blood and Spirit;
          confidently trusting in him for salvation from sin and wrath. You have
          good ground to do this: Matthew 22:4, "All things are ready: come unto
          the marriage." Isaiah 26:3, 4, "You will keep him in perfect peace,
          whose mind is stayed on you; because he trusts in you. Trust you in
          the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength."
          Chapter 44:5, "One shall say, I am the Lord's: and another shall call
          himself by the name of Jacob: and another shall subscribe with his
          hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel."
          Chapter 45:24, "Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I
          righteousness and strength." This being done, the bargain is closed
          for time and eternity; Christ is yours, and you are his, and God is
          your God in him. Satan strives against the soul here; for he knows,
          that if this be done, the person is no more his. Hence are these
          suggestions, Christ is a hard master there is no living with; though
          Christ says the contrary, Matthew 11:28, 29, 30. Again, it is over
          soon for that serious work, Psalm 95. If none of these nor the like
          will do, then he will tell the person, that it is presumption for him
          to offer at any such thing. But that is but the devil's doctrine, that
          it is presumption to do it, since God has commanded it, 1 John 3:23,
          "This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his
          Son Jesus Christ." And do what you will, you cannot please God unless
          you do it, John 6:29, "This is the work of God, that you believe on
          him whom he has sent." Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith it is impossible
          to please God." Well, if the soul will venture, he is ready to tell
          him, he had as good let it alone as try it in vain, for Christ will
          never receive him, nor give his consent to the bargain. But Satan is a
          liar; for he has given it already: Matthew 22:4, "All things are
          ready: come unto the marriage. Hosea 2:19, "I will betroth you unto me
          forever, yes, I will betroth you unto me in righteousness, and in
          judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies. The soul is like a
          traveler come to a deep water-side, over which lies a bridge appearing
          very thin and narrow; it is pouring on rain on this side, it is fair
          weather on the far side; he would gladly be over; and while he is
          minting to take the bridge, a false friend tells him, that he will
          never get over, that the bridge will break with him, or that his foot
          will slip, etc. And thus the poor man stands, sometimes putting on his
          foot, sometimes drawing it back again, until the flood rising behind
          him, he sees he must venture or perish. So he ventures with a
          trembling heart, and gets safe over, and sees that it was an enemy
          that made him so distrustful of the passage.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. This being done, believe that Christ is yours, Canticles 2:16; that
          God is reconciled to you in him; that your sins are pardoned for
          Christ's sake, and you are no more under condemnation for them, Romans
          8:1; that you are now in a state of peace with God, and safe under the
          covert of blood. This will effectually melt your hearts into sincere
          repentance. And the stronger your confidence be in this point, the
          fire will be the more keen to melt the soul. Satan will oppose you in
          this also, that raising the dust of doubts and fears, your hands may
          be feeble that should fight against your lusts, the legs weak and
          trembling with which you should turn from sin unto God. But the more
          he weakens that, the more he serves his own purpose against you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Stand upon this shore, and look to your sins, and Savior, Zech
          12:10. When a soul has, by a believing application of the blood of
          Christ, passed the gulf of condemnation and sees itself safe on the
          other side, it stands fairest for a hearty melting for sin, and a free
          and cordial turning from it unto God, Luke 7:37, 38, compared with
          verse 47. It is slavish fear that may be greater before, but it is
          filial relenting that will be greatest then. The waters of sorrow may
          make greater noise before, but they will come sweeping down with a
          more full flood then, as when a hearty thaw comes after a long frost.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Believing the promise of his grace, use the means. There
          are means of God's appointment to stir up a soul to repentance;
          namely, serious meditations on the sins of our nature, heart, lip, and
          life; the evil of it with respect to God, and to ourselves, etc.
          Revelation 2:5, "Remember from whence you are fallen, and repent."
          Psalm 119:50, "I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto your
          testimonies." There are promises of repentance, Ezekiel 36:31, "Then
          shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not
          good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your
          iniquities, and for your abominations." Acts 5:31, "Him has God
          exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give
          repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins." To believe the promise
          without use of the means is presumption; to use the means without
          believing the promise, is a selfish unsanctified work. What God has
          joined, either of these puts asunder, and so must be fruitless. God
          says to us in this case, as unto Moses, Exodus 17:5, 6. "Go on before
          the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel: and your rod
          with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go. Behold, I
          will stand before you, there upon the rock in Horeb; and you shall
          smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people
          may drink." The means are as the rook, the faith of the promise the
          rod of God: the way to get the water was by smiting the rock with the
          rod.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          FOURTHLY, Let as consider the parts of repentance. These are two,
          namely, humiliation for sin, and turning from sin unto God. These two
          put together, make up true repentance. Accordingly the Scripture
          speaks of repenting of sin, 2 Corinthians 12:21. "which have not
          repented of the impurity," etc; and likewise repenting from sin,
          Hebrews 6:1, "Not laying aside the foundation of repentance from dead
          works, etc. So in the Old Testament repentance is expressed by two
          words; the one denoting remorse and sorrow, Job 42:6. "Wherefore I
          abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." Jeremiah 8:6, "No man
          repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?" the other
          denoting the turning of the soul, namely, from sin unto God, Ezekiel
          18:30. "Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But however these may be distinguished, they cannot be divided in true
          repentance. The true humiliation issues always in turning; and turning
          always begins at humiliation. Hence very often the whole of repentance
          is expressed by returning, and sometimes by humiliation, as Leviticus
          26:41, "If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then
          accept of the punishment of their iniquity." 2 Chronicles 33:12, "And
          when he was in affliction, he be-sought the Lord his God, and humbled
          himself greatly before the God of his fathers." We have both together,
          Joel 2:12, 13, "Therefore also now, says the Lord, Turn you even to me
          with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
          mourning. And rend your heart and not your garments, and turn unto the
          Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
          great kindness, and repents him of the evil."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, To begin with humiliation. This leads the van in the sinner's
          return to God by repentance. There is never a soul comes back to God,
          but it comes the low way of humiliation. The sinner gone from God, is
          set up against him: but grace puts down the sinner from that seat, and
          lays him down at the Lord's footstool, where the Lord takes him up: 1
          Peter 5:6. "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
          that he may exalt you in due time." As it was with Benhadad's
          servants, 1 Kings 20:31. 32; so it is with the convinced sinner: faith
          teaches them, that the King of Israel is a merciful King; repentance
          girds sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and in that
          posture brings them to him. Now, in this humiliation of the soul there
          are these five things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, A kindly sense of sin, whereby the soul sees and is deeply
          affected with its sins against a holy, gracious God. I call it so, to
          distinguish it from the legal convictions spoken of before, which make
          a terrible reel in the conscience and affections; whereas this kindly
          soaks into the heart. The former is at the bottom involuntary, comes
          in, and is kept on against the sinner's will; because the natural
          enmity of the heart against God is not broken; and makes the man like
          one under great pain, who would gladly sleep, but still the new
          stounds awake him, and keep him awake. The latter is voluntary, it is
          welcome in, and welcome to stay; because the heart is brought low, and
          would gladly be lower before a holy God. When the light appears at a
          chink, they would gladly draw the curtains, and open the windows, that
          they may get a better sight of their black face and foul hands,
          Jeremiah 3:18, 19. This sense of sin,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. For the matter of it, is,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, A sense of the plague of the heart, or sin of the nature, 1 Kings
          8:38; Romans 7:7, 8. The man that is humbled, sees the corruption of
          his nature, himself to be a mass of corruption and confusion. He
          discerns the bias of his heart to the wrong side, the aversion to do
          good, the proneness to evil, that is interwoven with his very nature.
          The light of the Lord shining into his soul, gives him the affecting
          sight of the distortion and depravity that is in all the faculties of
          his soul, the blindness in his mind, rebellion in his will, and
          carnality in his affections. The want of this is a flaw in the
          repentance of many, of whom we may say, as Leviticus 13:44, "He is a
          leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly
          unclean, his plague is in his head." They never see the corruption of
          their nature, and so repent not of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, A sense of actual sins: Job 36:9, "Then he shows them their
          work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded." These are the
          poisonous streams flowing from the empoisoned fountain: Mark 7:21, 22,
          "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
          adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness,
          deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness."
          Sin now lies at the door; for those things that were buried out of
          sight, have a resurrection, and stand before him as an exceeding great
          army which he has mustered against Heaven. Sins committed many years
          before, will appear more fresh and green than that day they were
          committed. What he justified before as no faults, he will be now
          ashamed of; and what were reckoned tolerable follies, will be
          accounted monstrous impieties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, A sense of the particular idol of jealousy, which the man has
          been most apt to be led away with. The soul is never truly humbled,
          until deeply sensible of its weak side: Hosea 14:3, "Ashur shall not
          save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more to
          the work of our hands, You are our gods." For the penitent will be
          particularly set against that, as what is particularly offensive to
          God, Psalm 18:22. This right eye smarts and pains him so exceedingly,
          that now he would gladly have it plucked out. And as it does
          especially grieve the Lord's Spirit, it specially grieves his, as what
          has been the great make-bate between God and him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, A sense of the numerousness and multitude of their sins; Job
          13:23, "How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
          transgression and my sin." A true sense of sin will open men's eyes to
          see innumerable evils compassing them about, countable only by him who
          tells the stars, Psalm 19:12. Hence the humbled soul is sensible of a
          cloud of guilt that it has been enrapt up in; and will see it must
          plead guilty to every line of the spiritual law: sees itself a mass of
          iniquity; "from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, there
          is no soundness, but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores."
          Isaiah 64:6, "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our
          righteousnesses are as filthy rags," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, A sense of the heinousness of their sins, the aggravating
          circumstances with which they have been attended: Luke 15:18, "I will
          arise, and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
          sinned against Heaven, and before you." Each sin pierces the heart of
          the penitent. And so it is wonderful to see what a dexterity a
          repenting sinner has in aggravating his sins, in his prayers and
          complaints. Time, place, person, and each circumstance, shoots as it
          were a dart through the liver.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, A sense of the evil of sin. Men may see sin, that see not the
          evil of it. Hence professing sin, instead of confessing it; turning to
          it, instead of turning from it. But if one saw the serpent's sting, he
          would not take it into his bosom, Luke 23:34. But the Lord's language
          to the soul whom he is drawing to repentance, is that, Jeremiah 2:19,
          "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall
          reprove you: know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and
          bitter, that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and that my fear is
          not in you, says the Lord God of hosts." And there is a twofold evil
          in sin, which the soul is now sensible of.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The evil of it with respect to themselves. They are sensible of
          the bitter fruits of sin: Romans 6:21, "What fruit had you then in
          those things, whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things
          is death." They see now "the vine is the vine of Sodom, the grapes are
          grapes of gall, the clusters bitter, and their teeth are set on edge."
          They cry out, as the sons of the prophets in another case, 2 Kings
          4:40, "O you man of God, there is death in the pot." This is the
          danger of sin, that they are made sensible of. They see the guilt of
          it, laying the soul open to temporal, spiritual, and eternal strokes:
          Jeremiah 14:7, "O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do
          you it for your name's sake: for our backslidings are many, we have
          sinned against you." Hence "horror takes hold on them, because of
          God's righteous judgments." They are made to wonder that they are not
          in Hell, drinking the cup of the wrath of God. Their hearts tremble to
          look back on the ruin that was hanging over their heads in their
          natural state; that the poisonous cup which they drank has not
          dispatched them. Hence they fear to meddle with sin again, as one
          would do to take a serpent into his bosom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The evil of it with respect to God and Christ; and that in a
          threefold respect.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [1.] As contrary to the holy law of God: 1 John 3:4, "Whoever commits
          sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the
          law." By sin one breaks over the hedge, yes, breaks it down, and so
          steps into the devil's ground; what wonder then a serpent do bite him!
          Now the sinner sees the equity of God's law, and so plainly perceives
          the evil of transgression: Romans 7:12, "The law is holy; and the
          commandment holy, and just, and good." And the breaking over this so
          glorious a hedge, galls the penitent heart, the sincere spirit of an
          evangelical penitent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [2.] As contrary to the holy nature of God: Habakkuk 1:13, "You are of
          purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity." Sin is
          the worst of evils in itself, and in the eyes of the penitent. There
          is nothing so contrary to the chief good, and therefore it is the
          chief evil. Now, the true penitent loves God, his holy nature and
          perfections; and therefore his sin is heavy to him, because by it he
          has walked contrary to him: Lamentations 5:16, "Woe unto us that we
          have sinned."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [3.] As the procuring cause of the sufferings of Christ: Zechariah
          12:10, "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall
          mourn for him," etc. Mount Calvary is the Bochim to the true penitent;
          the sufferings of Christ are the commentaries on sin, which the true
          penitent reads; the groans of a dying Savior rend their hearts; and by
          the wounds of a Redeemer they see the ill of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is the loathsomeness of sin, Isaiah 30:22; whereby it is not only
          hated for what attends it, but is abhorred for itself, as a thing
          which on no terms the soul could any longer digest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. For the qualities of it. It is,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, A particular and distinct sense of sin, not a general and
          confused one. No man that hears the gospel, having common
          understanding, but he confesses himself a sinner; but many
          nevertheless are blind as to particulars. But this puts one in a
          capacity to lay his hands on his sores, saying, as Psalm 51:4,
          "Against you, you only have I sinned, and done this evil in your
          sight." It shows him his particular transgressions wherein he has
          exceeded, and the particular ills by which he has exceeded and
          offended in these. As the vermin appear crawling, when the stone is
          lifted up, which before lay hid; so the ills of the heart and life
          appear to the penitent: Romans 7:9, "I was alive without the law once:
          but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, It is real, not imaginary. The Spirit of the Lord realizeth the
          evil of sin to the soul. And so it goes beyond a merely rational
          knowledge of sin, as far as the sense of the bitterness of gall got by
          tasting it, exceeds that got by the bare hearing of it: Jeremiah 2:19,
          "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall
          reprove you: know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and
          bitter, that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and that my fear is
          not in you, says the Lord God of hosts." There is a spiritual
          sensation of spiritual things, arising from the new nature, as well as
          a natural feeling of what is grievous to us another way: 1 Corinthians
          2:14, 15, "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of
          God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
          because they are spiritually discerned. But he who is spiritual judges
          all things."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, It is operative, not dead and idle. The eye of the penitent
          affects his heart; and the heart being touched, sets all the powers of
          the soul on work. It is the spiritual physic, that ceases not to work
          until the whole soul be purged; as in the case of Peter's hearers,
          Acts 2:37, "who were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and
          to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
          There is a sense of sin which vents itself in nothing but in sighing
          and going backward, or in dry and fruitless complaints. It is like the
          disturbance which the sluggard meets with on his bed, which never
          thoroughly awakens him. But this sense of sin is thorough work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is an abiding sense of sin, not a transient one in a fit,
          and so away, Lamentations 3:49, 50, "My eye trickleth down, and ceases
          not, without any intermission; until the Lord look down, and behold
          from Heaven." The humbled soul carries it about with him, as long as
          he carries the body of sin and death about with him, saying with the
          apostle, Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
          from the body of this death?" For it is not a slight touch, which goes
          as it comes, very easily. The removal of the stroke carries off
          Pharaoh's sense of sin; but here the wound is deeper and so more
          abiding.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. An insensible sinner is an unhumbled impenitent sinner; as was
          the case of the church of Laodicea, who said, "she was rich, and
          increased with goods, and had need of nothing; and knew not that she
          was wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked,
          Revelation 3:17. They that never dug deep, are not built on the rock.
          They that have never got a broad sight of themselves in the sinfulness
          of their hearts and lives, have never yet got a believing sight of
          Christ. Consider this, you that have still lived at ease, strangers to
          any thorough exercise about your soul's case; though the door is shut,
          the thief is in the house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This shows how it comes that the pride of people's hearts still
          remains, though under crying guilt of sin. Though they know their sin,
          they have no due sense of it. If they had, it would be such a burden
          on their backs as would soon make them stoop, as Peter's hearers did,
          Acts 2:37. Insensible sinners may sit high in the seat of the
          scornful, while they see not what a God they have to do with: but when
          the Spirit of the Lord opens their eyes, and touches their hearts, to
          let them see and feel the evil of sin, they will lie low in the dust.
          They will, with the afflicted man, "put their mouth in the dust, if so
          be there may be hope," Lamentations 3:29.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. See here a difference between the saint's humiliation, and that of
          the hypocrite's. An Ahab may humble himself from a sense of the danger
          of sin; but a true penitent is humbled from the sense of the
          loathsomness of sin, 1 Kings 21:27, 29. Job 42:5, 6. A slave may bow
          himself for fear of the whip; but the disposition of a son is to be
          affected with the offence done to a kind father. Many will seem very
          low under the rod of God, and the apprehensions of his wrath, who are
          never touched with his love. They will be cast down under the sense of
          the evil their sin does to themselves, while the dishonor done to God
          by it lies far from their hearts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Let me exhort you to get and entertain a deep sense of sin
          on your Spirits. See your sins, and be duly affected with them, and be
          humbled for them. O how sad is it, that among our many thoughts, sin
          gets so few of them!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">For motives to press this exhortation, consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, That the Lord is anew calling the land by his providence to be
          sensible of their sins, and to be humbled for them. The Lord took it
          not long ago as a brand out of the burning; but he is threatening to
          cast it into the fire again, by a foreign invasion. For though we were
          delivered, yet the controversy remains still. We have not been
          thankful for our deliverance; Atheism, profanity, formality, contempt
          of the gospel, and a spirit of apostasy and declining from the Lord,
          and his work and way, woefully abound. How can we miss to fall at
          length!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Consider the present dispensation of providence towards this
          congregation, threatening to leave our house desolate. It fills the
          mouths of many with what is little worth; would to God it might fill
          your hearts and mine with a serious inquiry into the causes of it
          before the Lord. It speaks aloud, O that we were taking up the
          language of the threatening rod. The melancholy state of this
          congregation, in the time of the last desolation, needs not be forgot.
          It would become us all very well on this occasion, to consider what a
          jealous God we have to do with, and what entertainment has been given
          to the preached gospel; to lay our hands every one on our own mouths,
          and consider well what we have contributed to the bringing of the
          matter to this pass. By taking with our sin, and humbling ourselves
          before the Lord, way might be made for the acceptance of prayer
          through Jesus Christ; and them that humble themselves God will exalt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Consider, that however lightly your sins may sit on your
          spirits, they are a burden to the holy Spirit of God: Amos 2:13.
          "Behold," says the Lord, "I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed
          that is full of sheaves." And we may be sure the Lord will ease
          himself of that burden sooner or later. And if it be not by our
          repentance and humiliation, it will be by his accomplishing his wrath
          on us: Isaiah 1:24. "Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and
          avenge me of mine enemies." Therefore consider your ways in order to a
          returning to the Lord. The lighter that sin sits on us, it is the more
          grieving to the Spirit of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider, that without sense of sin there is no humiliation;
          that without humiliation there can be no repentance; and that without
          repentance there can be no escape from the wrath of God. "For except
          you repent, you shall perish." Insensibleness of sin, and the evil of
          it, locks up the heart in obduration and impenitency; and that will
          shut up the soul under wrath. But God loves the sensible humbled son:
          Jeremiah 31:20. "Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for
          since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still:
          therefore my affections are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy
          upon him, says the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, In true humiliation there is a kindly sorrow for sin:
          Zechariah 12:10, "I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
          inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications;
          and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall
          mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in
          bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born."
          The soul is not only filled with remorse, but true grief, for
          offending a holy, gracious God. He grieved the Spirit in committing
          sin, his spirit is grieved in repenting of it. The hard heart is
          broken, the adamantine heart dissolved into tears of godly sorrow, the
          rook is struck by the rod of the gospel, and the waters gush out. The
          way to Zion lies through the valley of Baca: Jeremiah 50:4, 5, "In
          those days, and in that time, says the Lord, the children of Israel
          shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and
          weeping: they shall go, and seek the Lord their God. They shall ask
          the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us
          join ourselves to the Lord, in a perpetual covenant that shall not be
          forgotten." And it is the mourners for sin whom the Lord comforts with
          the consolations of his Spirit. This is that brokenness and contrition
          of heart, which God calls for, and takes so much pleasure in. This is
          the rending of the heart, which God requires, Joel 2:12, 13. This is
          godly sorrow, which has these properties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a sorrow for sin as sin; not only for the guilt of it, but
          the loathsomeness of it; not only for the ill it does to ourselves,
          but the dishonor and wrong it does to a holy gracious God, Psalm 51:4;
          Zechariah 12:10. The penitent in his sorrow, goes farther than
          awakened reprobates, who seeing their souls ruined and dead, do put on
          their mournings. He grieves at the heart, because of the offence done
          to God, the defacing of his image, transgressing a holy and most just
          law, furnishing a spear and nails to pierce a Savior.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is an inward real sorrow. Not the hanging down of the head like
          a bulrush, Isaiah 58:5. Not a made sorrow in a disfigured countenance,
          which lies all in outward appearance. But it is a sorrow soaking into
          the soul, and piercing the very heart, Isaiah 61:3. And therefore it
          follows the man in secret, where no eye sees; making him mourn before
          the Lord, when the world knows nothing of it. For it arises from an
          inward principle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a lively sorrow. The sorrow of the world works death. It
          stupefies a man, and takes heart and hand for duty from him. But the
          spiritual pangs of godly sorrow for sin quicken a man to his duty: 2
          Corinthians 7:11, "For behold, this self-same thing that you sorrowed
          after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yes, what
          clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes,
          what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge!" It makes the
          man active in salvation-work. And the reason is, the one springs from
          slavish fear, which chills the soul, making it cold and stiff, and
          unfit for action; the other from love, which warms the heart, and
          disposes it for action: Luke 7:47, "Her sins which are many, are
          forgiven: for she loved much."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is an abiding sorrow. It is not a flash of an affection, which
          is deceitful, but a "spirit of heaviness," Isaiah 61:3. The sorrows of
          many are like a summer-shower, that wets the surface of the ground,
          but is presently dried up, before it do any good. But godly sorrow is
          like that, Ecclesiastes 7:3, "Sorrow is better than laughter: for by
          the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better." The soul,
          like Mary, mourns until it find the Lord, Lamentations 3:49, 50.
          forfeited. It may indeed remit of its degrees; but while sin abides,
          the spring of mourning abides too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. It is a universal sorrow. The true penitent heartily grieves for
          his own sin, Psalm 38:18, and for the sin of others, Psalm 119:136. It
          is like the letting out of waters: it may begin at one sin, but it
          does not stop there, but goes through all known sin, Psalm 1:5. and
          unknown too, Psalm 19:12, "Who can understand his errors? cleanse you
          me from secret faults." They never truly mourn for one sin, that do
          not mourn for all: for that which moves sorrow in the repenting heart
          for one sin, is to be found in all sins, namely, its contrariety to
          the law and nature of God, the loathsomeness as well as danger of it.
          And hence, when once the floodgate of godly sorrow is opened, it
          overflows all; and the sweetest morsel becomes bitter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. It is deep sorrow. Peter repenting wept bitterly. He who would have
          a good crop, ploughs well; and he who would build surely, goes deep
          with the foundation. It was the want of depth of earth that was the
          ruin of the stony-ground hearers, Matthew 13:5. And deep digging was
          the safety of the house founded on a rock, Luke 6:48. This sorrow is a
          rending of the heart, Joel 2:13; a rending of it as the plough rends
          the earth, Jeremiah 4:3; a pricking and piercing of it as with
          daggers, swords, and spears, Acts 2:37, compared with John 19:34; a
          cutting it as with a knife, Jeremiah 4:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a question, Whether penitential sorrow exceeds all other sorrows
          for the comforts of this life, or not? If we measure by the moving of
          the heart and affections, it is evident, that at least always it does
          not exceed other sorrows. But if we measure by the settled disposition
          of the heart, it is as evident that it does exceed them all. As the
          deepest waters ordinarily make least noise, so men will be more moved
          in a lesser joy and grief than in a greater; for they are but the
          lightest joys that move laughter, and oft-times the greatest sorrows
          are above tears. It settles more firmly, and continues more than any
          other sorrow whatever in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Lastly, It is a heart purifying sorrow. It works repentance or
          forsaking of sin: 2 Corinthians 7:10. "Godly sorrow works repentance
          to salvation, not to be repented of." True mourning and turning are
          inseparable companions; though there is a mourning for sin, that is
          not deep enough to turn up the love of sin by the root. True sorrow in
          the heart is a spring, which as it runs will work out sin, as to the
          love, habitual practice, and dominion of it, as a spring works out the
          mud thrown into it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1. There is no repenting with a hale heart, and without
          repentance no salvation. People must either be broken for their sins
          in a way of mourning, or God will break them for them in a way of
          judgment. There are many stout hearts in our day, that will boldly
          outface challenges from the word and their own consciences, without
          either breaking or bowing. But let such remember, that there is a day
          coming when God will make the stoutest heart to tremble, and the heart
          of adamant to fly in a thousand pieces, Psalm 2:9. "You shall break
          them with a rod of iron, you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's
          vessel."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. How far must they be from humiliation, that sin deliberately, glory
          in their shame, and rejoice in ungodly courses and practices! I think
          providences and ordinances are hardening to many in our day; they are
          not bettered by them, and therefore they are hardened and made worse
          under them. Our penny weddings and set drinkings, leaving such a
          stench behind them, and attended with before unheard of profanity, are
          speaking evidences of this. Are these Christian methods to help poor
          people? Will God accept the gift, where such a fat sacrifice is
          offered to the devil? Is that charity for which drinking must open
          men's hearts and hands to give? If some methods be not fallen on to
          prevent these things, they will bring wrath on the congregation. I
          appeal to the consciences of all sober persons, if it looked not
          judgment-like, that in that very time when abroad a design was
          managing to lay the congregation desolate, at home many were met for a
          set drinking, carried on to a monstrous height of profanity, in the
          day and in the night. It becomes us all to mourn for this, lest we
          involve ourselves in the guilt. And particularly I warn all such as
          were any way partakers of that scandalous riot, to repent, lest wrath
          break out upon them. For it is a fearful thing to stand exposed to the
          lash of these threatenings, Habakkuk 2:15, "Woe unto him that gives
          his neighbor drink: that put your bottle to him, and make him drunken
          also, that you may look on their nakedness." Isaiah 22:12, 13, 14,
          "And in that day did the Lord of hosts call to weeping, and to
          mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: and behold,
          joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and
          drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. And it
          was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts, surely this iniquity
          shall not be purged from you, until you die, says the Lord God of
          hosts."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The sorrow of many for their sins, will tend to no good account
          before the Lord. Few have any remarkable sorrow for their sins at all;
          but among those whose hearts are really grieved and pained for their
          sin, how few are there that have any right sorrow? The danger of it,
          the disadvantage by it, the shame of it before the world, pains them a
          little; but the dishonor done to God by it touches them not
          effectually. And so their sorrow will be but the beginning of Hell,
          not of repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Be exhorted to mourn for sin. Labor to get your hearts
          affected with this mournful object, and be not strangers to this
          exercise. The sins and threatened judgments of this day call for it;
          and it is the way to attain particular safety in common calamity:
          Ezekiel 9:4, "And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the
          city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
          foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the abominations
          that be done in the midst thereof." If we were more in the duty of
          mourning, we would share more of the gospel-comforts, Matthew 5:4,
          "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted." And the
          more of the Spirit one has, the more will he be taken up that way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, In true humiliation there is a holy shame upon the account of
          sin before the Lord: Romans 6:21, "What fruit had you in those things,
          whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death."
          The remembrance of sin fills the penitent with shame and blushing:
          hence says Ezra, chapter 9:6, "O my God, I am ashamed and blush to
          lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are increased over
          our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens." Shame was
          never known in the world, until sin entered; yet sometimes sin comes
          to such a height with sinners, that it quite banishes shame: but the
          case of such is very desperate, Jeremiah 3:9. "You had a whore's
          forehead, you refused to be ashamed." Shame then is the remains of
          virtue in a sinner, to which whoever are lost, all are lost to all
          good, Isaiah 3:9. "The show of their countenance does witness against
          them, and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not." Now, the
          grace of God awakens this shame, and sanctifies it in the penitent
          soul, so that he hangs down his head before the Lord, as ashamed of
          his way and heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are four things occasion shame, and meet here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Nakedness causes shame. Hence said Adam to the Lord, Genesis 3:10,
          "I heard your voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was
          naked; and I hidden myself." Sin strips the sinners of their beautiful
          garments, takes away the glory of the rational creature, and leaves
          them without a covering before the eyes of a holy God. The penitent
          sees this, and is ashamed; and so the publican, cannot lift up his
          eyes to Heaven, but smites on his breast, as if he would wound the
          breast that sin bred in, which has brought him to this shamful case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Pollution and defilement, for that makes one loathsome to others,
          Job 9:31, "You shall plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
          shall abhor me." Sin defiles the soul, takes away and mars all its
          beauty, and deforms it in the sight of God. And the penitent sees
          this, and is ashamed, Isaiah 64:6, "We are all as an unclean thing,
          and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and we all do fade as
          a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away." Never
          was a man that had been plunged over head and ears in a mire, more
          ashamed to come before others in that case, than the penitent is
          ashamed to show his face before God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Disappointment of raised expectations, Jeremiah 2:36, 37. The
          sinner in his impenitent state, looked for his happiness and
          satisfaction in sinful courses. But when his heart is touched, he is
          ashamed; for he finds, that instead of bread expected, he has got a
          stone; instead of fish, a serpent. He finds, that he has been courting
          his own death and ruin; and that from the wall he leaned on there has
          come forth a serpent and bit him. And hence is that reflection, Romans
          6:21, "What fruit had you in those things, whereof you are now
          ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Discovering of one's reproach, Jeremiah 2:26, "Sin is a reproach to
          any people." In the impenitent state the soul's reproach is hidden to
          it; but when grace touches the heart, and the Lord brings the sinner's
          ways to mind, lays his sins in broad-band before him, how can he miss
          to be ashamed? In a special manner, a conviction of base ingratitude
          fills one with shame, as to be convicted of designs against him who
          had saved our life. And thus the goodness of God duly considered,
          fills the penitent with shame and blushing, while he thinks what an
          ungrateful wretch he has been: Jeremiah 3:25, "We lie down in our
          shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the
          Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day,
          and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1. Shamelessness in sin is a badge of impenitency, and therefore
          a forerunner of destruction, Jeremiah 6:15. Philippians 3:10. A
          forehead of brass is a sign the heart is of stone. Impudence in sin
          argues a filthy heart, an obstinate disposition, and a seared
          conscience. And such are a stage beyond others from the kingdom of
          God. What hopes can they have of the glory of Heaven, that glory in
          their shame?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We see then that sin will bring shame sooner or later, here or
          hereafter. As for them that live and die without repentance, their
          shame is sure, and they will be covered with it, before the great
          congregation of Heaven and earth at the last day, and they shall never
          recover their countenance: Daniel 12:2, "Many of them that sleep in
          the dust of the earth shall awake, some to shame and everlasting
          contempt." And if people be recovered by repentance, they will be
          filled with shame before the Lord, even holy shame. But whatever shame
          men have, it is no holy shame that keeps them from glorifying God by
          taking shame to themselves when called thereto; for no grace of God
          keeps folk back from duty, Joshua 7:19. Common discretion teaches,
          that one ashamed of an injury done to the honor of another, cannot
          look him in the face but with shame, until he has done what he can to
          repair that honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly, The penitent soul is a sincere soul, and heartily at odds
          with sin. For such an one will be ashamed before God, of what the
          world cannot tax him with. Many may be sorry for sin before God,
          because of the terrible consequences of it which they apprehend, who
          yet are not ashamed before him, because they see not the evil that is
          in itself. But it argues a child-like disposition, to be heartily
          ashamed of secret sins before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fourthly, In true humiliation there is self-loathing and abhorrence:
          Ezekiel 36:31, "Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your
          doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own
          sight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations." The penitent
          not only loathes his sin, but himself for his sin. He cries out with
          Job, chapter 40:4, "Behold I am vile, what shall I answer you? I will
          lay mine hand upon my mouth." Repentance sets a man at variance with
          himself. He sees his ugly face in the glass of God's law, Christ's
          sufferings, and the Lord's goodness, and he loathes himself. This
          self-loathing manifests itself,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In the low and mean thoughts the penitent justly entertains of
          himself. True penitents see such vileness in themselves, as makes them
          give a very mean account of themselves. Abraham owned himself to be
          dust and ashes; Jacob, less than all the mercies of God; David, a
          worm, and not a man; Asaph, as a beast before the Lord; Agur, more
          brutish than any; the centurion, unworthy that Christ should come
          under his roof: Paul, one born out of due time, the least of the
          apostles, nay, less than the least of all saints, nay, the chief of
          sinners; and the prodigal son, Luke 15:19, reckoned himself no more
          worthy to be called a son, but to be made a hired servant.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In the penitent's being heartily out with himself upon the account
          of his sin: Job 42:6, "Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust
          and ashes." As one cannot with any pleasure touch himself, that has
          filth thrown on him, but his very heart stands at himself; so it is in
          spiritual self-loathing. He looks on himself as an ugly spectacle. He
          not only has nothing to say in defense of himself, but with
          indignation he rejects all the shifts and excuses for it, which he was
          satisfied with before: Luke 18:13. "The publican standing afar off,
          would not lift up so much as his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon his
          breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In holy revenge, 2 Corinthians 7:11. He who was going on in sin
          before, is now divided against himself; so that the devil's kingdom of
          sin in him must needs go to ruin. He acts the part of an accuser,
          advocate, and judge, against himself; yes in some sort lashes himself
          for his sinful heart and life. Hence we find the humbled sinner,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Smiting on his breast, Luke 18:13, as it were thereby declaring,
          that he deserves to be struck at the heart, and die for his
          transgression; that within him is the cause of all his sin and
          sorrows, he may thank himself for all; the source and spring of all is
          the corrupt heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Smiting on his thigh, Jeremiah 31:19, as if he would thereby
          declare, that he would be willing to take vengeance on the feet that
          carried him out of the way of God; that he is filled with indignation
          against himself, for his unaccountable practices, saying, What have I
          done? what a wretched sinner have I been?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are these five things that stir up this self-loathing
          especially, in the penitent soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The remarkable blots, and signal miscarriages in his way, that
          deeply wound and defile the conscience: like Peter's denying his
          Master, which made him weep bitterly, when he came to himself. These
          in a peculiar manner cover the soul with confusion, and fill it with
          self-abhorrence. And hence sometimes repentance begins at some such
          thing, from whence it spreads to the whole body of sin: Acts 2:36, 37,
          "Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made that
          same Jesus whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when
          they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said, Men and
          brethren, what shall we do?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The fullness of sin seen in the soul: Isaiah 64:6, "We are all as
          an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." The
          penitent being made sensible of his soul's case, sees the leprosy
          spread over the whole man, his mind under much darkness, his will
          rebellious against the will of God, his affections disordered, his
          whole nature corrupted, the seed of every sin in it; so that he
          concludes, that his heart is full of iniquity, and that the lusts that
          are hatched there, their name may be Legion. His life is a loathsome
          spectacle of the outbreakings and workings of that corruption. So that
          he sees that "from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head there
          is no soundness; and therefore he loathes himself."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The pollution cleaving to his duties: Isaiah 64:6. forfeited.
          While he sees how the running sore of his natural corruption drops on
          all his holy things, and defiles them, how can he choose but loath
          himself? He sees his best works are like a moth-eaten garment, full of
          holes; never a prayer, nor confession made, but there are provocations
          against the Lord in them. His mournings for sin must be mourned over,
          because of the woeful defects thereof; while he goes to mend one hole,
          still he is sure to strike out another. Thus the penitent is in his
          own eyes like Job, who had not whole fingers to dress his sores with;
          so he abhors himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) The aggravations of sin, Luke 15:18. A sight of these makes sin
          look like an opened stinking sore, wherein each of them contributes to
          make it more and more loathsome. When the penitent considers with what
          bent of affection he has sinned, the light, the many mercies, vows,
          and resolutions, etc. he has sinned against, he cannot but loath
          himself as a wretched self-destroyer, as an ungrateful miscreant, and
          as a beast before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) Instability in anything that is good: Hosea 6:4, "Your goodness
          is as a morning cloud, and as the early due it goes away." Wavering
          hearts, and wavering hands, are very humbling to a soul truly touched.
          A good frame is a rare hour, and stays but a short while. How often
          are resolutions fairly taken up, and begin to bud in endeavors for
          practice, that yet are quickly let fall again? How often do men
          relapse into the same sins they have sometimes had made very bitter to
          them? There is nothing more apt than this to stir up self-abhorrence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Self-conceit is a need-nail to a state of impenitency:
          Revelation 3:17, "You [the church of Laodicea] say, I am rich, and
          increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you
          are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked." No
          repentance can be where there is no humiliation, and there can be no
          humiliation while people are puffed up with a conceit of themselves.
          Publicans and harlots will enter into the kingdom of Heaven, before
          such self-conceited professors. Whenever the Spirit of the Lord takes
          a dealing with such persons, and discovers to them the signal
          miscarriages in their life, the fullness of sin, etc. that swelling
          conceit of sweet self will fall away, as ever the snow melts in a
          sunshine day. They that look on themselves as among the chief of
          saints, will see themselves the chief of sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Look into yourselves, if you would loathe yourselves and repent.
          Hence said Isaiah, chapter 6:5, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I
          am a man of unclean lips." Things may be going all wrong in the house,
          and the master not know it, while he is a stranger at home. Many a
          poor soul is pining away in its iniquity, and running with loathsome
          spiritual sores, threatening its ruin, while in the mean-time they are
          mightily in love with themselves, and fond of their own condition,
          like a miserable man that is happy in a dream. But heavy will the
          awakening of such be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly, Sin must needs be a very loathsome thing in the eyes of a
          penitent, since it makes him loath himself. Alas! many times we love
          that in ourselves, which we loath in others. But when one loathes
          himself for his sin against a holy, gracious God, it is an argument
          that that soul is heartily out with sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fifthly, and Lastly, In true humiliation there is a penitent
          confession of sin. Hence is that exhortation, Jeremiah 3:13, "Only
          acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the Lord
          your God," etc. This is the way that penitent sinners have always
          sought pardon and ease to their consciences in: Psalm 32:5, "I
          acknowledged my sin unto you, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I
          said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and you forgave
          the iniquity of my sin." Confession of sin is the vomit of sin,
          whereby the sweet morsel is cast up again; and it is the vent of real
          sorrow, shame, and self-abhorrence. And when the heart is loosed to
          it, the man becomes like the fish that is boiled in the water which it
          swimmed in.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This confession is to be according to the nature of the offence. If
          the sin be a secret one, a confession to God in secret is sufficient.
          If it be a private offence, the confession is to be so too: James
          5:16, "Confess your faults one to another." If it be a public offence,
          giving public scandal, the confession is to be public also: 1 Timothy
          5:20, "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear." So
          penitent David left his confession on record, for the church's
          edification. And so did the apostle Paul, 1 Timothy 1:13. And the
          reason is evident, since by sin God's honor is impaired, and we can
          repair it no other way, but by confessing it with sorrow, shame, etc.
          the confession must be according to the nature of the offence, else
          the wrong done to the honor of God is not repaired by it. And in the
          private and public confession God is our party, and not men only, as
          well as in the secret one.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, confession is a necessary part of humiliation. If the hard heart
          be loosed to be truly humblied for sin, it follows of course, that the
          tongue will be loosed to confess it. Hence confession is put for the
          whole of humiliation, yes of repentance, Hosea 5:15, "I will go and
          return to my place, until they acknowledge their offence." 1 John 1:9.
          "If we confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive our sins,
          and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Confession of sin has two
          parts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Self-accusing. God has given a law, the sinner has broke it; the
          penitent confesses his transgression with shame and sorrow, to the
          honor of the lawgiver. He cannot hide it, he dares not deny it; his
          soul is humbled, and therefore he confesses it: Psalm 51:3. "I
          acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me." He
          approves of the law as holy, just, and good, and disapproves of the
          transgression. Thus the morsel that was sweet in the mouth, turning
          bitter in the belly is vomited up.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Self-condemning. Hence said the returning prodigal, Luke 15:18, 19.
          "Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before you, and am no more
          worthy to be called your son." The penitent looks to the law, and the
          demerit of his sin, reads his own doom, and passes sentence on
          himself. He owns that all the evil he smarts under for the present, is
          just and righteous with God; Daniel 9:14. "Therefore has the Lord
          watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the Lord our God is
          righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his
          voice." If his broken bones pain him, he will own that it is just. If
          his sin find him, so that he read it in his punishment, he will
          acknowledge that it is a just contrivance; and that he deserves to
          sink under eternal wrath for it, saying with the afflicted church, "It
          is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his
          compassions fail not," Lamentations 3:22. He will say, that God may
          justly take the filthy garments of his sin, coyer them with brimstone,
          wrap him up in them, and cast him into the pit, Psalm 51:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, this confession should be sincere, full, very particular, free,
          and accompanied with forsaking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1. Hiding and covering sin, and refusing to confess it in the way
          that God calls for a confession, is a sign of an heart not humbled for
          it: Proverbs 28:13. "He who covers his sins shall not prosper: but
          whoever confesses and forsakes them, shall have mercy." Many in our
          day, falling into public scandals by their works of darkness, put on a
          forehead of brass, and refuse to confess them for the glory of God,
          cheating themselves with that, that they will confess their sins to
          God but not to men. But little do they consider, that by that means
          they put a bar in their own way to pardon, while by resolute lying
          they cover one sin with another, and by refusing to honor God at his
          call. Nor do they consider the weight of that word standing in the way
          of their peace with God, while they refuse to remove the scandal, that
          so they may be reconciled to the church: Matthew 18:17, 18. "If he
          shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect
          to hear the church, let him be unto you as an heathen man, and a
          publican. Truly I say unto you, Whatever you shall bind on earth,
          shall be bound in Heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth, shall
          be loosed in Heaven." It is true, it is but a word; yes but it is
          God's word, that will be more terrible to an awakened conscience than
          any punishment men can inflict.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They that shun to see their sins, that they may confess them,
          cannot repent of them: Jeremiah 9:6. 7. "Your habitation is in the
          midst of deceit, through deceit they refuse to know me, says the Lord.
          Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, behold I will melt them, and
          try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?" It is
          true, there are sins which we cannot so see in ourselves as to confess
          them particularly; but in that case the soul does not refuse
          conviction, as Psalm 19:12. "Who can understand his errors? cleanse
          you me from secret faults." But when one keeps the sweet morsel under
          his tongue, and has no will to see the evil of it, lest he should be
          obliged to confess it before the Lord, this is quite another case, and
          speaks a deceit of the heart, holding fast sin, and refusing to let it
          go.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly Labor to be sincere, full, free, etc. in confessing your
          sins. We are in debt to the justice of God, we cannot pay our debt;
          let us confess our debt, to prevent a pursuit, and that we may be
          capable to pray for forgiveness of it, which otherwise we cannot be.
          O, if we had a due sense and sorrow for our sins, this would, like an
          overflowing flood, bear down before them all those things which now
          hamper us in confessing our sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus far of humiliation, the first part of repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, I come now to the second thing, namely, the returning of the
          soul unto God from sin. This is the completing of repentance. Whatever
          sense of sin, shame, sorrow, etc. for it one have, if it end not in
          returning to God, it is naught. It is under this notion that
          repentance is so often called for in the Old Testament, Return, Turn
          you. And it may be well put for the whole of repentance: for,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, The impenitent sinner is out of himself, out of his wits; but
          by repentance he returns and comes to himself. Hence we read, that the
          prodigal, Luke 15:17. came to himself. There is never a soul that is
          brought to repentance, but there is as great a change upon him, as on
          a madman that is returned to his sound mind. He has quite other
          notions of things than he had before; he looks upon his sinful courses
          as the effects of spiritual frenzy. This is the first part of
          repentance, namely, humiliation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, The impenitent sinner is out of his place, like a wandering
          bird: Proverbs 27:8, "As a bird that wanders from her nest: so is a
          man that wanders from his place." And so the soul is out of its rest,
          and out of its duty. Adam shook himself and all his race out of their
          rest, and out of that they wander up and down in the devil's common.
          Repentance is the sinner's returning to his place again, to take up
          his place again in God's house among his servants. This is the second
          part of repentance. And whenever the soul comes to itself, it will
          come to God again. The grace of God finds the sinner, as the angel
          found Hagar, Genesis 16:8, 9; and as Paul found Onesimus, Philemon
          verse 10, 11, 12. Now, in this returning, according to the two terms,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. There is a turning from sin: Ezekiel 14:6, "Repent, and turn from
          your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations." 2
          Timothy 2:19, "Let every one that names the name of Christ, depart
          from iniquity." Psalm 34:14, "Depart from evil." The sinner changes
          his course, and gives up with his former lusts. The impenitent sinner
          is a misled traveler, who finding himself wrong, will go no farther
          on, but leave the wrong way, and seek the right one. To repent of sin,
          and yet continue in the practice of it, is a contradiction. No; the
          true penitent ceases from sin, he gives over his work in the service
          of sin and lusts, Isaiah 1:16. He forsakes his former ways, chapter
          55:7. And though sin remains in him, yet it reigns not as before. If
          the question be, How the penitent turns from sin, since he is daily
          offending, and sin abides in him, while he is here? I answer,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. True penitents turn from it in their heart and affection. There is
          a bond in the impenitent state, whereby the sinner's heart is knit to
          his lusts, as ever the sucking child's heart is to the breast, which
          he can by no means want. Repentance loosens that bond: Romans 7:24, "O
          wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
          death?" So though sin cleaves to the soul, yet the soul cleaves not to
          it as formerly. It hangs on him, it is true, but only as the chains on
          the captive, which are his burden; as the grave-clothes on Lazarus
          raised, which he is working to put off. Thus repentance makes a change
          of the heart. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, His esteem of sin is turned to despite. His judgment is set
          against it: Isaiah 2:20, "In that day a man shall cast his idols of
          silver, and his idols of gold, which they made, each one for himself
          to worship, to the moles and to the bats." What he approved before,
          now he condemns; for the scales are turned, and what was highest
          before is now lowest. Grace and holiness get the ascendant of sin and
          wickedness in his esteem. Those he counted most happy sometimes,
          because they took the greatest liberty in sinful courses, he now
          accounts most miserable, as slaves to sin, and in the road to
          destruction; and therefore takes up Joshua's resolution, chapter
          24:15, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, His love of sin is turned to hatred of it: Ezekiel 14:6.
          forfeited. Psalm 119:113, "I hate vain thoughts." Verse 104, "I hate
          every false way." It was good in his eyes before, better than the
          favor of God, and communion with him. He knew nothing good or
          desirable but the world and lusts, and what might satisfy the corrupt
          cravings of the soul. But repentance turns his soul against it, and he
          hates it as an evil thing, as the worst of evils, worse than suffering
          and afflictions. Were he left to his choice without fear of
          punishment, he would never choose it; for he hates it for itself, its
          contrariety to God's nature and will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, His liking of sin is turned to loathing of it. Hence repentance
          is called a casting away of sin, Ezekiel 18:31. as one would do some
          filthy thing that he cannot endure to have near him. For the penitent
          looks not only on sin as an ill thing, but as a loathsome thing which
          his heart stands at, Isaiah 30:22. And this is the ground of that
          self-loathing which the penitent is filled with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, His cleaving to sin is turned into a longing to be rid of it,
          Romans 7:24. The man longs to be free from it, as ever the prisoner
          for the opening of his prison-doors, the captive for his being set at
          liberty, and the dropping off of his chains. It is a burden on his
          back, which he groans under; a sickness to his soul, that he would
          gladly have the cure of. And therefore Christ with all his salvation
          is lovely in his eyes; his sanctifying Spirit, as well as his
          justifying blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They turn from it in their life and conversation. He who stood in
          the way of sinners before, now leaves it, when once the grace touches
          the heart, Isaiah 55:7. The penitent not only has a pure heart, but
          clean hands. Repentance will make a visible change on one's life: for
          it sets men to mortify the members of the body of death, Romans 8:13;
          to refuse compliance with lusts and temptations, Titus 2:12; to starve
          the lusts of the flesh, Romans 13:14; and to nail the body of sin with
          all its members to the cross of Christ, Galatians 5:24. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, They turn from the gross pollutions of the outward man, Psalm
          24:3, 4. An elect soul before conversion may be a habitual profane
          person, as well as others: but if he may be so after conversion, where
          is the difference between Christ's sheep and the devil's goats? It is
          true, they may make gross slips, as David and Peter did: but they do
          not lie in them, they recover again by repentance. But a profane life
          is the mark of an impenitent state, Galatians 5:21. And it is a wonder
          how men can pretend to repentance, while they live in the habitual
          practice of drunkenness, swearing, sabbath-breaking, lying,
          dishonesty, and other gross pollutions of the outward man, where one
          would think the profane devil is not so much as gone out, far less
          cast out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They become tender with respect to the sins of common infirmity,
          laboring to make conscience of their words and actions, Acts. 24:16.
          What others account light of, they will stand at a distance from, as
          having felt the smart of sin; and that not only before the world, but
          even in secret where no eye sees but God's. They will stand aloof from
          temptations, and even from the appearance of evil: and wherein they
          are overtaken through the frailty of the flesh, they will mourn for it
          before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In respect both of heart and life. They turn against sin to oppose
          and resist it, in the inner and outward man, as taking now the
          contrary side to the devil, the world, and the flesh. The spiritual
          combat is begun in the true penitent, Galatians 5:17. The war with sin
          is proclaimed and begun, which never ends until death. They revolt
          from, cast off the yoke, and stand up against their old masters, 2
          Timothy 2:19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, They resist the motions of sin in their hearts, and endeavor
          after heart purity, as well as life purity: Psalm 119:113. "I hate
          vain thoughts: but your law do I love." The Pharisaical professor may
          cleanse the outside of the platter, while he is little troubled about
          its being within full of ravening. But the hardest work a gracious
          soul has against sin, is with the heart, with what the world neither
          sees nor can see in him. And the guiding of the heart is the hardest
          piece of management in his religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They resist the outbreakings of sin in the life: Psalm 18:23. "I
          was also upright before him: and I kept myself from mine iniquity."
          They see they are in a world where snares are thick laid; they see
          their own weakness, and how ready they are to be entrapped, and
          therefore labor to be on their guard, lest they be carried away with
          the stream. Hence they are afraid of temptations, and therefore labor
          to shut their eyes from beholding vanity; sometimes fearing to fall
          one day by the hand of temptation, and therefore longing to be beyond
          the reach of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. And Lastly, Because their turning from sin is never perfect until
          death, therefore so long they are ay turning, and renewing their
          repentance, John 13:10, They are not true penitents who look on it as
          the work of some days or weeks, at the soul's first conversion to God.
          A true penitent will ay be repenting, as long as he is sinning. He
          sees that he is often falling into the mire, and therefore must be
          often washing; daily contracting new debt, therefore must be daily
          crying for forgiveness. And the more heinous his after miscarriages
          be, the longer he lies secure, his repentance will be the more bitter
          when he rises up again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now, this turning from sin has these properties.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is voluntary, as springing from an inward principle set up in
          the heart against sin: Job 42:6. "I abhor myself, and repent in dust
          and ashes." The penitent does not only cast away sin as a live coal
          out of his bosom, that would burn him, but as some loathsome thing,
          that would defile him. Some turn from their sins against their will;
          they part with their sin as Phaltiel did with his unlawful wife
          Michal, 2 Samuel 3:15. They dwell in the tents of sin, until the
          rigging-tree break, and there is no abiding longer there for them;
          they part with their sins, as the covetous man with his riches at
          death, when, nill he will he, he must let it go. But true repentance
          is a turning from sin out of choice: and forced reformation neither is
          sincere nor will last, Psalm 78:34.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is sincere, as being a turning from sin as sin, a turning from
          it because it is a turning away from God, a turning from it for its
          contrariety to God's holy nature and law, Luke 15:18. The man leaves
          his sin, not for the inferior motives only of danger to himself by it,
          but from the higher motives, namely, because it is offensive to God,
          dishonors his Son, grieves his Spirit, transgresses his law, and
          defaces his image. If your turning from sin proceed not from these
          motives, God will never regard it as acceptable in his sight. It is
          done for self not for God; and God will never be the reward of that
          work whereof he is not the end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question. What should one do with respect to those sins he has turned
          from, from these lower motives of self, or those sins that have left
          him, before he left them? Answer. Do not turn back to them; but do
          with them as they use to do with those that die by their own hands,
          bury them disgracefully, and throw stones on their grave. Look on them
          and loathe them, rise higher in your motives to forsake them than
          before. You left them for your own sake, put them further away for the
          sake of God's honor. Set them before your eyes again, and see how
          provoking they have been to a holy God, how dishonoring to his Son,
          etc. repent and mourn over them on these accounts. And then your
          turning from them will be sincere.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. This turning from sin is universal: Psalm 119:104, "I hate every
          false way." Ezekiel 18:31, "Cast away from you all your
          transgressions." Whoever turns sincerely from one sin, turns from all
          known sin whatever; because the reason that moves the true penitent,
          is to be found in all as well as any one. Partial reformation is not
          sincere; for God requires the whole heart, and will not be served by
          halves. Every sin is a deadly wound to the soul; and therefore though
          many be cured, if but one remain uncured, the man is a dead man by
          that one: Matthew 5:29. "If your right eye offend you, pluck it out,
          and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your
          members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast
          into Hell." A drop of poison will make a whole cup of good wine
          deadly, and one sin retained will render all other reformation naught;
          as Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal's concubine was the death of all his
          seventy sons by his wives except one.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is speedy, without delays: Psalm 119:60, "I made haste, and
          delayed not to keep your commandments." As long as a man is
          undetermined to turn from his sin, or delays to do it, his repentance
          is not sincere. It is an evidence that the lance of humiliation has
          not gone deep enough, when the filthy matter does not presently spring
          forth. A man whose heart is truly touched with a penitent sense of
          sin, will delay as long the flinging a burning coal out of his bosom,
          as the casting away of his sin. No: when it goes to the quick, it must
          off presently; though it were an offending right hand, it must be cut
          off presently; though it were an offending right eye, it must be
          presently plucked out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, This turning from sin is thorough; it makes complete work
          evangelically, though not legally. It was a flaw in Judah's
          repentance, that she turned not unto the Lord with her whole heart,
          but insincerely. Jeremiah 3:10; and in Ephraim's that he mixed himself
          among the people, and was a cake not turned, Hosea 7:8. Men turn
          thoroughly from sin in these four respects.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The true penitent sticks at no known sin, but turns from all
          without exception, even those sins that are dearest and nearest to
          them, and which they have been most easily beset with, Hebrews 12:1,
          "I kept myself from mine iniquity," Psalm 18:23. This turning from sin
          is never thorough, until it reach the sin that is the sin of one's
          constitution, the sin that is the sin which most attends his calling,
          stations, and relations wherein he stands; the sin that he has most
          frequent and strongest temptations unto. That is the predominant evil
          which the heart must be loosed from, the right hand and right eye sin,
          the one thing lacking, which mars all other things, Mark 7:21. Unless
          there be a turning from, a warring with this, it is all wrong; though
          indeed they may sometimes lose as well as win in the battle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, He turns from that which is the ensnaring hook in any of his
          sins, the handle whereby it caught hold of him, Psalm 131:2. Pharaoh
          would have been content to let Israel go, so be they would have left
          their little ones, which he was sure would have brought them back
          again. And Satan will let people turn from sin for a time, while they
          retain a reigning love to the bewitching thing that is in a sinful
          course. For while it is so, the tree is indeed cut, but the root is
          left in the ground, and will grow again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, He turns from the occasions of sin, Ezekiel 14:6. Wherefore
          David prays, "Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity;" and Solomon
          gives advice in case of drunkenness, Proverbs 23:31, "Look not you
          upon the wine when it is red, when it gives his color in the cup, when
          it moves itself aright. It is vain to pretend to repent and turn from
          sin, while men do not watch against the occasions of it, and wrestle
          against them, as against the sin itself. They that in a siege mind
          really to defend the town, they will defend the outworks as long as
          they can; willfully to let the enemy in there, speaks treachery. Much
          lies in this point for reformation: Proverbs 4:14, 15, "Enter not into
          the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it,
          pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, He turns from the enjoyment of the fruits of his sin. To
          pretend to turn from sin, and yet to feed sweetly on the fruits of it,
          is an absolutely vain pretense. When sin itself is truly quit, the
          profit of it is given up with. This the prophet teaches, Isaiah 33:15,
          "He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly, he who despises the
          gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes,
          that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from
          seeing evil," etc. This is so evident, that even Judas in his
          repentance, such as it was, could no longer brook the reward of his
          iniquity, Matthew 27:3. A philosopher had bought a pair of shoes, but
          had not paid the price of them; the tradesman died; the philosopher
          thought the money was gained; but his conscience caused him bring back
          the money, and throw it into the shop. "Take it," says he, "you are
          alive to me, while dead to all the world besides." Hence two things
          belong to this part of repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Restitution, or restoring the thing again, which has been
          sinfully and wrongly taken away from others. He who can do it, and
          will not, cannot repent of that sin; for he willfully feeds on the
          fruit of his sin; and that is a continuing in it inconsistent with
          turning from it. And since there is no pardon of that sin which a man
          does not repent of, it is a maxim in divinity, to a person that is
          able, but unwilling to do it. Hence Zacchaeus proves himself a true
          penitent by restitution, Luke 19:8. And one may as well think a thief
          may repent in the time he is feeding on what he has stolen from his
          neighbor, as that one may repent of what in other cases he has
          unjustly taken from his neighbor, and can, but will not restore. When
          lovers part, they give back their tokens; and so when a sinner parts
          with his sin, he restores all that he had unjustly taken from others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Reparation as far as may be, in those cases wherein proper
          restitution cannot be made: as in the case of unjust wounding our
          neighbor's honor, reputation, peace, quiet, and contentment, etc.
          Hence is that exhortation, James 5:16, "Confess your faults one to
          another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed." One may as
          well pretend to repent and go on in sin, as willfully to refuse this
          and repent of the sin. The like reparation is necessary in those
          scandalous sins, whereby the honor of God is impaired before the
          world, religion wounded, and exposed to the contempt and scorn of
          profane men, and the hearts of the godly saddened. To repent of such
          sins, and yet willfully to refuse the way whereby the honor of God,
          and the credit of religion, might in some measure be repaired, is
          impossible. One may as well pretend to repent of his wounding a man,
          while he stands looking on him bleeding to death, and will not, though
          it is in his power, bind up his wounds.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1. Hence we may see what is the proper way to follow out the
          design of our congregational fast; namely, to turn from our sins which
          have provoked the Lord to wrath against us. For humiliation without
          reformation can do little service. Let each of us lay our hands to our
          heart, and consider what has been the coal that we have cast in to
          raise this flame, and heartily turn from these things. If so, we would
          readily wear with thankfulness the blessings obtained by prayers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. All the trouble, grief, and sorrow that men have for their sin is
          little worth, if it issue not in turning from sin. For men to be
          sighing, but still going backward, is not repentance, but of that sort
          which may be carried on in Hell, through eternity. If turning be not
          joined to mourning for sin, it is unsanctified sorrow, that will
          neither be acceptable to God, nor profitable to our souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Turning from sin outwardly, while the heart remains glued to it, is
          not repentance either. It is an easy thing to reform outwardly; but
          the great business lies in getting the heart weaned from the world and
          lusts. If we would be satisfied as to the truth of our repentance, we
          must likewise examine the motives prevailing with us to turn from sin;
          for the mean and low motives that rise no higher than ourselves, our
          own advantage, ease, safety, etc. will never denominate us true
          penitents.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Repentance is not the work of a day or a year, but the work of our
          whole lives. For so turning from sin is. Sin follows us, while we flee
          from it; often does it overtake us, and so we must renew our flight.
          The whole life of a Christian is a war; in that war are many battles,
          sometimes the Christian gains the day, and sometimes he loses. If he
          lose, he must renew the battle; if he win, he must pursue the victory,
          and lay his account with a new engagement. The great comfort is, that
          though he may lose a battle, yet he shall be victorious in the war:
          "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under his feet shortly," Romans
          16:20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, See here the necessity of turning from sin. "Except you
          repent," says the text, "you shall all likewise perish." Now, if you
          do not turn from sin, you do not repent; therefore if you turn not
          from it by repentance, you shall perish. Our sins or out souls must
          go. Turn, or burn in the fire of God's wrath, is the choice. Let us
          then return speedily and thoroughly from all our iniquities, so shall
          they not be our ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. In repentance there is a returning unto God: Hosea 6:1, "Come, and
          let us return unto the Lord." This is the term to which the sinner
          comes back. Sin is a departing form God, repentance is a coming back
          to him again. It is a coming back, like that of a runaway servant to
          his master, returning to his place and duty in the family. Sin carried
          away mankind from God two ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sin carried men away from God as a portion wherein to rest. He is
          all-sufficient to himself and to his creatures, and none but he is so.
          Sin carried man away from God to the creatures for happiness and
          satisfaction: hence says Jehovah, Jeremiah 2:13, "My people have
          committed two evils: they have forsaken me the fountain of living
          waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no
          water." There he seeks a rest to his heart. By faith man returns to
          God as a portion, unites with him again through Christ, and takes up
          his everlasting rest in him. Thus he returns as the dove to the ark,
          Isaiah 60:3, "Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to
          their windows?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sin carried man away from God as a Lord and Master, to whom he owes
          obedience. In this respect man returns to God by repentance, returning
          to his duty, Psalm 119:59, "I thought on my ways, and turned my feet
          unto your testimonies;" as Hagar was by the angel sent back to Sarah,
          Genesis 16:9. Men turning from God, turn their backs on his laws, and
          make their own lusts their laws; but the repenting sinner turns back
          to the laws of God, Psalm 119:59, forfeited. He has slipped his neck
          out of the yoke of the commands of Christ, but he comes and takes it
          on again, never to throw it off more, Matthew 11:29. He has gone off
          the road, the strait way; but he comes back, and bids an eternal
          farewell to the broad way. And there is here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, A return of the soul to God himself, 1 Kings 18:37, consisting in
          the heart's turning to the loving and liking of the Lord as a Lord and
          Master. Sinners departing from God, not only mislike their service,
          but the Master and his house: Luke 19:14, "His citizens hated him, and
          sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign
          over us." They are filled with prejudices against him, there is a
          natural aversion in the heart to him, they cannot away with subjection
          to him. Hence "they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
          the knowledge of your ways," Job 21:14. But in repentance that
          aversion is cured, and the soul inclines and moves towards him in
          heart and affections. This consists in three things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The soul is brought to esteem the Lord worthy to be served and
          pleased in all things. The name of God is to the penitent a worthy
          name, James 2:7. The soul sees the transcendent glory and excellency
          of God, worthy of all adoration and obedience; and so slights and
          disdains all other masters, as unworthy of the service of an immortal
          soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The soul chooses him as its only Lord and Master, saying, as in
          Isaiah 26:13, "O Lord our God, other lords besides you have had
          dominion over us: but by you only will we make mention of your name."
          This was Joshua's choice, chapter 24:15, "As for me and my house, we
          will serve the Lord." The enlightened mind beholds his glory, the
          glory and excellency of himself, his image, laws, ordinances, and
          service; and the renewed will consents and cleaves to him. It has
          tried many masters, "serving divers lusts," Titus 3:3; but could never
          have satisfaction in the service of any of them, and therefore says,
          as Hosea 2:7, "I will go and return to my first husband, for then was
          it better with me than now."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The soul looks upon the service of God as its great happiness.
          Hence said the prodigal, when he came to himself, "How many hired
          servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
          with hunger? Luke 15:17. And therefore the saints are found declaring
          them happy who are most employed in his service, as the queen of Sheba
          said of Solomon's servants: Psalm 65:4, "Blessed is the man whom you
          chose, and causes to approach unto you, that he may dwell in your
          courts." And 84:4, "Blessed are they that dwell in your house: they
          will be still praising you." And until the soul come to this, to
          account the Lord's service the only true freedom and happiness, though
          they may take up his service, they will not abide with it, because
          they do not like their Master.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, There is in this returning a return of the soul to its duty to
          God. Hence said Saul, "Lord, what will you have me to do?" Acts 9:6.
          Whoever returns to God, comes home as a servant to enter to work: for
          idlers about God's house may be nominal servants, but real ones they
          cannot be. God's servants have higher relations which they stand in to
          him; but all of them have duty annexed to them. Are they married to
          Christ? they must bring forth fruit, Romans 7:4. Are they friends?
          they must do whatever he commands them, John 15:14. See Malachi 1:6.
          Now, the penitent returns to his duty in these two respects.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The penitent returns to his duty in his heart. He is
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) reconciled to the whole law of God, and the whole yoke of Christ,
          so far as it is known to him to be his law and yoke, Psalm 119:6. "I
          have respect unto all your commandments." He has a love and liking of
          the duties of piety towards God, and righteousness towards men. Though
          there remain in him a contradicting principle, yet he can say, as
          Romans 7:22, "I delight in the law of God, after the inward man." The
          heart-enmity against the law and the power of godliness is removed,
          and nothing is so desirable to him as to be holy as God is holy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) He has a full and fixed purpose of new obedience: Psalm 119:57,
          "O Lord, I have said, that I would keep your words." Verse 112, "I
          have inclined mine ear to perform your statutes always, even unto the
          end." He returns with a purpose never to be what he has been; to
          pursue holiness, to enter upon, and keep the way of duty, whatever be
          the hardships and difficulties he may meet with in it. And this
          purpose is for today, not for tomorrow only; not to delay a minute,
          but presently to fall in with every known duty, as knowing there is no
          time for delaying.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The penitent returns to his duty in both heart and life. He is
          brought to sincere endeavors after new obedience: 2 Corinthians 7:11,
          "Behold, this self-same thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort,
          what carefulness it wrought in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves,
          yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes,
          what zeal, yes, what revenge! in all things you have approved
          yourselves to be clear in this matter." Purposes without endeavors are
          but fair blossoms without fruit, which will never prove a penitent. If
          the lame man be cured, though not perfectly cured, he will rise and
          walk as he can. It is true, while here we can do nothing perfectly
          well; but the true penitent will endeavor to do all, and aim at no
          less than perfection. Hence said Paul, "I press toward the mark, for
          the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus," Philippians
          3:14. So the penitent returning to his duty,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [1.] Returns to the practice of every known duty. Hence said David, "I
          have respect unto all your commandments," Psalm 119:6. He labors to
          know what is duty, and is willing to know it; and when known,
          endeavors to perform it. He puts hand to external and internal
          obedience; to serve God in heart and life too; to perform his duty to
          God and to his neighbor; personal and relative, secret, private, and
          public.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [2.] Returns to spirituality in every duty: Philippians 3:3, "For we
          are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in
          Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh." The true penitent
          will not sist in the carcass of duties, but will endeavor to get in to
          those unseen things where lies the life and soul of duties; namely, to
          have his heart imbued with love to God as the principle of his
          obedience, touched with regard to the honor of God as his end, raised
          above selfish ends and designs, and performing all in faith, leaning
          on the Lord for strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now, this returning to the Lord is,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A sincere returning, not feigned and hypocritical, with the whole
          heart, Jeremiah 3:10. Hypocrites are said to have a heart and a heart,
          a divided heart, one for God, and another for their lusts. But the
          Lord says in this case, If you take me, let these go away. For no man
          can serve two masters. It is a returning to him to abide with him
          forever, as Onesimus to Philemon, verse 15. The penitent, like the
          servant under the law, his ear is nailed to God's door-posts, to serve
          him forever. To return for a time is naught.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A voluntary return. The penitent comes back with heart and
          good-will, Psalm 110:3, "Your people shall be willing in the day of
          your power;" as one that is going back to a good and honorable master,
          and will serve him with gladness: Psalm 100:2, "Serve the Lord with
          gladness." They that are only driven back to God, by heavy rods or
          sharp convictions, will come away again; yet people may be driven at
          first to God, who seeing his glory and excellency, and the
          desirableness of his service afterwards, do voluntarily and heartily
          yield themselves to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A speedy return: Psalm 119:60, "I made haste, and delayed not to
          keep your commandments." They that are sincere will not delay for a
          moment; they will make no truce with sin. The moment wherein true
          repentance touches the heart, is the precise term of going home to
          God; for they know that if they delay a moment longer, that moment may
          be the fatal moment to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A thorough return. The soul sticks at no known duty, but embraces
          all, be it ever so hard, and unpleasant to flesh and blood. Hence said
          the Lord of David, Acts 13:22, "I have found David the son of Jesse; a
          man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will." The
          penitent puts a blank in God's hand, saying, "Lord, what will you have
          me to do? Speak, Lord," says he, "your servant hears." He is for the
          will of God, without disputing. For God is an absolute master, and is
          therefore to be obeyed without reserve.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE of this point. It lets us see, that negative reformation is not
          sufficient for repentance. One must not only turn from sin, but turn
          unto God. We must not only put away evil, but take in to us the
          contrary good: Isaiah 1:16, "Wash you, make you clean, put away the
          evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to
          do well," etc. We must not only give up with such and such lusts, but
          be endued with the contrary graces. Some people reform from the evils
          of their life, but they do not go forward to the positive ways of
          holiness. They satisfy themselves, with the proud Pharisee, that they
          are not unjust, no extortioners, etc; but, alas! they do not consider,
          that when the house which the devil goes out of is empty, he returns
          with seven spirits more wicked than himself, and so the last state of
          such a person is worse than the first, Matthew 12:44, 45.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify"><b>THE APPLICATION</b></p>
        <p align="justify">
          I come now to the application of the whole. And here I would sound the
          alarm in the ears of impenitent sinners, to repent, and turn from
          their sins unto God. O sinners, repent, repent; you are gone away to
          your lusts and idols, turn from them; you have turned your back on
          God, turn to him again. In prosecuting this call to repentance, I
          shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Endeavor to convince you of the need you have to repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Lay before you a train of motives to repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Show you the great hindrances of repentance. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Give directions in order to your obtaining repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall endeavor to convince you of the need you have to repent, to
          make way for the motives to it. There are three sorts of persons that
          will readily stave off all our calls to repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. One says, I repent of my sins daily. Well were it with you, if it
          were so. Surely there is need for it. But none are so ready to pretend
          to this, as those that never yet knew what it is to repent. If ruing
          the ill you have done, a sigh for it, and a short-winded wish for
          mercy, be repentance, it is easy work. But it is not so. You can not
          repent with a hale heart: that heart of your must be rent for sin, and
          rent from it; you must turn from sin unto God in all known duties of
          obedience. If you pretend then to repentance, bring forth fruits meet
          for it. But to such pretended penitents we may say, as Samuel to Saul,
          1 Samuel 15:14, "What means then this bleating of the sheep, and the
          lowing of the oxen?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Another says, I have repented already. But O consider, repentance
          is not the work of a day, but of your whole lifetime, since you are
          never free of sin, Jeremiah 8:6. New provocations require new
          repentance; nay, old sins are not to be forgotten. Hence said Moses,
          Deuteronomy 9:7, "Remember, and forget not how you provokedst the Lord
          your God to wrath in the wilderness." And hence prays the Psalmist,
          Psalm 25:7, "Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
          transgressions." And if you repent of them thoroughly, you will be
          ashamed, and the wound will bleed afresh at the remembrance of them.
          Hence said the apostle, Romans 6:21, "What fruit had you in those
          things, whereof you are now ashamed?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Another sees no need of repentance for him; for such persons are of
          that blinded generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is
          not washed from their filthiness, Proverbs 30:12. They deny their sin
          instead of mourning over and confessing it, saying as verse 20. "I
          have done no wickedness." They possibly keep free from the gross
          pollutions of the outward man; and for the positive duties of
          religion, they either see no need of them, or if they do perform them
          too, they are blind to the corruption of their nature, and to heart
          sins, and the spirituality of the law of God. But you need repentance
          as much as the proud Pharisee, Luke 18 and as the Apostle Paul, Romans
          7:9. compared with Titus 3. But O consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Are there not many of us that never got a sound awakening all
          their days? They had lived under the sound of the gospel, but it never
          broke their rest effectually in a sinful course. I will read the
          mystery of your case, Luke 11:21. "When a strong man armed keeps his
          palace, his goods are in peace." Repent then, else you are undone.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Are there not many whose awakening has produced a partial change
          on them, but it has ended in a fearful apostasy from the way of God? 2
          Peter 2:22. "It is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
          The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and, the bow that was
          washed, to her wallowing in the mire." Their fair blossom they once
          had, has gone up as dust. Repent, or your backsliding will be your
          ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Are there not many sleeping virgins at this day, who are in a
          course of departing from God? The life, vigor, and tenderness they
          sometimes had, is gone; and death has settled down on their eyelids,
          and they are turned to be of the color of the earth. To these we must
          say, as Revelation 2:5. "Remember therefore from whence you are
          fallen, and repent, and do the first works."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Are there not many living in known sin? They know the
          particulars wherein they are wrong, and yet on they go, as an ox to
          the slaughter. Their corruptions are too strong for conscience. You
          must repent, or you will perish. Profane courses will make a miserable
          end, and one sin retained will ruin the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, Look and see whether you can perceive the footsteps of Christ's
          flock, or of the devil's drove, on the way which you are going,
          Canticles 1:8. Is your case the case wherein the fair company walked
          with displayed banners to Canaan, or that wherein many have slept and
          slipped away to the pit?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6thly, Can you deny but that there are many foul steps you have made
          and are making? O then repent. Go no farther on; one step more may put
          you beyond returning, Luke 14:24. Little knows the sinner how soon God
          may take the foot from him, either by clapping a withering curse on
          him, as on the fig-tree, Hosea 4:17. or by taking him red-hand in his
          sin, and sending him to the pit, Proverbs 29:1. "He who being often
          reproved, hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that
          without remedy."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I will lay before you a train of motives to repentance
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 1. Consider the obligations that lie on you to repent. Sit down
          and consider how manifold ties are on you to it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The command of God obliges you to it: Acts 17:30. "God commanded
          all men everywhere to repent." And will you not have regard to the
          sovereign authority of him that made you? The command to repentance is
          one of the two great commands of the gospel, Acts 20:21. "Testifying
          both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and
          faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ." This is the command which the
          prophets of old did so often inculcate, Ezekiel 18:30. "Repent, and
          turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be
          your ruin." This our Lord Jesus and the Baptist preached, and his
          disciples, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
          This the Apostles preached, Acts 2:38. "Repent, and be baptized every
          one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins."
          And this all along is the joint sound of the preachers of the gospel.
          So it is an old and new command too. No command is more peremptorily
          laid on, as in the text. As you regard then God's authority, repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Your baptism obliges you: Mark 1:4. "John did baptize in the
          wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance, for the remission of
          sins." It is a solemn tie laid upon you to return to and serve God the
          Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; to die unto sin, to live unto
          righteousness. You have then taken on the Lord's badge; how dreadful
          must it be to continue runaways from your Great Master? Repent, then,
          and return, as you would not be treated as runaways from your colors,
          as rebels that cast off your allegiance sworn to the King of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Your mercies oblige you in point of gratitude; Romans 2:4, "Despise
          you the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering;
          not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?" your
          common mercies, and special ones, preventing, restraining, etc. Every
          mercy is forfeited by sin; yet you are still in God's debt, and every
          day a new load of favors is laid on, and these are strong ties to
          repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Your profession obliges you. You profess yourselves
          Christians. If you will name the name of Christ, then depart from
          iniquity, 2 Timothy 2:19. Why do you call God Father, if you will
          needs do the works of the devil, (John 8:44.) which Christ came to
          destroy? Do you profess Christ your Redeemer, the Holy Spirit your
          Sanctifier? why then do you continue in bondage to your sin, in unholy
          courses? Do you believe every sin deserves God's wrath? what madness
          is it then to be treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath? Quit
          your profession then, or quit your sinful courses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 2. Seriously consider what sin is, that you are so fond of,
          prefer to Christ, and for the enjoyment of it forfeit the favor of
          God. What do you see in it, that does so powerfully charm you? If you
          are taken with the profit of it, you would consider that no advantage
          will quit the cost of the soul's ruin brought about by it: Matthew
          16:26, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
          and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his
          soul?" Job 27:8, "For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has
          gained, when God takes away his soul?" If you are taken with the
          pleasure of it; that is dear bought, being purchased at the rate of
          eternal flames, which sin will bring men to without repentance. The
          pleasures of sin are but momentary, Hebrews 11:25. And there is far
          more in God's service, even in this world: Psalm 4:6, 7, "There be
          many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift you up the light
          of your countenance upon us. You have put gladness in my heart, more
          than in the time that their corn and their wine increased." Consider,
          I pray you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Has not every bait a hook with it? Proverbs 23:31, 32. Is there not
          a trap, gin, and snare in them all for you? How often have you seen
          there has been death in the pot, when you have sit down to feed your
          corruptions? You have snatched at the bait, but have you not in the
          meantime felt yourselves wounded with the hook? you have smelled the
          rose, but have not the prickles mean while annoyed you? And how can it
          be otherwise? for "he who digs a pit, shall fall into it; and whoever
          breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him," Ecclesiastes 10:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Is there any solid rest in a sinful course? No, surely: Isaiah
          57:21, "There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked." Do not your
          consciences witness, that the sting of guilt in the conscience is like
          a dead fly in the ointment, causing all to be unsavory? Is there not
          always a worm at the root of every sinful gourd you sit down under the
          shadow of? Do not the very may bees of conscience suck the sap out of
          your lusts many times? Will any man say, that ever he found rest to
          his soul in a course of departing from God? No, no; ten thousand
          worlds will not satisfy an immortal soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Do not you find sin to be an insatiable tyrant, like the grave and
          the barren womb, never saying, It is enough? Isaiah 57:20. "The wicked
          are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up
          mire and dirt." O but they have a hard task, that have living raging
          lusts to feed! James 4:2, 3, "You lust, and have not: you kill, and
          desire to have, and cannot obtain: you fight and war, yet you have
          not, because you ask not. You ask, and receive not, because you ask
          amiss, that you may consume it upon your lusts." Psalm 78:18, 19, "And
          they tempted God in their heart, by asking meet for their lust. Yes,
          they spoke against God: they said, can God furnish a table in the
          wilderness?" The more they are indulged, the more they grow rampant:
          the more their thirst is cared for, the greater thirst is created.
          Hence men in a sinful course go from evil to worse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Is not a sinful course a most foolish course? No man is unfaithful
          to God, but he is unfaithful to himself, and his own interest and
          happiness. The Lord offers to reason the matter with you, and to make
          your consciences judge; Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let us reason
          together, says the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
          as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
          wool." It stands between you, and temporal and eternal happiness. It
          is a poisonous cup, bringing death along with it. And how foolish is
          it for men to hug a serpent in their bosom, when called to throw it
          out; to drink a cup of poison, when called to throw it away; to take
          coals in their bosom, when it is told they will burn them; to court
          their own death and ruin?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Is not sin the separation wall between God and you? Isaiah 59:2,
          "Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your
          sins have hidden his face from you, that he will not hear." Does it
          not mar your comfort from the word, your confidence in the Lord, and
          your access to God in duties? does it not make as it were a gulf
          between Heaven and you, that whatever communion others have with
          Heaven, your unrepented-of sins lets you have none? Shall this be your
          choice? Sure, then, you need not wonder, if you will not come back to
          God, he bid you at last depart from him, "into everlasting fire,
          prepared for the devil and his angels."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Consider what will be the end thereof. Sorely it will be
          bitterness in the end: Jeremiah 2:19, "Your own wickedness shall
          correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you: know therefore
          and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken
          the Lord your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord God
          of hosts." However pleasant the cup seem to be at the brim, the dregs
          of it will be bitter: Proverbs 9:17, 18, "Stolen waters are sweet, and
          bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knows not that the dead are
          there; and that her guests are in the depths of Hell." However taking
          the entertainment be, the reckoning will be dreadful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 3. Consider you must die: Hebrews 9:27, "It is appointed unto
          men once to die." Death is certain, and therefore repentance is
          necessary. O if men would realize death to themselves, sinners would
          soon find it necessary to turn a new leaf. One hearing Genesis 5. read
          in the church, was so impressed with the thoughts of death, that he
          presently betook himself to a new course of life, that he might die
          well. We must all meet with death, lie down in the grave; let us view
          it aforehand, and see how it calls us to repent. Look to your dying
          hour, and to your grave, O impenitent sinner, and consider these few
          things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Would you be content to die as you live? You live in your sin,
          without God; would you desire to die so? Many indeed entertain
          Balaam's wish, for the death of the righteous, while they care not for
          their life, Numbers 23:10, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and
          let my last end be like his." But remember he did not get it, chapter
          31:8, "Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword." And
          while death is so uncertain, it is the hanging of an eternal weight on
          a hair, to look to get matters mended then, that are not mended now.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider, what will a sinful life look like on a death-bed? How
          will you be able to look your unrepented-of guilt, and a long eternity
          in the face together? Ezekiel 22:14, "Can your heart endure, or can
          your hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with you? I the
          Lord have spoken it, and will do it." Sin sits easy now on a sleepy
          conscience, while health and strength lasts, and death appears not.
          But when death stares you in the face, and the awakened conscience
          flies upon you, it will cut you to the heart, that you have not
          repented before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. What will it be to die, and go to another world with a load of
          unrepented-of guilt on your back? Look to your grave aforehand; think
          with yourselves, how will it be to lie down there with your bones full
          of your iniquity? Is it not best now, to shake off and east away your
          transgressions, as knowing that however you may live with them, you
          cannot die with them well.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. At a dying hour you must part with the world, and the enjoyment of
          your lusts. The foul feast you sit at now, death will overthrow the
          table, and the sad reckoning for it comes in then, and continues
          forever. O rise up now, and leave it by repentance. Part with these
          things at God's call, which you must part with before long, whether
          you will or not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, There is no repentance in the grave, Ecclesiastes 9:10. You
          must repent, or you perish; and it is now or never. Mar matters now by
          an impenitent life, and let death catch you there, you shall never be
          able to mend them more. The working time, and time of trial is over
          then. If the brittle thread of life were broke, which may be snapped
          asunder in a moment, then you are beyond the line of mercy. The candle
          burnt to snuff, shall be as soon brought to born again, as time shall
          be recalled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 4. Take a view of the tribunal of God, before which you must
          appear: 2 Corinthians 5:10, 11, "We must all appear before the
          judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in
          his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.
          Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." O sinner,
          know you not that there is a judgment to come, and how this calls you
          to repent? Acts 17:30, 31, "God commands all men everywhere to repent:
          because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world
          in righteousness, by that man whom he has ordained: whereof he has
          given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the
          dead." Were men to lie forever neglected, without a future reckoning,
          as the beasts that perish, they might live as they list, the hazard of
          condemnation for an eternity would not press them. But it is not so:
          Hebrews 9:27, "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
          the judgment." Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. While you are going on in sin, your debt to the divine justice is
          increasing, the accounts are swelling; and the reckoning for them
          before the tribunal will be terrible, however little you think of them
          now, Ecclesiastes 11:9. They may fall out of your memory, but they
          will not fall out of the book of God's remembrance, Hosea 13:12. But
          now is the time to get them laid over on the cautioner's score.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Though you will not seek them out now to mourn over them, and turn
          from them, they will find you out before the tribunal of God, Happy
          would the sinner be, if his sins would part with him at the grave; but
          they "shall lie down with him in the dust," Job 20:11: or if they
          would lie down with him there, if they would lie still and never rise
          again; but "God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
          secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil," Ecclesiastes
          12:14. The Judge is omniscient, nothing can be hidden from him, he is
          not capable to forget the least injury which the sinner has done to
          his glory; all must come into the account.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When you see Christ come again, and his throne set for judgment,
          when the trumpet shall blow, and the dead arise, and made to compear
          before that tribunal, when the heavens and earth shall pass away, what
          will be your thoughts of staving off repentauce?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Your state for eternity will be determined there according
          to your deeds done in the flesh. Impenitent sinners will get a long
          eternity to rue their obstinacy in, while those that repented in time
          shall be happy forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 5. To move you to repentance, consider the sufferings of
          Christ. A Roman senator intending to provoke the people to revenge the
          death of Caesar killed by Brutus, brought forth his bloody robe, and
          cried, "Here is the robe of your late emperor." And O will you look to
          the bloody robe of Christ, hung up on the pole of the gospel, to move
          you to repentance? Zechariah 12:10, "They shall look upon me whom they
          have pierced, and they shall mourn for him," etc. And learn here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. How dreadful must God's indignation against sin be, which is
          written with the blood of Christ, pierced with the sword of justice.
          Is it not "a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God?"
          And shall we continue in sin, against which such indignation appeared?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sin appeared terrible in Sodom when in flames, but yet more
          terrible in mount Calvary, where the justice of God pursued the Son of
          God with the sword of vengeance. A spectacle of amazement, the Son of
          God set up for a mark to the arrows of God! Do you not ask into the
          cause of all this? It was sin. The children ate the sour grape, and
          the father's teeth were set on edge. They contract the debt, justice
          lays hold on him, and he "restores what he took not away, Psalm 69:4.
          The elect took on the debt jovially, but he is put to tears and strong
          cries in the paying of it. And will we not hate and loath sin?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods from above
          nor from below drown it. "Behold how he loved you." He might have been
          happy in his Father's love, though mortals had never shared of it with
          him. But such was his love to sinners, as made him lay down his life
          for them, that so a way might be pared for the egress of his Father's
          love towards them. And will you not hate and loathe sin which was the
          cause of his death? Is this your kindness to your friend?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When Christ suffered, the earth quaked, rocks rent, the dead arose,
          the sun was struck, blind with the sight, and hidden his face for
          shame: and how can we stand unmoved, who were the first movers of the
          bloody tragedy, whose sins furnished a Judas to betray him, a Pilate
          to sentence him? etc. Look here, and mourn for, and turn from sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, Did he not suffer enough? must he suffer more still, even
          in his state of exaltation? will you grieve his Spirit, trample on his
          laws, yes and his blood, continuing impenitent in your sins?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 6. Consider the wrong done to God by your sin, in which you may
          see the ugly picture of it. This kept Joseph from yielding to a strong
          temptation, Genesis 39:9; and pierced David's heart with repentance
          for his sin, Psalm 51:4; and lay heavy on the prodigal son, Luke
          15:18. Every sin reaches the throne of God in Heaven, and him that
          sits on it. It is true, the malice of sinners against God is impotent
          malice, and can do him no real prejudice, do their worst. They cannot
          make him less happy, they cannot disturb his peace, Job 35:6–8. But
          the sinner is like the beggar full of sores lying on a dunghill,
          venting his spite against the prince on the throne. He wrongs the
          honor of God, his declarative glory, though he can do nothing against
          his essential glory. Sinner, you wrongest God by your sin,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By setting yourself in opposition to his nature and will. What is
          sin continued in without repentance? "A walking contrary to God,"
          Leviticus 26:21; an interpretative aim to throw him down from his
          sovereignty, Psalm 14:1, "The fool has said in his heart, There is no
          God." You may put what fair colors you please upon it; but it is a
          throwing out the flag of defiance against the God that made you. For
          do you not thereby in effect disregard his all-seeing eye, and
          presence everywhere, bid defiance to his justice, and call in question
          his truth, despise his goodness and mercy, and run counter to his holy
          nature and will, while you runest still on that of which he has said,
          Jeremiah 14:4, "Oh do not this abominable thing that I hate!" And is
          this a course to be insisted in?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You wrongest God by trampling on his laws, Isaiah 33:22. He has
          given you a law to be the rule of your life, he has stamped it with
          his own sovereign authority, fenced it with punishments threatened,
          suitable to his infinite greatness: but you make no more of these than
          if they were cobwebs fit only to catch flies. You break through the
          fences, and in contempt of his authority, will be over into the
          forbidden ground. Thus you affrontest the God that made you: will he
          sit with it think you? No, he can avenge the affront, James 4:12,
          "There is one lawgiver, who is able to destroy;" and he will do it,
          Luke 19:27, "Those mine enemies which would not that I should reign
          over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You wrongest God by despising his Son, John 5:40. You wrong God at
          the rate heathens cannot do, and therefore your condemnation will be
          greater than theirs, John 3:19. God has sent his Son into the world,
          by his death to procure reconciliation between God and sinners; he has
          "exalted him to give repentance," Acts 5:31: but by your continuing in
          sin, you slight his death, and the purchase of his blood: you love
          your disease so, as you loathe the Physician. What will be the end of
          these things? Acts 13:41, "Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and
          perish."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. You wrongest God by grieving his Spirit, Ephesians 4:30. Hear God's
          complaints of impenitent sinners, Ezekiel 6:9, "I am broken with their
          whorish heart which has departed from me, and with their eyes which go
          a whoring after their idols." Amos 2:13, "Behold, I am pressed under
          you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves." How often has the
          Spirit of the Lord been at work with you to turn you from your sins,
          speaking to you by the word, providences, the secret checks of your
          own conscience, and secret motions and whispers within your own
          breast, but all to no purpose? This will not last: Genesis 6:3, "And
          the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he
          also is flesh." And it will have a doleful end, if you do not repent:
          Isaiah 63:10, "They rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he
          was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them." If sinners
          continue to be a burden to the Spirit of God, and do not take off the
          burden by repentance, God will throw it off to their cost: Isaiah
          1:24, "Therefore says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of
          Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine
          enemies."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. You wrongest God by defacing the remains of his image in your own
          soul, "God made man upright, after his own image." Adam's sin ruined
          his image in us. But the more we go on and sin, we render ourselves
          still the more unlike God, and the more contrary to him. How fearful
          is this, to be still blotting out any appearance of the traits of
          God's image in us?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, You wrongest God by the ill influence your example has on
          others. Hence says our Lord, Matthew 24:12, "Because iniquity shall
          abound, the love of many shall wax cold." Every impenitent sinner is
          an agent for the devil, and invites and encourages others to despise
          God and his ways, and so will be made to reckon for the mischief his
          sin does that way. The rich man in Hell was sensible of this, though
          it would seem not before, Luke 16:27, 28, "I pray you, father," said
          he to Abraham, "that you would send him [Lazarus] to my father's
          house: for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
          they also come into this place of torment."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, will you go on, thus wronging God by your sin, and not turn from
          it unto him? Consider, I pray you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. He is your Creator, Ecclesiastes 12:1. He gave you a being, and
          brought you out of the womb of nothing, and will you not be for him?
          will you be against him? Has not he who made you a right to rule you?
          does not reason itself say, that God's creating us gives him a
          sovereign dominon over us? O why will the creature thus set itself
          against the Creator? Will the potsherds strive against the potter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He is your Preserver, Hebrews 1:3. Acts 17:28. You live on his
          earth, feed on his good creatures, breathe in his air, and will you
          not hearken to his voice? Who was it that preserved you in the womb,
          that brought you out of it, so that it was not made your grave? Who
          has kept the brittle thread of your life from being broken hitherto,
          and fed you all your life long? Is it not the Lord? And will you fight
          against him with his own benefits which he has bestowed on you, yes,
          is bestowing on you while you go on in your sin? Shall the life,
          strength, comforts of life, time, etc. which he has given you, be
          employed to the grieving of his Spirit? What will the end of these
          things be?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He can destroy you, and that when he will, Matthew 10:28. Your life
          and breath is from him, and he can stop it when he pleases. He does
          not suffer you to go on to your sin, because he cannot help it, nay,
          the moment you provoke him, he can strike you dead, or send you down
          alive into the pit. But he waits to be gracious. And this one
          consideration might determine sinners to repent, if madness were not
          in their hearts, setting them to provoke him, who in a moment can
          destroy them, and make them silent in the grave.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. He is your Witness, Psalm 51:4. Luke 15:18. Sinners that like not
          to retain God in their knowledge, do in effect please themselves with
          the notion that God is closed up in Heaven, Ezekiel 9:9. "For they
          say, The Lord has forsaken the earth, and the Lord sees not." But the
          day comes when they will see themselves miserably deceived. No; he is
          a witness, though many times a silent witness; but he will speak in
          due time, Psalm 50:21, 22. The opening of the book of conscience, and
          of God's remembrance, will clear his being a witness of your whole way
          and every step of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, He will be your Judge, 2 Corinthians 5:10. And he is an
          omnicient one, from whom nothing can be bid; a just one, that will
          reward every one according to his works; an omnipresent one, from
          whose presence there can be no escape; an omnipotent one who can
          without fail make his sentence take effect. Will men pretend to
          believe a judgment to come, and yet be at no pains to make the judge
          their friend aforehand, but keep up the war against him, and not break
          it off by repentance? Alas! horrid unbelief is at the bottom of
          impenitency.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 7. God is calling you to repentance. Be not deaf to the calls
          of God, lest the Lord pay home your rebellion, by refusing to hear you
          when you call to him, Proverbs 1:24. and downwards. God is calling you
          to repentance,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By the mercies with which he is daily loading you. Quot beneficia,
          tot ora. Romans 2:4. "Despise you the riches of his goodness, and
          forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
          leads you to repentance? These are the cords of a man with which God
          is drawing you. That you are spared on God's earth, that you are kept
          out of Hell, that he gives you daily bread, and does not lock up
          Heaven and earth that they may not help you, call aloud to you to
          repent, and turn to him. And he takes notice how little these prevail,
          Jeremiah 5:24. "Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the
          Lord our God that gives rain, both the former and the latter in his
          season: he reserves unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God is calling you to repentance by the crosses and afflictions,
          either laid on you, or threatened. Every cross providence is a
          messenger from Heaven calling you to repentance: Micah 6:9. "Hear you
          the rod, and who has appointed it. They meet you in the way of sin, as
          the angel did Balaam; they bid you halt, and go no farther on; nay,
          they bid you return to the Lord. God is speaking to the land this way,
          to this church, and to the congregation, and to every one of us at
          this day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. God is calling you to repentance by the preaching of the word, Acts
          17:30. This is the great scope of all our preaching, that you may
          repent and turn from your sins unto God. And while God continues his
          gospel with us, it is a sign he is waiting for our repentance: but to
          continue in sin over the belly of all warnings, will have a fatal end
          to take us from the gospel, or the gospel from us; which we have
          ground to fear at this day on more accounts than one. Hence says
          Christ to the church of Ephesus, Revelation 2:5, "Remember from whence
          you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will
          come unto you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his
          place, except you repent."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE. Consider the text, "Except you repent, you shall perish."
          There are two things in this to press you to repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1 If you repent not, you shall perish. Sin unrepented of, brings ruin
          upon kingdoms, churches, congregations, families. And that is like to
          be the ruin of our land, and of our church, at this day. For, alas!
          the face of all at this day is like that described, Jeremiah 8:6. "I
          hearkened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of
          his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned unto his
          course, as the horse rushes into the battle." God has threatened us
          with desolating strokes, and is yet threatening but the generation is
          like to those scoffers spoken off, 2 Peter 3:4. saying, where is the
          promise of his coming? And because God does not speedily execute the
          sentence, therefore men cast off fear, and go on in their sins, in
          defiance of Heaven. But that concerns us nearly: Jeremiah 9:9. "Shall
          I not visit them for these things? says the Lord: shall not my soul be
          avenged on such a nation as this?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sin unrepented of will ruin your souls; Except you repent, you shall
          perish. Consider, your life, your souls lie at stake. Sinner, you have
          gone away from God, your soul is left in pawn that you shall return by
          repentance. If you return not, your pawn, your soul is lost, lost
          forever. Heaven's gate is too narrow to let you in there with a burden
          of unrepented-of sin on your back. Nay, Heaven you can never see; Hell
          you can not escape, if you repent not. The gospel calls you to repent;
          if not, the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty
          angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on you that know not God,
          and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ," 2
          Thessalonians 1:7, 8. Have pity therefore on your souls, Ezekiel
          18:31, 32, "Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you
          have transgressed, and make yon a new heart, and a new spirit; for why
          will you die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death
          of him that dies, says the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and
          live you." To this narrow point the matter is brought, Repent, or
          perish eternally; quit your sins, or quit Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now, I pray you consider here,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The certainty of your ruin in an impenitent state. You have it
          from the mouth of the Lord himself, in most plain and peremptory
          terms, that "except you repent, you shall perish." If it were but a
          may-be, it were sufficient in all reason to determine us to
          repentance; for it is unaccountable to put the soul in hazard of
          everlasting destruction, for all the profit or pleasure of a sinful
          course; a thousand times more than for one to put himself in hazard of
          drowning to catch a fly. But it is not a may-be, but certainly it
          shall be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, All other grounds of hope are out off, if you repent not. Tell
          me, O impenitent sinner, that will not turn from your sin, what will
          you trust to for salvation from the wrath of God? Will you trust to
          the mercy of God? I tell you you are a despiser of mercy, Romans 2:4;
          and you can not have it in this case, but over the belly of the truth
          of God; for he has said, "Except you repent, you shall perish." Pray
          consider, if you would have mercy, you must seek it in God's way:
          Isaiah 55:7, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
          his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
          upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Will you trust to Jesus Christ, his blood and merits? Do not deceive
          yourself. Is not this Christ's own word, "Except you repent you shall
          perish?" does not the Savior tell you this? None of my blood shall
          ever be wared on a sinner to save him from wrath, that will not repent
          and turn from his sin. Why does any body at all perish that hears the
          gospel, if folk may continue impenitent, and yet share of Christ's
          blood? No, no; to whom Christ will be a Savior from wrath, he will be
          first a Savior from sin, Matthew 1:21. He will first give repentance,
          before he give access to Heaven; for Christ's blood was never shed to
          bring in dogs and swine into his Father's house, but shed, "that he
          might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
          people, zealous of good works, Titus 2:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Where will the fruit of sin be, when this dear reckoning begins?
          Hebrews 10:31, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
          living God." You may get a time to run your course: but at length your
          eye-strings will break, the last pulse beat, and the soul will take
          wing and go to another world, and because of unrepented-of sin, be
          condemned to everlasting flames. And when you enter there, what will
          abide with you of all the satisfaction you have had in your sinful
          courses? No; then you must bid an eternal farewell to all
          satisfaction, ease, or delight whatever, either in God or your lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, How will you be able to stand under the load of wrath in the
          pit of destruction? Isaiah 33:14, "The sinners in Zion are afraid,
          fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites: who among us shall dwell
          with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting
          burnings? How will you be able to grapple with vengeance, the
          Mediator's vengeance, while God shall hold you up with the one hand,
          and punish you with the other? Think in time on the worm that never
          dies, and the fire that is never quenched: for either you must repent
          now, or that worm will gnaw you, and that fire scorch you forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider the eternity of this state. The pleasure, profit, and
          ease of sin are but for a moment; but the destruction for sin
          unrepented of is forever, 2 Thessalonians 1:9. O madness! to run the
          risk of everlasting pain for a moment's pleasure! If ruing, sorrow,
          remorse, rage against one's self for sin, were repenting, there would
          be repentance enough in Hell. Men stave off repentance now for the
          bitterness of it; but there is a sweet in it too: but then you shall
          have the bitterness of it in full measure, but never taste of the
          sweetness of it; for then the hopes of mercy are razed; and a fearful
          sight of an everlasting continuance of misery, without end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Have pity then on your own souls, and throw them not away for that
          which cannot profit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If you repent, you shall never perish. Repentance is the way to
          keep off the wrath of God from nations, churches, etc. Repentance is
          the way for each of us to escape the wrath of God: Ezekiel 18:30,
          "Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions;, so
          iniquity shall not be your ruin." Acts 2:38, "Repent, and be baptized
          every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
          sins." All the threatenings of wrath are summons to repent, and have
          always that clause understood in them, "Except you repent, you shall
          perish:" Revelation 2:22, "Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and
          them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they
          repent of their deeds." Though you have sinned with the world, if you
          repent with God's elect, you shall not perish with the world.
          Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, It is not falling into sin, but lying in sin without repentance,
          that ruins folk to whom the gospel comes, John 3:19. For there is a
          remedy provided; and it is for all diseases of the soul, even the
          worst and most desperate: and so nothing can be fatal to those that
          are willing to employ the Physician, and to undergo his method of
          cure. They are in glory this day, whose sins have been of the first
          magnitude, as David, Paul, Manasseh, Peter, etc. but they were
          repenting sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, There is mercy for you, if you will repent, and come to Christ.
          Good news, O sinners, If you repent, all your sins shall be blotted
          out, you shall be embraced in the wide and warm arms of mercy; if, as
          you have gone away from God, so you will come back again; Isaiah 55:7,
          "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
          and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and
          to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." Revelation 3:20, "Behold,
          I stand at the door, and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the
          door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." O
          sirs, will not affections of mercy draw you? God is now on a throne of
          mercy; he stretches out the golden scepter to you for peace, if you
          will have it in his own way: and in his name we proclaim mercy to all
          poor sinners that desire to turn from their sins unto God. O will not
          the proclamation of the indemnity touch the hearts of rebel sinners,
          and cause them to relent?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">OBJECTION 1. But my sins are many and great sins,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. God's mercies are many, Psalm 51:1. and great too, Psalm
          86:13; and his mercy is magnified in pardoning of such. If your sins
          were as great as mountains, as many as the catalogue of them would
          reach from Heaven to earth, there is mercy for you, if you will
          repent: Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let us reason together, says the
          Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." There are
          riches of mercy, Ephesians 2:4 abundance of pardoning grace, Isaiah
          55:7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 2. I have relapsed, gone back with the dog to the vomit, and
          with the sow that was washed, to the wallowing in the mire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. There is mercy for backsliders too: Jeremiah 3:14, "Turn, O
          backsliding children, says the Lord, for I am married unto you." Verse
          22, "Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your
          backslidings." If it were not so, who could be safe? Men must forgive
          in that case, and much more God will, Luke 17:4. For as the heavens
          are above the earth, so are God's thoughts above ours: Jeremiah 3:1,
          "They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become
          another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be
          greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet
          return again to me, says the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 3. But I have despised and alighted mercy, and the remedy of
          sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. They had gone all that length, who had so far despised mercy,
          and the remedy of sin, as they had murdered the Lord of glory, and yet
          they obtained mercy, Acts 2:36, 37, 38. Despise and slight it no more,
          and your former sins shall not be remembered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 4. I have so long gone on in sin, that I can have no hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. The longer the greater is your sin; yet God has not discovered
          to us any particular time, beyond which he will not wait. There are
          some called at the eleventh hour; and those that come in then, are not
          rejected. So was the thief on the cross. See Ezekiel 33:10, 11; Luke
          14:22; Joel 3:21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 5. But there is no body's case like mine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Consider the case of Manasseh, 2 Chronicles 33. and of Paul, 1
          Timothy 1:13. Such instances are designed to encourage sinners to
          repent in hope of mercy, Ephesians 2:7. Adam's case was more hopeless,
          who had sinned against more light and mercy, than you were capable to
          do. But suppose your case is a non-such evil, the mercy of God and the
          blood of Christ are non-such remedies. And you may be sure, since he
          has said, John 6:37, "Him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast
          out," that he will work a new thing on the earth, rather than that
          your case be unhelped, if you will put it in his hand. So I conclude
          that there is mercy for you, if you will repent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, You shall certainly be saved forever, if you do repent:
          Ezekiel 18:30, "Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
          transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin." No true penitents
          go to Hell. Heaven is the landing-place of all true penitents. They
          that turn from their sins now, and turn unto God, shall forever be
          with the Lord in another world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O look to the glory that is above, and let your souls be moved to
          repentance by it. Cast not away the hope of eternal happiness for what
          does not profit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, sinners, consider these things, and be stirred up to repentance,
          and do not adventure over the belly of fair warning to go on in a
          course of impenitency. Impenitency under the gospel is a sin of a deep
          dye; beware of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a continuation of sin; it draws out the thread of a
          God-provoking course, adding sin to sin, until God cut the thread of
          life. And O are there not enough of items standing in God's accounts
          against you already? why will you be still adding more, instead of
          diminishing and breaking off the course by repentance?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It seals sin and guilt on your soul. Impenitency keeps all the rest
          of your sins fast on your souls: John 3:19, "This is the condemnation,
          that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
          light, because their deeds were evil." If you would repent, no sins
          whatever you are guilty of should ever be able to ruin you: but if you
          do not, that one will keep all the rest in life and vigor, to your
          utter ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It flies in the face of the gospel, of Christ himself, his apostles
          and ministers, who with one voice call sinners to repentance. If you
          do this, you do all; if you do not this, you do nothing; you receive
          the grace of God in vain; it will be in vain to you that ever you
          heard the gospel, that Christ died for sinners, etc; for you will have
          no benefit by any of these things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, It is a bloody sin, that will involve you in everlasting
          misery. For there is no escaping of the wrath of God; if you do not
          repent, you are undone forever. For "except you repent you shall
          perish."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, you have had a message from the Lord, what answer shall I return
          to him that sent me? I think I may rank up all in these six sorts of
          sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The brutish sinner, that hears as if he heard not. The word makes a
          noise in their ears, because they are capable of hearing; but, alas!
          they are no better than the beasts, in so far as they make no
          reflections on it, with respect to their state and case. What shall I
          say to you, but that the time comes when these souls of yours, drowned
          in a moss of flesh and blood, will be separate from your bodies, and
          get a long eternity to reflect on the calls you have had to repent?
          Isaiah 1:3, "The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib:
          but Israel does not know, my people does not consider." Psalm 32:9,
          10, "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
          understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
          they come near unto you. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The sullen, desperate sinner, whose answer will be that, Jeremiah
          2:25, "There is no hope. No, for I have loved strangers, and after
          them will I go." Their hearts are glued to their sins, they have no
          will to part with them, and they have no hope that ever they shall be
          made willing, or if they were so, that God would receive them; and
          therefore they are resolved to take their time. But O consider, they
          have been reformed that have been as mad on their idols as you, as
          Manasseh and Paul. If that cannot draw you, pray answer that question,
          Isaiah 33:14, "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who
          among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The crafty, subtle sinner, whose answer will be that of Saul to
          Samuel, 1 Samuel 15:13. "Blessed be you of the Lord: I have performed
          the commandment of the Lord." But let the return to them be that of
          Samuel to Saul, verse 14. "What means then this bleating of the sheep
          in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?" What means
          your continuing in sin, your not wrestling and striving against it in
          heart and life, if it be so?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The presumptuous sinner, whose answer will be that, Deuteronomy
          29:19. "I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine
          heart." There are some who have a heart of adamant, and put on a
          forehead of brass, that nothing of this sort can affect them. Let the
          messengers of the Lord be saying what they will, they will be doing.
          They will have their course, and persuade themselves all shall be
          well. To such I would say, as verses 20, 21. "The Lord will not spare
          him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealousy shall smoke
          against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book
          shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under
          Heaven. And the Lord shall separate him unto evil, out of all the
          tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant, that
          are written in this book of the law." See Isaiah 28:16. and downwards.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The slothful sinner, whose answer will be that of Felix to Paul,
          Acts 24:25. "Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient
          season, I will call for you." They are convinced that they must
          repent, and resolve to do it, but not yet. Young folk put it off to
          old age; old folk delay it until a death-bed. Every one puts it off
          from time to time. But O sirs what certainty have you of an hour, much
          less of a year? How many are there that never see old age? How many
          drop into eternity before ever they are aware?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, The convinced sinner, who being awakened, says, "What shall
          I do to be saved?" For which reason I shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show you the great hindrances of repentance. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Thoughtlessness is a great hindrance of it: Jeremiah 8:6. "I
          hearkened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of
          his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his
          course, as the horse rushes into the battle." Men do not consider
          their souls' state, case, and way. They sleep away their time
          carelessly without due reflection; and therefore their spiritual state
          goes to wreck and they pine away in their iniquity, and are not aware
          of the same.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The love and cares of the world are great hindrances of repentance,
          Luke 8:14. These take up men's hearts so, as that they have neither
          heart nor hand for the case of their souls. How many are there, whom
          the world keeps in a constant hurry all their life long, that they
          never come to consider their way until death stare them in the face?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Prejudices against religion and seriousness are great hindrances of
          repentance. Some see no profit in it; but "godliness is profitable
          unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that
          which is to come," 1 Timothy 4:8. Some see no pleasure in it; but
          "wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace,"
          Proverbs 3:17. Some think that it is needless to be at all that pains,
          for less will serve: but, alas! they do not consider what a holy
          jealous God the Lord is, and how many shall seek to enter in, and
          shall not be able.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Presumption is a great hindrance of repentance, Deuteronomy 29:19.
          They hope still all shall be well, however they take their liberty in
          a sinful course. They abuse the mercy of God as a screen to their
          lusts; not remembering that he will by no means clear the guilty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Unbelief, the not embracing of Christ, and apprehending the mercy
          of God in him, is likewise a great impediment in the way of
          repentance. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Slothfulness, whereby the business is still put off from
          time to time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. I shall give directions in order to your obtaining repentance.
          Supposing what I have said before of the way to gain repentance by
          believing, I offer further these following directions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Labor to see sin in its own colors, what an evil thing it is.
          Jeremiah 2:19. What makes us to cleave to sin, is false apprehensions
          we have about it. To see it in itself would be a means to make us fly
          from it. For this end consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The majesty of God offended by sin. Ignorance of God is the
          mother of impenitency, Acts 17:30.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The obligations we lie under to serve him, which by sin we
          trample upon.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, The wrath of God that abides impenitent sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, The good things our unrepented-of sins deprive us of.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The many evils which are bred by our sin against the honor of
          God, our own and our neighbor's true interest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be much in the thoughts of death. Consider how short and uncertain
          your time is. Hopes of long life bring many into a hopeless case. And
          who knows when he may have outlived his day of grace, when the moment
          comes that God shall say, "My Spirit shall not strive any more with
          this man, for that he also is flesh?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Dwell on the thoughts of a judgment to come, where you shall be
          made to give an account of yourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">4. Meditate on the sufferings of Christ.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Pray for repentance and believingly seek and long for the Lord's
          giving the new heart, according to his promise, Ezekiel 36:26. "A new
          heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I
          will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
          an heart of flesh." Verse 32. "Not for your sakes do I this, says the
          Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own
          ways, O house of Israel."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, What you do, do quickly. The sooner you begin, the easier
          trill the work be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Take the three following marks of true repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sorrow for sin, as offensive to a good and gracious God, Zechariah
          12:10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Hatred of sin, as the most abominable thing, Revelation 2:6. This
          will be, <br />
          1. universal, against all known sin; <br />
          2. constant, without intermission;<br />
          3. implacable, without reconciliation; and, <br />
          4. vehement, without tolerating it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A fixed purpose and desire of eschewing sin, and following duty;
          guarding against present sins, and the occasions of these we are in
          hazard of; honestly endeavoring after it in the use of means, and
          laboring to remove the hindrances to a holy life.
